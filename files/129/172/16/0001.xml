PRESS NOTICENOT FOR PUBLICATION, BROADCAST, OR USE OlCLUB TAPES BEFORE .7r^3.&amp;.. ^.....Ji.j.m^!.THIS DOCUMENT IS ISSUED IN ADVANCE ON the strict UNDERSTANDING THAT NO APPROACH BEMADE TO ANY ORGANISATION OR PERSON about its CONTENTS BEFORE THE TIME OF PUBLICATION.Report of the Royal Commission on the ConstitutionComplete self-government for Scotland and Wales is rejected by the Commission on the Constitution in its Report publishedtoday.The Commission proposes more devolution of central government functions to Scotland, Wales and the English regions, but is divided about what form this should take..Eleven members of the Commission of 13 have signed theReport.     The two remaining members, Lord Crowther-Hunt and professor Alan Peacock, have put in a memorandum of dissent.The Commission was set up in April 1969.     Its firstchairman, Lord Crowther, died in January 1972 and was succeeded by Lord Kilbrandon, who was already a member.Main conclusions the Commission examines and rejects the case for thetransfer of complete sovereignty to an independent Scotland andWales, mainly on the ground that the vast majority of the scottish and Welsh people &quot;simply do not want it&quot;.It also rejects a federal constitution for the UnitedKingdom, which would involve partial surrender of the sovereignty of Parliament.
It considers that the devolution of central government functions to Scotland and Wales and the regions of England, insome way which would preserve the essential political and economic unity of the United Kingdom and retain the legal and effectivesovereignty of Parliament in all matters, could do much to reducediscontent with the present system of government.The Commission found that nearly all the complaints madespring either from the centralisation of government in London orfrom developments in the operation of government which have tended to run counter to the principles of democracy.     Devolutionwould counter over-centralisation and strengthen democracy.     Itwould be a response to national feeling in Scotland and Wales.The Commission points out, however, that this would notremove all grounds of complaint against government and that thecure for remaining defects would not simply be more devolution.&quot;There is no inherent reason why, regional government should bemore democratic or more sensitive to public opinion than centralgovernment&quot;.The eleven members who sign the Report agree on the identification and analysis of the causes of discontent with government and on the various forms that devolution might take.Although a survey conducted for the Commission has thrown somelight on people&apos;s attitudes to devolution, there is no clear evidence of what they want.    &quot;This is not surprising&quot; says theReport &quot;since they do not know what the possibilities are any morethan we did when our enquiries began&quot;.     Members therefore sawthis identification and analysis as their most important task,and they are fully agreed on it.
They agree also in recommending that the executive functionsof government should, where practicable, be devolved direct to the newly constituted local authorities, which in the exercise of thosefunctions should be subjected to a minimum of control.     Functionsretained by central government should where practicable beexercised in the regions, with the various departments and agencies of government so far as possible operating in the same regionsand from the same regional centres.The members differ on the form of devolution to be preferred.They say that this lack of agreement on what is essentially a matterof opinion and political judgment is not surprising, and ought not significantly to diminish the value of their Report.      &quot;We have regarded our principal function as one of analysis, comprising the identification and presentation of possible forms of devolutionand of the arguments for and against them.     We are agreed on this analysis, but not on the schemes of devolution preferred&quot;.They expect the publication of the Report to lead to publicdebate and the formulation of a more clearly defined public opinion.Only then will it be right for decisions to be taken.     Sinceopinion is still likely to be divided, the final decisions must bepolitical.The Report sets out in detail the varying preferences ofmembers for the type of devolution of power from central governmentwhich they favour for Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
Scotland and WalesOf the eleven members who sign the Report a majority favoursa scheme of legislative devolution for Scotland and Wales, whichwould transfer to directly-elected Scottish and Welsh assembliesa wide range of powers concerning most domestic functions suchas local government, town and country planning, roads, environmental services, education, health and sport and recreation.england for England a majority is in favour of regional councilsmade up of four-fifths local authority elected representatives and one-fifth nominated members chosen by the Minister of centralgovernment responsible for regional affairs.      These councils wouldbe mainly advisory, but they would also have a co-ordinatingfunction in the local authority field, including responsibilityfor formulating strategic plans.The English regions would be the 8 regions at presentestablished for economic planning purposes, modified to make the regional boundaries conform to those of the new counties defined by the Local Government Act 1972.Northern IrelandExcept on the question of representation in the United kingdom parliament the Commission makes no recommendations for NORTHERNIRELAND.     It merely records its impressions of the system of home rule in operation there until 1972, draws lessons from it for application to other parts of the United Kingdom, and compares its4
own proposals for the devolution of legislative powers to Scotlandand Wales with those recently approved by Parliament for Northern-Ireland.     Given the very different circumstances in which they are intended to apply, the Commission sees no incompatibility betweenthe schemes.     In its view, however, Northern Ireland is under-represented in the House of Commons, and it recommends that the representation of the province should be determined by the rulesapplicable to other parts of the United Kingdom.     The effect ofthis would be to increase Northern Ireland&apos;s representation from12 to about 17.EECThe Commission considers the implications of entry intothe e.c. and concludes that this does not stand in the way of substantial devolution, though it does place limitations on the range of functions which can appropriately be devolved.PreferencesTwo of the eleven members who sign the Report (Lord Footand Sir James Steel) consider that, as a matter of principle,there should be a more or less uniform system of government,throughout Great Britain, and they favour executive devolution,which would retain responsibility at the centre for legislation and major policies and devolve responsibility for subordinatepolicy and administration to elected assemblies in Scotland andWales and the eight regions of England which correspond to thepresent economic planning regions.5
The other nine members see no need for uniformity and regard the division of responsibility proposed in the scheme of executivedevolution as impracticable.     They consider that the reorganisation of local&apos;government in England has left no room for directly elected regional authorities.     They have varying views on whatis appropriate for Scotland, Wales and the English regions.1Eight   favour for SCOTLAND a scheme of legislative devolution,involving the devolution of full responsibility for legislation and policy-making in prescribed matters, subject to the retentionby Parliament of over-riding power, which would rarely be used.Sir David Rentnn would prefer to see an elected scottish assembly with advisory functions and much more limited legislative powers along the lines proposed by the Scottish constitutional committee which reported in 1970.Six   of the nine members favour for WALES the scheme of legislative devolution proposed for Scotland.Three (Sir David Renton, Professor Street and Mrs Trenaman)prefer an elected Welsh assembly with advisory functions and nolegislative powers.For ENGLAND eiglro   of the nine propose councils with advisoryand local authority co-ordinating functions.     These councils would consist of local authority representatives and a small number ofnominated members.Lord Kilbrandon, Mr Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr Longmuir,Professor Newark, Professor Street., Sir Ben Bowen Thomas and mrs Trenaman.2Lord Kilbrandon, Mr Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr Longmuir,Professor Newark and Sir Ben Bowen Thomas.-&quot;Lord Kilbrandon, Mr Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr Longmuir,Professor Newark,Sir David Renton,Professor Street andSir Ben Bowen Thomas.- -&apos; .. &apos;    y-     II
Mrs Trenaman would have regional councils consisting whollyof local authority representatives, whose sole function would beto co-ordinate local authority planning.All nine are agreed that the devolution of legislative powers would not be appropriate for England or for the individual regions of England.Causes for ComplaintIn the analysis leading up to its recommendations, theCommission notes that there is a feeling that government is remoteand insufficiently sensitive to the views and feelings of the people.In Scotland and Wales dissatisfaction with government has anadditional dimension of national feeling.     In Scotland the emphasis is largely on economic considerations, says the Report.     In Wales,while the economic factor is important, it is closely associatedwith a desire to preserve the Welsh language and culture.In neither country has the nationalist cause attractedsupport, anything like sufficient to constitute a general vote for independence; but it has provided a means for the people ofScotland and Wales to register their feeling of national identity,and has focussed attention on the desire for changes In the systemof government which would do more to acknowledge their separateidentities and special interests.7
The Separation of Scotland and wales in its examination of the case for a separate Scotland andWales the Commission concludes that the separate national identitiesof the Scottish and Welsh do not require their countries to be separated from the rest of the United Kingdom as independent states or to be administered as entirely separate communities.There are no grounds for believing that they are neglectedunder the present system and suffer in material terms because oftheir incorporation into the United Kingdom; on the contrary theytend to receive preferential treatment.     And in cultural mattersconditions within the United Kingdom are such that a distinctiveway of life will survive if those who possess it want it to survive.As regards the economics of separation the Commission findsthat neither Scotland nor Wales can be regarded as unsuitable for independence merely on the ground that it is too poor.     So longas they were prepared if necessary to accept some fall in theirstandard of living for the sake of independence, both countries would be economically viable.     To an unknown extent the exploita-tion of oil reserves would assist the economic viability of Scotland(and possibly also of Wales in the future).But with independence Scotland and Wales would be worse offmaterially.     In practice they would not be able to cultivate aseparate prosperity by adopting independent economic policies.They have a better chance of achieving prosperity within the UnitedKingdom than outside it.     The question of economic viability isanyway of secondary importance.     Separation would come about only if there existed an overwhelming political desire for it, andarguments about economic viability would then hardly be relevant.
The Commission believes that separation would neither serve the purposes of good government in Scotland and Wales nor enhancetheir prosperity - quite the reverse.     And for many people in all parts of Britain it would present a problem of national identitywhich they would find unwelcome and regard as totally unnecessary.A Federal SolutionThe Report says that there is very little demand forfederalism in Scotland and Wales, and practically none at all inEngland.     Experience abroad shows that in modern conditions thefederal idea of divided sovereignty is becoming difficult to sustain.It presents great financial problems and slows down desirablechange.     At best federalism is an awkward system to operate.In addition to the difficulties inherent in the system itself itis unsuited to the particular circumstances of the United Kingdom.It is not appropriate for our present stage of constitutional development; it would call for new institutions and practices ofgovernment which to most people would appear strange and artificial;and there is no satisfactory way of fitting England into a federalsystem.Such a system would damage the interests of the UnitedKingdom as a whole, both in the management of its domestic economy and in its relations with other countries.Legislative DevolutionThe preferred  scheme of legislative devolution would providefor the establishment of Scottish and Welsh assemblies directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional, j,representation for a fixed term of four years.
The precise functions to be transferred, to the assembliescould- be established only after more detailed enquiry and consultation with the various interests concerned than it wouldhave been appropriate for the Commission to undertake, but it issuggested that responsibility for the following matters mightbe transferred:To both Scotland and WalesLocal governmentTown and country planningNew TownsHousingBuilding controlOther environmentalservicesAncient monuments andhistoric buildingsRoadsRoad passenger transportHarboursEducation (probablyexcluding universities)Youth and communityservicesSport and recreationArts and cultureSocial work servicesHealthMiscellaneous regulatoryfunctionsAgriculture, fisheries and food (with certain exceptions)ForestryCrown estatesTourismTo Scotland onlyPoliceFire servicesCriminal policy andadministrationAdministration of justiceLegal mattersHighland and IslandsdevelopmentPrisonsSea transport
In all these fields the Scottish and Welsh assemblies wouldmake laws just as Parliament now does.     In some other fields,for example, consumer protection, railways, road freight, civilaviation and broadcasting, limited powers might be transferred.The financial arrangements would require an independent exchequer board; the main object would be to give the Scottish and Welshgovernments maximum freedom in expenditure.Executive authority would be exercised by Ministers appointedby the Crown and drawn from members of the assemblies.Representation at WestminsterThe Commission points out that there is no entirely satisfactory solution to the problem of the representation in theHouse of Commons of a region with its own legislature.The members who support legislative devolution   to Scotlandand Wales recommend that Scottish and Welsh representation inthe House of Commons should be reduced so that in proportion topopulation it would be the same as that of England, subject toany allowance for special geographical considerations.     Theeffect would be to reduce Scottish representation from 71 toabout 57 and that of Wales from 36 to about 31.Executive DevolutionAn essential feature of this scheme as seen by.the two members who support it is that it should be applied in a more orless uniform way throughout Great Britain.
In Scotland, Wales and each of the eight English regionsthere would he an assembly elected as in the scheme forlegislative devolution.   It would execute and administer withas much freedom as possible the legislation and policies ofthe United Kingdom Parliament and Government.   Executive authority would be vested not in Ministers but in the assembly itself,which would delegate much of that authority to functionalcommittees, as local authorities now do.   Functions would betransferred to the assemblies by amendment of the statutesdealing with individual matters.   This would be a long-termprocess.In the first instance the assemblies might have only a fairlylimited range of powers in matters such as strategic planning.This would be extended as time went on.   Generally speaking the subjects which would offer the greatest scope for the devolution of executive powers are those which have been administrativelydevolved to the Scottish Office, but almost all subjects would offer some scope for regional involvement.It is suggested that to provide some measure of protection for the regions against the encroachment of central governmenton their preserves, a statutory council might be set up,representative of the regional assemblies, with a right to be consulted on proposals for new legislation affecting regionalresponsibilities.   The scheme (and the schemes for advisory councils) would not call for any change in Parliamentaryrepresentation.
Advisory councils the Welsh Advisory Council proposed by three members wouldbe responsible for scrutinising, debating and making representations to the Secretary of State for Wales about government policies and activities in relation to Wales, including the activities ofad hoc bodies.     It would replace the existing Welsh Council.It would operate in part through standing committees coveringall aspects of the work of the Secretary of State, and would haveclearly defined powers to call for information from the welsh office and to question officials.     Welsh Ministers would oninvitation attend and take part in the Council&apos;s debates.^ The Scottish Council proposed by one member would havesimilar functions.     It would also take certain stages of scottish bills referred to it by the House of Commons; its powers in thisrespect would be similar to but somewhat wider than those proposedby the Scottish Constitutional Committee.Both these Councils would, like the assemblies in theschemes of legislative and executive devolution, be directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.     For the co-ordinating and advisory councilsproposed by a majority of members for the English regions, about one-fifth of the members would be nominated by the Minister ofthe central government responsible for regional affairs, and theremainder would be elected by the local authorities in the regionfrom their own councillors.     The English regional councils wouldhave an advisory function similar to that proposed for the       jjScottish and Welsh Councils.
They would also have a co-ordinating function in the localauthority field including responsibility for formulating strategicplans into which the structure plans of local authorities wouldhave to fit.     They would have no power of direction over thelocal authorities and would not themselves administer services or undertake works.      (In the scheme advocated by one memberthe responsibility for co-ordinating local authority planningwould be the councils&apos; only obligatory function, and they wouldhave no nominated members).Administrative DevolutionThe Commission believes that the Secretary of State system has brought substantial benefits to Scotland and Wales which arenot generally appreciated.     But more should be done to informthe public of the way it operates and the benefits it confers.There is little scope for adding to the functions of the scottish office.The Welsh Office should progressively assume additionalfunctions, but these should not necessarily include all thefunctions transferred to Scotland.     In particular the Commissionsees no reason to think that Wales would derive any benefit fromthe assumption by the Welsh Office of functions in relation tothe system of law and the preservation of law and order.In England, whether or not more advanced systems of devolution are adopted, government departments should make regular and comprehensive reviews of the desirability of transferringadditional functions to regional offices.
It would be possible to appoint regional Ministers in theDepartment of the Environment to exercise the executive functionsof the department on behalf of the Secretary of State and to actmore generally as the government&apos;s representatives in the regions.Although regional Ministers would ensure that the government thought in regional as well as in functional terms, they wouldnot be in as strong a position as the Secretary of State forScotland or Wales to promote the interests of their regions.It would not be possible to extend the full Secretary of state system to the English regions.Regional Organisation within parliamentary formal structure of regional committees might be introduced in the House of Commons, with the committees taking parliamentary questions and adjournment debates of local and regional concernand examining government policies towards their regions.     Butonly Parliament could decide whether this change in its procedure should be adopted.The Relationship between Government and the people the Commission^ enquiries raised many issues affectingthe relationship between government and the people which are notregional in character and which are not disposed of by its conclusions on devolution.     It would not have been practicable for the Commission to tackle these issues as well as devolution.It draws attention to them, leaving others to consider whetherthey call for further enquiry.     Particular importance is attachedto the problem of communication between government and people.&apos; 15  M:M
The Commission offers an initial appraisal, in the hope that what it has to say will encourage further study and appropriate action.Scope of the ReportThe Report consists of twelve Parts and six Appendices.In a Part giving the background to the enquiry, there are chaptersdevoted to the United Kingdom (including the emergence of its constituent parts), Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.One Part deals, with present discontents in Great Britain and theextent to which these are due to national feeling.In a chapter dealing with the public finance of devolutionthe Report reaches the general conclusion that it should bepossible for regional government within Great Britain to havea greater degree of financial independence than was exercised in practice by the Northern Ireland Government up to the time ofits suspension, but that this independence would be in mattersof expenditure rather than revenue.       &quot;Whether that would satisfya full-scale Scottish or Welsh legislative assembly is a matterof speculation&quot;, says the Report.If devolution in Great Britain were confined to Scotlandand Wales the practical difficulties of financial devolutionwould be very much reduced, and rather more financial independencefrom the centre might be practicable.     But Scotland and wales would almost certainly still be heavily dependent on United Kingdomgrants.The Report examines in detail the forms of devolution, whichit concludes is not a cure for all faults of government but whichcould do a great deal to cure the particular faults which are16 ff&apos; &apos; -V- -      -&apos; &apos;&quot;-&quot;v-*- II &quot;     7,&apos; . - v
essentially regional in character.Discussing the relationship between government and the people the Report states: &quot;In so far as the remoteness of governmentis not simply a matter of geography, but rather a psychologicalgap between government and people - between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; -it will not be much reduced by devolution.     The main counter toit must be better communication&quot;.The Channel Islands and the Isle of ManThe Report shows that members of the Commission were impressed by the virtual unanimity of opinion in the evidence submitted in favour of retaining the existing constitutionalrelationships between the Islands and the United Kingdom, eitherwithout change or furnished with some additional defence againstencroachment on the Islands&apos; autonomy in domestic matters.The Commission has not itself &quot;approached the Islands in anyspirit of reforming zeal&quot;.     The immediate problems which ledto the inclusion of the Islands in the Commissions terms ofreference were largely resolved when special arrangements weremade for them within the Common Market.The Commission^ main concern has been to see if meanscan be found of reconciling the Islands1 autonomy with the UnitedKingdom&apos;s responsibilities for their external affairs.     Itconcludes that the problem cannot be resolved by changes inconstitutional relationships.     So long as the United Kingdomremains responsible for the international relations of the islands and for their good government it must have powers in t^he17. h &apos; ff
last resort to intervene in any of the Islands in the exerciseof those responsibilities.It would not be practicable to make a formal division of legislative and executive responsibilities between the UnitedKingdom and Island Governments, with each enjoying exclusivepower over the matters allocated to it.The Commission does, however, indicate in general terms thecircumstances in which the United Kingdom Government might inpractice be justified in using its paramount powers to intervene in the affairs of the Islands.     These are dealt with under fiveheadings - defence, matters of common concern to British peoplethroughout the world, the interests of the Islands, internationalresponsibilities and the domestic interests of the United Kingdom.It believes that &quot;with goodwill and recognition on each side ofthe rights and obligations of the other, few serious difficulties should arise, and that those that do will be capable of beingovercome at least as well under the existing relationships asunder any new relationships that could be contemplated&quot;.The Commission recommends that a committee similar to theStanding Committee on the Common Interests of the Isle of man and the United Kingdom should be established for any of theother Islands which desires to have one; or, and it thinks this might be preferable, that there should be a single committeecovering the interests of all the Islands.It regards as unsatisfactory the existing arrangements bywhich petitions to the Crown from the Island authorities against decisions of the United Kingdom Government are referred to and
considered only by a Committee of the Privy Council consistingof Ministers of the United Kingdom Government, and suggests that consideration should be given to the possibility of devising anew procedure whereby petitions could be referred to a body which included some independent members for enquiry and report before being accepted or rejected.It- suggests as one possibility the addition of independent members to the proposed Standing Committee.     This body, whichmight be known as &quot;The Council of the Islands&quot; and be composedof a Chairman and two other independent members appointed by theCrown and up to six representatives each of the United KingdomGovernment and the Islands, with an independent Secretariat, wouldcombine the function of conciliation with that of giving advice to the Committee of the Privy Council on petitions from the Islands.No changes are recommended in the economic relationships between the&apos;United Kingdom and the Islands.Memorandum of DissentIn their Memorandum of Dissent Lord Crowther-Hunt and professor Peacock favour a wider interpretation of the terms ofreference directed to the changes necessary in the system ofgovernment as a whole.     Their assessment of the evidence leadsthem to believe that the necessary reforms should have three main objectives:a.       to counter the decline they consider hastaken place this century in the extent to whichthe British people govern themselves;
b. to reduce the present excessive burdens onthe institutions of central government;c. to provide adequate means for the redressof individual grievances.They believe that the evidence shows that it is just as important to achieve these objectives for the people in the differentregions of England as for the people in Scotland and Wales.    they believe, too, that the achievement of these objectives is themore urgent since they consider the constitutional and institutionalconsequences of United Kingdom Common Market membership to beso profound and far-reaching.They recommend a scheme for devolving powers to sevendemocratically elected assemblies and governments - one forScotland, one for Wales, and one for each of the five english regions.     These assemblies would be elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.     Theywould be responsible for adapting United Kingdom policies to thespecial needs of their areas.       They would assume control ofvirtually all the outposts of central government now operating in their areas, including the Scottish and Welsh Offices and the regional and local offices of Whitehall departments.       Thus theseoutposts, which now employ twice as many civil servants as thevarious departmental headquarters, would be completely &quot;hived off&quot;from central government.      The &quot;intermediate level&quot; governments would also take over completely the functions of the non-commercial and non-industrial ad hoc authorities operating in their areas(e.g. the health and water authorities); and they would be given
some supervisory responsibilities in respect of the activities in their parts of the country of the various industrial and commercial ad hoc authorities (e.g. the Gas and Electricity Boards).These &quot;intermediate level&quot; governments would not be limitedto the specific functions or duties conferred on them by Parliament.They would have a general competence to act for the welfare andgood government of the people in their areas.     They would eachhave an Ombudsman with wider terms of reference than those ofthe present Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.     Theywould have some independent revenue raising powers and sufficientfinancial &quot;independence&quot; of central government to give them the requisite degree of freedom to carry out their duties and responsibilities.     There would be no change in the functionsof local government, but local governments would have some directrepresentation at this &quot;intermediate level&quot; of government.At the centre, the scheme envisages that Members ofParliament would have a much greater share than at present ingovernment policy-making including more influence on the decisions which United Kingdom Ministers have to take in the Council ofMinisters in Brussels; for these purposes MPs would need to be organised in functional committees matching each of the maindepartments of government.     The composition of the House ofLords might be altered to include members of the &quot;intermediate level&quot; governments.     The number of Scottish and Welsh MPs wouldnot be reduced.     Scotland and Wales would still each have a minister in the United Kingdom Cabinet charged with the special responsibility of promoting and safeguarding their interests at this level of decision-making.     Various changes are also proposed affecting the operation of our political parties.
A fuller summary of these and the other changes recommended byLord Crowther-Hunt and Professor Peacock is given on pages (xii)to (xxii) of their Memorandum.MembershipThe Commission originally had sixteen members.Lord Crowther was not replaced when he died.

ROYAL COMMISSION ONTHE CONSTITUTION1969-1973REPORTTo the Queen&apos;s Most Excellent majesty may it please Your MajestyWe, the undersigned Commissioners, having been appointedto examine the present functions of the central legislature and government in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom; to consider, having regard todevelopments in local government organisation and in theadministrative and other relationships between the various parts of the United Kingdom, and to the interests of the prosperity and good government of Your people under theCrown, whether any changes are desirable in those functionsor otherwise in present constitutional and economic relation-ships; to consider, also, whether any changes are desirable inthe constitutional and economic relationships between theUnited Kingdom and the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man:HUMBLY SUBMIT TO YOUR MAJESTY THE FOLLOWING REPORT.
PART IAPPOINTMENT OF THE COMMISSION
OUR TASKthe background to our appointment1. In 1969, when we were appointed, there was obviously some discontentwith the workings of government, and the outward signs of that discontentseemed to reflect especially the frustrations of those living furthest from london.scotland . People in Scotland, their normal political loyalties shaken, had begun torally in substantial numbers behind the banner of the Scottish National Party.Not all of the party&apos;s new followers wanted the full independence for Scotlandwhich it demanded, but their sentiments were clear enough. In their eyes, thegovernment in London was not doing enough about Scotland&apos;s economic problems. Government policies, designed for the United Kingdom as a whole,appeared to them to be inappropriate to conditions in Scotland; at least thosepolicies did not seem to be succeeding. Opportunities for work in scotland were restricted, and many of the country&apos;s best people were emigrating. It was argued that if the Scots-an intelligent and hard-working race of over fivemillion people could gain substantial control over their own affairs, scotland would prosper and its historic institutions would be revitalised. Moreover,there was little doubt that those sentiments were shared in spirit by manyScots who, though they gave no support to the Scottish National Party andhad no wish to break the union with England, were proud of Scotland andwanted to see its light shining more brightly in the world.wales. The picture in Wales was very similar. People were having to adjust to change in their economy. The old traditional industries were dying out, andnew industries were required to take their place. But the new industries werenot moving in quickly enough to provide work for everyone and to maintainthe vitality of communities built up in the past around the old industries.Emigration to England was continuous and, as one distinguished Welshmantold us, there was a feeling that Wales had become the backyard of the UnitedKingdom. People felt frustrated at their own inability to influence the situation.As in Scotland, this frustration found expression in a sharp rise in support fora nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, which pressed the case for self-government.4. Alongside the economic difficulties, and perhaps partly arising from them,there was a revival of interest in the Welsh language and culture, and it seemed that many of the people who lent their support to Plaid Cymru did so oncultural rather than economic grounds. The broad political effect, however,was the same. A growing minority of Welsh people appeared to want self-government for Wales, and a substantially larger number seemed dissatisfied with government from London, though perhaps to a lesser extent than theScots. Smaller than Scotland, and with a population of less than three million,Wales has closer natural ties with England; but many of its people appeared tothink that it was sufficiently large and distinct to be given greater control over its own affairs.
5. What of the people living in England, who, numbering 46 million, made up the bulk of the population? How did they feel about the workings of govern-ment in 1969? Were they happy with the existing system?6. We have since been able to throw some light on this question, but in 1969the position was by no means clear. The most commonly held view was thatthere were parts of England notably the North East and the South West witheconomic problems no less serious than those of Scotland and Wales, in whichpeople felt just as frustrated with government, although because they had no separate identity and no nationalist party to turn to their complaints were barelyheard. This view raised the presumption that there was a basic fault in thesystem of government which had nothing to do with nationalism. The suggestion was that government was too centralised, and that all too often decisions weremade in London contrary to the wishes of those directly affected in other partsof the country. There was said to be a strong desire for more local participation in the making of government decisions; and it was argued that this desirewas present in the regions of England, as in Scotland and Wales, quite apartfrom any wish to preserve racial or cultural traditions. In Scotland and wales the desire for more participation might be bolstered by the fact of nationhood,but it was claimed that the sense of alienation and frustration which gave riseto that desire existed everywhere, and that the basic need was for people in britain as a whole to win back power from London.7. That, in the broadest terms, was how things appeared in Britain in 1969.The situation was not clear cut, but the outward signs pointed to a desire for moreindependence from London and for a wider participation in the decisionsmade by central government.Northern Ireland8. The situation in Northern Ireland was quite different. The province, witha population of only one and a half million, had exercised a wide measure of constitutional independence for nearly fifty years. Its people already had theirown Parliament, Government and civil service, and for most day-to-daypurposes their laws were made at and administered from Stormont, the seat of the Northern Ireland Parliament and Government, and not from London.Working relations between Stormont and London were good, and at the timeof our appointment there was virtually no pressure for the abandonment ofhome rule. The civil rights problem had forced its way to the surface with theLondonderry riots of October 1968, but the issues which lay behind thosedemonstrations related to matters devolved to the Northern Ireland Govern-ment. They did not apparently affect the nature of the constitutional link with London, which was our primary concern. There was accordingly nostarting presumption in favour of change, except perhaps some minor improve-ments in the working relationships between Stormont and London.The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man9. The remaining problems which gave rise to our appointment were thoseof the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. These islands are neither part ofthe United Kingdom nor colonies. They are dependencies of the Crown.
They have their own legislative assemblies, and by long-established convention are responsible for the regulation of their own domestic affairs, includingtaxation. The United Kingdom is responsible for their defence and foreign relations.10. In the years leading up to 1969 these arrangements, which had theirorigins in medieval history, began to feel the strain of modern developments.Difficulty arose mainly over the application to the Islands of international agreements entered into by the United Kingdom. Since the Second World Warthese agreements had greatly increased in number and scope, and were impingingmore and more on matters hitherto regarded by the Islands as purely domestic.The Islanders feared that particular treaties entered into by the United kingdom on their behalf would require the application in the Islands of domestic policies to which they were opposed. The problem was seen to be a very real one whenthe United Kingdom declared its intention of applying for membership ofthe European Economic Community. The presumption was that the UnitedKingdom, on signing the Treaty of Rome, would take the Islands with them into the Community, and the Islanders thought that the consequences for theireconomies and for their way of life would be disastrous. This particular matter,which was largely responsible for the inclusion of the Islands in our terms ofreference, was resolved while we were sitting by the making of special arrange-ments for the Islands within the European Community. But the wider problemremains.our terms of reference11. We were appointed in April 1969 with the following terms of reference:&quot;To examine the present functions of the central legislature and govern-ment in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the UnitedKingdom;to consider, having regard to developments in local government organisa-tion and in the administrative and other relationships between the various parts of the United Kingdom, and to the interests of the prosperity andgood government of Our people under the Crown, whether any changes are desirable in those functions or otherwise in present constitutional andeconomic relationships;to consider, also, whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships between the United Kingdom and the channel islands and the Isle of Man.&quot;Interpretation of the terms of reference12. The width and diversity of our terms of reference, and the requirement to have regard to a continually changing situation, have made the mereidentification of our task a major preoccupation. The inadequacy of the narrowest interpretation which might be.put upon the terms of reference, andthe sheer impracticability of the widest interpretation, have led inevitably to a compromise. It is important for an appreciation of this Report to understandhow this compromise was arrived at.13. We have no doubt that the main intention behind our appointment wasthat we should investigate the case for transferring or devolving responsibility
for the exercise of government functions from Parliament and the centralgovernment to new institutions of government in the various countries and regions of the United Kingdom. This involves looking at the arguments forand against Scottish and Welsh independence, and considering many lessadvanced solutions for those two countries, ranging from a form of federalismto a strengthening of the Scottish and Welsh Offices and a greater decentralisation-tion of civil servants from Whitehall. It also involves the study of parallelarrangements for devolution to the regions of England. That, together with the examination of the special problems of Northern Ireland and of the channel islands and the Isle of Man, is a very big task, and many would think that wehad sufficiently fulfilled our duty if we accomplished it without doing more.14. On the other hand, our terms of reference do not mention specific reformssuch as devolution. They speak of prosperity and good government, and of changes in the functions of the central legislature and government in relation tothe several parts of the United Kingdom or otherwise in present constitutional and economic relationships. On the most sweeping interpretation, it might be argued that these terms of reference open the way to a root and branchexamination of the whole of the British constitution. Some people who com-mented in Parliament and elsewhere on our appointment evidently thoughtthat it was this wider kind of investigation, or something approaching it, thatthe Government had in mind for us. Our own conclusion was that such a widereview was not intended, and would not be practicable. If it had been intended,our membership would hardly have reflected as clearly as it did the differentnational and regional interests and would no doubt have incorporated a somewhat different range of expertise. Even if we had felt qualified to tackle the whole constitutional field, the proper performance of that task would haveengaged us for a quite unreasonable length of time.15. We also concluded that the narrowest interpretation of our terms ofreference the consideration of devolutionary models only would be undulyrestrictive. Three factors led to this conclusion. In the first place, if devolutionwere found to be desirable it would be necessary to consider consequential orcomplementary reforms to the central institutions of government.16. Secondly, in the earlier stages of our enquiry we were not at all surewhat was the true nature of the complaint against government. There was certainly some kind of discontent, and the outward expressions of thatdiscontent seemed to reflect unfavourably on our centralised system of govern-ment. But the existence of widespread pressure for devolution was far fromproved. Who, apart from fairly small minorities in Scotland and Wales, had actually said that they wanted self-government, or anything like it ? Was therereally a general desire for more participation in government in the regions, and what did people mean by &quot;participation&quot; ? Might we not find, on looking into it, that the prevailing discontent was due not to an unsatisfied demand for devolution, but to something quite different? It was possible, for example, thatthe discontent arose mainly from dissatisfaction.with the current performance of the government in office part of the ebb and flow of politics or fromresentment at the remoteness and inaccessibility of government in general,reflecting a need for government at all levels to be more sensitive and responsive to personal needs and feelings. People might want better opportunities to
register their grievances against government and to have them remedied. Itmight even be that the discontent, although augmented in Scotland and Walesby stirrings of nationalism, was fundamentally yet another manifestation of the anti-authoritarianism which was a feature of the times.17. None of these possible explanations would necessarily call for moredevolution. But if they were found to be valid we could not simply rejectdevolution and say nothing more. We would at least have to suggest the possibleneed for other reforms. Those reforms might amount to a tuning-up of thepresent system, or might involve more radical changes in the central governmentinstitutions themselves.18. The third factor which led ns to the conclusion that we could not confineourselves strictly to the consideration of devolutionary models was the realisa-tion that devolution cannot sensibly be looked at in isolation. A number of witnesses suggested that the institutions of central government, in additionto any defects they might have in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, were unsatisfactory on other grounds. It was represented to us that in various ways these institutions were not as effective as they should be in meeting the needs of the times, and that the people working in them Members of Parliament, Ministers and civil servants were prevented by the system from contributing as they would wish to the good governmentof the country. Although we recognised that it would not be practicable forus to follow up this line of enquiry to the point of making definite recom-mendations, we felt that in making our analysis we should at least identify the issues for public debate.19. The course we finally took, therefore, was broadly to identify theproblems of government as a whole, in so far as they were reflected in theevidence and other information available to us, but to concentrate our workof detailed examination and our positive recommendations on those issues which were primarily geographical in character.Relationship between the various parts of our task20. It is a reflection of the way in which we have been pressed by currentdevelopments that during the first twelve months or so each part of our taskin turn appeared to have some special urgency, and we had to consider making it the subject of an interim report.21. At the outset the problems of Scottish and Welsh nationalism were themost pressing. Then, when serious rioting broke out in Belfast, and it seemed that a fundamental change in the arrangements for governing the provincemight have to be considered, Northern Ireland went to the top of our agenda.Later, our visits to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man brought home tous the very real and immediate difficulty in which the Islands found themselvesover the United Kingdom&apos;s application to join the Common Market. Finally,in the spring of 1970, it was being widely suggested that we should reportquickly on English regionalism, so that the lines of local government reformcould be decided in the light of our recommendations.22. On each occasion we decided not to submit an interim report. Our task,concerned with the constitutional and economic relationships between the
various parts of the United Kingdom and between the United Kingdom andthe Islands, did not readily lend itself to a piecemeal approach. There wouldbe advantage in examining the whole range of problems together and in presenting a comprehensive and balanced set of recommendations. In no casedid it appear that the benefits to be derived from an early and separate interimreport would be such as to outweigh this consideration. There was nothingshort-term about Scottish and Welsh nationalism. Northern Ireland&apos;s most urgent problems were being energetically tackled, and were of a kind whichcalled for political rather than constitutional solutions. Nothing we could do would influence the ^course of the Common Market negotiations and their implications for the Islands. And while it might be argued that discussions of constitutional reform should have preceded local government reform, thereport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England was published at an early stage of our work; since our terms of reference requiredus to take account of developments in local government, it seemed best for usnot to report before the local government legislation had been introduced.On every occasion, therefore, we concluded that our proper course was to concentrate on the longer-term requirements and not to attempt to propoundwhat would necessarily be uncoordinated solutions to the immediate problems.23. As events have unfolded and our work has proceeded, we have come to regard the problems of Northern Ireland and of the Islands as largely separablefrom those of Great Britain, and this is reflected in the form of the Report.The treatment of Northern Ireland24. Early in 1970 we visited Northern Ireland to take evidence, and there-after we gave priority to this part of our terms of reference. The evidencerelated both to the practical experience of the working of home rule in theprovince and this proved of great value to us in considering possible measuresof devolution to other parts of the United Kingdom and to possible amend-ment of the constitution of Northern Ireland itself. Events, however, movedrapidly, and as the situation changed so did the attitudes and opinions of theNorthern Ireland political parties and people. Some new parties came into being.In a very short time the evidence that we had received could no longer be relied upon as an accurate statement of views held in Northern Ireland, and it became necessary for us to reconsider our role in relation to the province.25. All the issues raised by our terms of reference are of a kind whichultimately call for political decisions. They cannot be determined in an academicway by the collection and assessment of evidence of a technical nature. any new constitutional arrangements proposed must be such as the people concerned will be likely to accept, and those who seek to propose constitutional changeneed to have the fullest possible information about the state of public opinion.We considered that it would be neither practicable nor appropriate for us,in the face of a rapidly changing situation in Northern Ireland, to maintainthe close personal contacts with the leaders of political opinion that would benecessary for this purpose. It had become a major preoccupation of the UnitedKingdom Government to seek a solution to the Northern Ireland problem inconsultation with all shades of opinion there, and it seemed that there was littlewe could usefully do to assist in this process. In these circumstances we decidedthat our best course would be to turn our attention to the other parts of our
terms of reference and to formulate our conclusions on them. We could thenseek to relate those conclusions to Northern Ireland in the light of the existing situation.the form of the report26. The bulk of this Report, therefore, while taking into account the lessonsto be learned from Northern Ireland, is concerned primarily with possibleconstitutional changes in Great Britain. After this introductory Part, dealingwith the nature of our task and the way we set about it, we give in Part II, asa background to our enquiry, a brief account of the history of the UnitedKingdom and its constituent countries and of the existing arrangements fortheir government. In Part III we seek to identify the present causes of discontentwith government in Great Britain and in Part IV to determine the general principles that should underlie any reform.27. Parts V to VIII discuss ways in which the powers of government now exercised in Westminster and Whitehall might instead be exercised in Scotland,Wales and the regions of England. Part V deals with separatism, which wouldinvolve the division of the United Kingdom into a number of separate sovereignstates, and federalism, which would involve the creation of states sharingsovereignty with the United Kingdom. Parts VI to VIII are concerned with various aspects of devolution, which is the delegation of central governmentpowers without the relinquishment of sovereignty.28. In Part IX we discuss on a more general plane the relationship between government and people. Part X is concerned with Northern Ireland and Part XIwith the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Finally, in Part XII, we summariseour main conclusions and recommendations.29. Two members of the Commission Lord Crowther-Hunt and ProfessorPeacock have not felt able to sign this Report. They have disagreed with usboth on the interpretation of our terms of reference and on the way in which our ideas have been developed. They have set out their own views in aMemorandum of Dissent1.30. It was clear that our conclusions would not be unanimous, but until alate stage in drafting we hoped to be able to accommodate within our Reportthe views of all members by describing and analysing in an impartial mannerin Part VII the various forms that devolution might take, leaving it to individual members or groups of members to put forward their own preferred solutions inPart VIII. In July 1972 Lord Crowther-Hunt had informed us that he did notbelieve his views could be adequately presented in this way and that it was his present intention, therefore, to write a separate Memorandum of Dissent.The Commission still hoped that this course could be avoided, but by December1972 it was clear that it could not. In February 1973 Professor Peacock decidedto join Lord Crowther-Hunt.31. Although much of it was available in draft in January this year, we couldnot fully evaluate the Memorandum of Dissent before seeing it in its final form,which, subject even then to some fairly important additions, was not presented to us until 1st June 1973, our last meeting for drafting purposes. It has therefore Printed as Volume II of the Report.
not been possible for us to prepare a considered commentary on its proposals,whether by way of accepting what might be valuable features or for the purposesof detailed criticism, without further delaying our own Report. The Memorandumrecommends a scheme of devolution differing in important particulars from thatoriginally advocated by Lord Crowther-Hunt. We can only say that, after suchexamination as has been practicable, the Commissioners who sign this report are unable to support that scheme.32. We feel bound to refer to the criticisms in the Memorandum, some ofthem severe, of our attitude to the Commission^ terms of reference and ofthe way we set about our task. In the first place, it is certain that each individual member, if called upon to prepare an essay on the Constitution, would concen-trate on those problems which he found most interesting, and would lay the emphasis in the way he himself found most telling. But the report of a RoyalCommission is necessarily a team product; the general shape and scope has tobe agreed between the members, each of whom must sacrifice some of his or her own private opinion as to the best way to go about the work. Secondly,it will be found that none of the main topics mentioned in the memorandum is overlooked in our Report; where we refrain from a full treatment it is forthe reasons already given. Thirdly, while the problems of the government ofScotland and Wales figure, as might have been expected, more largely in theReport than do other topics, it should not be inferred, as might be inferredfrom the Memorandum, that the regions of England have been inadequatelyconsidered. Much of our time has been spent on detailed examination of theapplication to the English regions of the various devolutionary models we have examined. Had that not been so, our Report would have been ready for presentation a long time ago. Lastly, we wish to make it clear that we reject the strictures contained in Chapter 2 of the Memorandum on the report ofthe attitude survey conducted for the Commission.
HOW WE SET ABOUT OUR TASKevidence33. After our first meeting, on 29th April 1969, we issued an open invitationthrough the press to submit evidence on any part of our terms of reference.We later drew this invitation to the attention of bodies which seemed likelyto have a particular interest in our work.34. We invited some witnesses to supplement their formal written evidenceby giving oral evidence in public, and others to discuss their evidence informallywith us in private. In addition, many organisations and individuals who had notsubmitted formal evidence but who appeared likely to be able to help in ourenquiries kindly joined us for informal discussions. A list of those who helped inthese various ways will be found in Appendix A. We are most grateful to the mall. Much of the written evidence and all the oral evidence taken in publichas been published by Your Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office.35. In all, we met on 163 days. On twenty-four of these we held publicsessions in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff, Aberystwyth, Belfast, the Isle ofMan, Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark. All the meetings in the Islands andthe first meetings in Edinburgh and Cardiff were well-attended. The televisioncompanies sought and were given permission to record some of the proceedings in Scotland and Wales with a view to broadcasting an edited report. We under-stood that the proceedings of a Royal Commission had not previously beentelevised, and we were pleased to have our work brought to the attention ofa wider public in this way.36. We did not take evidence in public in England, where there was under-standably less interest in our work than elsewhere. But we met representativesof some of the local authorities for informal discussion in the regions, and the list of witnesses includes many other persons who contributed to our thinkingon the problems of English regionalism.research3.7. We realised at the outset that we could not rely solely on the evidence submitted. Inevitably there would be gaps which could be filled only by specialresearch or fact-finding projects. But the wide-ranging nature of our terms ofreference made decisions about research particularly difficult. An extensiveprogramme of research could no doubt have been justified, on the groundthat it. was the Commission^ job to collect on a broad front all such informationas might appear relevant, and then work inwards towards a solution. But this approach would have involved setting on foot a great deal of work which might eventually prove to have been unnecessary for our purposes. It would have com-mitted us to a very long enquiry before we were sure what the problems reallywere, and all against a rapidly changing background. We therefore decided to commission research only when it became clearly essential to our enquiry and was likely to yield information not readily available from other sources.38. In order to keep in close touch with the work being done for the Commis-sion we asked one of our number, Lord Crowther-Hunt, to accept special
responsibility for the co-ordination of research. The projects undertaken arelisted in Appendix E. They include a survey of public attitudes to governmentin Great Britain, but for the most part the papers commissioned are backgroundpapers by experts rather than works of original research. The results of all these projects are being published separately in a series of Research Papers. Inaddition to the information gained from these specific research projects, wehave benefited greatly from informal advice which we invited from a largenumber of academics and others with special qualifications in the fields withwhich we have been concerned.membership39. Early in 1972 we sustained a grievous loss in the sudden death of our first Chairman. Lord Crowther had qualities and experience which ideallyfitted him to preside over a body with the wide-ranging terms of referencewe were given. He shaped our early enquiries and set us on the path that wehave since followed. His death occurred just as we were beginning to work towards our conclusions and recommendations. We had suffered an earlierloss through the death of Professor Donald Robertson, who, in the little morethan twelve months that he was with us, had made valuable and stimulatingcontributions to our debates.Assistant Commissioners40. In taking public and private evidence in Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland, and in evaluating evidence relating to those countries, we had the help of Assistant Commissioners, whose services we were authorised to call upon for the purposes of our enquiry. Twelve Assistant Commissioners, foureach from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, were designated. We benefitedgreatly from their local knowledge and experience and are most grateful fortheir help. We wish to make it clear, however, that they are in no way responsiblefor this Report or for the recommendations it contains.Secretariat41. It is not as a mere formality that we express our admiration of theservices which were given to the Commission by Mr. R. J. Guppy, C.B., ourSecretary. There must have been few Commissions of recent times which laidsuch a burden of care and responsibility on its Secretariat. Mr. Guppy andthose working with him Mr. J. L. Bantock, Mr. A. H. Bishop, Mr. D.Morgan, O.B.E., Mr. J. Richards, Mr. K. H. Skilling and the supporting staff-shouldered it sometimes heroically and always cheerfully. Their promptproduction of material, their administrative competence, and the lucidity oftheir drafting deserve our grateful appreciation; we express it sincerely.
PART nTHE UNITED KINGDOM-THE BACKGROUND
THE UNITED KINGDOM42. In this Part of the Report we give the background to our enquiry. Westart, in this chapter, by tracing very briefly the emergence of the constituent parts of the United Kingdom and their coming together as a unitary state,and by describing the main features of the union, its achievements and what ithas meant to its constituent peoples. Then, in the three succeeding chapters, wenote the distinctive characteristics of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland their history, traditions and institutions, their main social and economicfeatures and the special arrangements which have been made for their govern-ment as part of the United Kingdom. Finally, we have a chapter on regionalismin England.43. We have concentrated on those aspects of British history which haveseemed to us most important for three purposes to outline broadly the storyof the British people, to explain both the origins and the present structure of themain institutions of government and to underline those features which haverelevance to the problems we are required to consider. We have tried to keepthe material brief, factual and uncontroversial. But any presentation of historyis selective, and open to criticism on that account. Our terms of reference,relating to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom,leave us particularly vulnerable to criticisms of bias in the construction of ourhistorical section. The constituent parts of the United Kingdom, and indeed the elements composing them, were at different times brought together by force,coercion, or agreement. The conflict of view between those in favour of con-tinuing the union and those advocating a greater or lesser degree of separationis central to our enquiry. The historical past, the interpretation placed upon itand the weight attached to it are essential elements in that conflict and are boundto be controversial. We have tried in these background chapters, withoutsacrificing brevity, to be as objective as possible.the emergence of the constituent parts44. Before the establishment of Roman rule in Britain during the firstcentury A.D., the land had experienced a succession of invasions, mainlythrough the western approaches, extending over many millennia. Men of theStone and Bronze Ages were followed during the second half of the firstmillennium B.C. by more advanced people entering the country through thesouth-east from the European mainland. These were predominantly Celticpeoples, who, by the time of the arrival of the Romans, were settled farmers,organised in tribal kingdoms, some of which, notably those in the south andsouth-east of Britain, already possessed well-established systems and centres ofgovernment. Evidence of the skills of their craftsmen, in stone, metal and coins,survives.45. Their conquest by the Romans was no easy task. It extended over severaldecades, being achieved by A.D. 78 in the west and halted at the Antonine andHadrian Walls by about A.D. 120 in the north. The effective Roman occupation
of Britain was confined within an area roughly bounded by a line drawn fromDover through London to York, thence to Chester and southwards throughCaerleon to Exeter. For the better part of three hundred years the inhabitants of this area experienced a Roman occupation in the fullest sense, an integratedrural-urban economy, Roman law and citizenship, home and foreign trade,Latin as a lingua franca which influenced the Celtic spoken language and, fromthe second century, organised Christianity.46. Britain was not spared the pressures of the invasions that breached the frontiers of the Roman Empire from the early decades of the fourth century.These became disturbing influences around the coasts of Britain throughout thatcentury, by the end of which the Roman presence was being gradually with-drawn and settlements of Angles, Saxons and Jutes were being established inthe south and south-east of the country. From the fifth century onwards, similarsettlements increased along the eastern coastline, so that the succeeding centuriesinvolved a warlike readjustment within a territory that had enjoyed the advan-tage of pax Romana for many years. This readjustment produced an unsettledsituation throughout Britain that lasted until the eleventh century, after whichthe larger constituent elements out of which the United Kingdom was graduallyformed took shape.47. During the.early phase of this readjustment the Celtic peoples fromStrathclyde southwards failed to achieve the wider political unity which theircultural and linguistic character might have sustained. The lateral geographicalbarriers and the pressures of the new settlers in Bernicia and Deira separatedthe northern Celts from the Cumbrians, who were cut off in turn from the peoples of western and middle Britain with the emergence of the Kingdom ofMercia. Farther south the powerful Kingdom of Wessex was being consolidated,and this, together with Irish pressure, resulted in the withdrawal of large numbersof Celtic people to north-western Gaul, so leading to the establishment of whatis now Brittany. The extension of the power of Wessex severed the connection between the western and south-western Celts. By the end of the seventh centurythe once unified Roman province in Britain had been fragmented and succeeded by an unstable collection of kingdoms and principalities, including those ofCeltic origin in the north, west and south-west and involving the assimilationof the Celts who survived in the central, eastern and southern parts within thenew kingdoms Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Kent and Sussex of the Angles, Saxons and Jutes.48. Throughout the formative centuries Roman traditions were not entirelylost. A vague consciousness of Britain survived. The preservation of the christian religion amongst the Celts, and its extension amongst the new people from such historic centres as Iona, Lindisfarne, Canterbury and Llantwit Major,informed the lives of leaders and princes with higher cultural standards andpious learning. This made possible the establishment of more permanent politicalunits. The Kingdom of Wessex in particular achieved a high degree of stability and efficiency centred on Winchester. Alfred and his immediate successors gaineda pre-eminence that was recognised well beyond their territories, with the consequence that, notwithstanding the Danish Conquest by Canute, England asa political entity with the kingship had become established by the time of theNorman Conquest on a basis which made it already stronger as well as larger
than its neighbours in the north and west. The Normans imposed firm govern-ment on the whole of England. This was at first the government of a colony bya foreign ruling class, but eventually the Normans lost their separate identityand, albeit as rulers, were predominantly identified with the English kingdom.Their system of government, feudal and baronial though it was, set the seal onEngland&apos;s political unity, and had an influence also on Scotland.49. Forces of expansion and consolidation were similarly at work in thenorth and west. In the north the Celtic Scots who had established themselvesin the region of Argyll achieved in the ninth century, under Kenneth McAlpin,union with the Picts in a kingdom covering the territory north of the Forth andClyde. A victory by Malcom II in 1018 enabled him to annex the Lothians,which had been held by the Northumbrians since the sixth century. In 1035 hewas succeeded by his grandson, Duncan, who was already King of Strathclyde.Somewhat ironically in the light of later developments, the process of forgingScottish political identity was facilitated by the insistence of the Scottish kingson the adoption of English law, custom and, to some extent, speech; and scottish kings and magnates developed close feudal ties with the English. TheHebrides, which, with parts of northern Scotland, had come under Norsedominion in the ninth century, were ceded by the Norwegians in 1266, and theScottish kingdom was finally completed in the fifteenth century, when the lastNorse dominion, Orkney and Shetland, passed to the Scottish Crown.50. In the west, Wales was already a geographical expression in the seventhcentury. Politically it consisted of an unstable collection of petty principalities,separated from one another by mountains and valleys better suited to be centres of refuge than sources of great political power. Political and economic weak-nesses were balanced by cultural forces which included an historic sense ofcontinuity with the traditions of Rome, a code of law, a common language,poetry, mythology and song. Occasionally a Prince of Deheubarth or Gwyneddwould assert his right to be the Prince of Wales and desire such recognition fromthe King of England. In the arbitrament of ordeal by battle, the claim had failed by the end of the thirteenth century, after which Edward I and his successors sought to impose an administrative and political order from without.Owain Glyn Dwr revived the political independence of Wales for a decade or so at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century.Thereafter it lapsed.51. In the south-west the small Celtic principality of Cornwall was subjugatedand annexed by Wessex in the tenth century, with the consequent extinction ofits political but not its cultural or ethnic identity. Across the western seas layIreland, free until the end of the eleventh century of political ties with Britainand destined thereafter to be a restive part of the United Kingdom.the making of the union52. The relationships of Scotland, Wales and Ireland with their more power-ful English neighbour are briefly recounted in our later chapters, and we mentionhere only the final link in each case in the chain of events which brought them into union with England. The first of these was the enactment by the Parliamentof England in 1536 of a statute providing for Wales to &quot;stand and continue for ever from henceforth incorporated united and annexed to and with&quot; the
realm of England. This was a unilateral Act, but essentially it confirmed and gave more precise form to a situation which had existed since a statute of 1284.Union with Scotland, when it came in 1707, took a very different form. Theterms of union between the two nations, to which effect was given by Actspassed in both the English and Scottish Parliaments, provided for the establish-ment of a single Parliament of Great Britain. Then, in 1800, the creation of theUnited Kingdom was completed by a similar union with Ireland though onthe Irish side the ratifying agent was a Parliament of Ireland in which noRoman Catholic could sit. Finally, in 1922, the United Kingdom was given itspresent shape when the greater part of Ireland ceased to be part of it. NorthernIreland, consisting of six of the original nine counties of Ulster, had in 1920been given its own Parliament of Northern Ireland, subordinate to the UnitedKingdom Parliament at Westminster, and by a vote of its Parliament chose toremain within the United Kingdom.the main characteristics of the union53. We note here the main characteristics of the union so established thethings which the people of the several countries, nations and regions which make up the United Kingdom have in common and, since unity does notnecessarily involve uniformity, those which they do not all have in common.54. The first feature to note is a common loyalty to Your Majesty, which thepeople of the United Kingdom share with the people of the Channel islands and the Isle of Man, and with those of the colonies and many of the independent countries of the Commonwealth. Next, they have a common citizenship, whichagain they share with the people of the Islands and the colonies.55. What distinguishes the people of the United Kingdom from others whopay homage to the Crown is their representation in the Parliament at West-minster, which is the supreme law-making authority for the whole of the UnitedKingdom. Even in Northern Ireland, where by the Government of Ireland Act1920 a separate Parliament was set up to legislate for the province in domesticmatters, ultimate authority continued to rest with the United Kingdom Parlia-ment, which created and conferred powers on the Northern Ireland parliament and was able at any time to change those powers-in 1972 it withdrew themcompletely or make laws overriding the laws made in Northern Ireland.Accordingly the people of Northern Ireland have always had representation inthe United Kingdom Parliament as well as in their own domestic legislature.56. The supremacy of Parliament has the consequence that it is not bound by the acts of its predecessors; equally it cannot bind its successors. No specialprocedures are required to enact even the most fundamental changes in theconstitution. Thus the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 was made possible by an ordinary Act of Parliament, despite the declared intention of the Act of union of 1800 that the union of Great Britain and Ireland should last for ever.It is in this sense that the often-repeated statement that the United Kingdom hasno written constitution is to be understood. There is no lack of written statutesregulating constitutional institutions and procedures; indeed, the number of statues of constitutional significance in this country must be at least as great as in most others. But all these are ordinary statutes, having no greater authority
than any others (save perhaps what they have acquired by antiquity) and requiring no special procedures for their amendment1. Nor are they collectedinto a single document that can be referred to as &quot;the Constitution&quot;.57. The United Kingdom is a unitary state in economic as well as in politicalterms. It has, for example, a single currency and a banking system responsible toa single central bank; Its people enjoy a right of freedom of movement of trade,labour and capital and of settlement and establishment anywhere within the kingdom (though there is an exception in Northern Ireland in a restriction on employment imposed in the interests of Northern Ireland workers). Similarly,all citizens are free to participate in trading and other concessions obtained bythe United Kingdom abroad.58. These are the things that are held in common. But there are others thatare not. Not all the people of the United Kingdom live under the same systemof law, since the separate Scottish legal system which was in existence in 1707was preserved by the union settlement. Sometimes it is this separate legal systemalone which causes the United Kingdom Parliament to pass special Scottish Actsor to include special Scottish provisions in general Acts. In addition, the content of the laws to which people are subject sometimes differs. The particular circumstances of Scotland, producing a requirement for different policies, maylead to separate Scottish legislation. Similarly, special measures applying onlyto Wales, concerning the Welsh language, for example, are on occasionseparately enacted. The content of the law diverges still more in NorthernIreland, which for a period of over fifty years had its own Parliament, with notonly its own limited powers of taxation but considerable freedom to differ insome kinds of social legislation. In comparison with the whole body of the law,however, these exceptions, of form and content, even including the variations inNorthern Ireland, are relatively minor. For the greater part, the people of theUnited Kingdom live under the same law.59. There are differences also in the relationships between the State and theChurch. The Church of England is established in England, but both the Churchin Wales and the Church of Ireland, which, like the Church of England, form part of the Anglican Communion, have been disestablished. In Scotland, the established church at the time of the union was the Presbyterian Church ofScotland, and it has so remained. Thus there are established Churches inEngland and Scotland, but not in Wales or Northern Ireland.the achievements of the union60. It is as well, before taking on a task that is necessarily concerned morewith the parts of the United Kingdom than with the whole, to take note of itsconsiderable achievements. This country, aided by good fortune but sustainedmuch more by the efforts of its own people, raised itself to a position of un-questioned primacy in the world and used it, on balance, for good. Spreadacross the world, the areas that have known British rule amount to well over a quarter of the whole; whatever else the British have left, they have endowedthese areas with a tradition of Parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.I We are assuming, because it is not necessary to discuss an opposite contention, that thisholds good of the Acts by which the Union of 1707 between the Kingdom of England andWales and the Kingdom of Scotland was established.
Britain was the first country to transform itself from an agricultural communityinto a major industrial power. In commerce, in navigation, in banking, in investment, it was British practices that were adopted by the rest of the world.61. These achievements have owed much to the union. The United kingdom has been greater than the sum of its constituent parts. While, for example,Scotland&apos;s desire to participate in England&apos;s overseas markets may have beena major factor in her decision to agree to the union, the benefits were by nomeans one-sided. The removal of the threat of internal strife allowed theenergies and talents of all the British people to be directed to peaceful pursuitsat home and to expansion abroad.62. The story of the United Kingdom has thus been, at least in the largerisland, a success story. But this is not to say that the union has brought unalloyedadvantage to the constituent parts. It can be argued that in Scotland, Wales and parts of England, as well as in Ireland, a price in political, social and economicterms has had to be paid for progress; that the interests of the majority havebeen fostered partly at the expense of national and regional minorities; thattraditional ways of life have been disrupted by the exploitation and then theabandonment of local resources; that the resultant social distress has not been adequately recognised by governments which have seemed physically andpsychologically remote; and that the minorities most concerned with these problems have not been allowed the power or the means to alleviate them.Nevertheless, outside Northern Ireland, there has been little general disposition to question the maintenance of the union, particularly in times of politicalcrisis and when the security of the United Kingdom has been threatened. at such times, indeed, all sections of the British people have never failed to re-assert their loyalty to the wider entity.63. We do not believe that this loyalty has faded. On the contrary, a newchallenge would call forth the old response. Although, as we note in the countrychapters which follow, there remain within the United Kingdom some markedgeographical differences in social and cultural characteristics and strongly held national and regional loyalties, there exist also, quite apart from the moretangible things we have mentioned as being held in common, innumerableclose ties which result from centuries of intermingling and from shared language,experience, social institutions and attitudes to such fundamental matters aspersonal liberty and the rule of law. Moreover, powerful unifying forces areat work in the growing influence of the various media of communication,improved means of transport and continuing movement of population.64. It would nevertheless be idle to pretend that nothing is happening to theold spirit of unquestioning unity. With the British Empire in the sense of wideterritories for whose rule these islands were responsible so largely relinquished,and with the manifest diminution of Britain&apos;s role on the international stage,the necessity for a tight union at home as a base for external expansion has passed. For both defence and economic welfare it is to outside groupings ratherthan to our own unaided strength that we now look. These changes have, byan inevitable process, caused people to question what has for so long been taken for granted. How far such questioning should go, and what changes it should suggest, constitute the main theme of this Report.
SCOTLAND65. Scotland is the second, largest of the four countries which make up theUnited Kingdom. With a total area, including the many islands which lie offthe coast, of some 30,000 square miles, it constitutes just under one-third of thewhole, and is three-fifths the size of England. Being the most northerly part of britain, with much mountainous or hilly country, it has a population which is relatively much smaller. At the 1971 Census, the population of Scotland was,227,706, or 9-4 per cent, of the United Kingdom total of 55,346,551. Somefour-fifths of the people of Scotland live in the central belt, a comparativelynarrow strip of low-lying land, which has long been the political and economicheart of the country.historical background the Union of the Crowns66. The early tendency for Scottish political identity to be shaped on linesnot dissimilar from that of England, and the close feudal ties between the twocountries, were later decisively broken by English attempts at sovereignty oroverlordship, culminating in the oppressive claims of Edward I of Englandwhich precipitated the Scottish Wars of Independence. This long period of anglo-Scottish conflict was marked by the emergence of the Franco-ScottishAlliance, which lasted for 250 years up to the Reformation. Under the inspira-tion of the national heroes, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, the Scotssurvived as an independent nation, the decisive victory being Bruce&apos;s crushingdefeat of the English at Bannockburn in 1314. Relations between the twocountries did not improve until in due course both were forced to make common cause in defence of Protestantism, and in 1603 James VI of Scotland succeeded,as heir to the Tudor line, to the throne of England and Wales.67. Although this Union of the Crowns opened up the possibility of politicalunion, there was no immediate move in that direction. The Scottish Parliamentcontinued to sit in Edinburgh, though with the Sovereign, who had removed hisseat to London, no longer in proximity. Throughout the Middle Ages Parlia-ment had been the tool of either the Sovereign or the nobles, depending on their relative strengths, and the later development of the estates system nobility,lairds, clergy and burgesses sitting together in the one House had prevented the emergence, as in England, of a powerful organ of the commonalty. After 1603the Scottish Parliament was increasingly controlled by a business committee,the Lords of the Articles, over which the King secured complete control from1612 until its abolition in 1690. Lacking the ultimate financial sanction which enabled the Westminster Parliament to win its long fight for political control, theScottish Parliament was unable to bring pressure to bear on the Sovereign;and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, though suppressed for two periods covering more than half the seventeenth century, came to beregarded as more representative than Parliament of the Scottish people as awhole. Parliament, however, enjoyed a brief final flowering from the abolitionof the Lords of the Articles until its independent life came to an end in 1707.
The Union of the Parliaments68. The Union of 1707 was from any standpoint a remarkable achievement,in that it was entered into voluntarily by the two Parliaments. Although earlyin Queen Anne&apos;s reign both Parliaments had empowered the appointment of royal Commissioners, who agreed on the general principles of union, sub-sequent differences of view between the two countries meant that, right up tothe event, it was by no means certain that negotiations for union would be successful. Conscious of developing authority, the Scottish Parliament had passed a number of measures designed to assert its independence. In particularan Act of Security, to which Royal Assent was reluctantly given in 1704, had provided that on the death of Queen Anne the Scottish succession would be different from the Hanoverian succession already determined in England andWales by the Act of Settlement of 1701. English retaliation took the form of theAlien Act of 1705, directed against the status of Scots in England and trade between the two countries; its provisions were to come into force unless Scotlandaccepted the Hanoverian succession before the end of the year.69. As was intended, this measure put pressure on the Scottish Parliamenteither to stand by a different succession, which would mean reversion to completeseparation, or to move towards union. In the event new Commissioners were appointed and speedily agreed on the terms of union, which at English insistencewas to be complete and incorporating and not, as many Scots woidd probably have preferred, federal. Notwithstanding considerable opposition in Scotland,the Scottish Parliament, concluding that union was the most sensible solution to the relationship between the two kingdoms, passed the Act of Union by a110 votes to 69. The terms were then approved without amendment by the westminster Parliament.70. The first of the twenty-five Articles of the Union provided for the uniftca-tion of the two kingdoms as Great Britain. Accompanying this was the acceptance by Scotland of the Act of Succession, thus ensuring that the Union of the Crownswould be maintained. The third Article provided for one Parliament of GreatBritain, in which (as determined by later Articles and accompanying legislation which formed part of the Union settlement) Scotland was to receive prescribedrepresentation. Other Articles established freedom of trade between the twocountries, with a common flag, coinage and system of weights and measures.Except for some transitional provisions, taxation was henceforward to be on acommon basis, and Scotland received an &quot;equivalent&quot; of about  400,000 as aonce for all compensation for assuming a share in the English national debt.While separate legislatures were thus abolished, and the two countries enteredinto a full political and economic union, special provisions were made for thecontinuance of the Scottish Church and of Scots law and the Scottish legalsystem.71. The Union was a unique event. It is not surprising that the proposals were controversial at the time and; that the consequences of the Union have since been the subject of much heated debate in Scotland. From the outsetthere were those who opposed not just the terms of the settlement, but the wholeconcept of an incorporating union. Many parts of Scotland, however, cameincreasingly to enjoy the economic fruits of the Union as the industrial revolutiongot under way, and not until the latter part of the nineteenth century did the modern nationalist movement begin.
The Scottish Church72. The Church for which special provision was made in an Act forming partof the Union settlement was the Church of Scotland as established by law.While Protestant Reformation was an experience common to both Scotland and england in the sixteenth century, it did not take the same form in the twocountries. In Scotland under the leadership of John Knox, with his ScotsConfession of Faith, the favoured doctrine was Calvinistic, and the form inwhich this was subsequently endorsed was determined in the WestminsterConfession of Faith of 1647. A system of church government and disciplineinvolving kirk sessions, presbyteries, synods and the General Assembly was introduced and adopted in 1581, largely due to the influence of Andrew Melville.Despite attacks during the seventeenth century on both the form and the doctrine, the Scottish Church survived. In providing that it was to &quot;remain and continue unalterable&quot; the Union settlement recognised the existing situation.73. While this provision ensured the Church of Scotland&apos;s establishedposition, it could not of itself safeguard it from schism and dissension, by whichit was rent during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With reunificationlargely complete by 1929, however, the Church of Scotland has re-establisheditself as the national presbyterian church. As exemplified by the evidence which its Church and Nation Committee presented to us1, it has from time to timeexpressed views on broad national issues. Today it claims an impressive, ifpartly nominal, adult membership of one and a quarter million.Scots law and legal system74. For a considerable period in the Middle Ages the Scottish legal system was based on Anglo-Norman law, but the Wars of Independence caused acomplete break, after which little trace of English law remained. Scottish lawyersturned to the Continent for ideas and training, and Roman law thus acquireda dominant influence in Scottish legal thinking. By the time of the Union awell-defined and independent system of Scottish law had been established. Thiswas recognised in the Union settlement, which provided for the preservation ofthe separate code of Scots law and the Scottish judiciary and legal system.Under Article XIX the two highest Scottish courts the Court of Session andthe High Court of Justiciary were to continue, and were not to be subject tothe jurisdiction of the English courts. These bodies have remained respectivelythe supreme civil and criminal courts in Scotland, while beneath them there isa completely separate Scottish system of jurisdiction and law courts, with ajudiciary, advocates and solicitors, none of whom are interchangeable with theirEnglish counterparts. The provisions of the Article did not explicitly refer to appeal to the House of Lords. The High Court of Justiciary has remained thefinal court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases; but before the Union the Courtof Session had been subordinate to the Scottish Privy Council as &quot;the SupremeJudges of the Kingdom&quot;, and it soon became established that in Scottish civilcases the House of Lords had appellate jurisdiction. It has for many years beenthe custom to appoint two of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary from the Scottishbench.75. It was explicit in the Union settlement that the United Kingdom Parlia-ment would be the legislative body which would henceforth have the function1 Written Evidence, Vol. 2.
of making and amending the law of Scotland, but on the way in which a separatesystem of Scottish law was to be not only preserved but also developed theArticles of Union were by no means clear. Article XVIII stipulated that, while&quot;the laws which concern public right, policy and civil government may be madethe same throughout the whole United Kingdom ... no alteration be made inlaws which concern private right, except for evident utility of the subjectswithin Scotland&quot;. No procedure was specified for determining how &quot;evidentutility&quot; should be ascertained, nor was the concept of private right defined. Inpractice, with only a small volume of legislation involved, it was normallypossible during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for the Lord Advocate,the chief Law Officer of the Crown in Scotland, to advise the Government afterpreliminary consultation in Scotland.76. The complexities of modern government have made it more difficult to distinguish between public and private right. The laws of Scotland and Englandare, in some respects, tending towards uniformity. For many good reasons, suchas closer economic and social relationships, this tendency is not objected to inScotland, provided that the two systems are assessed on their own merits, andthat the assimilation is negotiated on the basis of freedom of choice betweenequals and in such a way as to preserve the separate identity of the two systems.In the realm of law reform the Law Commissions in both countries, in pursuanceof their statutory terms of reference, work in close consultation. Nevertheless thetwo systems remain separate, and a unique constitutional phenomenon withina unitary state stand to this day in the same juridical relationship to one another as they do individually to the system of any foreign country.Post-Union government of Scotland77. After 1707 special arrangements were made for the conduct of govern-ment business in Scotland. At first, in continuance of a pre-Union office, a secretary of State for Scotland was appointed as a member of the Governmentin London. After 1745, however, no special appointment was made, and responsibility for Scotland was given to a Secretary of State with other duties.From 1782 this was the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who in1828 assumed a general oversight of Scottish policy. In practice, throughoutthe whole of this period, much of the effective political power in relation to scotland was exercised by the Lord Advocate.78. This system lasted until 1885, when the office of Secretary for Scotland was created, and since 1892 the holder of the office has always been in theCabinet (except the war Cabinets). From the outset his legislative and executive responsibilities covered a wide range of subjects, including law and order and education (exercised through the Scottish Education Department, created in1872 as a committee of the Privy Council). In addition, he was expected to keepan eye on the various boards which were established to administer aspects ofpublic business in Scotland, and which increased in number in the period upto the First World War; in 1914 these included boards for agriculture, fisheries and local government, the General Board of Control and the Prisons Com-mission. When the Scottish Board of Health was created in 1919, absorbingthe Local Government Board and two others, the presidency was vested in theSecretary for Scotland and the vice-presidency in the new office of parliamentary under Secretary for Health.
79. The status of the Secretary for Scotland was upgraded in 1926 to that of a principal Secretary of State, and his deputy became a Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State. In 1928 the Boards of Agriculture and Health and thePrisons Commission for Scotland were reconstituted as statutory departments,under the control and direction of the Secretary of State, but existing inde-pendently of him. In 1939, with the opening of St. Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburghas the headquarters of government administration in Scotland, the functions ofthe Departments of Agriculture, Education and Health became vested directlyin the Secretary of State, on the basis of recommendations which had beenmade in 1937 by the Gilmour Committee1. At the same time the generalfunctions of the Scottish Office in London were transferred to Edinburgh andabsorbed in a new Scottish Home Department, which also assumed responsibilityfor fisheries and prisons.the scottish economy80. From the outset, the Scots devoted a great deal of their energies to securing the economic advantages to be expected from the Union. As is brought out in this Report, it is largely on the extent to which these expectations havebeen, and continue to be, fulfilled that the Union is judged in Scotland.81. Economic benefit from a wider market, and especially from participation in the developing trade with the English colonies, was expected to be one of the fruits of union. More generally, it was clear that the economy of scotland would become increasingly integrated with that of the rest of the UnitedKingdom, although the nature and extent of this economic interrelationshipcould not have been foreseen in an era before the industrial and technologicalrevolutions. In the century and a half following the industrial revolutionScotland shared in British industrial prosperity, at least to the extent thatcentral Scotland was one of the main areas in which the heavy industriesdeveloped. The population of Scotland increased during the nineteenth centuryfrom about 1-6 million to over 4-4 million. But excessive reliance on a small number of basic industries left the country particularly vulnerable to anydecline in these industries, whether for technical reasons, such as the working-out of coal and iron ore resources, or through changes in the general economic climate; and at the height of the economic depression of the early 1930s un-employment exceeded 400,000, about a quarter of the labour force.82. The boom conditions of the Second World War and the immediate post-war period did not long mask Scottish economic difficulties. With the help of substantial government expenditure, an attempt was made both tostrengthen and diversify industry in the central industrial belt, emphasis being placed on investment related to the modernisation of the older traditionalindustries. As the 1950s progressed Scotland&apos;s rate of growth lagged behindthat of the United Kingdom as a whole, and the inherent weakness of theScottish economy again became apparent. As will be noted later, economic difficulties of this kind were not confined to Scotland. Wales and parts ofEngland suffered similarly. But from the Scottish point of view the relevantcontrast has always been between Scotland&apos;s economic performance and that1 Report of the Committee on Scottish Administration (Chairman, Sir John Gilmour)(Cmd. 5563).
of England or the United Kingdom as a whole. A White Paper issued in 19661noted that the problem in the central belt of Scotland remained that of re-structuring and diversifying Scottish industry quickly enough to fill the gapsleft by the decline of the heavy industries, while at the same time, especially in west-central Scotland, developing new and redeveloping old towns to providestandards of housing and servicing appropriate to modern needs. successive governments, employing vigorous regional policies and various incentives to industry, have directed their attention to these problems, and much has beendone. Scotland has benefited from the introduction of new or expandingindustries, including motor vehicle manufacturing and electronics, many ofthem involving substantial foreign investment.83. These large structural changes have unfortunately been far from painless.In the traditional labour-intensive industries modernisation resulted in a fall inthe labour requirements. The new growth industries did something to make good this fall, but in many cases considerable retraining was required and thenew industries tended to be capital intensive. Labour productivity has thusincreased in Scotland, more quickly indeed than in the United Kingdom as awhole, but a difficult employment situation has persisted. The Scottish un-employment rate has invariably stood considerably above that of the UnitedKingdom as a whole2. Between 1960 and 1970 the total number registered asunemployed increased by nearly 15,000 from 78,700 to 93,500. The decline inthe total number of employees in employment was about 28,000; while femaleemployment was increasing, the drop in male employment over the decade wasabout 91,000. Over the same period the annual rate of net migration never fellbelow 20,000 and sometimes stood at more than twice that figure. Emigrationdoes not always mean total loss to Scotland, since the emigrants have sometimesreturned with capital to be employed for the benefit of their native land; but itis at a level a good deal higher than most people would wish to see and soreflects a need to develop more opportunities for Scots to make a living inScotland.84. While the central belt is of major importance to Scotland in terms of population and economic development, the areas to the north and south havealso had problems rightly commanding attention, although of a different kind.In the Borders, the south-west and the north-east, there has been a decline inemployment in existing industries, including agriculture, and the major need is to develop new sources of employment. In the north-east this problem may be eased following the discovery of oil in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland.85. Exploitation of oil will have a significant effect on many aspects of theScottish economy. It may, for example, transform the position in at least partsof the largest problem area in Scotland the Highlands and Islands-which covers 47 per cent, of the land area but has a population of only about 280,000and has contributed only about 4 per cent, of the Scottish national income.Although modern means of communication have helped much of the highlands and Islands, some stretches of the north-west mainland and some of the Islandshave remained remote. The economy has been largely dependent upon the primary and service industries of agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism.1 The Scottish Economy 1965-70; A Plan for Expansion (Cmnd. 2864).2 See footnote on page 139.
For political and social, as well as for economic, reasons a great deal of govern-ment attention has been devoted to the problems of the area. Special agencieshave been created to cope with specific problems. Among these are the North ofScotland Hydro-Electric Board, the Crofters Commission and the highlands and Islands Development Board, the last of which has a considerable measure of independence of operation, enabling it to make grants and loans for the develop-ment of the economy and in other ways to sponsor industrial growth. looking to the future, the Board has drawn attention to the possibilities for such growthwhich may arise as North Sea oil exploitation gets under way. Shetland, becauseof its proximity to some of the major oil fields, and the Cromarty and MorayFirth areas have already been affected.the scottish people86. The cultural and social attitudes of Scotland have in the past differedquite markedly, and still in many aspects differ significantly, from those in otherparts of the United Kingdom. The preservation in the Union settlement of separate Scottish institutions helped to maintain the differences that already existed. The separate legal and clerical professions formed a source of Scottishcultural identity. This was focussed on Edinburgh, which contained theirinstitutional headquarters, and thus retained or acquired some of the attributesappropriate to its capital status, including periods of great literary andintellectual distinction.87. But cultural and educational influences were not confined to Edinburgh.In Scotland as a whole there was a long tradition of educational striving. a fairly elementary but quite widespread system of parish schools, coupled withthe academies (or secondary schools) in the burghs, and four universities, whosefoundation dated back to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, created a climatewhich enabled a &quot;lad o&apos; pairts&quot; to get on. The system, however, proved unableto cope with nineteenth century industrialisation and the emergence of a largeurbanised working class. The establishment of the Scottish Education Depart-ment and the introduction of a system of state-provided and compulsoryeducation were necessary milestones in the maintenance of Scottish educationalstandards. Great strides were made, with the department playing a central and direct role in the provision of a national system of education. In recent yearsdifferences between the educational system in Scotland and that in other partsof Britain have in some respects been narrowing at the various levels, and theScottish universities, now eight in number, are the concern of the university grants Committee, which has responsibilities throughout Great Britain. Therehas nevertheless remained in Scotland a distinctive educational tradition basedon a system which is less specialised than that in the south.88. Emigration has social as well as economic aspects. Historically the limitedprospects of improvement within Scotland resulted in many persons with the potential for rising in the social and economic scale choosing emigration as thebest means of doing so. Some went to England and others went further afield.In the inter-war period heavy unemployment in Scotland further strengthenedthe tradition of emigration which had developed during the nineteenth century,and, as we have already noted, the flow of Scottish emigrants has continued inthe post-war period during the decline of the labour-intensive industries. The
social significance of this long continuing trend has been to produce in Scottishnational consciousness a phenomenon akin to the Diaspora in that more peopleof Scots descent who regard themselves as Scottish live outside Scotland thanwithin its boundaries.89. Within Scotland social and cultural differences are to be found in different parts of the country. The most obvious and important difference is that betweenthe Highlands and the Lowlands, which are separated physically by the dis-cernible feature of the Highland line. In the development of Scotland as a nation, two distinct cultural patterns emerged, one, predominantly Celtic, inthe Gaelic-speaking Highlands and the other, Anglo-Saxon with distinctiveScottish features, in the English-speaking Lowlands. Although this division haspersisted to the present day, it has become, like differences between Scotlandand other parts of Great Britain, much less sharp.90. As the main centres of economic development in Scotland were to befound in the central belt while the Highlands languished, there was considerableinternal migration within Scotland from the Highlands to the Lowlands, wherethe Gaelic-speaking Highlanders were progressively assimilated to Englishspeech. By the end of the nineteenth century it had become clear that,for economic reasons, the English language would predominate throughoutScotland. Until recently the number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland has beenin steady decline; at the 1951 Census it was about 95,000 and in 1961 it wasdown to 81,000. Preliminary results of the 1971 Census, however, appear toshow that the decline has been slowed if not arrested. Very few speak onlyGaelic. By 1961 the number aged three and over had fallen below one thousand,largely confined to the older age group and to young children; of those agedten or over the number speaking only Gaelic was under 500. An CommunGaidhealach and other Gaelic societies have sought, with some success, to foster the continued use of the language and to maintain Celtic culture. ButGaelic has never in modern times been the language of Scotland, and it is not a central issue in Scottish nationalism. The absence of a separate national languagehas not, however, noticeably hindered the preservation and development of adistinctive Scottish culture and society.present government arrangements the administrative machinery of government91. In 1952 a Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs was appointed, underthe chairmanship of the Earl of Balfour, to review, with reference to the financial,economic, administrative and other considerations involved, the arrangementsfor exercising government functions in relation to Scotland. In accordance with recommendations made by the Commission in its report, presented in 1954,further functions were transferred to the Secretary of State, including theappointment of Justices of the Peace, animal health policy and highways;responsibility for electricity was also transferred. Functions transferred since then are road passenger transport in 1968 and ancient monuments, royal parks and palaces in 1969. Meanwhile, in 1962, the four departments of the Secretaryof State were reconstituted as Agriculture and Fisheries, Development, Educa-tion, and Home and Health. The present staff of the Scottish Office is about,500, excluding the prison service, State Hospital and industrial staff.1 Report of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs 1952-1954 (Chairman, The Earl ofBalfour) (Cmd. 9212).
92. Annual expenditure on services within the responsibility of the Secretaryof State, and administered directly by him or indirectly through local authoritiesto which he makes grants, now amounts to over  1,400 million. The procedure for the approval of estimates and control of expenditure for the Secretary ofState&apos;s departments is broadly the same as for Whitehall departments, but twospecial features of central government expenditure in Scotland are worth noting.After the functional programmes have been provisionally fixed the Secretary ofState has scope, within the overall Scottish Office total, to make marginaladjustments to take account of special Scottish circumstances. Secondly, whileprogrammes of expenditure in Scotland prepared by Great Britain departments are primarily the responsibility of the functional Ministers concerned, pro-procedures have been devised to ensure that the views of the Secretary of State onthe expenditure to be incurred in Scotland are taken into account.93. The organisation and distribution of functions in the Scottish Office was described in the evidence submitted to us by the department. It was pointedout that the Secretary of State also has responsibilities in connexion with anumber of minor Scottish departments, and that he has joint responsibilitywith other Ministers for the work of bodies, such as the Crown Estate Officeand the Forestry Commission, which operate throughout Great Britain. Thereare also a number of specifically Scottish ad hoc bodies responsible to theSecretary of State for the discharge of their functions, and usually financed in whole or in part by him.94. As the work of the Scottish Office has increased, additional ministers have been appointed to assist the Secretary of State. A second office of Parlia-mentary Under Secretary of State was created in 1940 and a third in 1952. Theoffice of Minister of State was created in 1951. Since then it has been the practice to have one of the Scottish Ministers in the House of Lords, which bothfacilitates Scottish business there and enables the holder of the post to be more readily available in Scotland than Ministers who are Members of the House ofCommons.95. Also in the Scottish Ministerial team are the Lord Advocate and the solicitor-General for Scotland. The Lord Advocate has responsibility for legalaspects of all government business affecting Scotland, including the drafting of scottish legislation, which is undertaken by the Scottish Parliamentary drafts-men in his department. The Lord Advocate has usually been in Parliament asa member of the House of Commons, though in recent years it has not alwaysbeen possible to fill the office in this way. In Parliament he is able to assistdirectly in the passage of Scottish legislation. This is sometimes to be found inpurely Scottish Bills or in Scottish parts of United Kingdom Bills, but it may also take the form of clauses adapting United Kingdom legislation to Scotland,a method which causes difficulties.to practitioners in Scotland.96. The Lord Advocate is also responsible for the administration of the criminal law in Scotland, and in particular for decisions to prosecute, a functionwhich is operated through the Crown Office in Edinburgh and is largely in thehands of the Solicitor-General for Scotland.97. The government of Scotland is not solely in the hands of the Secretary ofState and the other Scottish Ministers. Leaving aside defence and overseas1 Written Evidence, Vol. 2.
relations, there are important functional responsibilities, involving (in 1971/72)identifiable public expenditure of over  700 million a year, directly discharged inScotland by other Ministers, of whom the most important are the secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, Employment and Social Services.98. The Balfour Commission pointed out that, broadly speaking, the statutoryfunctions of the Secretary of State for Scotland were those which brought thecentral government into relationship with local authorities, or which affected lawand order, or which arose from the recognition of distinctive Scottish conditions,while the responsibility of Great Britain Ministers in Scotland related to matters affecting trade and industry, those aspects of communication which could not readily be divided within the unified economic system of Great Britain and services provided for the benefit of the public in general. While this distinctionhas remained broadly true, the Secretary of State has in recent years become more closely involved in matters, especially in the economic field, which have a scottish aspect but do not fall within his statutory responsibilities. He takes the lead in the preparation of programmes for economic development in Scotlandand exercises a general co-ordinating responsibility for their implementation,even where they are carried out on the authority of other Ministers. In carryingout these responsibilities the Secretary of State is now served by the ScottishEconomic Planning Department, which was brought into being as a fifthdepartment within the Scottish Office on 1st June 1973. It incorporates theformer Regional Development Division of the Scottish Office, a non-executiveunit which was created in 1964, and those executive divisions of the scottish development Department closely concerned with economic development in the fields of electricity, transport, tourism, new towns and the Highlands and islands. Closely associated at official level with the work of this new department is the Scottish Economic Planning Board, on which are represented all the mainGreat Britain departments with responsibilities in this field in Scotland, and an oil development task force, again with interdepartmental representation, whichhas been set up to tackle and co-ordinate action on specific problems of north sea oil development as it affects Scotland. To assist him in respect of thedevelopment of North Sea oil the Secretary of State appoints an Oil development council, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, while on a widereconomic spectrum he is advised by the Scottish Economic Council, of which he is chairman, and which includes representatives of local government,industrial, trade union and other interests in Scotland nominated by him. TheMinisters of Great Britain departments concerned remain, however, fullyresponsible to Parliament for the exercise of their departments&apos; functions inScotland.Parliamentary arrangements99. The Union settlement provided for the House of Lords to includesixteen representative peers, chosen at each general election by the peers ofScotland from among their number. Scottish representation was augmented byScots holding peerages of the United Kingdom. As no new peers of scotland were created after the Union, their number gradually dwindled, and since the enactment of the Peerage Act 1963 all holders of Scottish peerages have had aright to membership of the House of Lords.
100. Scottish representation in the House of Commons was also determined in 1707. The figure then prescribed was 45, but the number has been adjustedfrom time to time. Of the present 630 seats in the House of Commons, 71 arefilled by Members representing constituencies in scotland. The distribution ofthese seats among the political parties in general elections held since 1945 isshown in Appendix B.101. Most purely Scottish business in the House of Commons, includingconsideration of legislation relating exclusively to Scotland, is conducted in theScottish committees of the House. These are the Scottish Grand Committee,which holds debates on Scottish affairs and considers Scottish Bills in principle,two Scottish Standing Committees, which take the Committee Stages of scottish bills, and the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which is not a standingcommittee but may be appointed on a sessional basis to conduct enquiries. Weexamine the composition and working of these committees in Chapter 22,which is concerned with proposals for making greater use of regional committees of Parliament.Local government102. Local government in Scotland was examined by the Wheatley Commis-sion, which reported in September 19692. The Commission concluded thatthe existing structure of 33 county councils, sharing functions with 21 large burghs, 176 small burghs and 196 districts, and four all-purpose authorities the counties of cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen was inadequate for present and future demands on local government, and recom-mended the replacement of these 430 local authorities by a two-tier system of regional and district authorities throughout Scotland, with the authorities at each level being independently elected and carrying out functions in their own right.103. The recommendations were generally accepted by the Government and,with certain modifications, were embodied in the Local Government (Scotland)Bill introduced in Parliament in November 1972. The Bill, as passed by theHouse of Commons in June 1973, defines nine regions, to be known asHighland (with a population, on the basis of the 1971 Census, of 175,000),Grampian (437,000), Tayside (397,000), Fife (328,000), Lothian (742,000),Borders (99,000), Central (263,000), Strathclyde (2,578,000) and Dumfries andGalloway (143,000). Three island areas Orkney and Shetland, each with a population of about 17,000, and the Western Isles, with a population of 31,000 are given the status of most-purpose authorities, independent of the Highland1 Scotland and Wales are both at present over-represented at Westminster if comparedwith England on the basis of size of electorates. The numbers of constituencies for each ofthe three countries in Great Britain and for Northern Ireland are determined separately underthe terms of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958. For Northern Irelandthe number is fixed at 12. For Scotland and Wales the minimum numbers of seats are specifiedas 71 and 35 respectively. For Great Britain the number is to be &quot;not substantially greater or less than 613&quot;; there are 618 at present, making with Northern Ireland&apos;s 12 a total of630 seats in Parliament. Were the average electorates to be the same throughout the UnitedKingdom, Scotland would have about 57 seats, Wales 31, Northern Ireland 17 and England 525,compared with the present figures of 71, 36, 12 and 511 respectively. There are specialgeographical considerations affecting the size of some constituencies, especially in sparsely populated areas of Scotland and Wales.2 Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland (Chairman, LordWheatley) (Cmnd. 4150).
region, except that they will share with that region the police and fire services.The regional and island authorities are to be the rating authorities, but the districts forming the second tier are separately to determine their own rates.There are to be forty-nine districts, mostly with a population ranging betweenabout 30,000 and 200,000. There will be exceptions in the large urban areas ofGlasgow and Edinburgh at one extreme and eight small districts, mainly in the highlands, at the other. There is also provision in the Bill for a system of voluntary community councils, to be set up by local initiative to give expression to local opinion and to promote local projects. These councils will have no statutory powers, but may receive grants or raise money in other ways.104. The Bill provides for the regions to have responsibility for the major and strategic services, including economic and physical planning, roads and trans-port, education, social work, the police and fire services (which are to be sharedin the case of the Borders with the Lothian region) and the main environmental services (including those provided by the existing regional water boards). Thedistrict authorities are to be given responsibility for housing, environmentalhealth, amenity services, licensing, and (except in the Highlands, Borders andDumfries and Galloway, where the functions are to be regional) local planning,building control and libraries. Certain functions community centres, parks,recreation, museums and art galleries are to be exercised concurrently; and onsuch matters as planning, housing and redevelopment it is intended that the twolevels of authorities will work closely together.105. There is to be a permanent Local Government Boundary commission for Scotland, charged with reviewing both boundaries and electoral areas.Elections to regional, island and district councils are to be at four-year intervals,with all councillors being elected to an authority at the same time, and with thedistrict elections being held midway between regional elections.106. Our terms of reference require us to have regard to developments in local government organisation. We have assumed that in Scotland localgovernment will be reformed on the basis set out in the Bill, and that elections to the new regional, island and district authorities will take place in 1974, withthe new system coming into force in May 1975.the situation in brief107. The close relationship of the Scottish economy to that of the rest of theUnited Kingdom has resulted in increasingly close economic and social tiesbetween Scotland and the South. At the same time there has been a demandfor recognition of the distinctive nature of Scotland in the political, economic and social sense. That demand has been met in greater or lesser degree, and in vary-ing ways, ever since the Union, the terms of which recognised the existence of separate Scottish institutions. These institutions have on the whole beenpreserved, and the machinery of government has been given special form to take account of political and economic circumstances in Scotland. But the increasingpressures which these circumstances impose as the twentieth century progresseshave, for some Scots at least, occasioned a conflict of loyalties. That, as regardsScotland, is the problem we have to examine.
WALES108. Wales, on the western and more mountainous side of Britain, has an area of just over 8,000 square miles, a little less than one-sixth the size ofEngland or slightly more than one-twelfth that of the United Kingdom. Accord-ing to the 1971 Census, the population of Wales was 2,723,596, or 4-9 per cent,of that of the United Kingdom. More than two-thirds live in the industrial beltof South Wales, where Cardiff, the capital city, is situated. The Census showed that about one-fifth of the population were able to speak Welsh, with by far thehighest densities in the western half of the country.historical backgroundUnion with England109. The completion of the military conquest of Wales came with the over-throw of Prince Llewellyn the Last in 1282. This was the culmination of a continuous process that had begun before the Norman Conquest of Englandand was intensified thereafter. William of Normandy established his Marcherlords along the Welsh border stretching from Gloucester to Chester. their successors and their retainers maintained a continuous pressure along thenorthern and southern seaboards of Wales and up the valleys of the Rivers Dee,Severn and Usk and their tributaries, thus gradually surrounding and penetratingthe mountainous heartland of the country. Over the years, these lords formedmarriage alliances with Welsh families and so became closely involved in the domestic policies of the Principality. They ruled their own lordships in accord-ance with the terms of their original grants; they were subject to military serviceand the payment of dues, but otherwise exempted from the King&apos;s writ within their territories. The Welsh Princes for their part maintained their rule within their territories with the full panoply of sovereign power and as free as possible from feudal commitments to an overlord.110. After the collapse of 1282 and the promulgation of the Statute ofRhuddlan in 1284 a new political and administrative order appeared. There wereprincipalities with administrative centres in Caernarvon and Carmarthen, togetherwith scores of quasi-independent lordships, some of them in the possession ofthe English Crown and in no way associated with the principalities, which from1301 were in the prerogative of the Prince of Wales. For the rest of the MiddleAges the Welsh people knew the stress of conflicting loyalties, subjected as theywere to the English Kings, yet not entirely detached from their Welsh lords. Withinthe principalities and lordships, Welsh customs and civil laws survived, in spiteof the presence of feudal law and such Westminster enactments as appliedthroughout the King&apos;s realm. The Welsh language was not proscribed, certainly not within the courts of first instance, and even within the King&apos;s and Lords&apos;courts the parties were often members of Welsh families who could conductbusiness in the language of the country. The record of the courts might be inLatin or Norman-French, the actual work being conducted in Welsh or Norman-French.111. The principalities were divided into five shires Anglesey, Caernarvon-shire and Merionethshire in the north, and Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire
in the south. During the fourteenth century the Knights of the Shires weresummoned to the Parliament of Westminster. The Earldoms of Pembroke andGlamorgan gave a quasi-county status to their compact territories, but they hadno shire status and they were by no means as extensive as the counties thatsucceeded them at the Tudor settlement.112. Owain Glyn Dwr, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, led a rebellionon a national scale, and during the brief years of his success tried to impose a uniform administrative pattern on the country, with an elected Parliament atthe summit. It met three times, but did not survive the collapse of the rebellion.Thenceforward, with the exception of the establishment of a Council for wales and the Marches by Edward IV in 1471, the political, territorial and economic life of Wales became, with the passage of the years, increasingly integrated withthat of England. Under the unstable conditions of the Wars of the Roses, west wales supported the House of Lancaster and East Wales the House of York;ironically enough, these Wars were concluded on Bosworth Field in 1485 bythe crowning of the first Tudor King, who was a scion of the Tudors ofPenmynydd, Anglesey.113. The Tudor Acts of 1536 and 1542 provided the framework of governmentfor the Principality down to modern times. The whole of Wales became shireground, with the thirteen counties (if Monmouthshire is included) that are known today. Within these, the cantrefs and commotes of the old order were retained as the smaller administrative units. Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs andLords Lieutenant were appointed, and Members of Parliament were elected onthe same franchise as in England. The 1542 Act established a uniform system oflaw courts, known as the Court of the Great Sessions. Circuits for Welsh judgeswere arranged, and twice a year they moved to the assize towns to deal with thecases referred to them. The Council of Wales and the Marches, under itsPresident, met at Ludlow, where it supervised the administration of the law andarbitrated when intractable disputes arose within or between the shires andlordships. It was suppressed in 1689. The Welsh bench of judges remained until1830, when the Welsh courts were assimilated to those of England; Monmouth-shire was attached to the Oxford circuit and the North Wales and Chester andSouth Wales circuits were formed.Progress after the union114. Although following the Acts of 1536 and 1542 the official language ofgovernment was English and the gentry and professional classes tended toneglect the use of Welsh, the translation of the Bible in 1588 and its successiveeditions and reprinting from the seventeenth century onwards provided anunexpected guarantee of the future of the Welsh language. Books began to bepublished in Welsh, at first in London, afterwards in Shrewsbury and Chesterand, during the eighteenth century, in several Welsh market towns such aCarmarthen, Llanrwst, Talgarth, Llandovery, Brecon, Wrexham and Swansea,where presses produced a continuous flow of educational works, pamphlets,almanacs and broadsheets which were peddled in fairs and markets and sold byestablished traders. From the middle of the eighteenth century, the circulatingschools of Griffith Jones and the evangelical revival became rousing andinvigorating forces in social life. They gave the people a powerful incentive for
reading, initially the Bible, devotional works and catechisms, but leading in-inevitably to wider horizons, to anthologies of prose and verse and to magazinesand plays, some of which awakened interest in political and social problems andin world affairs.115. By the beginning of the nineteenth century a comparatively high proportion of Welsh people were literate and articulate and ready for theexcitements of politics and the new industrial areas that were growing apace.The ground, from which people like Robert Owen of Newtown could appear,had been well prepared. The changes wrought by the industrial revolution weresharpening the experience of an alert and cultured people. The so-called&quot;disorders&quot; which appeared to be endemic in the Welsh countryside andindustrial areas in the early nineteenth century led the Government to appointin 1846 a Commission of Enquiry into the State of Education in Wales. TheCommission was not well-constituted and, with the assistance of a few Welsh-men, succeeded in producing a report which gave the Government no help andthe Welsh people much offence. This report revealed little understanding of welsh history, and contained several gratuitously offensive comments about the welsh character and the disadvantages of being Welsh-speaking. The soonerthe Welsh language and other characteristic institutions were abandoned andtheir English counterparts adopted, it was suggested, the better for all concerned.116. The great majority of the Welsh people rejected the Commission^report. The slogan &quot;The Treason of the Blue Books&quot; tended to darken counsel,but the report certainly altered the general attitude of Welsh people to the&quot;wisdom from without&quot; and stimulated their own sense of responsibility forformulating demands and seeking measures of reform. In this climate dissentingorganisations, which were not peculiar to Wales, assumed increasing political significance. Nonconformist chapels, with their Sunday schools, literarysocieties and zeal for the establishment of British schools, became the centres of a popular radicalism that was to challenge established authority and, withthe coming of the ballot box, to generate new political forces. The old dissentingacademies and the new teacher training colleges were beginning to provide more positive leadership.Educational advance117. Thus inspired, educational progress was rapid. The first of the UniversityColleges of Wales opened at Aberystwyth in 1872. Welsh Members of Parlia-ment succeeded in getting a Committee on Higher and Intermediate Educationestablished. Following its report in 1881, two additional University Collegeswere opened, in Cardiff and Bangor. In 1889 the Welsh Intermediate education act was passed. This led to a substantial increase in the number of &quot;inter-mediate&quot; or grammar schools throughout the Principality, under the indirectsupervision of the newly established county councils, some of the leaders ofwhich were exploring the possibility of a wider association within a national council for Wales. The three University Colleges were federated to form theUniversity of Wales in 1893, and the Central Welsh Board was established to inspect and examine the grammar schools in 1896. In 1907 the Welsh Depart-ment was formed within the Board of Education, the National Library of Wales
at Aberystwyth was given its Royal Charter, and the National Museum of wales in Cardiff was similarly constituted. The higher educational programme for wales was virtually complete by 1914.118. The Welsh Disestablishment Act, passed in that year, provided for thedisestablishment and disendowment of the Church of England in Wales,though its operation was postponed until after the First World War. Churchschools, tithes and the control of burial grounds had long been Nonconformistgrievances. They were now removed, and the ecclesiastical domination of theChurch of England, particularly in the county towns and districts, was suc-ceeded by an autonomous Church in Wales, with brighter prospects of a closeidentification with the people of the country.Other unifying forces119. Other forces strengthened the consciousness of Welsh nationhoodthroughout the nineteenth century. The issues of temperance and Sunday observance, though not peculiar to Wales, were especially powerful there as political forces for the expression of Nonconformist opinion. In 1881 an Actwas passed to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors on Sunday in Wales.Emigration to overseas territories from the rural and industrial areas alikeassumed the character of protests against the domination of an alien orderrepresented by squires and capitalists and by an established and endowedChurch. Men like Samuel Roberts of Llanbrynmair and Michael Jones of Balasought to establish free Welsh communities in North and South America, thelatter with some slight prospects of acquiring the status of an autonomousprovince in the Valley of Chubut and in the foothills of the Argentinian Andes.The Welsh language120. Towards the end of the nineteenth and in the early years of the presentcentury the influence of the new grammar schools, teacher training colleges and universities indirectly produced a revival of interest in the study of welsh language, its literary traditions and possibilities. The Welsh press not onlycontinued its impressive quantitative output of books and periodicals butpublished new Welsh prose and poetry of high quality. Welsh literature, dramaand art were alive to modern issues and inspired by the best contemporarystandards.First steps towards devolution121. These cultural movements had their political counterparts, and a growingsense of Welsh nationhood became a force to be reckoned with by political parties in formulating their policies in the United Kingdom. Events in ireland had a strong influence. The young Lloyd George shared a platform withMichael Davitt in the 1880s. Cymru Fydd (New Wales), a society aimed atobtaining a national legislature for Wales, was formed after the 1886 Parlia-mentary election, when Wales rallied to Gladstone and Home Rule. Dis-establishment and the land question, however, dominated Welsh politicalthinking to the exclusion of effective action to achieve self-government. Thesepressures moved the Government to extend measures of administrative de-centralisation. Following the creation of the Welsh Department of the Boardof Education in 1907, the Welsh Insurance Commission was set up in 1911 and a
Welsh Board of Health and Welsh Department in the Ministry of agriculture in 1919. During these years some Welsh Members of Parliament presented bills for a Welsh Parliament, but they were never taken up or pursued.122. From the middle of the eighteenth century economic developmentstransformed social life in many parts of Wales. These continued throughout the nineteenth century with the accompanying migration of peoples within the counties of Wales and from without. After the First World War these develop-ments ceased. Economic depression set in, with mass unemployment andemigration on a large scale. The traditional and young industrial societies bothbegan to disintegrate. There were ominous signs of a decline in organisedreligion, a steep fall in the number of Welsh speakers, political disillusionmentand industrial frustration. Faith in the Governments intentions and capacitycollapsed. The National Eisteddfod and the Welsh League of Youth strove torally the older cultural forces and, in the 1930s, a petition demanding equalstatus for Welsh and English in public life attracted 350,000 signatures. the welsh Nationalist Party laid the foundations of its organisation, issued itsperiodicals and organised conferences which were designed to demonstrate thedisregard of the Government for the plight of Welsh social life and the opinionof Welsh people. War and the preparations for war supervened, providing ameasure of economic relief for a country where the need for new political devices,for a Secretary of State for Wales or &quot;dominion status&quot;, were being more clearly expressed.the welsh economy123. The economic fortunes of Wales in the last two centuries have fluctuatedperhaps more sharply than those of other parts of the United Kingdom. Theperiod from 1760 to the First World War saw a great shift from a predominantlyagricultural economy to dependence on the metal and coal industries, in which more than one-third of the working population came to be employed. Between1851 and 1911, while the numbers living in rural areas declined, there was asurge of industrial activity and the population in Wales as a whole doubled from1-2 million to 2-4 million, with many workers entering the country from Englandand Ireland a migration which was to transform the structure of Welshsociety. Between the wars, by contrast, the effects of the economic depressionwere tragically pronounced in Wales. The number registered as unemployedrose to nearly one-tenth of the entire population, and from 1921 to 1939 netoutward migration averaged 25,000 a year. The position greatly improvedduring and after the Second World War. In the decade up to 1955 there was almost a return to boom conditions; hundreds of new enterprises were estab-lished, an ambitious programme of redevelopment was undertaken in the olderindustries and the rate of unemployment fell below 2 per cent. This was one of themost successful exercises in regional economic development undertaken in britain. Since that time, however, Wales has been troubled by sharply declininglabour needs in some of its main industries, including coal, steel and agriculture.Between 1960 and 1970 the numbers employed in the extractive group ofindustries (agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying) fell by almosthalf, from 138,000 to 70,000. As a result the rate of unemployment in Wales has remained well above that in the United Kingdom as a whole, and above thatin each of the regions of England except the North1.1 See footnote on page 139.
124. Wales is still one of the areas of the United Kingdom most in need offaster economic growth. While there has been a marked increase in mami-facturing industry, which now employs more than one-third of the Welsh labour force, this has not been enough to offset the loss of jobs in older industries.The run-down of employment in the coal and steel industries affects most seriously the industrial areas of south and north-east Wales, where furtherdiversification of industry is needed. Elsewhere in Wales there are similar problems of unemployment or depopulation, heightened in some areas byrelative remoteness from main centres of population. The most serious aspect of the present situation is the decline in jobs for men. Despite the efforts of successive governments to attract new industry into Wales, the number of maleemployees in employment fell from 670,000 in 1960 to 608,000 in 1970.125. The rate of economic growth in Wales will continue to depend heavily on the level of economic activity in Great Britain as a whole. A substantial proportion of the industrial expansion in Wales since the war has resulted fromthe entry of new manufacturing enterprises, including aircraft, chemicals,electronics, motor vehicles and synthetic fibres, which have helped to create amore broadly-based economy. By the end of 1965 establishments set up in wales since 1945 by firms originating elsewhere accounted for nearly one-thirdof the total and two-thirds of the growth of manufacturing employment, and thecontributions of immigrant firms appear to have been maintained at a similarlyhigh level in subsequent years. The indications are that most of the newmanufacturing industries rely very little on Wales for their supplies or theirmarkets. On the other hand manufacturing industries in other parts of britain are heavily dependent on sheet steel, tin plate, special fuels and water from wales and on the deep sea port and refineries of Milford Haven and Llandarcy foroil supplies. Also, with improving communications, industrial areas of North andSouth Wales have inevitably been brought into a closer relationship withneighbouring parts of England, particularly in the Severnside and Deesideareas. There is in general an intricate pattern of economic integration andinterdependence between Wales and the rest of Britain, and the links betweenindustry and industrial development within and outside Wales are bound toremain very strong.the welsh people126. The distinctions which can be made between the people and way of life in Wales and those in the rest of the United Kingdom are now less sharp thanthey used to be. Almost within living memory Wales might have been described as a land of small communities, most of them naturally Welsh-speaking, wherepeople felt a strong sense of belonging to the local mine or steel-mill, to theirchosen church or chapel, to the scattered rural community or village, to theirsmall town or valley. These loyalties strengthened resolution in sustaining whatwas for most people, on the land or in industry, a life of no little hardship.This experience, hardened in the inter-war years, and the traditions which itengendered have left their marks, though the circumstances of people in Walestoday are for the most part much altered.127. Changes have been brought about mainly by economic necessity and by developing communications of all kinds. Few workers in the valleys now walkto local pits at the beginning of their shifts; many travel by car or bus to distantcoal-mines, or to factories and trading estates usually with managements from
outside Wales which are situated well away from their homes. Small farms aredisappearing through amalgamation, the spread of forestry or the demands of mineral prospecting. In the holiday areas the volume of visitors from outsideWales grows and there is a constantly increasing flow of retired people from england. Wales is experiencing the full impact of the anglicising influence of radio and television. The considerable migration into as well as out of wales has been exercising a cumulative effect over the years, increasing the numbers ofinhabitants of non-Welsh origin and reducing the proportion of those bred inthe Welsh tradition.128. This is not to say that the Welsh way of life is dead. But it has come under pressures which have tended to confine its fuller expression to the westernhalf of Wales and smaller enclaves elsewhere. A particularly sharp divisionwithin Wales can be seen from Census statistics relating to the Welsh language.In 1971 the proportion of the enumerated population aged three or over ableto speak Welsh in the five counties of Anglesey, Caernarvon, Merioneth,Cardigan and Carmarthen (that is, the whole of western Wales except the county of Pembroke, where a substantial anglicised settlement had been established inNorman times) averaged over 65 per cent. In no other county of Walesdid the proportion reach half that figure. It is not without significance also thatin the polls held in Welsh counties and county boroughs in 1968 to determine whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays, the same fivecounties, but no other part of Wales, elected to remain &quot;dry&quot;. The teachings ofnonconformity and an instinctive resistance to the forces of uniformity still havea notable influence on behaviour, particularly where Welsh speakers are foundin relatively strong numbers.129. There have always been geographical obstacles to cohesion in Wales.Road and rail communications are much better in an east-west direction,linking Wales with England, than between north and south, at which extremesthe main centres of industry and population are situated and the pull of adjacentEnglish centres is felt. The strains imposed by these physical factors on the unity of Wales, however, have been amply countered by the growth and stability oflarge-scale Welsh institutions which have helped to foster and maintain a strongsense of community.130. Generalisations about a people are difficult to make and usuallyunsatisfactory, but it seems true that as one moves eastward and southwardthrough Wales, the &quot;Welshness&quot; of the people, though it undergoes subtlechanges, persists. Despite divisions and gradations, there remain a strong sense of Welsh identity, a different way of looking at things and a distinct feeling thatthe needs and interests of people in Wales must be considered separately fromthose of people elswhere in the United Kingdom.recent developments in governmentDecentralisation of government departments131. During and after the Second World War the process of administrativedecentralisation, which had virtually come to a halt in 1919, was renewed. In1940 the Welsh Board of Health, already concerned with health, national insurance and poor law matters, took over responsibility for housing, water supplies, loan sanctions, provisional orders and other local government services.
Other government departments opened offices in Wales and by 1945 there werefifteen such offices. In that year also the Government set up the Conference of heads of Government Offices in Wales to improve liaison between departmentaloffices, to review the general execution of government policies in Wales as awhole, and to prepare an annual report on government action in Wales. In1965, as part of the economic planning machinery established for the whole ofGreat Britain, the Welsh Planning Board, made up of representatives of the welsh Office and of the main departments concerned with economic planning,was appointed to co-ordinate administrative action on matters of economic interest.Advisory bodies132. There was also an increase in the number and standing of advisorybodies formed to make known Welsh views on matters of concern to theGovernment. In 1942 the Welsh Reconstruction Advisory Council was set upto advise on problems likely to be encountered in the post-war period. TheEducation Act 1944 provided for the appointment of a Central AdvisoryCouncil for Education for Wales, and in 1948 an order under the same Actestablished the Welsh Joint Education Committee, a unique committee of localeducation authorities with executive as well as advisory functions. In 1949 theCouncil for Wales and Monmouthshire, made up originally of representatives oflocal authorities and other bodies in Wales and three members nominated bythe Prime Minister, was appointed with the task of securing that the Govern-ment were &quot;adequately informed of the impact of government activities on thegeneral life of the people of Wales&quot;. The Council published a series of memoranda on Welsh problems and continued in being until 1966, when its economic work was taken over by the Welsh Economic Council. This in itsturn was replaced in 1968 by the Welsh Council, with wider terms of reference,covering both cultural and economic matters and promotional as well asadvisory functions. In the same period other government-appointed bodies were set up to carry out particular executive functions in Wales or to provide expert advice on matters of Welsh concern.Welsh legislation133. While Wales was thus increasingly looked upon as a separate area for administration, this did not apply to any great degree to legislation. The onlyActs relating exclusively to Wales which were passed by Parliament in the post-war period up to 1971 were concerned with the Welsh language and Welshcultural institutions. The Elections (Welsh Forms) Act 1964 provided for the useof Welsh on election forms and, following the recommendations of the HughesParry Committee1, the Welsh Language Act 1967 paved the way for theremoval of restrictions on the use of the Welsh language in official documents and in the administration of justice in Wales. The Eisteddfod Act 1959, theLlangollen International Musical Festival Act 1967 and the Welsh NationalOpera Company Act 1971 enabled all Welsh county borough and county district councils to contribute from rate funds to the support of the institutions named.Ministerial responsibilities134. There were significant developments in the allocation of ministerial responsibility for Welsh affairs. In October 1951 the office of Minister for1 Report on the Legal Status of the Welsh Language (Cmnd. 2785).
Welsh Affairs was created, and this was held by the Home Secretary until, in1957, it was transferred to the Minister of Housing and Local Government.Between those years there had been a resurgence of the demand for a Secretaryof State who would be concerned solely with the affairs of Wales and would exercise a range of responsibilities comparable to that of the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. This was recommended in 1957 by the Council for Wales andMonmouthshire1, following a study of government administration in Wales.The government of the day, however, did not think that Wales would be&quot;ideally served by a copy, on half scale, of the existing system of government inScotland&quot;2. It therefore did not accept the CounciFs main recommendation,but appointed instead a Minister of State to assist the Minister for welsh affairs and introduced other measures aimed at strengthening Welsh administra-tion. It was not until October 1964 that, in fulfilment of an election promise,a Secretary of State for Wales was included in the Government.present government arrangementsDepartmental arrangements135. At the outset the executive functions of the Secretary of State were thosewhich had been administered by the Welsh Office of the Ministry of housing and Local Government, mainly town and country planning, housing, water,sewerage and other local government matters, together with economic planning and the responsibilities for roads in Wales formerly exercised by the Minister ofTransport. In addition, the Secretary of State was authorised to exercise &quot;over-sight within Wales of the execution of national policy by the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Education and Science, theMinistry of Health, the Ministry of Transport, the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Labour&quot;3. In later stages the Welsh Office took over direct respon-sibility for the health service, forestry and agriculture (jointly with the Ministryof Agriculture), ancient monuments, tourism, child care and primary and secondary education in Wales and for financing the National Museum and national Library of Wales.136. With the growing range of functions the staff of the Welsh Officeincreased from 225 in October 1964 to 990 in December 1972. All but a small number needed to man an office in London are located in Cardiff. Most other government departments have offices, varying in size and status, in Wales.Nearly one half of the identifiable expenditure of government departments andlocal authorities in Wales in 1971-72 fell within the responsibility of theSecretary of State. For Wales, as for Scotland, procedures have been devised which enable the Secretary of State both to adjust his own programme ofpublic expenditure to take account of the special circumstances and needs of wales and to take a view of the Welsh parts of other Ministers&apos; programmes.137. For Wales, as for other parts of Great Britain, the government has,as we have seen, set up a variety of bodies with executive, advisory or appellatefunctions. Some are appointed wholly or partly by the Secretary of State andothers by other Ministers or agencies in consultation with him.1 Council for Wales and Monmouthshire Third Memorandum (Cmnd. 53), January,1957.2 Government Administration in Wales (Cmnd. 334), December, 1957.3 House of Commons, Official Report, 19th November, 1964, Vol. 702, Col. 624.
138. Government responsibilities in Wales, therefore, are carried out by the welsh Office, by other government departments, most of them with offices in wales and with execution of national policy in Wales subject to oversightby the Secretary of State, or by or with the advice of various appointed bodies.These arrangements are similar to those in Scotland, except that, as shown inthe comparative statement in Table 5.1, the Secretary of State for Wales has anarrower field of executive responsibilities than the Secretary of State forScotland.Table 5.1EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SECRETARIES OF STATEFOR SCOTLAND AND wales the following list is not comprehensive, but the main functional headings are shown.

Wales is represented in the House of Commons by 36 Members1, a littleunder 6 per cent, of the total. There is no separate peerage of Wales, but thereare many Welsh holders of peerages of the United Kingdom.1 For a comparison with the representation of other parts of the United Kingdom, seefootnote on page 31. For the distribution of the Welsh seats among the political parties ingeneral elections since 1945, see Appendix B.
140. It is the practice to provide one day in each Parliamentary session for a debate in the House of Commons on Welsh affairs. This is usually based on a motion to take note of the annual White Paper on Wales and enables members to discuss government policy and action over the whole field of administration in Wales. Welsh affairs are also debated at sittings of the Welsh Grand Com-mittee, established in 1960 to consider &quot;specified matters relating exclusively to wales and Monmouthshire&quot;. There is provision for Bills relating exclusively to wales to be examined by a Welsh Standing Committee of the House ofCommons, but such Bills, as we have already noted, are rare. We examine the composition and working of these committees in Chapter 22.Local government141. It was recognised soon after the last war that local government in Walesstood in need of reform. The structure that existed, with thirteen county councils,four county borough councils and 164 county district councils, was thought toinclude too many small and poor authorities for the efficient and economicalmanagement of local affairs. Various proposals for reform were put forward inthe period up to 1971, and the eventual shape of local government reorganisationwas determined by the Local Government Act 1972, which applies to Englandand Wales. For the whole of Wales the Act provides for a two-tier system of localgovernment, consisting of eight counties and thirty-seven districts, to take effect from 1st April 1974. Populations are between 200,000 and 450,000 in all buttwo of the new counties, and between 40,000 and 100,000 in most of the newdistricts. The main functions of the new county councils will be highways and traffic management, the fire service, education, youth employment, the social services and consumer protection, and of the new district councils, housing,refuse collection and public cleansing, clean air and other functions concernedwith the protection and improvement of local amenities. Responsibility fortown and country planning, recreation and some other matters will be sharedbetween county and district councils. At the local level, provision is made for about 1,000 community councils, with substantially the same functional respon-sibilities as the existing parish councils, which they will replace.142. Areas and electoral arrangements are to be reviewed by a permanentLocal Government Boundary Commission for Wales, established by the Act.The Act is concerned only with local government and does not touch on any changes that may be made in arrangements for the government of Wales as awhole. On that issue the Government stated in a consultative document1published in February 1971 that it would be wrong to take decisions until this commission had completed its work. Meanwhile, the Welsh Council, appointedby the Secretary of State, would continue in being.the situation in brief143. In Wales, despite its long-standing political union with England, therehas been kept alive, and indeed during the last hundred years asserted more strongly, a sense of separate Welsh identity. This has been recognised by succes-sive governments, which have gone a long way in decentralising administrativeprocesses and setting up advisory and other machinery to take account ofparticular Welsh circumstances. There are very few economic, social and cultural1 The Reform of Local Government in Wales.
questions affecting Wales which are not either the direct or the very closeconcern of the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office, and for many of thesequestions means have been devised for seeking a wide expression of Welshviews. But, as in Scotland, the increasingly close economic and social ties with england have alerted many people in Wales to the danger of losing theirseparate identity and led them to question whether the welfare and distinctiveculture of their country might best be safeguarded and promoted by institutionalchange.
NORTHERN IRELAND144. With a land area of about 5,000 square miles and a population at the1971 Census of 1,536,065, more than a third in the Belfast area, NorthernIreland is smaller than either Scotland or Wales. Yet, unlike any other part ofthe United Kingdom, it had, until they were suspended in March 1972, a parliament and a Government of its own. This came about in 1920, not becauseregional government was held to be right in itself, but as part of what was intended to be a general settlement of the Irish problem. But other parts of thesettlement were not implemented in the way that was planned, and today,more than fifty years later, that problem is far from being resolved, and thereremain deep-rooted and violent conflicts about constitutional authority and theway it is exercised in Northern Ireland. To understand the nature of the problem,which is at the heart of any enquiry into Northern Ireland&apos;s constitution, it isnecessary to go back far beyond the Act of Union of 1800 which linked GreatBritain and Ireland in the United Kingdom.historical background the early history145. Ireland or parts of it first came under the control of England in the twelfth century following invasion by Henry II. There followed a long periodof what was in effect colonial administration. By the end of the thirteenthcentury there was an Irish Parliament, but it was confined to the Englishsettlers, and.the native Irish were not represented. Moreover the King ofEngland, as Lord of Ireland, assumed and exercised the power of makingordinances for the country and applying English statutes to it. A &quot;home rule&quot;gesture in 1468, when an Act of the Irish Parliament declared that Englishstatutes were valid in Ireland only if ratified by the Irish Parliament, was soondefeated. Henry VII despatched Sir Edward Poynings to Ireland to reduce itto a &quot;whole and perfect obedience&quot;, and in 1494 the Irish Parliament wascoerced into passing the Act known as Poynings&apos; Law, which provided that allIrish Bills must be submitted to the King and his Council in England, wherethey might be approved, with or without modification, or suppressed.146. English authority in those early years was at its strongest in the Pale,an area around Dublin, and hardly existed at all in the province of Ulster inthe north, where powerful chiefs ensured that the old Gaelic customs lived on.At the end of the sixteenth century attempts were made under Elizabeth I toextend English sovereignty into Ulster. These met with resistance, which was finally overcome in 1603. The flight to the continent of the most powerful ofthe Ulster chiefs provided an opportunity for declaring their lands forfeit tothe Crown, and a scheme for the settlement of those lands by colonists was drawn up. The &quot;plantation&quot; by substantial numbers of Scottish and Englishsettlers began soon afterwards and in time transformed the character of Ulster.Unlike the native Irish, who were Catholics, the Scots settlers were Presbyteriansand the English were Anglicans. The defeat of the Catholic King James II byhis successor, William of Orange, at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, stillcelebrated as a public holiday in Northern Ireland, considerably strengthened
the position of Protestants in Ireland, as elsewhere. The substantial numbersof the native Irish who remained in Ulster after the plantation had little share in the growing prosperity which new methods of farming and new industriesbrought, and until Catholic emancipation in the nineteenth century they had noinfluential part in politics.147. Although from time to time attempts had been made by the IrishParliament to secure a greater degree of autonomy, at the end of the seventeenthcentury it was still subject to Poynings&apos; Law and thus effectively under the controlof the authorities in England. When, however, negotiations for Parliamentaryunion between England and Scotland were initiated at the beginning of theeighteenth century and Irish Protestants sought to have Ireland included on similar terms, this was not acceptable to English interests. The Irish again soughta greater say in their own affairs, and in 1782 the legislative independence of theIrish Parliament was recognised. An Act of that Parliament in 1793 permittedRoman Catholics to vote in Parliamentary elections, though they could still notbe elected to sit, and Parliament remained a purely Protestant body.148. The disabilities suffered by Catholics as a result of their exclusion from political power naturally produced discontent. Open dissatisfaction with theGovernment, however, first manifested itself amongst the Presbyterians in thenorth, who suffered disadvantages by comparison with the Anglicans. inspired by radical ideas and the spirit of the French Revolution, the Society of UnitedIrishmen was formed with the object of reforming what was regarded as acorrupt and unrepresentative Parliament and of &quot;uniting Irishmen of allreligions against the unjust influence of Great Britain&quot;. Repressive measures were adopted to contain the movement, and in 1798 an unsuccessful rebellionwhich started in the north added impetus to moves which had already begun in Britain towards Parliamentary union between Great Britain and Ireland.Proposals for union were put before the Irish Parliament in 1799, and at firstwere defeated. By 1800, however, changes in membership and a great deal ofbribery led to a majority for union and an Act of Union was passed. Thisprovided for the abolition of the Irish Parliament and for Irish representation in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. Catholic emancipation was made more acceptable to Protestants by the consideration that in the United kingdom parliament there would be no possibility of Catholic domination.After the Act of Union149. The lack of agreement before 1800 on the desirability of union soonreappeared after it was effected. By 1830 demands were being made in ireland for the repeal of the Act and for reforms within Ireland which would benefit the Catholic majority, including disestablishment of the Church of Ireland,reform of the land laws and provision of a wide measure of national education.These demands, particularly those for the repeal of the Act of Union, wereresisted by Protestants in Ireland, the great majority of whom were thedescendants of the seventeenth century settlers in Ulster. They feared that undera revived Irish Parliament they would be an oppressed minority in a Catholic-dominated Ireland. The links between religion and politics, which had theirorigin principally in the plantation, were thus strengthened; as a general ruleProtestants were in favour of continuing the union and Catholics were against it.
150. In the middle of the nineteenth century a major natural disaster, thedestruction of the potato crop by blight, had its effects on all aspects of Irish life.The dependence in many areas on this single crop was so great that its failurehad devastating results. Starvation and migration so reduced the populationthat by the end of the century it was down to four million, only half of what ithad been before the famine. Many in Ireland were convinced that the measuresof famine relief adopted by the British Government were inadequate, and thisgave a new element of bitterness to Irish nationalism. After a period of stagna-tion following the famine, a movement dedicated to the overthrow of Britishpower by force of arms was established and was responsible for acts of violenceboth in Ireland and in England.151. The aim of the constitutional nationalists had by that time become a form of home rule, in which an Irish Parliament would deal with Irish affairs,while Westminster, with Irish representation, would continue to deal with &quot;all questions affecting the imperial Crown and Government&quot;. This aim they pressedvigorously at Westminster. Irish Members began systematically to obstruct allParliamentary business in the House of Commons, a tactic which put the Irishhome rule issue in the forefront of British politics. In the general election of1885 home rule candidates took 85 of the 100 Irish seats and effectively held thebalance of power between the Liberal Government and the conservative opposition. Gladstone^ first Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1886, but manyof his own members joined the Conservatives in voting against it and it was defeated. In the ensuing general election the Conservatives were returned to power. They allied themselves more closely with the cause of maintaining theUnion, and on a visit to Belfast in 1886 Lord Randolph Churchill made thestatement, often quoted, in regard to home rule that &quot;Ulster will fight, andUlster will be right&quot;. The settlement of the Irish question thus became a partymatter.152. Attempts to provide home rule continued. After the return to power ofthe Liberals, a new Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1893. This was passed inthe House of Commons but defeated in the House of Lords. The first organisedforce against home rule was established by Ulster Unionists in this period, but with the defeat of the Bill interest naturally declined. When, however, in theearly 1900s there again appeared to be a likelihood of home rule legislation,Ulster Unionists made it clear that they would resist it at all costs. In 1912 a&quot;solemn league and covenant&quot; (or a declaration in similar terms) was signed in belfast by almost half a million people, who bound themselves to use &quot;all meanswhich may be found necessary&quot; to defeat the home rule movement; and it was clear from the preparations of the Unionist supporters that this included armed force. A Home Rule Bill was nevertheless passed by the Parliament at West-minster in 1914, though with the advent of war it was not put into effect. Duringthe war a group of separatists in Ireland determined that the country&apos;s independ-ence should be asserted by force of arms, and the leaders of the Easter Rebellionin Dublin in 1916 issued a proclamation declaring an Irish Republic. The rebel-lion failed, but the execution of all the signatories of the proclamation mobilisedIrish public opinion in support of their cause and, it is widely agreed, made a conciliatory settlement the more difficult to achieve.
home ruleThe 1920 Act153. In 1914 a Bill had been introduced providing for the exclusion of partsof Ulster by county option from the operation of the Home Rule Act. a white Paper in 1916 proposed the exclusion of the nine counties of Ulster.But neither proposal involved the establishment of a separate legislature inthe excluded part. In 1920 for the first time legislation was introduced embodyinga proposal for two Parliaments, one for Southern Ireland and one for NorthernIreland, which was defined as the six counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down,Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone and the two boroughs of Belfast andLondonderry. This reached the statute book as the Government of Ireland Act1920. The Ulster Unionist Party reluctantly acquiesced in it as the only means bywhich union with Great Britain could be maintained.154. Under the Act, the whole of Ireland was to continue within the UnitedKingdom and to be represented in, and be subject to, the supreme authority ofthe Parliament of the United Kingdom. But wide powers were devolved to thetwo Parliaments which the Act established. Partition was intended to be only temporary. An official summary of the Act made this clear by stating that&quot;Although at the beginning there are to be two Parliaments and two Govern-ments in Ireland, the Act contemplates and affords every facility for unionbetween North and South, and empowers the two Parliaments by mutual agreement and joint action to terminate partition and to set up one parliament and one Government for the whole of Ireland. With a view to the eventualestablishment of a single Parliament, and to bringing about harmonious actionbetween the two Parliaments and Governments, there is created a bond of union in the meantime by means of a Council of Ireland which is to consistof twenty representatives elected by each Parliament and a President nominated by the Lord Lieutenant&quot;.155. This Council of Ireland never met. The degree of independence conferred by the 1920 Act did not satisfy the South and the Irish Republican Armycarried on a guerrilla campaign in an attempt to ensure the severance of alllinks between Britain arid Ireland. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 conferreddominion status on Southern Ireland as the Irish Free State and it thus ceased to be part of the United Kingdom. The Parliament of Northern Ireland was empowered to choose whether Northern Ireland should or should not be partof the Irish Free State, and its decision was that it should not. The Irish FreeState (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1922, a Westminster Act, provided thatthe 1920 Act should cease to apply to any part of Ireland other than NorthernIreland. The Irish Free State, however, asserted a claim to jurisdiction over thewhole of Ireland, and the constitutional position of Northern Ireland has never been formally recognised in the South.The 1949 Act156. The Irish Republic, as it had by then become, left the commonwealth in 1948, and the Ireland Act, passed by Westminster in 1949, recognised itsstatus as an independent republic. The Act also included a declaration that northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and that in no event
would Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of Your Majesty&apos;sdominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the NorthernIreland Parliament.Transferred and reserved matters157. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 remained the basic statute onwhich the constitution of Northern Ireland depended up to the time of itssuspension in 1972. Under the Act the Parliament of Northern Ireland wasgiven power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of theprovince and responsibility for all matters other than those specifically reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The latter were normally referred toas &quot;reserved&quot;1 matters, as distinct from the &quot;transferred&quot; matters for which the parliament of Northern Ireland was responsible, and we shall follow thisconvention.158. The main reserved subjects were matters relating to the Crown, themaking of peace and war, the armed services, foreign and commonwealth relations, elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, dignities andtitles, treason, aliens, naturalisation, trade with places outside NorthernIreland, merchant shipping, wireless telegraphy, aerial navigation, coinage,trade marks, copyrights, patents, the Supreme Court of Judicature of NorthernTreland, the postal services, customs and excise, income tax and any tax onprofits. The United Kingdom Parliament, the supreme authority of which waspreserved by Section 75 of the Act, also had power to legislate on any trans-ferred matter, though in practice for a period of more than fifty years itrefrained from doing so except at the request and with the consent of theGovernment of Northern Ireland.The Northern Ireland Parliament159. The Parliament established by the 1920 Act was bicameral. There wasa House of Commons of 52 Members elected by the people of Northern Ireland,and a Senate consisting of the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of londonderry and 24 Members elected by the House of Commons by a systemof proportional representation. The procedures of the Parliament, which sat atStormont, near Belfast, were modelled on those at Westminster. Parliamentcontinued for five years unless sooner dissolved. Elections did not coincide with those to the House of Commons at Westminster. Every general election,from the first in 1921, produced a majority for the Unionist Party, which inconsequence always formed the Government and had a majority also in the senate.The Executive160. In respect of the transferred matters, the Act provided for executive powers to be exercised by a Government of Northern Ireland. At the head ofthis Government was the Governor, appointed by the Crown, who exercisedthe executive powers of the Crown in respect of all matters falling within the sphere of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland. He summoned,prorogued and dissolved Parliament, and appointed the members of the Privy1 The Act distinguished between &quot;excepted&quot; matters and &quot;reserved&quot; matters, the latter being intended to be later transferred to an all-Ireland Parliament; but it became the practice to use the term &quot;reserved&quot; for both &quot;excepted&quot; and &quot;reserved&quot; matters.
Council of Northern Ireland and Ministers to such government departments asthe Parliament of Northern Ireland established. All these actions were taken onthe advice of Ministers, so that the Governor acted in relation to NorthernIreland Ministers much as would a constitutional monarch, though he was required to do so within the limits of instructions received from the UnitedKingdom Government. At the time of the suspension of the constitution in 1972there were nine departments the Prime Minister^ Department and the ministries of Finance, Home Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce, Education,Development, Health and Social Services and Community Relations. these departments were headed by Cabinet Ministers, who under the Act had to be members of the Northern Ireland Parliament or become Members within sixmonths of appointment. There is a separate Northern Ireland civil service,with pay and conditions of service similar to those of the United Kingdomcivil service.Representation at Westminster161. Northern Ireland returns twelve members to the House of Commons atWestminster1. Up to 1972 little Northern Ireland domestic business was con-ducted there, and there were no Northern Ireland Committees of the Housecomparable to the Scottish and Welsh Committees. The Home Secretary wasthe United Kingdom Minister charged with responsibility for Northern Irelandaffairs.Financial arrangements162. The 1920 Act required Northern Ireland to make a contribution towardsthe cost of services such as defence and overseas representation. This &quot;imperial contribution&quot; was determined annually by a Joint Exchequer Board, which hadone representative each of the Treasury and the Northern Ireland Ministry ofFinance and an independent chairman appointed by the Crown. Under the ActNorthern Ireland&apos;s revenues were to be derived partly from transferred taxes,those imposed by the Northern Ireland Parliament, and partly from what was known as the residuary share of reserved taxation. The latter was NorthernIreland&apos;s share of reserved taxes, such as income tax and customs and excise duties, imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament, after deduction of theimperial contribution and the cost of reserved services operated in NorthernIreland by the United Kingdom Government.Local government163. The pattern of local government in Northern Ireland in 1920 was substantially the same as in England and Wales. There were the two county boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, which were all-purpose authorities,and six counties, further subdivided into boroughs and urban and rural districts. Local authorities in Northern Ireland have never exercised policepowers or, except in Belfast, provided fire services, and some of the duties imposed on local authorities in Great Britain since 1920 civil defence, youthemployment and some general health services are examples have in NorthernIreland remained with the Government. In 1971 housing functions were trans-ferred to a central housing authority. Generally speaking, however, at the time The question of the representation in the House of Commons of regions with subordinatelegislatures is discussed in paragraphs 811-815.
of our enquiries the pattern of local government in Northern Ireland was similar to that in England and Wales and, as there, it was undergoing radicalreview.164. In May 1970 a Local Government Review Body, under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Macrory, reported. The Northern Ireland Government acceptedits recommendation that most of the major local government functions, suchas education, health, welfare and child care, planning, roads and traffic manage-ment, public road passenger transport and fire services, should in future be vested in the Government itself. These changes are being made. In the case ofboth education and the personal social services, local administration will bein the hands of appointed area boards, five for education and four for the personal services.the northern ireland economy165. The three traditional industries on which the economy of the provincehas principally been based are agriculture, textiles (notably linen) and ship-building. Employment in all three has declined greatly since the war. agriculture is still the largest employer. The climate has favoured the development of an intensive livestock industry, with greater dependence on pigs and poultrythan in Great Britain. Farms are on average smaller. About 52,000, or 9 percent, of the total in civil employment, are now employed in agriculture,compared with 95,000 twenty years ago. During the same period employmentin textiles, where there has been a considerable change from the traditionallinen to man-made and other fibres, has fallen from 75,000 to 43,000; and in shipbuilding it has fallen from 24,000 to 10,000.166. Unemployment levels have been significantly above the United Kingdomaverage1, and the problem has been aggravated by the decline of the tradi-tional industries. In April 1973 7-1 per cent, of the insured population wasunemployed, compared with 5-4 per cent, in Scotland, 4-4 per cent, in wales and 3-1 per cent, in the United Kingdom as a whole. The figure for Belfastwas 5-4 per cent.; the highest unemployment is generally to be found in the lessindustrialised areas furthest from the city. The higher unemployment ratesmay not, however, be the full measure of the problem, since there are probablymany persons (such as married women and retired people) who, though notregistered as unemployed, would take employment if it were available.167. Average earnings for manual workers in Northern Ireland are also lower than for the United Kingdom as a whole; in October 1972 average earningswere 88 per cent, of the United Kingdom average for men and 80 per cent, forwomen. These differences in earnings are in part due to differences in industrial structure, with a smaller proportion of skilled workers in Northern Ireland.This factor, together with the higher level of unemployment and the larger proportion of the population engaged in agriculture, has meant that averageincome per head has been consistently a good deal lower than in the UnitedKingdom as a whole; in 1971 it was 77 per cent, of the United kingdom average.168. The strengthening of the economy of the province has always beengiven the highest priority by both the Northern Ireland and United kingdom See footnote on page 139.
Governments. In 1932 the Northern Ireland Parliament passed the first of aseries of Acts dealing with industrial development, and after the war it began to make more extensive use of its powers in this field. Some of the legislation was on lines parallel to that in Great Britain, while some was peculiar to northern Ireland. By agreement between the two Governments, because ofits particularly high unemployment level and its vulnerability to economicrecession, Northern Ireland has offered greater incentives to new industryand to the expansion of existing industry than the development areas of GreatBritain. Great importance has also been attached to industrial training. By these measures, about 80,000 new jobs have been created since the war, a figureequivalent to 46 per cent, of the total employment in manufacturing industry.Many entirely new industries have become established, including syntheticfibres, electronic and electrical goods, automobile and aero-engine components and rubber products. This new growth has not, however, been sufficient to counteract the decline in employment in the existing industries; and the diffi-culties have been added to by an increase in population proportionately a gooddeal higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom, though its effect on thelabour market has to some extent been reduced by emigration.169. In general the economic life of Northern Ireland is closely linked withthat of Great Britain. In 1971 73 per cent, by value of the imports and 87 percent, of the exports consisted of trade with Great Britain. Trade with the irish republic is of relatively small importance, representing in 1971 only about10 per cent, of the total.home rule in practiceHow practice has differed from theory170. The brief account we have given of the main provisions of the 1920Act would, taken by itself, give a misleading picture of the working of home rule in Northern Ireland. The world in which the home rule ideas were to operate was very different from the one in which they were conceived. The Actwas passed at a time when it was still possible to believe that, following the endof the First World War, both legislatures and governments would be able to limit their activities to those of the Edwardian era, the subject matter beingneatly divided into the great &quot;imperial&quot; issues on the one hand and purelydomestic matters, which could safely be left to a regional legislature, on theother. The Act was designed in this way, the &quot;imperial&quot; matters being reserved to Westminster and a contribution levied to pay for them, while nearly all othermatters were transferred to the Northern Ireland Parliament, which was tohave complete legal freedom to make of them what it wished and the independentfinance needed to underpin that freedom. But almost before the Act had comefully into force this dream had collapsed and the mounting crisis of unemploy-ment, in Northern Ireland as elsewhere, forced the state into activities whichhad hardly been known before the war, and started the long escalation ofexpenditure which has continued to the present.171. This collapse of the financial arrangements laid down in the 1920 Act,and its wider consequences for the working of the home rule provisions, owednothing to the peculiarities of the Northern Ireland situation, except to theextent that the province is a part of the United Kingdom, but by no means the
only part, which is unable to pay for its own domestic services out of the pro-ceeds of taxes collected there. Measures began to be devised soon after 1920to provide additional revenue for Northern Ireland. We give a full account ofthe development of the financial arrangements in Chapter 29. We merely notehere that the financial provisions outlined in paragraph 162 above representby themselves an incomplete and in some ways misleading picture of the flow of funds between the two exchequers. An important consequence of the wayarrangements developed was a reduction in Northern Ireland&apos;s freedom to pursue independent policies on transferred matters, since financial adjustmentwas inevitably accompanied by a degree of United Kingdom Treasury control which was certainly not contemplated when the Act was passed. The freeexercise of legislative powers was inhibited also by popular pressures for theadoption of standards in the public services no lower than those obtainingin other parts of the United Kingdom.The community problem172. These matters, which we later examine in greater detail, are relevant to a consideration both of a reform of the Northern Ireland constitution andof its possible application to other parts of the United Kingdom. But in NorthernIreland the constitution was placed under additional stresses stemming fromthe division of the population into two sharply distinct communities, a majority,predominantly Protestant and in favour of the maintenance of the union withGreat Britain, and a minority, predominantly Roman Catholic and opposedto the union. For the whole period of the existence of the Northern ireland parliament, politics in the province were dominated by this single issue.Parliamentary elections were concerned almost exclusively with it, and only those political parties whose position in relation to it were clearly definedwere able to attract substantial support. As a consequence the Unionist Party,with the support of the largely Protestant majority of voters who support theunion, had a comfortable majority in every general election to the NorthernIreland House of Commons and always provided the Government. Thealternation of political parties in power, an important feature of the Westminstersystem of government which was applied to Northern Ireland under the 1920Act, was not possible. Single party rule was the most notable feature of thegovernment of Northern Ireland, and much of the effort of the many people who have been concerned to devise constitutional reforms has been directed to circumventing the evils which flow, or might be thought to flow, from it.173. In later Parts of our Report -particularly in Part X we examine, inthe light of the evidence we received, the strengths and weaknesses of the formof devolution applied to Northern Ireland by the 1920 Act, distinguishing sofar as we can the factors which relate to the particular circumstances ofNorthern Ireland from those which have wider relevance. The general con-clusion we reach is that, despite the great difference between the theory ofhome rule and its practical application, and despite the special difficulties inherent in the Northern Ireland situation, in many fields notably thosewhich were unaffected, or at least were not dominated, by the communityproblem the home rule experiment had considerable success. And eventhough at all times the two communities remained largely separate and deeplysuspicious of each other, there were long periods of relative tranquillity whenthe argument between them, if not resolved, was at least conducted peaceably.
The tragedy of the disturbances which began in the summer of 1968, andwhich have continued during the whole of the time we have been sitting, is thatthey followed immediately upon one of the longest of these periods of quiet,when it was possible to hope that the traditional distrust was at last beingbroken down.Recent developments174. The developments in Northern Ireland since 1968 are so well known that it is unnecessary for us to chronicle them in any detail. In that year thereemerged a civil rights movement which sought to achieve universal adultsuffrage in local authority elections, the redrawing of electoral boundaries, the ending of unfair discrimination, in employment and housing, the repeal oflegislation providing for internment without trial and the disbandment of the ulster Special Constabulary. Though the movement&apos;s declared aim was to achieve its objects by non-violent means, in October 1968 there was a violentconfrontation with the police in Londonderry. This was followed by increasingdisorder in other parts of the province, and in August 1969, when it became apparent that the civilian police could not alone deal with the situation, requestswere made and granted for the deployment of the Army in aid of the civil power.175. The United Kingdom Government and Parliament thereafter became more directly involved in the affairs of Northern Ireland. Responsibility for allsecurity operations, including those carried out by the police, was assumed by the General Officer Commanding (Northern Ireland). The United KingdomGovernment re-affirmed the pledge that Northern Ireland would not cease tobe a part of the United Kingdom without the consent of its people, and theNorthern Ireland Government put in train a programme of radical reform.This included the abolition of the business vote in elections to the NorthernIreland House of Commons, universal adult suffrage in local government elections, the creation of a central housing authority responsible for all public authority house building, allocation and management, a new structure for thepolice, new machinery for the investigation of citizens&apos; grievances, including a parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and a Commissioner forComplaints, and the establishment of a Ministry of Community Relations anda Community Relations Commission. Proposals were also put forward for the reform of the Northern Ireland Parliament, providing in one way or anotherfor the greater participation in government by members of the Opposition,but in the absence of agreement they were not acted upon.176. None of these measures, nor the tightening of security, including theuse of internment without trial, sufficed to prevent the mounting violence anddeaths and injuries on a scale which exceeded even that of the 1920s.177. In discussions with the Northern Ireland Government in the early months of 1972, the United Kingdom Government put forward proposals forfurther action, including a referendum on the constitutional position of NorthernIreland, some reduction of internment, the appointment of a Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland and the transfer to Westminster of all statutory and executive responsibility for law and order. This last proposal was not accept-able to the Northern Ireland Government, and it announced its intention to resign. As a consequence in March 1972 the United Kingdom Parliamentenacted the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act, which effectively
vested in a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland all the powers formerlyexercised by the Northern Ireland Government. The Northern ireland parliament was prorogued, and the Parliament at Westminster assumed full responsibility for legislating for the province.178. The 1972 Act required annual renewal by Parliament and was so renewedin March 1973. In the meantime the United Kingdom Government had been engaged, in consultation with all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland, in anattempt to devise new arrangements for the government of the province whichwould enjoy the support and respect of the overwhelming majority of thepeople of Northern Ireland. In October 1972 it published a paper setting out some ideas as a basis for further discussion.179. On 8th March 1973, in accordance with the Northern Ireland (BorderPoll) Act 1972, the electors of Northern Ireland were invited to vote either forthe proposition that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UnitedKingdom or for the proposition that it should be joined with the Republic ofIreland, outside the United Kingdom. 591,820 electors, representing 57-4 percent, of the electorate, voted in favour of the first proposition, and 6,463 infavour of the second; the major opposition parties had advised their supportersnot to vote.180. In the same month the United Kingdom Government published its proposals for a new constitution for Northern Ireland, and legislation was laterenacted giving effect to them. In Chapter 30 we note the main features of thenew constitution.1 The future of Northern Ireland A paper for discussion. (This paper contains a ratherfuller account than we have given of the events since 1968.)
ENGLANDintroduction181. England, with an area of 50,000 square miles, is the largest of the four countries which make up the United Kingdom, of which it forms rather morethan half. It is two-thirds as big again as Scotland, more than six times the size of Wales and nearly ten times the size of Northern Ireland. In terms of population and economic wealth it occupies a still more dominant position.At the 1971 Census the population of England was 45,870,062, representingnearly 83 per cent, of the United Kingdom total. It is a highly developedcountry, in many places heavily industrialised and urbanised, and more densely populated than any other country in Europe with the exception of theNetherlands. It is, however, by no means uniform in terms of physical, socialor economic geography. In earlier chapters we have identified the main featureswhich distinguish Scotland and Wales from England. But just as we havedetected differences within Scotland and Wales, so it would be inaccurate to regard England for the purposes of comparison as homogeneous. There arewide variations in climate and in terrain, which despite the high general averageincludes large areas with low population densities. There are also social and cultural differences within England almost as great as those which distinguishEngland or its individual regions from the other countries which make up theUnited Kingdom.182. Close proximity to the mainland of the European continent has hada profound effect on the course of English history. We have already notedthat in early times the south-east was the part of the British Isles most opento invasion, and though the frontiers of England have remained intact for over 900 years, it has at all times been much concerned with and influenced by developments on the continent. This factor and its generally more equableclimate and terrain have combined to give it a disproportionately largerpopulation than is accounted for by its greater size.183. For many years the south-east of England in particular, which possessesin London the political, administrative and commercial centre of the UnitedKingdom, has been so naturally attractive to population and industry as torequire the adoption of special measures to order and restrain their growth.The south-east has not always been in so dominant a position. During the nineteenth century, the population of the counties which now form the SouthEast economic planning region fell from 33 to 28-5 per cent, of the GreatBritain total, though the percentage in London and the Home Counties a smaller area increased from 18 to 23-4. These figures reflect the growthduring that period of both London and the new industrial cities in the northand midlands.184. This latter development led to a considerable degree of provincialinitiative and independence in economic and political affairs. As in Wales,nonconformity and dissenting influences gave impetus to reform. A number ofdistinguished provincial political leaders emerged, such as Cobden and Brightin Manchester and Joseph Chamberlain in Birmingham, who were instrumental
in pushing through radical reforms with important political and socialimplications. It was then possible for such provincial leaders through their local achievements to establish themselves as national leaders. In the twentiethcentury it has become increasingly necessary for those aspiring to nationalstatus to be London-based, and, although the percentage of population inLondon and the Home Counties has changed very little, the population in thewhole of the south-east has increased to 31-6 per cent, of the Great Britaintotal.185. The increasing predominance of England within the United Kingdom,and of the South East region within England, has important consequences forthe matters with which we have been concerned. In Scotland and Wales it hasbeen a factor in promoting interest in the development of special arrangementsdesigned in one way or another to give the Scots and Welsh a greater share inthe determination of policies to be applied in those countries and in theirexecution. In England, on the other hand, there has been no correspondingdemand for purely English policies or for purely English institutions of govern-ment. There is no English nationalist movement. This is hardly surprising,since England is already governed from its capital city by people who are themselves mostly, though by no means exclusively, English. Indeed, theEnglish tend to use the terms &quot;England&quot; and &quot;English&quot; when they mean&quot;Britain&quot; and &quot;British&quot;, often to the annoyance of the Scots and Welsh.186. In these circumstances there is no need for us to include in this back-ground chapter on England information, comparable to that given in thechapters on Scotland and Wales, about the development of the English nation and the arrangements made for its government. For the most part the institutions of government in England are those which serve either Great Britain or theUnited Kingdom as a whole. The institutions which do exist to serve Englandalone are those whose responsibilities do not extend to either Scotland orWales because separate institutions have been created in those countries tomeet a Scottish or Welsh demand. The English generally have been content with this arrangement.187. In Chapters 4 and 5 we have noted the main features of the scottish and Welsh economies, with their need for new industry to counter unemploy-ment and emigration caused largely by the decline of the traditional heavy industries. By comparison the economy of England as a whole has flourished.While the outlying areas, notably the north-east and south-west, have experi-experienced problems very similar to those of Scotland and Wales, a large part ofEngland, comprising most of the area from south Lancashire and Yorkshireto the south coast, with in general a high degree of industrialisation andurbanisation, has at times fallen victim to the opposite kind of economicill. Here the problems have often been those arising from congestion andoverheating of the economy, with scarcity rather than surfeit of labour.Attempts to correct these ills have not always achieved desirable effects else-where, and corrective regional policies have been applied. When the general economic and employment situation is bad, national recovery hinges on the recovery of this industrial heart of England.188. The greater size and population of England has naturally resultedin a geographical decentralisation of government administration to a regional
or provincial level to a larger number of units and to an extent far greaterthan has been considered necessary within Scotland and Wales, where theScottish and Welsh Offices, operating from Edinburgh and Cardiff, can more readily maintain close contact with local authorities and other bodies. It is animportant part of our remit to examine the case for, and the possible methodsof, further devolution to this intermediate level in England. In this chapterwe describe briefly the steps that have already been taken in this direction. but before doing so it will be helpful to give some account of the reorganisation oflocal government itself.local government189. Before the reforms of the nineteenth century which produced the system that has endured until very recently, such local government as existed inEngland was provided in the boroughs by the self-appointed and often corruptmunicipal corporations, and elsewhere by the Justices of the Peace and later,as the sphere of government activity was extended, by authorities elected as required to deal with particular matters, such as poor law, education and health.As time went on there was increasing acceptance of the principle that, insteadof many bodies each responsible for its own service, there should be a generallocal authority responsible for all local services. The principle was appliedfirst in the towns; in 1835 the Municipal Corporations Act established a uniformsystem of councils elected on a property franchise in most of the charteredboroughs. The Local Government Act of 1888 extended the same principle to the counties, and by an Act of 1894 urban and rural district councils were established. As part of these reforms the functions of the specialist boardswere transferred to the new local authorities.190. But the principle of local authority responsibility for all services didnot long survive. Developments in means of transport, the spread of urbanpopulation and the emergence of new or more sophisticated services soonrequired concerted action over areas larger than that of a single authority.Non-elected statutory boards and commissions were appointed to deal withparticular services, and functions were transferred to them from the authorities.When, for example, the National Health Service was introduced after theSecond World War, responsibility for hospitals was transferred to regional hospital boards; and under current legislation other health services are beingtaken away from the local authorities and placed in the hands of appointedregional and area health authorities as part of a reorganisation of the national health Service. Similarly in a reorganisation of water services new regionalwater authorities are to take over virtually all the existing functions of public authorities, including the local authorities, responsible for water supply, quality and conservation and the sewerage services. Other functions have been lost to local authorities in much the same way.191. It became apparent after the last war that the structure of local govern-ment was in need of reform. There were too many authorities; many of them were too small in area and resources to provide services to the standardsrequired; the division of responsibilities between them was confusing andillogical; and the separation of town and country was unsatisfactory.192. A start was made in the 1950s with the government of Greater London,which, with a population of about 8 million concentrated in an area of 600 square
miles, presented problems of particular urgency. On the basis of proposals made by the Herbert commission, the London Government Act 1963, which came into force in 1965, established a two-tier system of government, with theGreater London Council as one tier and the thirty-two London borough councils as the other. These new authorities replaced the former Londonand Middlesex County Councils and various county, metropolitan and non-county borough councils and urban district councils, all of which had been involved in local government in the London area. It left substantially untouchedthe special arrangements for the government of the historically largelyindependent City of London.193. Functions were divided between the Greater London Council and theLondon boroughs. The former was charged with carrying out functions for thewhole area, such as strategic planning and development, including overspillhousing, the fire and ambulance services, main sewerage and drainage, majorroads and traffic management and control; most of the services provided bythe London Transport Board were later added. The boroughs were made responsible for the more local services such as health and welfare, refusecollection, most aspects of housing, minor roads and libraries. In the case ofeducation there was an unusual division of function, which came about becauseof a desire not to break up the unified education service which had been built up by the London County Council. Whereas the Herbert Commission had proposed that the boroughs should be the main education authorities, the Actprovided for that arrangement to apply only in the twenty outer boroughs. Forthe twelve inner boroughs (and the City of London), whose area correspondedto that of the old London County Council, the education function was entrusted to a new Inner London Education Authority, a statutory committee of theGreater London Council, consisting of Council members elected for the areasof the boroughs concerned together with representatives of the borough councils; the Authority was made practically autonomous in financial matters,being given power to determine the amount for which the Greater london council would precept on the inner boroughs for educational purposes andalso the amounts needed for capital expenditure.194. More recently steps have been taken to reorganise local governmentin the rest of England. Proposals for reform were presented in June 1969 inthe report of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission2, which recommended fifty-eight all-purpose local authorities for the whole of England outside greater london, except for the conurbations centred on Birmingham, Manchester and liverpool, for which a two-tier system of metropolitan and metropolitan districtauthorities was proposed.195. After lengthy public discussion of these proposals, legislation was introduced and has been enacted as the Local Government Act 1972. Thescheme of reorganisation set out in the Act differs in some important respects from the Commission^ proposals. It provides for a system of counties anddistricts throughout the country. In England outside Greater London, there Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London (Chairman,Sir Edwin Herbert later Lord Tangley) (Cmnd. 1164).2 Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England (Chairman,Lord Redcliffe-Maud) (Cmnd. 4040).
are to be forty-five counties, including metropolitan counties for the conur-nations of Merseyside, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire,South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear. The Act defines the counties (most ofwhich are to retain the old county names) and the metropolitan districts, butrecommendation of the district boundaries elsewhere was one of the first tasksentrusted to a new permanent Local Government Boundary Commission for england. Provision is made for the retention of parishes and parish councils in rural areas and for the establishment, on the basis of advice from the boundary Commission, of &quot;successor&quot; parish councils in areas of small boroughs and urban districts abolished by the Act. The reorganisation is to come intoeffect on 1st April 1974.196. County councils will be responsible for those functions which requireplanning over a wide area or need the support of substantial resources. district councils will be responsible for those functions which require administrationat the more local level. Thus, county councils&apos; functions will include the police and fire services, consumer protection, highways, and strategic decisions on land use planning and on transportation. District councils, which will be the rating authorities, will be responsible for housing, environmental health andmost aspects of planning and development control. The allocation of the major functions of education, libraries, youth employment and the personal social services differs between the metropolitan and the non-metropolitan areas.In the metropolitan areas the districts will in all cases be large enough in termsof population and resources to provide these services effectively; in the non-metropolitan areas they will be the responsibility of the county councils.Metropolitan county councils will be passenger transport authorities for their areas; outside the metropolitan areas the new district councils will take overlocal authority transport undertakings, but will be required to run them inaccordance with the county councifs transportation plans. In respect of somefunctions including aspects of town and country planning such as conservation,the provision of open spaces and recreational facilities, support for entertain-ments and the arts county and district councils will have concurrent powers,and all local authorities will have certain powers for the benefit and improvementof their areas. A major feature of the local government reorganisation provisionswill be the greater powers the new authorities will have to make flexible arrange-ments for the discharge of their functions through their own committees orstaff or by other local authorities.197. All councillors will be directly elected for four years, instead of threeas at present. County councillors will all be elected at the same time. In themetropolitan districts one-third of the councillors will be elected in each of thethree years between the county council elections, whereas the non-metropolitandistrict councils will be able to choose between whole council elections andelections by thirds. Councillors are not to be paid a salary, but may claim anattendance allowance. There will be no aldermen in the new authorities, and theoffice of alderman will be abolished also in the Greater London Council andthe London borough councils by order from convenient dates. Local authorities will, however, be able to resolve to confer the title &quot;honorary alderman&quot; onpersons considered to have rendered outstanding service to the community.Provision is also made to permit the preservation of a wide range of ancienttitles, dignities and traditions.
198. A recommendation of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission of particular interest to us was for the establishment of eight provincial councils, covering the whole of England, including Greater London, and with boundaries broadlyfollowing those of the existing economic planning regions. The councils wouldbe indirectly elected by the unitary and metropolitan authorities proposed by theCommission, and would include in addition some co-opted members amountingto 20-25 per cent, of the total. The key function of the councils would bestrategic land-use planning for the province; they would also have reserve powers to carry out certain tasks of interest to the province as a whole, and forthat purpose would be empowered to obtain revenue by precept on the mainauthorities. On these proposals the Government commented, in a White paper of February 19711, that there were functions of both central and local govern-ment that needed to be considered in a regional or provincial context, the mostimportant of which was the formulation of broad economic and land-usestrategy which would be the regional framework within which services wouldbe provided. The Government agreed with the Redcliffe-Maud commission that the regional or provincial area would be too large for the operation oflocal government services. While the reform of local government belowprovincial level need not be delayed, decisions on the constitution of anyregional bodies, and on the range of functions they might carry out in relationto both central and local government, would have to await the Report of this commission. In the meantime the Government would continue to pursue the preparation of regional strategies by the creation of teams comprising theStanding Conferences of Local Planning Authorities, the Regional economic planning Councils and the central government.history of english regionalismThe beginnings of a regional organisation199. England has always been a highly centralised state, in the sense that theexercise of central government powers has, with little exception, been conducteddirect from the centre and not by outposted agents of the government. Therehas, for example, been nothing comparable to the French prefect system.Although Justices of the Peace, who were mainly responsible for the administra-tion of justice and of such local services as existed outside the boroughs beforethe reforms of the nineteenth century, were appointed by the Crown, they werein no sense local outposts of the government. As local people they were ableto give administration a local flavour and to prevent the imposition of politicaland religious policies which did not command adequate support. Indeed, withthe notable exception of CromwelTs short-lived division of England and Walesinto eleven districts, over each of which he placed a Major-General with the function of enforcing the military dictatorship, there was very little decentralisation-tion of government until the First World War. The need to control the food supply and secure the best distribution of labour then provided the first majorstimulus for the setting up of regional offices of government departments.After the war regional offices were found to be useful for such matters asemergency planning to meet the housing shortgage and the administration ofthe developing social services.1 Local Government in England-Government Proposals for Reorganisation. (Cmnd. 4584).2 See paragraphs 994-999.
200. The Second World War, with its threat of a paralysing attack on the seat of central government, made still more imperative the development of an efficient regional organisation. England was divided into ten regions, each incharge of a Regional Commissioner vested with extensive powers enablinghim to co-ordinate civil defence activities in his region. The major governmentdepartments which did not already have regional organisations set them up sothat they could participate in these arrangements. Regional boards, consistingof the regional officers of government departments and, from 1940, representa-tives of each side of industry, were established to co-ordinate economicactivities. Although in the normal course officials in the regions were responsible to their own departments, for use in emergency the Regional Commissionerswere vested with extensive reserve powers enabling them to act as the executivegovernment of the region. This embryonic machinery of regional governmentwas never set in motion for the purpose for which it was designed since thecentral government was at no time put out of action. After the war theorganisation was disbanded and those few functions it had discharged werereabsorbed, since it was recognised that the concept, unprecedented in Englishhistory since the time of Cromwell, was not a popular one, particularly with thelocal authorities.Local authority co-operation201. Looking ahead to the problems of the post-war era the Barlow Corn-mission had concluded, in a report presented in 19401, that a regional formof government, accompanied by regional policies to ensure regional industrialdevelopment and diversification, would greatly facilitate the dispersal of population and industry from the congested conurbations. The Commissionsuggested the reform of local government along regional lines. This suggestion was not adopted. But after the war neighbouring local authorities began toco-operate in a way that they had not done before, particularly after the enactment of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. This co-operation,sometimes on a statutory basis and sometimes by voluntary agreement, has since been extended to the joint administration of services and the bulk-buyingof supplies, particularly in the education and housing fields. In the field of planning standing conferences of local planning authorities have been estab-lished, and have played an important part in the working out of regional plans,although responsibility for physical planning decisions has remained with theindividual local authorities and for national policy decisions on such matters as industrial location and public investment with the central government.Decentralisation of government departments202. The process of decentralisation of individual government departmentscontinued after the Second World War. The pace of development varied fromtime to time. There was no settled government policy in favour of regionalism,and there were indeed periods in which regional responsibilities and staffswere contracted in the interests of economy. But as time went on there tended to be growing recognition of the contribution which the decentralisation of departments and interdepartmental co-operation in the regions could make toefficient administration.1 Report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population(Chairman, Sir Montague Barlow) (Cmd. 6153).
203. There have been significant differences in departmental practice, bothin the extent of the use made of regional staffs and in the numbers and boun-daries of the regions themselves. Regional organisations were set up onfunctional lines, and boundaries selected for very different purposes naturallydid not coincide. In the early years after the war an attempt at standardisationwas made. Nine standard regions were denned, with which the departments were expected to conform in the interests of promoting interdepartmentalco-operation; departures from standard were permitted only if demanded bythe needs of efficient administration. But, as the written evidence submittedto us by the government departments indicates1, very many different regional organisations remain, reflecting the differing requirements of the various services. Even within a single department there may be a number of differentorganisations for different purposes. When the Department of the Environmentwas established in 1971, bringing together work hitherto done in a number of separate departments, it found itself with no fewer than thirteen separateregional organisations; this number has since been reduced to eleven by bringingunder a single organisation regional services relating to physical and economic planning, highways and housing.204. Other bodies, such as the nationalised industries and many of theautonomous bodies which have been appointed to administer particular services the regional hospital boards are an example or to perform advisoryfunctions, have also been organised on a regional basis.Regional economic planning205. In the early 1960s a new emphasis was placed on regionalism, with the recognition of the need to plan economic performance and growth at a regional level. High unemployment in the north-east led to special steps being taken toco-ordinate the work of the offices of the government departments in the region and a Minister was appointed with special responsibilities for promoting its economic development. Then, in 1965, a framework of economic planningmachinery for the whole country was established. For this purpose, Englandwas divided into eight planning regions, in each of which an economic planning council and an economic planning board were set up. The new machinery was at first under the aegis of the Department of Economic Affairs and is now the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.206. The chairman and members of each of the regional economic planning councils are appointed by the Secretary of State. They are drawn from localgovernment, industry and commerce, the trade unions, the universities, social services and other spheres of activity which contribute to regional economic planning. They are appointed as individuals and not as representatives ordelegates of particular organisations or areas. The councils have varied in size, with an average membership of twenty-five to thirty. By their termsof reference they are required to assist in the formulation of regional plans,to advise on steps necessary for implementing the plans and to advise on the regional implications of national economic policies. One of their principaltasks has been to develop long-term strategies for their regions. The councils are not statutory bodies; their functions are advisory and they have no executive powers.1 Written Evidence, Vol. 4.
207. Alongside each council is a regional economic planning board, consistingof senior civil servants of the departments concerned in any way with economic planning, with an officer of the Department of the Environment as chairman.The boards have no formal terms of reference. Their main task is to co-coordinate the regional economic planning work of the departments and, through acommon secretariat in each region, to co-operate with the regional economic planning council in developing a long-term planning strategy.-the regions of england208. In the absence of national and historical characteristics such as exist in Scotland and Wales, the boundaries of English regions must to some extent be artificial. The way in which the country is divided up depends on the purposes for which the division is made. There has nevertheless been substantial accept-ance of the broad lines of division of England into eight to ten regions since a division was first made for civil defence purposes in the Second World War,and this has been so even though those drawing up regional structures have wished them to serve some very different purposes, including emergencywartime government, the co-ordination of local authority activities, the decentra-lisation of government administration, physical planning and economic planning.There have of course been many exceptions. To facilitate interdepartmentalco-operation and planning some functions have been fitted not very happilyinto standard regions, while others have had to remain outside.209. The wartime organisation provided for ten regions. This number was reduced to nine when standard regions were created after the war, the principalchange being the elimination of a separate London region. When the economic planning machinery was established in 1964 the number was further reducedto eight, and again the principal change was in the treatment of south-east england. In place of three standard regions London and the South East,Eastern and Southern two new regions were created, the South East and east Anglia. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission has since given its blessing tothe economic planning regions, recommending them for its proposed provincialcouncils with some boundary adjustments. The Commission^ investigationshad suggested that the eight regions, while differing greatly in population andthe extent of territory covered, not only provided areas of suitable size for thefunctions of provincial councils, but also roughly reflected such sense of provin-cial identity as existed in various parts of England.210. There are, as we have already noted, very many departures from thisregional pattern. Where convenience of administration is the only consideration,the size of the operations may suggest a greater or a lesser number of regionalunits. Or the regional pattern may be dictated by technical considerations.British Raifs five regions, for example, are divided by boundaries that runbetween rather than across main railway lines, so that four out of the five meet in London; while water catchment areas are the natural units for the purposesof water conservation.211. In considering the case for the devolution of government functions tothe English regions and the various forms that devolution might take, one of thematters for consideration is the regional structure that would be appropriate.We take as a starting point the economic planning regions, with the minimum
of modification needed to make the regional boundaries conform to those ofthe new counties defined in the Local Government Act 1972. Table 7.1 gives the areas and populations of the regions so formed. The boundaries of theexisting regions are shown on the map on page 574 together with the modifications.Table 7.1AREAS AND POPULATIONS OF REGIONS(The regions are the Economic Planning Regions modified so as to make the regional boundaries conform to those of the new counties as defined in theLocal Government Act 1972.)Region	New Counties	Area (square miles)	Population (thousands)Northern	Cleveland Cumbria Durham Northumberland Tyne and Wear Totals	225 2,629 941 1,943 208	567 476 607 280 1,209		5,946	3,139			North West	Cheshire Lancashire Greater Manchester Merseyside Totals	897 1,175 497 250	865 1,342 2,727 1,659		2,819	6,593			Yorkshire and Humberside	Humberside North Yorkshire South Yorkshire West Yorkshire Totals	1,356 3,208 602 787	838 629 1,315 2,053		5,953	4,835			West Midlands	Hereford and Worcestershire Salop Staffordshire Warwickshire West Midlands Totals	1,516 1,348 1,049 765 347	562   . 337 963 456 2,790		5,025	5,108

212. In the paragraphs which follow we look very briefly at the maincharacteristics of these regions and the problems that have arisen over theirdelineation.The Northern Region213. The economic planning region comprises the existing counties ofNorthumberland, Durham, the North Riding of Yorkshire, Cumberland andWestmorland. It is one of the most distinctive regions, with a strong individual -duality. Its people have an affinity with the lowland Scots, which becomes more marked as one moves north through Northumberland. Its heart is the industrial and mining area of the Tees, Wear and Tyne, which is separated by broadstretches of thinly populated country from its nearest comparable neighbours.The decline in recent years of its traditional industries of coal-mining, ship-building and metal manufacture has resulted in high unemployment and presented problems of a kind familiar in Central Scotland and South Wales.Much has been done to broaden the base of industry and to improve com-munications both locally and with the rest of the country.214. It has for long been a matter for debate whether Cumberland andWestmorland should be grouped for regional purposes with other north-western counties or with counties in the north-east. Both arrangements havebeen tried. The Redcliffe-Maud report concluded that, because lines of com-munication tend to run north and south rather than east and west, these countiesshould be included in the North West Region. The Commission also proposed the exclusion from the Northern Region of most of the North Riding. With theminimum alteration required to avoid division of counties, the region would consist of the new counties of Cleveland, Cumbria, Durham, Northumberlandand Tyne and Wear.The North West215. This region consists of Lancashire, Cheshire and that part of Derbyshirewhich largely depends, like those two counties, on the twin conurbationscentred on Manchester and Liverpool. The Pennines form a natural boundaryto the east, but to the north as we have seen there is a problem about theinclusion of Cumberland and Westmorland, while to the south there is no veryobvious boundary between the region and the Midlands, and the High PeakDistrict of Derbyshire in particular poses problems. But the region has a strongindustrial, political and social cohesion. Like the Northern Region, it facesthe problems of unemployment and the need to attract new industry following the decline of its traditional industry, in this case cotton textiles. The newcounties in the region would be Cheshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester andMerseyside.Yorkshire and Humberside216. Although Yorkshire, by virtue of its size and the loyalties it commands,is a natural region, with the West Yorkshire conurbation as its industrialcentre, it has generally been found desirable to have regional boundaries which do not coincide with those of the county. There have been many variants.The economic planning region excludes the North Riding, much of which isclosely related to the industrial areas of the north-east, but includes Lindseybecause of the need to plan the development of Humberside as a whole. The
Redcliffe-Maud Commission proposed the inclusion in its Yorkshire province of the greater part of the North Riding and only part of Lindsey. Adjusting the boundaries to include whole counties, the new counties included in the regionwould be Humberside, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.Traditionally, the wool textile industry has been to Yorkshire what cotton hasbeen to Lancashire, and its decline, though less dramatic than that of cotton,has confronted the region with the same basic economic problems as those ofthe North and North West.The West Midlands217. This comprises Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshireand Worcestershire. Its industrial centre is the Birmingham conurbation. Likethe South East and the East Midlands, it is industrially a relatively prosperousarea and a highly congested one. The problem in these regions is not, as withthe others we have considered, one of encouraging new industry, but ofregulating its natural growth, and the major planning effort is directed to the renewal or redevelopment of the towns and cities and to the easing of congestion. The new counties in the region would be Hereford and Worcester,Salop, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Midlands.The East Midlands218. This region consists of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire,Northamptonshire, Rutland and Lincolnshire (apart from Lindsey). It has fewnatural boundaries; the Redcliffe-Maud Commission allocated Northampton-shire to the South East Region and southern Lincolnshire to East Anglia.If under the new local government arrangements Northamptonshire were toremain in the region and all of Lincolnshire were to be included, the newcounties, in addition to these two, would be Derbyshire, Leicestershire andNottinghamshire.2D. Unlike the West Midlands, the East Midlands is not dominated by any large conurbation; it is rather an area of many free-standing towns of varyingsize. The growing diversification of industry everywhere is tending to make lessmarked the distinction that once existed between the West and East Midlands,the former specialising in metal-working and car production and the latterin industries such as pharmaceuticals, tobacco, textiles, clothing and footwear;and the links between the two regions are tending to increase. It has neverthelessbeen generally accepted that the two regions are sufficiently different in character and in the planning problems they present to justify their treatment as separateunits.East Anglia220. This region, covering the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshireand the Isle of Ely, and Huntingdonshire and Peterborough, is the smallest interms of population, though not in area, of the eight economic planning regions.It is still largely agricultural in character and contains no major industrialconurbation. Despite the proximity and pressure of London, and the rapid growth of population and industry, it has so far managed to preserve its identityand seems to form a cohesive region with a distinctive set of problems. The newcounties in it will be Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.
The South West221. The south-west of England presents a difficult problem in the drawingof regional boundaries. The present counties of Dorset, Gloucestershire,Somerset and Wiltshire group together naturally, with Bristol as a strong and growing industrial centre. This leaves Devon and Cornwall, forming an exten-sive but sparsely populated peninsula with a pattern of economic life mainlydepending on agriculture and tourism and in which industrial development has played a relatively small part. The prosperity of these two counties must dependpartly upon developments, particularly in the field of communications, in the counties to the east of them. But their grouping with those counties in a regionbased on Bristol is not a natural one, and it has hitherto been adopted only because there appeared to be no other way of creating in the south-west a region which is an economic and administrative entity of appropriate population and size. The new counties of Avon, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire,Somerset and Wiltshire will be in the region.The South East222. The remaining counties of England, including Greater London, are in theSouth East Region. Within its borders live some seventeen million people. Thoughfor administrative purposes the region has generally to be divided up into unitsof a more manageable size, and this is done in very many different ways, forthe purposes of planning it has to be considered as a whole since all parts of there are so obviously under the influence of London. This influence indeed extendsmore widely. In addition to being the administrative, financial and commercialcapital of the country and the centre of its communications, London is themetropolitan capital of the Commonwealth and an international city of firstrank.223. London&apos;s special and dominant position is an important factor to betaken into account in any consideration of a regional division of England. Thesouth-east is meaningless without London; with London it is by almost any measure one cares to select overwhelmingly greater than any of the other regions. This has raised for us the question whether any new regional organisa-tion of government that might be devised for other parts of the country could appropriately be applied in the south-east, or whether the unique character ofthat region would require it to be treated in some different manner. The problem is by no means a new one. It has always existed in the local government field,where it has been found necessary to provide for London a structure of localauthorities somewhat different from that considered suitable for other parts ofthe country.224. The new counties in the region will be, in addition to Greater London,Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Essex, Hampshire,Hertfordshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and West Sussex.the situation in brief225. England is the most densely populated and highly industrialised of thecountries which make up the United Kingdom, with a population more than four-fifths of the whole. Despite its comparatively small size it presents immensevariety in the nature of the landscape, the character of the people and the range
of social and economic problems. Probably because of its dominant positionin the United Kingdom, there has been no demand for the creation ofinstitutions of government to serve England as a whole or particular parts ofit comparable to the demands made in Scotland and Wales. But in the years since the Second World War there has been an increasing requirement for some services to be planned and provided over areas greater than those of individuallocal authorities, and this requirement is likely still to exist after the reform oflocal government. We have to consider the extent of the functions and powers that could appropriately be exercised at a regional or provincial level and thekind of organisation that would be needed for this purpose.
PART IIIGREAT BRITAIN-THE PRESENTDISCONTENTS
GROWTH AND CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT226. In this Part of our Report we seek to identify the present causes of discontent with government in Great Britain. As part of the background to our enquiry, we start in this chapter with an account of the ways in whichthe scope, scale and complexity of government activity have changed over thelast hundred years and of the modifications that have been made to the institu-tions of government to meet those changes. In Chapter 9 we deal with the nature and extent of the complaints about government which have been brought toour attention. Then, in Chapter 10, we examine the additional ingredient intro-duced by national feeling in Scotland and Wales.the scope of governmentThe subject matter of government227. Throughout most of the nineteenth century government was concernedmainly with law and order, external affairs and defence, the regulation of overseas trade and the raising of revenue; it exercised a narrow range ofregulatory functions, but its attitude in domestic affairs was mostly passiveand non-interventionist. There was little or no involvement in many matters such as the performance of industry and the economy, the quality of the environment and standards of health and welfare which are major preoccupa-tions of modern government. The situation today is quite different; there arenow very few areas of public and even personal life with which government can be said to have no concern at all.228. This expansion of government, while a constant feature of modernhistory, has markedly quickened its pace at certain times. In this centurytwo periods stand out, both associated with the world wars.229. The first period extended from 1908 to 1919. It began with the extensivesocial reforms which were embodied in the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, theLabour Exchanges Act 1909 and the National Insurance Act 1911. Therefollowed in war-time the imposition of a widening range of administrative and economic controls. After the war those controls were quickly wound up,but many of the new government departments, including those establised for Pensions, Labour, Air and Scientific and Industrial Research, remained in being, and two additional departments, for Transport and Health, were set up. Each of these new departments represented an enlarged area of govern-ment intervention.230. The second period of rapid expansion was the decade from 1940.Apart again from the complex apparatus of war-time controls, finally dismantledin the 1950&apos;s, there were major developments in the social services and in theeconomic and environmental fields. Legislation was passed to bring aboutmajor changes in the arrangements for education, social security, health,agriculture, and town and country planning, and the Governmenfs directinvolvement in industry and the economy was increased through a series of Actsproviding for the nationalisation of basic industries. Changes in the characterof economic intervention were also implicit in the acceptance by the war-timeGovernment of responsibility for maintaining full employment.
231. In these and other ways government responsibilities have, within the lifetime of many people now living, widened immensely. The range of subjectsthat may now be raised in Parliament provides some illustration of this. Wehave examined a recent series of Parliamentary Questions to see how far itwould have been appropriate to put them at the beginning of the century. Ouranalysis covered Questions receiving both oral and written reply in the Houseof Commons in one week in June 1971. There were 718 Questions in all, andwe estimate that between 80 and 90 per cent, of them could not have been tabled in 1900 since they related to matters which were not then of governmentconcern. There has been no comparable increase over the same period in thetotal number of Questions tabled, no doubt because of the limited opportunities for receiving oral reply and the procedural restrictions which have been imposed;the growth of government responsibilities, and possibly of public anxieties,has been reflected instead in a vast increase in correspondence between Membersof Parliament and Ministers.Effect on the lives of the people232. The cumulative effect of government expansion on people&apos;s lives and activities has been considerable. The individual a hundred years ago hardlyneeded to know that the central government existed. His birth, marriage anddeath would be registered, and he might be conscious of the safeguards forhis security provided by the forces of law and order and of imperial defence;but, except for the very limited provisions of the poor law and factory legislation,his welfare and progress were matters for which he alone bore the responsibility.By the turn of the century the position was not much changed. Today, however,the individual citizen submits himself to the guidance of the state at all times.His schooling is enforced; his physical well-being can be looked after in a comprehensive health service; he may be helped by government agencies tofind and train for a job; he is obliged while in employment to insure againstsickness, accident and unemployment; his house may be let to him by a public authority or he may be assisted in its purchase or improvement; he can availhimself of a wide range of government welfare allowances and services; and hedraws a state pension on his retirement. In these and many other ways unknownto his counterpart of a century ago, he is brought into close and regular contact with government and its agencies.233. Industrialists, too, are much more involved with government. Anindustrialist in the nineteenth century, if he wished to build a factory, could doso by entirely private arrangement, and government hardly needed to knowabout the project. In these days, however, a prospective factory developer isfaced with a host of Acts and regulations to do, for instance, with environ-mental planning, industrial development certificates, government grants,allowances and inducements, the welfare and training of employees, employeeinsurance and taxation, industrial relations, licences, waste disposal, air pollutionand the collection of trade statistics any aspect of which his nineteenth century forebear might well have regarded as an unwarranted interference.the scale of governmentThe number of Ministers234. As the scope of government has increased, so naturally has its size.This increase is well illustrated by the changes in the numbers of Ministers
and civil servants and in the cost of government. For most of the nineteenth century the Cabinet consisted of twelve to fifteen members and Ministerialappointments outside the Cabinet were few. In this century, there has been no great increase in the Cabinet, which usually includes about twenty Ministers,but the total number of Ministerial appointments of all kinds has risen toover one hundred, about three times as many as in the days of Disraeli andGladstone.The size of the public service235. The corresponding increase in government organisation has ultimatelybeen reflected in the size rather than in the number of separate governmentdepartments. While new departments have been created from time to time todeal with expanding government functions, the pattern of organisation hasundergone many changes and the tendency in recent years to merge ministrieswith similar or associated functions has led to a structure of fewer, but much larger, main departments. The Ministry of Defence, the Department of the environment, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry together cover the tasks formerly carried out bya dozen or so separate ministries.236. Increases in manpower give a clearer idea of the great growth that hastaken place in the departments. Up to the end of the nineteenth century, thestrength of the non-industrial civil service (excluding the Post Office) did notexceed 50,000. In this century there has been a tenfold increase in that number,to around 500,000, while the population of the country has risen only by half.Employment in the public service generally has also greatly expanded. InOctober 1972, the total was about 6,400,000, including 691,000 industrial and non-industrial civil servants, 408,000 in the Post Office, 1,900,000 in the other nationalised industries, 2,600,000 in local government and 775,000 in theNational Health Service. Thus just over a quarter of the total employed popu-lation is now engaged in the various public services and industries, a proportionsome six times as great as at the beginning of this century.The cost of government237. The rise in government expenditure has been even more dramatic,largely because transfer payments in the form of social security and other benefits to persons have risen at a much faster rate than direct purchases by government of materials and labour services. In 1870, total government expendi-ture was about  3 per head of population, whereas in 1970 it had reachedsome  400 per head; expressed as a percentage of national income (gross national product at factor cost), expenditure rose from 9 per cent, to 43 percent. The rise in transfer payments alone was from about 0-2 per cent, ofnational income in 1870 to 12-5 per cent, in 1970, when the Government wasclaiming over 25 per cent, of the annual output of resources for its own directuse.238. The centralisation of government is reflected in the changing financialresponsibilities of central and local government. More than half of totalgovernment expenditure in 1870 was undertaken by local authorities; but,despite the large increase in their functions, this proportion had fallen to lessthan one-third by 1970. Equally striking is the fall in the proportion of local
authorities&apos; expenditure financed by themselves. In 1870 probably about 80 percent, of local expenditure was financed by local rates, fees and charges, butthis percentage had fallen to around 45 per cent, a century later. Thus the changing size and structure of government viewed alongside the growth in population and incomes indicates its increasing domination over the manage-ment of the nation&apos;s economic affairs.the complexity of governmentThe processes of government239. Other changes that have taken place in the nature of government are less easy to quantify. The tasks of government have become not only vasterbut also more complex and burdensome, more difficult for Ministers and parliament to control and for people to follow. Whereas in the last centuryit was entirely feasible for Ministers to keep a close watch on the activities oftheir departments and to take all policy decisions themselves, often withoutthe advice of civil servants or experts, today a Minister cannot be expected toknow about more than a small proportion of the decisions that are madein his name, and policies have to be submitted to a complex network of internal and perhaps external consultation, specialist examination and often researchbefore they reach Ministers for consideration. Many of these processes areconducted anonymously and without publicity. In these circumstances, the degree of control exercised by Ministers is bound to be lessened, and the citizen can hardly be expected to have any deep understanding of governmentoperations.240. Not only does government effectively fall more and more into the handsof the expert; it also increasingly requires an expert to appreciate its processes.The closing of a coal mine or the demolition of houses to make way for a newroad may seem to those directly affected to be fairly simple issues of right andwrong, but such operations are likely to have derived from calculations ofgreat complexity which demonstrate, to specialists at least, that thoy are thebest options in the interests of the public at large. It is increasingly probablethat the answers will have been obtained with the help of a computer, whichfacilitates far more refinement in decision making than was possible forgovernments of an earlier age.Legislation241. As government has penetrated more widely and deeply into the life of the nation, the scope and often the complexity of legislation has increased.Long before this century began Parliament found itself obliged to delegate to Ministers the power to make instruments which would carry the force oflaw. For many reasons the much greater range of legislative activity, the limitations on Parliamentary time, the need to consult experts and outside interests on questions of detail and the importance of adjusting quickly to new conditions reliance on delegated legislation has greatly increased. In the twenty years from 1951 to 1970, over 43,000 statutory instruments were made,an average of over 2,000 a year or nearly double the number at the beginningof the century. The volume of the instruments made each year is now about three times that of the Acts of Parliament passed. Many of these instrumentsare complex and technical, not easily comprehended even by the people they
directly affect; and many provide penalties for contravention. It might be observed that in these circumstances ignorance of the law may sometimes benot only excusable but inevitable.future prospectsAttempts to check the growth of government242. What we have said suffices to indicate how government has grown in scope, in scale and in complexity. It might well seem to the ordinary citizenthat such a vast and spreading organism is beyond his powers to understand,let alone influence. It is natural in these circumstances to enquire whether theexpansion is likely to continue or whether it can be halted or even reversed.243. It is a concern of all governments to keep the public service and public expenditure within appropriate limits. With an eye to the need for economy,and to the general desire for a reduction in the tax burden, special attemptsare made from time to time to curtail expenditure in one sector or another,or in the public sector as a whole. In the early 1950s, for instance, as after theFirst World War, it became public policy to make a &quot;bonfire&quot; of war-timecontrols. Between 1950 and 1958 there was in fact a steady decline in the numberof non-industrial civil servants and some check in the rise in public expenditure,though both trends were later reversed. A White paper published in October1970 stated the Governmenfs belief that &quot;government has been attempting todo too much. This has placed an excessive burden oh industry, and on thepeople of this country as a whole, and has also overloaded the government machine itself&quot;. Every activity of government was to be examined with a viewto deciding whether it was still relevant and whether it had necessarily to beundertaken by central government.The pressures on government244. But while attempts to curb the growth of government may meet withsome successes, the inexorable pressures continue. People now look to govern-ment, not only as in the last century for protection against attack from withoutand against disorder and crime, disease and extreme distress, but also for greaterequality of opportunity, more and constantly improving public services and theenhancement of living standards. To a very great extent it is under thesepressures that government has grown and continues to grow. There is no littledegree of resistance to change, and especially to rapid change, in our govern-mental arrangements, but it is almost a natural assumption when social,economic or industrial problems arise that it is primarily for the Governmentto solve them. The roots of most government measures, even those described as unpopular, are to be found in the known or assumed requirements of thepopulation. To some extent the political parties anticipate and interpret thewishes of the electorate in presenting their manifestos for approval; but forthe most part the expansion of government is a reaction to the continuouspressures and problems of the community.245. New policies usually involve higher government expenditure and morecivil servants. While government may be urgently called upon to act, theremay be less disposition on the part of the public to recognise the implications1 The Reorganisation of Central Government (Cmnd. 4506).
of that action. Having willed the end, they may resent the financial cost. Butvoices raised in favour of economy in government are now, perhaps, weakerthan they used to be. The social and personal services which the governmentadminister are by their nature expensive in money and manpower; they arelittle amenable to savings through greater productivity, and there are bothpractical and political limits to the curtailments which can be made. Even the growing complexities of government largely derive from the general desire that an ever-widening range of interests, national, sectional and individual,should be brought into account in the taking of decisions.246. In recent years, with the development of broadcasting, the pressures on government have built up more quickly and intensively. Radio and televisionhave fostered a wider and more immediate appreciation of current issues and aswifter response to them. Very soon after new problems have broken through to the surface they may concern pollution, fire hazards, cruelty to animals,the collapse of an insurance company, the adoption of children, bad housing,reservoir schemes, pornography, the needs of developing countries, conflictor disaster abroad, or any one of an interminable list of subjects they are widelydiscussed on radio and television, and in the press. Public protests and pressuregroups mount, usually focusing their demands for action on government,and dissatisfaction increases if action is not taken or is not immediately effective.Thus government, however reluctant it may be at the outset, may be compelledto extend its sphere of activity.247. It is clear that these pressures will continue and that what the 1970White Paper described as &quot;the increasingly complex and technical characterof the processes of government and administration in modern society&quot; will persist. While machinery reforms and occasional excursions with the pruningknife may do something to make government more manageable, there is no prospect of halting, still less of reversing, the long-term trend of growth in its scope, scale and complexity.changes in our political institutionsParliament248. We now consider the ways in which the institutions of governmenthave been modified to deal with the greater volume of business. We start withParliament. The first point to note is that the growth in the resources at its disposal has in no way matched the increase in the demands made upon it.Indeed in one respect these resources have been diminished, since about a hundred of its Members are now Ministers and so part of the executive which parliament has to control, compared with only just over forty in 1900. Repre-sentation in the European Parliament has placed a large additional burden on the remaining Members. There has been no great increase in the staff at their disposal. In 1966 the number of House of Commons Clerks was thirty-six, one fewer than in 1900; by 1972 the number had risen to forty-eight.And the number of sitting days has not substantially changed; since 1945 ithas averaged 163 days a year, compared with 149 days between the wars and129 days before the First World War.249. Parliament has, however, shown consciousness of the need to reformits own procedures to match the changed situation. It has been recognisedthat the traditional processes of Parliament set debates on Bills and motions,
formal proceedings in Committee, questions and statements on the floor of theHouse are not now adequate for probing in depth the actions of governmentdepartments. Accordingly, within the last twenty years in particular, experi-ments have been made and procedures brought in to enable the legislature to scrutinise more closely the policies and acts of the executive and generally to bring government more into the open. Some of the experiments have notbeen pursued; others have proved to be workable and seem likely to becomeestablished as permanent features of the Parliamentary arrangements.250. Changes have been made mainly through development of the work ofParliamentary Select Committees. A Select Committee on Nationalised Indus-tries was set up in 1956 to enable Members to look into the affairs of publicly owned industries. From 1967 further specialist committees were established,on either a subject or a departmental basis, for agriculture, science and technology, race relations and immigration, education, overseas development and Scottish affairs. These committees, some temporary, operated alongside the long-established Public Accounts and Estimates Committees through which Parliament conducted its enquiries into the Governments management of public finances.251. This system of scrutiny was reviewed in a Green paper published in October 1970. This proposed, and it has since been accepted, that the house should set up, first, an Expenditure Committee to examine the whole range of public expenditure and its policy implications, and secondly, alongside the established Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, Select Committees on science and Technology, Race Relations and Immigration and (subject to anyreconsideration made necessary by constitutional developments) scottish affairs. Through this structure of Committees, which would be able to call forpapers and records and to take evidence in public from Ministers, civil servants and, as necessary, bodies outside government, it was considered that parliament would be provided with more effective standing machinery for scrutinisingpolicies and public expenditure, including the longer-term financial projections.Government would, in effect, become more open, the formation of policiesmight be subtly influenced under the impact of interrogation, and the knowledgegained and made available by the Committees would help to enhance thequality of public debate.252. Parliament has recently appointed a Joint Select Committee of bothHouses to improve its control over the great volume of regulations, orders and statutory instruments of all kinds. It is the task of the Committee to consider such instruments and to report to Parliament any unusual or unexpected usein the instruments of the powers granted by Act of Parliament and any techincal or other flaws they might contain. More recently, a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons has been established to examine also the merits of statutory instruments.253. Despite these modifications, there is an evident contrast betweenthe enormous increase in the scope, scale and complexity of governmentand the extent and pace of change in the Parliamentary institutions. Fundamen-tally, except in the curtailment of the powers of the House of Lords and the1 Select Committees of the House of Commons (Cmnd. 4507).
transfer of a large part of the responsibilities for Northern Ireland to a separatelegislative assembly, Parliament has changed hardly at all in this century.A Member who had sat in the House of Commons in 1901 would find littlein its mode of operation (though much in its subject matter) to surprise himtoday.The Executive254. During the same period, the organisation of the executive has undergonemore profound changes, possibly reflecting the fact that Parliament, as a legis-lative, deliberative and critical body, matured much earlier than did themachinery of government. We have already noted the great increase in thenumber of Ministers, the development of the Scottish and Welsh Offices,the creation of many other new departments to take over the new functionsof government, and the more recent tendency to group related subjects in a smaller number of departments with the aim of securing greater cohesion instrategy and policy. The mechanisms of central co-ordination, traditionallyhoused in respect of policy in the Cabinet Office and in respect of public expendi-ture in the Treasury, have also been developed through the Public expenditure survey Committee, which monitors future trends and priorities in expenditure and, more recently, through the central policy review staff in the cabinet office.255. The civil service has also undergone profound change. It has, as wehave seen, increased enormously in numbers and in the range of skills it provides. Instead of being housed almost wholly in headquarters offices inLondon, the staffs of most departments are now to a considerable extentdeployed in a network of regional and local offices so that fewer than one-thirdof the total are at headquarters. Some of the headquarters staffs have them-selves been dispersed to the provinces to relieve the pressure on accommodation in London.256. The structure, recruitment and management of the civil service havebeen the subject of a full enquiry by a departmental committee1, and theservice is being reorganised in the light of some of the recommendations made.Appointed bodies257. Another feature of modern government is the rapid growth in thenumber of bodies operating between central and local government. There arenow several hundred bodies of one kind or another which have been appointedby the Government to carry out specialised functions. This is by no means anew development. Government boards were set up after the industrial revolutionto deal with poor law, health and education. But today the number and range of these bodies are very much greater. Many are purely advisory, having no powers of executive action, though they bring influence to bear, as they were intended to do, on the actions of government. Others may act as appeal tribunals to adjudicate on the interests of individuals, or they may, like the boards of nationalised industries, have considerable executive and spendingpowers and loom large in the commercial life of the nation. In some cases thepowers which they have been given, for instance in relation to hospitals and gas and electricity, may previously have been exercised by elected local The Civil Service (Chairman, Lord Fulton) (Cmnd. 3638).&apos;
authorities. We examine the constitution and functions of these bodies more fully in Chapter 18. For the most part they are appointed by Ministers ratherthan elected, and they are able to carry out their functions, whether executive,appellate, advisory or of some other character, with a considerable degree of independent discretion. They are now an integral part of our changing pattern of government. Many of them operate on a regional basis.Local government258. Local government has itself experienced many changes during thecourse of the twentieth century. As the scope of government has increased ithas acquired many new functions, while it has lost to the new appointed bodiessome of its older traditional functions. While we have been sitting, plans havebeen going ahead (as described in Part II) for a radical reform of the structure of local government in all parts of Great Britain, designed to make it betterfitted to undertake the tasks which fall to it in the modern world.safeguards for the individualAvenues of complaint259. With government touching the lives of people at so many points,occasions for individual complaint have inevitably increased. People withgrievances against government departments or public bodies usually have a choice of courses open to them. If the complaint is that an executive body has exceeded or misused its powers, the ordinary courts may give redress. In certaincircumstances administrative tribunals are available to consider appeals. Ifthe complaint lies against a public corporation, there may be a body, as in thecase of the nationalised industries, specifically established to examine andreport on representations by the public. Many people prefer to put theirgrievances to their Members of Parliament, who may pursue them throughletters to Ministers or through Questions in Parliament. The press and broadcasting are also quick to take up complaints of maladministration orinjustice, and in this way too the Government may be induced to instituteenquiries leading to remedial action.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration260. Since 1967 a further means of redress has been established with theappointment of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. TheCommissioner may receive and investigate complaints about public administra-tion which are submitted to him by a Member of Parliament. Broadly speakinghis jurisdiction extends only to maladministration by government departments,and he is not able to deal with complaints against other public bodies. TheCommissioner reports on his enquiries into a particular case to the department concerned, and it is for the department to decide whether action should betaken. He also makes an annual report to Parliament.261. There has been pressure for this procedure to be applied to a wider field. In legislation for the reorganisation of the National Health Servicespowers are being taken for the appointment of Health Service Commissioners.In the case of local authorities, the Government has indicated its acceptance ofthe need for improved complaints machinery and is considering in the light ofcomments by local authorities the form that this should take.
262. There has therefore been in recent years some elaboration of thearrangements for examining complaints about public administration and theyare expected to be further developed. These procedures, which are broadlyderived from experience in other European countries, may still be regarded assomewhat experimental in this country, but there seems little reason to doubtthat they will become, in their present or some other form, an accepted and permanent part of our constitutional arrangements.summary263. In this chapter we have very briefly reviewed the changes that havetaken place in the scope and scale of government activity and in the institutions of government over the last hundred years. The most notable feature has beenthe immense increase in the range and complexity of government business andin the manpower and other resources devoted to it. The institutions of govern-ment have to some extent been changed to enable them to meet the new demands made upon them. In recent years both the civil service and local governmenthave been made the subject of general reviews. There has, however, been no general review of Parliament or of the working of central government. the changes that have been made from time to time have been in the nature ofadaptations of existing institutions, designed to meet new situations as they have arisen. It is against this background that complaints about the working of thepresent system of government have to be examined. In the two chapters which follow, we seek to establish more precisely the nature and extent of thosecomplaints.
DISSATISFACTION WITH GOVERNMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN264. We must now try to establish what the complaints really are. In all thewelter of discussion and protest, what things stand out as substantial andpersistent causes of dissatisfaction with the existing system of government?We start, in this chapter, with those causes of dissatisfaction which appear tobe common to the people of Great Britain as a whole. Then, in the followingchapter, we discuss the special complaints which arise from national feeling inScotland and Wales.265. Throughout this discussion, and indeed in the whole of our Report,wherever common considerations apply, for convenience of presentation weuse the term region to cover Scotland and Wales as well as the regions ofEngland, while recognising that the separate national identities of Scotlandand Wales put them into a different category and that in Scotland the term is atpresent used in a quite different sense to denote the top tier of local authorities.Where, as is often the case, the national identities of Scotland and Wales giverise to separate considerations, we make this clear.266. In our efforts to determine the nature and extent of dissatisfaction wehave had a great deal of help from our witnesses, many of whom have had first-hand experience of government, at all levels from the Cabinet downwards,while others have devoted their lives to study of the problems with which we areconcerned. But we decided at an early stage that in addition we should do what we could to find out the views of the general public. We therefore com-missioned the Government Social Survey1 to arrange for an attitude surveyto be carried out on our behalf. The full results of this survey, which was completed in August, 1970, are being published in our series of ResearchPapers2.267. The abstract nature of our subject caused difficulties for the survey.Concepts such as devolution may be familiar to those in government and to others with a close interest in public affairs, but for many people they have little meaning. In an attempt to overcome the difficulties, the main generalconcepts were presented to respondents in the form of numerous questions about specific aspects of government. This made the interviews long (on average, just under an hour); yet it was still not possible to cover fully all thetopics connected with our terms of reference. The questions were confined tothe themes of participation, nationalism and devolution, which seemed to usto be the most important when the survey was commissioned.268. This limitation meant that to all intents and purposes the only specific&quot;solution&quot; put to those being interviewed&quot; was some kind of devolution. the answers given to questions about devolution reflected a fairly widespreadinterest in some moderate degree of change in this direction, and this findinghas influenced our thinking. It must be recognised, however, that if a person isdissatisfied, and he is presented with only one suggested remedy, then he maybe expected to take a generally favourable view of that remedy, whatever it is,1 Now part of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.2 Research Paper 7 Devolution and Other Aspects of Government: An Attitudes Survey.
even if he has given no previous thought to it. This factor, taken in conjunctionwith the specialised nature of the subject and the technical limitations inherent in all attitude surveys, suggests that the survey results should be used withcaution. They are not a substitute for the informed views of witnesses directly involved or interested in government. Nevertheless they are the only indicationwe have of what the general public thinks, and they constitute an essential partof the evidence.269. Using all the information available to us we have tried to track down the main sources of dissatisfaction with government. Inevitably these overlapand run into one another, but nearly all the complaints of substance seem tospring either from the centralisation of government in London, or from develop-ments in the operation of government which have tended to run counter to theprinciples of democracy. It is broadly true to say that complaints put to usabout centralisation have come mainly from those actively engaged in local or regional affairs, whereas complaints about the weakening of democracyhave emerged more from the evidence of academics and other specially qualifiedindividuals and groups. We examine the complaints under these two generalheadings.centralisation270. We have described in Chapter 8 the enormous increase in the scale ofgovernment in recent times, including the advent of the welfare state and theassumption by government of responsibility for ordering the economy. Thegreater volume and complexity of government has inevitably increased theimportance of the central co-ordinating role. There is a feeling in some quartersthat only those at the centre can know all that goes on, and that only they are properly qualified to assess all the possible repercussions of taking any particularaction. They must therefore have the last word. The contrary argument is thatwhile the growth in the volume of government has increased the power of those at the centre, it has resulted in ever greater demands upon them and made it quite impossible for them to have a full grasp of all that is going on. In trying to reconcile the many conflicting interests it is all too easy for them to finishby pleasing no one. The recipients of their edicts out in the regions have becomeuneasy about the quality of the decisions being taken, and have come to question the need for the centralisation of so much power in London.271. Discussions with a large number of people, especially those engaged in public life, have given us a clear picture of the typical complainant. He is a man of ability and experience, connected with an important local authority or perhaps with some regional body such as an economic planning council. he knows his locality well, and is confident that the solution which he and hiscolleagues propose for a particular problem is best for the people living there.He may well have gone to the trouble of visiting London to explain his views.But often, and not infrequently after what he considers to be an unreasonabledelay, he learns that his proposed solution is not endorsed by the centralgovernment. Possibly the decision is conveyed to him by a junior official, andit may be based on professional or technical advice which appears to him tobe no more, and perhaps less, authoritative than that available locally. Hesuspects that the matter has not received the same quality of attention inLondon as he and his colleagues have given to it locally, and he is perhapsfrustrated because the decision is based on factors of which he has little direct
knowledge and which he is not fully competent to dispute. He is left with thefeeling that the obvious and commonsense thing to do has been vetoed, and thatif those in London had been as familiar with local circumstances as he is theresult might have been different.272. This picture of the typical complainant and there are others not somuch in the public eye is illustrative of a feeling that there is too much controlfrom London over things which people in the regions regard as primarily theirown concern. It has been put to us that the United Kingdom is the largestunitary state in Europe, and among the most centralised of the major industrial countries of the world. While not all our witnesses accepted that the conse-quences of centralisation are necessarily bad, the predominant view was thatgovernment is too centralised in its operations to deal properly with the whole range of functions which are now its responsibility. Such over-concentration ofresponsibility was said by one witness, quoting an expression originally usedto describe the centralisation of government in France in an earlier age, toproduce a state of constitutional ill-health characterised by &quot;anaemia in theextremities and apoplexy at the centre&quot;.273. The fact that these complaints are made does not mean that regionalcritics are careless of wider national considerations. They realise that theycannot always have things their own way. But when people in other regionssee that year by year the South East of England prospers, apparently regardless of the economic climate, whereas, despite the operation of regional policiesdesigned to help them, they do not, they naturally begin to question the system and to ask whether the economic and social policies being applied are the best that can be devised to meet their particular needs.The allocation of public expenditure274. We received from representatives of local authorities and regional economic planning councils frequent complaints about the allocation of public expenditure in the regions. What these people seem to want more than anything else are a fair share of public funds for their regions and a voice in determiningits allocation to the various services so as to ensure that regional as well as national considerations are taken into account.275. On the question of fair shares their knowledge about what the variousregions of the country are getting is incomplete, and there is insufficientinformation published to enable them to work it out. On the allocation of funds within the region they are largely in the hands of the central government.Because the government is responsible for managing the economy, and for ensuring that national policies and national standards are applied, it exercisesconsiderable influence over the allocation of all public expenditure. But people in the regions complain that allocation at national level often fails to produce a commonsense result on the ground. Priorities between the various services-education, roads, hospitals and so on are decided by the Cabinet. A balance is struck at national level, and this is broadly reflected in the allocation ofexpenditure to the various services throughout the country. Under this system the Cabinet might agree, for example, that there should be a special drive toimprove facilities for primary education, and a particular authority might begiven permission to build a new primary school. But what if everyone locallyis agreed that a new road or hospital is much more urgently needed than a
new primary school ? In such circumstances which are evidently not unusual people in the particular locality feel that they should be able to forgo the schoolfor the time being, and have the road or the hospital instead.276. The central government, however, will not normally allow public funds to be switched from one service to another in this way, at least between the&quot;key&quot; services for which it accepts special responsibilities for determiningstandards and co-ordinating developments. It considers that, if such transferswere permitted, national policies for the various services might be undermined.If a number of authorities decided to use their primary school allocation forother purposes, the intended drive on primary school building might peterout; and the additional use of funds on roads and hospitals would in effectchange the order of priorities decided by the Cabinet. Looked at from a nationalpoint of view it would also upset the balance of fairness in services between one area and another. In the eyes of Whitehall an area which chose to build a road instead of a primary school might not have so pressing a need for newroads as some other areas; and those other areas might not be able to use theirschool allocation on roads because their need for schools was even greater.277. And so, for these reasons, regional preferences may be subordinate to national policies, and on occasion the results may seem nonsensical to localpeople. While they do not ask for more than their fair share of public funds,they do not see why they should not be given greater discretion to spend it inthe way desired by the majority of local people. Local authorities already have some discretion to allocate expenditure among the various services for whichthey are responsible, and there have been changes in this respect while we havebeen sitting; but this discretion is said to be much circumscribed in practice,while a large part of public expenditure in the regions is not under localdemocratic control at all.Lack of co-ordination between government departments278. Another cause of complaint is that the central government is so largethat its right hand does not know what its left hand is doing. Whitehall is saidto speak with too many voices, and not to co-ordinate its activities sufficiently to ensure that the operations of the various departments fit in with one another and make sense in regional terms. This is another consequence of looking ateverything on a service or functional basis at national level. What some peoplewant to achieve is a regional view. Subject to the overriding needs of national economic control, they would like to see the central government in Londonconfining itself to laying down general policy, leaving the lesser policy issues and detailed administration to be dealt with locally. In this way they would hope to achieve a blend of government activity more in keeping with localwishes.Civil servants in the regions279. Although representatives of the regional economic planning councilswere at pains to commend the work of the civil servants on the regional economic planning boards, other witnesses said that many civil servantsstationed in the regions were too junior, and that the more senior appointmentstend to be filled by older men towards the end of their careers. With one or twoexceptions, officers working in the regions were said to have insufficient autho-rity and discretion to settle things on the spot. Too much was governed by
central policy or had to be referred back to Whitehall. And however identifiedan officer might become with the interests of the region in which he worked,his first loyalty was inevitably to his own department. Apart from any other factors, that was where his promotion prospects lay. In discussions aboutpossible governmental arrangements at regional level, the point has often beenmade to us that the civil servants responsible for administering regional affairs should be answerable to some regional authority. And it has been suggestedthat the country as a whole would be better served if a tour of duty away from london were to be regarded in the civil service as a normal and desirablefeature of the able officers career.Political life in the regions280. It was put to us that the lack of administrative authority in the regionsand the concentration of government power generally in London mean that political talent in the regions is not given a proper chance to develop. Thoselikely to be most effective in helping to develop a rich and full life for a particularregion will usually be men and women who themselves belong to that region and are the most talented people in it. The complaint is that at present only asmall minority of them are used in government. Able people tend not to enterpublic life because they cannot see that they will be able to achieve anythingworthwhile. Some able people who were attracted to service on the regional economic planning councils when they were first set up in 1965 quickly lostinterest when they found that they were given no real authority or influence.In this respect our system of government has been compared unfavourably with that of West Germany, where there are positions of considerable politicalpower at the regional level and it is not uncommon for able men to move eitherway between national and regional politics.281. People concerned about the lack of a strong political life in the regionsargue that if political power could be transferred to the regional capital, thenother centres of power commercial, industrial and cultural would also be attracted to it, as they are now attracted to London.282. The point is made, however, that regional political power in the formalconstitutional sense could still be practically useless unless it were to be accom-panied from the centre and throughout the administrative machine by a newstyle of thinking, positively favourable to devolution and based on co-operationrather than the exercise of central authority. One of the most common com-plaints by local authorities is that, although in theory they have considerablefreedom of action in the services which they administer, in practice their optionsare heavily circumscribed by the need to conform to national policy and byMinisterial edicts, often extending to quite minor matters school buildingplans and minor traffic regulations are just two of many examples. And thereis unease in local authority circles about the way in which some ParliamentarySelect Committees have begun to concern themselves directly with matters which fall within the statutory responsibility of the democratically elected local councils.Imposition of uniformity from the centre283. Many witnesses felt that one of the most unsatisfactory consequences ofcentralisation was that regional diversity was dwindling. It is said that national
policies and standards, imposed from the centre supposedly to ensure fairnessbetween one region and another, tend to produce a uniformity which is incon-sistent with the retention of a distinctive regional character. On the other hand there is evidently widespread pressure in some fields for the same treatment tobe given to all.284. This is an important question which we have not been fully able to resolve. It is important because one of the main purposes of any system of devolution would be to allow free local choice, which implies variety; and ifthe public at large did not really want variety there would be much less pointin devolution.285. The evidence on this issue is conflicting. Government departments told us that nearly all the pressures they get are for uniformity, not against it. Thetypical complaint is that in some way the provision in one particular case isnot as good as in other cases. There is a general underlying assumption thateveryone in the country is entitled to the best that is going; and it seems thatif variety means less for some than for others it is not wanted. On the otherhand, as we have already indicated, many people with responsibility in the regions would like to be given freedom to do things in their own way.286. The attitude survey suggests that on this question members of the public at large are fairly evenly divided. When respondents were asked whetherthey thought that the standards of the various social services should be thesame in every part of Great Britain, or that each region should be allowed toset its own standards, 53 per cent, favoured uniformity and 44 per cent, regionaldiscretion. Some parts of Britain which are generally thought to be among those most interested in devolution actually showed a desire for uniformityabove the average.287. The answers given to questions about devolution showed that in GreatBritain as a whole 61 per cent, of respondents appeared to favour at least a moderate degree of devolution involving more regional responsibility for taking decisions. But half these people would withdraw their support for devolutionif it meant that people in other regions would be &quot;better off financially&quot; thanthey were; and, not surprisingly, of the 30 per cent, still in favour of devolutionin those circumstances, two-thirds said that they would change their minds ifit meant that they would be &quot;actually worse off financially&quot; than at present,thus leaving only 10 per cent, of all respondents still in favour of devolutionregardless of the material consequences.288. On the question of uniform standards there is obviously a strong feeling that government should be &quot;fair&quot; as between one citizen and another. this feeling shows itself in the pressures brought to bear on Westminster andWhitehall. On the other hand the desire for &quot;uniformity&quot; does not appear tobe as great as is often assumed. It may be that the central government, havinggrown accustomed to ensuring uniformity in some important fields for good and sufficient reasons, also imposes uniformity in other fields out of habit orconvenience, and not because the people have manifested any particular desire for it. In those matters which touch the life of the individual very closely, suchas the level of social service cash benefits, most people probably do want areasonable degree of uniformity. It would not seem right to them if, for example,
old age pensioners in one part of Britain were to be paid more than those in another part. But in those broader matters which individuals tend to know verylittle about, and in which they have no ready standard of comparison such asthe provision of schools, roads and hospitals, and the standards to be adoptedin building them they may well have no particular desire for uniformity.Their local representatives who deal with these things in practice do not seemto want it. In some fields there are already substantial variations in the levelof service provided by different local authorities. And in many fields exactparity of treatment is not practicable.Congestion in Whitehall and Westminster289. It was suggested to us that centralisation has led not only to dissatis-faction in the various regions of the United Kingdom but to congestion in thecentral institutions of government. Indeed this congestion, and the adminis-trative difficulties to which it gives rise, are an important contributory cause of regional discontent. Because Whitehall is trying to do too much the quality of its decisions is said to be adversely affected. Another point made is thatwhile opponents of devolution say it would lead to yet more civil servants,no one has attempted to measure the administrative costs which now arise fromover-centralisation from the duplication of work at different levels and fromthe ever-increasing time and effort that has to be devoted to co-ordination withinthe huge government machine.290. The effects of centralisation on Parliament itself are also much spoken of.It is said that Parliament has become overburdened, and that its proceduresare increasingly inappropriate for the volume of present-day business. There isa shortage of Parliamentary time for necessary legislation, and too much hasto be left to delegated legislation, which, while being technically authorised byParliament, in practice receives less Parliamentary attention than it should,in some cases none at all. We have been told that time is nevertheless wastedon minor matters of a kind with which Parliament ought not to be concerned.To the severest critics often businessmen primarily engaged in the control oflarge commercial enterprises Parliamentary procedures seem irrelevant to the efficient despatch of government business. They think it is impossible for parliament as it now operates to exercise a proper degree of control overessential matters.General assessment of complaints about centralisation291. We have recorded the principal complaints that arise from the centralisation-tion of government in London. They are by no means the only views put forward.Some people consider that in an advanced industrial society, concentrated in afew relatively small islands, government must necessarily be mainly from thecentre. They say that the social and economic life of the country is so closelyintegrated, and that the issues of government are so complex, that there is little scope for the dispersal of government power. Although there are exceptions,this opinion is widely held among people with first-hand experience of centralgovernment. Some of them might be thought to have a vested interest in main-taining the status quo, but their experience must be set against the comparativeignorance of public affairs of a good many of those who hold a contrary view.There is a tendency for the pro-centralist view to be supported also by trade unionists, partly perhaps because they are themselves largely organised on a
national basis. Some think too that the interests of ordinary working people and of under-privileged groups will be better protected by a strong centralgovernment than by relatively weak regional governments.292. We have received no complaint that the central government favourssouth-east England deliberately, or that the people of London go out of their way to attract prosperity at the expense of their fellow citizens in other regions.It is true that, according to the attitude survey, the minority of people whothink that government understands the needs of their region better than thoseof other regions is considerably higher in London (31 per cent.) than in thecountry as a whole (10 per cent.) showing that, in people&apos;s minds at least,geographical proximity to government may be an advantage. But manyLondoners would reject any suggestion that they are better placed than people in other regions. London is no environmental paradise; and local authorities inLondon tend to be no less critical of central government than authoritieselsewhere.293. Nor is there any suggestion that the concentration of government decisions in London arises from any deliberate attempt to sap the power ofthe regions. For the most part it is a direct consequence of the operation ofthe doctrine of Ministerial responsibility. If a Minister is to be held personallyresponsible to Parliament for all that his department does, he and his senioradvisers at the centre must retain a large measure of control over its activities.294. Moreover, government institutions are themselves aware of the diffi-culties which centralisation has produced, and they have for some years been taking action to overcome them. Certain important central government depart-ments have been re-organised to improve co-ordination. The process of hivingoff government activities to agencies outside the civil service has begun. Localgovernment is being reformed so that it will become the responsibility of fewerand bigger authorities, thus increasing their negotiating power vis-a-vis thecentral government; and the many different controls over local authorities arebeing studied with a view to eliminating those that are not strictly needed.Parliament, as we noted in the last chapter, is concerned to improve its ownworkings. It has to be recognised that, in all these efforts to solve theirorganisational problems, government institutions are in a much more difficult position than big business; they have many conflicting interests to serve, andno one overriding criterion such as profitability to guide them.vnrrg295. Our conclusion, however, is that despite these attempts to improvematters, the degree of dissatisfaction produced by centralisation remainssubstantial. People working in government, feeling that they are in the best position to form a balanced view, and that they are doing their best to mitigatewhat they regard as the inevitable evils of any modern system of government,tend to underestimate the strength and quality of the dissatisfaction. On theother hand, many of those who complain tend not to have thought out very fully the implications of a more regional system of government. These implications-tions are many, but one question in particular would need to be answeredbefore any proposals for regional devolution could be safely embarked upon.How far is the general public prepared to accept that matters which are now decided at national level, and subject to representations through Members ofParliament, should in future be finally disposed of at regional level, with the
inevitable consequence of more marked variations in standards between oneregion and another? The greater the regional discretion, the less guaranteethere will be that citizens will be treated alike in all parts of the country inmatters which affect their daily lives. The electorate might be prepared to contemplate regional devolution, but it is important that its full implicationsshould be appreciated. In the course of discussing various schemes of devolutionwe shall later examine more closely what would be involved.the weakening of democracy296. We now turn to complaints about the various ways in which peoplethink that democracy is being weakened. Some of these complaints amount toallegations that the formal machinery of democracy is not working properly;others arise from a more general feeling that the reasonable expectations of asociety living under a democratic system of government are not being satisfied.We deal first with the more specific complaints.The backbench Member of Parliament297. Members of Parliament appear to be regarded on the whole as sympathetic-thetic to the views of ordinary people, and as effective champions of constituentsin difficulty. But it is widely thought that the present system does not provide them with sufficient useful work or give them any great satisfaction. Many people are under the impression that the Members&apos; main function in Parliament isto vote for their party. According to this view the rigidity of party disciplinehas brought the backbench Member more and more under the control of theparty whips, turning debate into what one eminent Parliamentarian has des-cribed as a ritual dance. It is said that Members are frustrated by their inability to influence the making of policy, and that as a result they tend to seek greater opportunities to interfere with and criticise government. It is suggested thatthey should have a more constructive role, so that they would not merely actas an irritant to government departments but would advise the administration in the formative stage of policy making. Members of Parliament have themselvescomplained that at present practically everyone is consulted at this stageexcept them, and that they are brought in only to be presented with decisionsalready formulated in draft legislation.298. The majority of respondents in the attitude survey 55 per cent. thought that Members do not have enough power and influence over thedecisions that are made; and judging by our other evidence the support for thisview among informed observers is even greater. There is a feeling that the member of Parliament has become devalued as the people&apos;s representative,and that he ought to be given the status and facilities accorded to his oppositenumbers in countries such as the United States. The resources of governmentdepartments have far outstripped those available to him. The business of govern-ment has become bigger and more expert, and he has been left behind. He issaid to have insufficient information and opportunity to exercise any substantialinfluence over the policy decisions of the executive.299. The contrary view is that Members of Parliament do still have con-siderable power, and that at best the complaints are exaggerated. It is easy tosee how the exaggeration can arise. The fact that so few Members appearwilling to question the party line in public, much less vote against it, lends
support to the notion that they are merely acting under party orders and have little influence on the government as individuals. It is not generally appreciated that the influence of Members is largely brought to bear in committees and party meetings operating off the floor of the House, usually without publicity,and that important Parliamentary votes are often preceded by much pressingand canvassing of individual opinions. Behind the scenes the Member ofParliament is still someone to be reckoned with. Although government policies and draft legislation may be prepared without his participation, they aredecided in the light of what Members generally can be expected to support;and their views are sometimes sought in the preparatory stages of legislationthrough the medium of debates on reports of independent committees or government Green or White Papers.300. Although critics often refer to the small amount of influence exercised by the ordinary Member, it seems to us that the real complaint is that the kindof influence which he exercises is increasingly inappropriate for governmenton the modern scale. Changes in his role are under way, but his influence is stillregarded as largely negative. His strongest power is one of obstruction andcriticism, and it can be exercised only in relation to what is put before him orcomes to his notice. In an age of experts and new management techniques,some Members at least would like the opportunity to be more professional,and to have more direct influence over the many decisions which affect theirconstituents. They are not content to await their chance as Ministers, but want to be able to participate in government in a more constructive way as backbenchMembers. In this the weight of general opinion seems to be on their side.Other criticisms of Parliamentary government301. It has been suggested to us that the need of the party in power to preservea majority in the House of Commons from day to day actually results inundemocratic government. The argument is that a small minority on one wingof the government party can, and has quite often been known to, frustrate the wishes of the majority of Members. Because the government needs to retain the support and sympathy of this minority of its Members in order to stay in power, it sometimes draws back from policies which it knows to be right andwhich on a free vote would be supported by a majority of the whole House.It is said that if individual decisions could be dissociated from the need tomaintain the government in power by majority support, there would be greater freedom of executive action and debate. More extensive use of free votes wouldresult in some government measures being rejected; but in that way the demo-cratic process would be properly at work, since if a majority of all Membersis against a government proposal that ought to be taken as a fair indication that the proposal is wrong. Stability under a free voting system could be preserved by appointing the government for a fixed term of four or five years.Many people think that this would help governments to develop their policiesmore sensibly, in the light of long-term interests, instead of being as at presentunduly preoccupied with current decisions and short-term interests.302. Fixed terms would also remove another constitutional feature to which many people have objected, the Prime Ministers power to call an election atthe moment of his choice. This is thought to load the scales too much in favourof the government of the day, particularly since the advent of public opinion
polls. Another factor in the timing of elections is the ability of the governmentto manipulate the economy so as to give it maximum advantage. There havebeen further suggestions to the effect that the Prime Minister should beappointed by Members of the House of Commons on a majority vote, or be directly elected by a separate poll of the whole electorate.303. These are the complaints that have been brought to our notice; theymay fairly be said to reflect a feeling of resentment that the people&apos;s repre-sentatives in Parliament are, from day to day, too little in control of what is going on in government and that the electorate is given an opportunity to change its representatives only at the time most favourable to those already in power.The growth of ad hoc bodies304. A number of our witnesses expressed strong disapproval of the growth of what are generally referred to as ad hoc bodies that is, bodies appointedby the government to execute or advise on particular specialised functions.As we noted in the last chapter, there are now some hundreds of these bodies.They encompass a wide range of government activity, including the nationalised industries, broadcasting, health, education, regional planning, water resources,countryside preservation, forestry, tourism, culture, sport and many other fields. The principal complaint is that they are not democratically elected andin practice are often not accountable to anyone.305. The complaint comes mainly from representatives of local authorities.The authorities are critical of the way in which they, the elected representativesof the people, have been passed over when the administration of new govern-ment functions has been decided upon. They consider that many of the functionsgiven to ad hoc bodies, particularly those of an executive kind, ought instead to have been allocated to them. The ways in which the health services and (inEngland and Wales) the water services are now being reorganised, with somefunctions being taken away from local authorities and placed under appointedbodies at the regional and local level, have occasioned widespread dissatisfaction-tion, as being out of keeping with the declared intention to strengthen localgovernment. Many local authorities also resent the fact that the regional economic planning councils are not rooted in local government.306. The complainants say that because the central government is functionallyorganised it is naturally predisposed to think in terms of functional nominatedbodies when new government responsibilities have to be allocated. It is recog-nised that in the past the geographical areas covered by local authorities havesometimes not been suitable for the new functions to be performed, or that theauthorities have been too small and not sufficiently well served by good calibrecouncillors and staff to inspire confidence in their administrative and technicalability to exercise the new functions satisfactorily. But with the reorganisation of local government into larger and more powerful units, and with improvingefficiency, local government leaders think that in future there should be much less reason for setting up ad hoc bodies. They believe that many of the functions which have to be performed below the level of the central government shouldbe well within the capabilities of the large new authorities, acting eitherindividually or working together in small groups to cover an area of regional size.
307. The burden of the evidence we have received is that the drift towardsgovernment by nominated bodies has gone too far. It is generally felt that where these bodies perform functions which cannot sensibly be performed bya democratically-elected body, they should at least be made answerable to sucha body in some way which will ensure that the views and the pressures of the electorate are brought more directly to bear on their activities.Other complaints about the weakening of democracy308. The other complaints about the weakening of democracy are inter-related. Before dealing with them individually it will be helpful to outline thegeneral picture into which they fit. We are here moving into a vaguer area of discontent. People are uneasy about the working of government, often without being quite sure who or what is to blame or what needs to be done to remedy the situation. The unease arises from a general feeling that the reasonableexpectations of a society living under a democratic system of government arenot being satisfied. In varying degrees people are disenchanted with governmentbecause, although it is elected by the people and is supposed to serve their needs and wishes, in practice it has developed a momentum of its own which seemsto leave them out of account. Consequently there are complaints that govern-ment is remote from the people and too much carried on in secret, andthat it has enlarged its activities at the expense of individual freedom without giving effective guidance to the public on how to deal with the multitude ofgovernment organisations and without providing adequate machinery for appealsagainst administrative decisions and for the remedy of grievances. People tendto feel that government is not in touch with them, and is not sufficiently sensitiveto their views and feelings. So much now happens between elections, or appearsnot to be influenced by the outcome of elections, that the right to vote for a parliamentary candidate once every five years or so has come to seem an inadequate expression of the democratic will.309. Not all of these complaints are strictly related to constitutional reform in the sense that they might be remedied by the creation of new institutions orby other legislative action. But they are at the very centre of the relationship between government and people and cannot be ignored in any discussion of constitutional questions. In the paragraphs which follow we attempt to explaina little more fully what the problems are.Participation and communication310. At the time of our appointment there had been much discussion of a desire for greater participation in government. There had not emerged any clearidea of the form which that participation should take, and one of our most difficult problems has been to determine what &quot;participation&quot; might mean inpractice and how strong and widespread the desire for it is.311. Greater participation could be achieved by giving existing elected representatives more control over what government is doing, or by increasingthe numbers of elected representatives, or by providing for more involvementin government activities in particular fields by persons not necessarily electedbut in some way representing the general public. It could also take the form ofmore prior consultation with people affected by government decisions, or bettercommunication generally between government and people so that the electorate
was made to feel less remote from government. Participation could be more effective still if there were greater opportunities for it to be exercised locally;many people would be able to play an effective part in government only intheir own localities, and there they would be knowledgeable and understandingabout local issues and readily accessible to those affected by their decisions.312. The strength of the desire for all these different kinds of participationcannot be precisely gauged. The evidence and other information available tous does not for the most part clearly distinguish one from another. There iscertainly a substantial demand for a greater measure of control by existingelected representatives, which is the first method of increasing participation.That much is clear from what we have already said about the workings ofParliament and about the activities of ad hoc bodies.313. There are also some indications that it might be desirable to increasethe numbers of elected representatives, which is the second method. There isthe desire, mainly expressed by people involved in local government, to replaceappointed bodies by elected bodies wherever possible. There is also the demand,not unanimous but substantial, for new elected assemblies in Scotland andWales. And while there is not the same clear evidence of such a demand in the regions of England, it is argued by some respected advocates of devolutionthat a latent demand exists. Yet, despite the increase in the scope, scale and complexity of government, the total number of elected representatives at all levels is actually being reduced. This will be the effect of the current reformsof local government and it is causing some concern, at least to people in localgovernment.314. On the evidence of the attitude survey there is a substantial minority of people (perhaps as many as 20 or 25 per cent.) who consider that they have the basic ability to play some part in government. We do not know how far these people want to play a part in government and what proportion of them would if given the opportunity put themselves forward for election. We can only saythat the potential is there. And it is to be expected that rising standards ofeducation will increase the pool of qualified people.315. Some people who would not consider elective office might be preparedto serve in a more limited way. One such way would be to share in the thirdkind of increased participation we have mentioned more involvement ingovernment activities by bodies representing the general public. In many quarters non-elected bodies are unpopular, but there will continue to be a need for bodies performing advisory or consumer-watchdog functions, orfulfilling an appeal role, and it will not be practicable for all such bodies tobe directly elected. Many of our witnesses, particularly those representing someEnglish regions, were, for limited regional purposes, generally happy with a pattern of representation which included no directly-elected persons but which reflected a wide range of non-government interests such as industry andthe trade unions, education and so on, and allowed for some indirectly-elected representatives from local government. In this more limited field of participationthe demand is probably not so much for more direct election as for more effective influence. People do not like to be appointed to government advisorybodies and then find that their advice is ignored.
316. That leads on to the next possibility-more prior consultation with thoseactually affected by government decisions. This could be achieved throughrepresentative bodies or through direct contact with the public. The compli-cations surrounding the idea of greater consultation are admittedly immense.All fields of government and all types of decisions are concerned, fromimportant constitutional issues which some people would like to see subjected to a referendum down to quite small planning decisions which may neverthelesshave a marked effect on people&apos;s lives. We can only record our opinion that,whatever the difficulties may be, there exists a widespread desire for moreconsultation.317. Finally, there is the more elusive concept of general communication between government and people a state of mutual trust and understanding which enables each to appreciate the position of the other so that the peopleon the one hand will recognise the difficulties of government and the limitations on what it can do, and government on the other hand will be fully and con-tinuously aware of what the people think about it and expect of it, We believethat in this sense there is at present a wide gap in communication. This beliefis explicitly supported by the attitude survey and there are echoes of it in our general evidence. Several witnesses suggested that the chief fault of governmentis its inability to communicate directly and simply with the people. One essential element which seems to be missing is a demonstrated willingness on the partof government to listen as well as to inform. Put simply, the contention is thatgovernment needs to do more to discover and understand the views and problems of ordinary people. It should reach out more to maintain contact with the individual. We return to this subject in Part IX.318. Whatever its precise nature and strength may be, the desire for increasedparticipation and communication has not yet crystallised into general support for a particular set of constitutional proposals. Although some proposals are contained in our evidence, the public at large evidently has no clear idea ofwhat needs to be done. There is a vague and diffuse feeling of dissatisfaction with government in general, and some evidence that people think the system could be improved; but, with the exception of devolution and possibly also of the proposal for a referendum on entry into the European Communities,no specific constitutional ideas have attracted popular support. Popularsupport for devolution, in the sense that there is a wide public interest in itand it is commonly spoken about at election time, is largely confined to Scotlandand Wales. Although the attitude survey suggests that people in the english regions could also become interested in some kind of devolution, so far their interest in it does not constitute a popular demand. And popular interest in a referendum on entry into the European Communities, although according toour impression fairly widespread throughout Britain, arose out of a particularand transient situation and against the background of referenda being held inother countries faced with the same decision. It did not appear to be part of ageneral and continuous demand for referenda on all important issues.Secrecy in government319. In recent years one aspect of communication that has attracted specificcomplaint is the alleged lack of openness in the conduct of government policymaking and administration. It is almost a matter of general agreement that,
leaving aside security issues, too much government is carried on in secret.At least, few seem prepared to argue to the contrary. The most outspoken criticssay that secrecy in government, although represented as being in the publicinterest, is often merely in the interest of Ministers and civil servants. Theycontend that executive secrecy in a much-governed country denies the knowledgewhich is essential for an informed public opinion, and inhibits effective scrutinyand criticism of the government and administration. Green Papers that is,government papers of a consultative nature, introduced a few years ago asa step towards more open debate of government policy have been criticised as being almost as firm in their conclusions as White Papers, and as tending to push the governments favoured solutions. There is a demand for more opengovernment and administration which would encourage wider public debate in the light of full information before conclusions are reached. While it is recognised that this might sometimes cause delay, it is said that in practice theincreased public debate would be likely to relate mainly to policies which werein any case of a long-term nature.320. While there is substance in these criticisms, we think that the expecta-tions of some critics are probably unrealistic. The whole question of secrecyis bound up with delicate problems of diplomacy and practical administration which cannot simply be ignored in the interests of more open government.The undermining of civil liberties321. Another complaint is that institutions of government are exercisingmore and more power over the individual without adequate safeguards being provided to ensure that they treat him fairly. It has been put to us that the law relating to civil liberties and the right to redress leaves scope for the uncheckedabuse of administrative discretion; and that where there is provision for the remedy of individual grievances it is often not effective in ensuring that justiceis done. Ordinary people tend to be confused by the wide range of governmentinstitutions, and are said to have difficulty in discovering, let alone defending,their rights. The attitude survey suggests that a substantial minority have atsome time had specific grievances which have either not been dealt with satis-factorily or have not been presented, often because the individual was reluctant to tackle the organisation concerned or did not know where to go.322. Fears about the encroachment of government on the freedom and rights of the individual have led to various suggestions for reform. Someadvocate a general Bill of Rights a basic code of rights and freedoms whichthe citizen could fall back on in all circumstances and others a comprehensive system of administrative courts to which the citizen could appeal when aggrievedby a government decision which went against him. Another suggestion is thatthe scope and powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for administration should be extended. More generally, it has been pointed out that if the moderntendency towards the hiving off of government functions to separate agenciescontinues, the case for introducing additional checks on administration toprotect the individual citizen will be even stronger.General assessment of complaints about the weakening of democracy323. Whereas over-centralisation has been criticised for many years, and is awell-established cause of dissatisfaction, it is only comparatively recently that
people have become uneasy about the general weakening of democracy in the ways that we have just described. Our task of analysis would have been easierif public opinion had crystallised a little further. We are faced with a variety of complaints the precise strength of which it is difficult to gauge. Some of themappear overstated. Some owe their existence largely to academic opinion andhave not yet had a real chance of becoming generally established by public discussion. But it is significant that notwithstanding our known primary interestin regional devolution we were quickly made aware of all these complaints about government which are not essentially regional in character. A good numberof our witnesses regarded them as the main subject of their evidence, eitherignoring regional devolution or treating it as secondary. And some of theircomplaints are obviously important. For many people they may reflect what is,in their view, most wrong with government.conclusion324. We do not wish to give the impression that we have found evidenceof seething discontent throughout the land. We have not. Although the peopleof Great Britain have less attachment to their system of government than in thepast, in our opinion it cannot be said that they are seriously dissatisfied with it.Some dissatisfaction is to be expected, particularly in view of the wide and growing ambit of government responsibility. Because the lives of people arenow so much more affected by government than in the past, there are many more potential grounds for discontent. Other advanced countries face similar problems, and for similar reasons. That is no justification for concluding thatthe problems are insoluble. But it seems inevitable that in picking our way through the field of complaints we shall find some that arise from defects whichwill simply have to be tolerated, and others that arise from defects which areincapable of cure by changing the machinery of the constitution and which canbe made more tolerable only by changes in attitude and practice. No systemof government anywhere ever did or ever will leave the people with nothing togrumble about. But many of the complaints relate to defects which can atleast be partially remedied. And some sources of complaint which have not sofar given rise to particularly vigorous or widespread protest nevertheless contain the seeds of more serious dissatisfaction which may arise in future if remedial action is not taken.
NATIONAL FEELING325. In the last chapter we discussed the dissatisfaction with governmentwhich is common to the people of Great Britain as a whole. We now consider how, in some parts of the country, the nature and extent of that dissatisfactionare influenced by national feeling and by the existence of national institutions.We start with a brief enquiry into the nature of national feeling and the different forms that it may take. We then trace the development of the Scottish and welsh nationalist movements in favour of political separation from the rest ofthe United Kingdom and assess their significance. Finally, we consider the ways in which less extreme forms of national feeling affect people&apos;s attitudesto the present system of government.the nature of national feelingNational identity326. It is possible to argue endlessly about the meaning of the word &quot;nation&quot;and whether a particular group of people do or do not have a separate nationalidentity. The factors which have to be taken into account include geography,history, race, language and culture. But these, whether looked at singly or in combination, do not provide a conclusive answer. Some of our witnessesconsidered that the best judges were the people themselves; and that if a group of people think of themselves as a separate nation then nothing more is needed to demonstrate the existence of that nation. The claim clearly has greatervalidity if it secures a measure of recognition by others.327. Our terms of reference refer to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and thus appear to accept the claims to separatenational identity made on behalf of the Scottish and Welsh peoples. The manydiscussions we have had with the Scots and the Welsh have given ample evidenceof the existence of this sense of nationhood, often strongly felt even by thosewho have no desire to see much change in the existing arrangements for thegovernment of Scotland and Wales and who are proud also of their british nationality. The fact is that the word &quot;nation&quot; is used to mean very many different things. To some people it has an intensely political significance, whileby others it is regarded as relating more to cultural matters.328. If the peoples of Scotland and Wales have separate national identities,then so also have the English. But although English people value their ownparticular heritage, they readily identify themselves for the purposes of govern-ment with the United Kingdom as a whole, and their complaints against government do not have a particularly English flavour. English nationalismtherefore poses no problems for us.329. Within England there is in Cornwall a very small minority which claimsa separate national identity for the Cornish people and considers that thisshould be acknowledged and recognised by separate arrangements for their government. The early inhabitants of Cornwall were of Celtic origin. The

It is possible to argue endlessly about the meaning of the word &quot;nation&quot;and whether a particular group of people do or do not have a separate nationalidentity. The factors which have to be taken into account include geography,history, race, language and culture. But these, whether looked at singly or in combination, do not provide a conclusive answer. Some of our witnessesconsidered that the best judges were the people themselves; and that if a group of people think of themselves as a separate nation then nothing more is needed to demonstrate the existence of that nation. The claim clearly has greatervalidity if it secures a measure of recognition by others.327. Our terms of reference refer to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and thus appear to accept the claims to separatenational identity made on behalf of the Scottish and Welsh peoples. The manydiscussions we have had with the Scots and the Welsh have given ample evidenceof the existence of this sense of nationhood, often strongly felt even by thosewho have no desire to see much change in the existing arrangements for thegovernment of Scotland and Wales and who are proud also of their british nationality. The fact is that the word &quot;nation&quot; is used to mean very many different things. To some people it has an intensely political significance, whileby others it is regarded as relating more to cultural matters.328. If the peoples of Scotland and Wales have separate national identities,then so also have the English. But although English people value their ownparticular heritage, they readily identify themselves for the purposes of govern-ment with the United Kingdom as a whole, and their complaints against government do not have a particularly English flavour. English nationalismtherefore poses no problems for us.329. Within England there is in Cornwall a very small minority which claimsa separate national identity for the Cornish people and considers that thisshould be acknowledged and recognised by separate arrangements for their government. The early inhabitants of Cornwall were of Celtic origin. The
Anglo-Saxon settlement of England did not extend to their territory, and thepeople of Cornwall continued to be Celtic. Cornwall has, however, beengoverned as part of England for a thousand years and, despite its individualcharacter and strong sense of regional identity, there is no evidence that its people generally have a wish to see it separated for the purposes of government from the rest of England. What they do want is recognition of the fact thatCornwall has a separate identity and that its traditional boundaries shall be respected. While we studied with interest evidence presented to us1, we havenot been able to identify ways in which this demand could be met within anyframework of constitutional change that we would consider appropriate. Wehave noted that in the current local government reorganisation Cornwall is toretain its county status within its historic boundaries. That decision may beexpected to reassure those who feared for CornwalTs survival as a unit ofgovernment. More might, however, be done on the question of status. Just asthe people of Scotland and Wales tend to resent the description of their countries as regions of the United Kingdom, so the people of Cornwall regard their partof the United Kingdom as not just another English county. The creation of the duchy of Cornwall in the fourteenth century may have been in some respectsa mark of English overlordship, but it established a special and enduringrelationship between Cornwall and the Crown. Use of the designation on all appropriate occasions would serve to recognise both this special relationshipand the territorial integrity of Cornwall, on which our witnesses laid great stress.330. The only two claims to separate national identity with which we deal,therefore, are those of the Scots and the Welsh, and the question for us is whether in these cases the existence of national feeling gives rise to a needfor change in political institutions. In answering this question we have no rulesto guide us. There are many examples of multi-nation states throughout theworld, and just as many different systems of government trying to cater for theparticular problems which such states present. Each state must fashion a system which fits its own peculiar history and conditions. For Scotland and Wales wehave received suggestions ranging from complete political separation to theretention with little change of the existing arrangements.331. We have been impressed by the number of people in both Scotlandand Wales who see little need for change but who nevertheless show a keenawareness of a separate national identity and a firm resolve to preserve it.Most Englishmen would probably be surprised to hear the United Kingdomspoken of as a multi-nation state. What many Scots and Welshmen consider apartnership of nations, the average Englishman tends to regard as one nationcomprising different kinds of people. For him, the United Kingdom is a wholepatchwork of communities. Thus, a person brought up in Brighton recognises that the Scots and Welsh are different from himself, but so too are peopleborn and bred in Yorkshire or Tyneside, or for that matter in Birmingham.And though he may regard the Scots and the Welsh as rather more different in degree than the others, it probably does not occur to him that there is any difference in kind. All have British nationality, and he will not think of aseparate Scottish or Welsh nationality except as something belonging to history and having no present-day political significance.1 See Written Evidence,&apos;Vol. 8.
332. Although there is no ill-will or intended discourtesy in this attitude ofthe English, people in Scotland and Wales are much irritated by it. It fails torecognise the special character of their separate identity, of which they them-selves are keenly conscious and proud; and at the same time it implies thatthe resentment which they feel arises only because they are living in the past and getting agitated about something which is no longer important.National feeling in Scotland333. Feeling on this issue is perhaps particularly strong in Scotland, forwhich the present system of government is rightly seen as being based historicallyon a union freely negotiated between two nations of equal status, and peoplevery much resent the tendency in England to regard Scotland as just anotherprovince. Throughout our discussions in Scotland there was an assumption bywitnesses that in any new constitutional arrangements Scotland should beequated with England as a whole, and not with individual regions of England.This view is held so strongly that some people in Scotland who want a scottish assembly think that there should be an assembly for England also, even though there may be no demand for it. The underlying feeling is that, whatever is done,Scotland should be placed on a par with England.334. This Scottish view of the status of Scotland in relation to that ofEngland is not generally appreciated by English people, and the issue is not one which is much brought to their notice. Expatriate Scots do not usuallyflaunt their Scottishness before the people in England with whom they live and work. These Scots are the ones who are prepared, if only temporarily, toleave Scotland behind. Many become anglicised, and especially among themore successful of them there is a tendency to develop a cosmopolitan outlookin which there is little room for Scottish nationalism. The Englishman seesfew home-based Scots. He is not exposed to the full flavour of Scottish lifenorth of the border, and consequently does not appreciate the strength ofnational feeling which still exists there.National feeling in Wales335. National feeling in Wales differs to some extent from that in Scotland.In Scotland the emphasis is placed largely, though by no means exclusively,on economic considerations. There is a sense of grievance that the contractmade in 1707 between two partners of equal status seems to have turned outbetter for England than for Scotland, and there is a demand by Scots to managetheir own economy. In Wales, while the economic factor is also important innationalist thinking, it is closely associated with a desire to preserve and foster the Welsh language and culture. We have formed the impression that evenamong Welsh people with extreme nationalist sympathies there is not so stronga desire for a complete break with England as there is among nationalists inScotland. Welsh people with nationalist leanings seem more prepared to contemplate the continuance of some kind of unity with England. They insist,however, that this must be in such a form as will ensure the preservation oftheir national identity, which they believe to be at risk, and which indeed,because of the closer connexions with England, is more vulnerable than thatof Scotland. Scottish nationalists appear rather to feel that the achievement ofpolitical independence would make possible the independent management of
the economy to the marked advantage of Scotland, and that this in turn would bring those cultural and other advances needed to maintain the Scottishtraditions and way of life.The effect of economic conditions336. Although considerations of economics may not be the main drivingforce of Welsh nationalism, they are still an important element in it. It is interesting to note that the stirrings of Welsh national consciousness underOwain Glyn Dwr at the end of the fourteenth century have been attributedmainly to the disastrous economic consequences of the Black Death. In moderntimes also, there is probably some relationship between adverse economicconditions and the growth of nationalist movements. In periods of prosperityfor Scotland and Wales, wounds to national pride can be more easily tolerated;but when these countries suffer economic depression, even if only by comparisonwith the more prosperous parts of England, public discussion in Scotland andWales mounts, the sense of community is heightened and more people are drawn to nationalist policies, either as a long-term solution to their problemsor as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the government to do more forthem immediately within the existing system. We have no doubt that dis-satisfaction with economic conditions in both Scotland and Wales was oneof the main causes of the increase in support given to the nationalist parties in the period leading up to our appointment.337. One view is that material well-being is the beginning and the end of theproblem, and that if it were possible to ensure reasonable prosperity in Scotlandand Wales, nationalism would never be heard of again except from a fewextremists. This view appears too simple. It is true that the claims of nationalismwere subordinated to other demands in Scotland and Wales when heavyindustry flourished there in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries andall parts of the United Kingdom shared the fruits of imperial success. Butpolitical nationalism made little headway during the inter-war depression.This may have been due to a realisation that a revival of the Scottish and Welsheconomies inevitably depended on a revival of the United Kingdom economy as a whole, and a belief that alternative and untried policies were available through which this revival might be achieved. The post-war period has seena quite different situation. New political initiatives, including the adoption of strong regional policies, have been taken, but have not succeeded in raising the prosperity of Scotland and Wales to the level of that of the Midlands andSouth East of England. In these circumstances political nationalism has grown and put down stronger roots. As economic prosperity can never be absolutelyassured, the possibility of a nationalist revival in times of economic adversitywill thus always be present.Communities within Scotland and Wales338. Acknowledgement of the separate national identities of the Scots andthe Welsh should not be allowed to obsure the fact that different communitiesexist within both Scotland and Wales. The attitude survey indicates that thereis a substantial minority of people in Wales who tend to identify themselves with North or South Wales rather than with Wales as a whole, and there is a clear linguistic division between the western and eastern parts of the country.
In Scotland there are distinctive traditions in the Highlands and the Islands,and a greater tendency than elsewhere in Britain to think in terms of a townor county. It cannot be assumed that all people living in North Wales or in the highlands of Scotland would view with equanimity the prospect of government from Cardiff or Edinburgh; there may even be some who would regard rulefrom London as a lesser evil. Nevertheless it seems likely that for most peopleloyalties to communities within Scotland and Wales exist side by side with andare subordinated to a larger loyalty to Scotland or Wales as a whole. Certainlythe concept of smaller communities within Scotland and Wales is no part ofthe present nationalist platform in either country; both the Scottish NationalParty and Plaid Cymru are concerned to secure the separation of their countries from the United Kingdom as single independent nations. We have not thoughtit useful to consider any scheme of reform which did not treat each of thesecountries as a whole.the development of the scottish nationalist movement339. Modern Scottish nationalism might be said to have started in 1853,with the setting up, with a considerable measure of support from the scottish local authorities, of the National Association for the Vindication of ScottishRights. Since then the fortunes of the nationalist movement have fluctuated,and it has been subject to a number of splits and re-groupings. But the basicidea of the resumption of self-government by Scotland has continued to receive some kind of support throughout, and in more recent years the movement,while still commanding only minority support, has become a well establishedfeature of Scottish life.The earlier history of the Scottish nationalist movement340. During the second half of the nineteenth century, as governmentactivity increased and became more complex, there were complaints that Scottishbusiness was neglected in Parliament and that the arrangements for governingScotland were inadequate. Interest in constitutional change was stimulated bythe Liberal Party&apos;s policy of home rule for Ireland, and in 1886 the scottish home Rule Association was founded with the object of winning a similarmeasure of independence for Scotland. Scottish Home Rule Bills were intro-duced in Parliament in the 1920s. In the meantime a separate body, the ScotsNational League, had been advocating an independent Scotland which would determine its relationship with England on a basis of mutual agreement andequal rights. In 1928 there was formed a new National Party of Scotland, whicheffectively absorbed both the Scots National League and the Scottish Home RuleAssociation. The new party&apos;s policy, which perhaps attempted to reconcile the independence and home rule elements, was stated to be &quot;self-governmentfor Scotland with independent national status within the British group ofnations, together with reconstruction of Scottish national life&quot;.341. In 1932 the more moderate Scottish Party was founded, with a policyof home rule rather than complete independence. In 1934 it joined forces withthe National Party of Scotland to form the Scottish National Party (S.N.P.).The original programme of the S.N.P. was &quot;self-government for Scotland on abasis which will enable Scotland as a partner in the British Empire with the
same status as England to develop its national life to the fullest advantage&quot;.To achieve this objective a Parliament was to be established in Scotland as thefinal authority on all Scottish affairs, and Scotland and England were jointlyto exercise their rights and responsibilities as mother nations of the BritishEmpire. Under the influence of the moderate element, derived mainly from theScottish Party, the S.N.P. at first pursued a policy which was in effect one ofhome rule. But dissensions gradually developed between those who wished inthis way to attract the maximum support and those who wished to pursue amore extreme policy of complete independence, and in 1942 the moderatesbroke away to form the Scottish Union, later renamed the Scottish Convention,a movement aiming at home rule. The Convention secured a wide measure of popular support by using the device of the Covenant, which committed itssignatories to do everything in their power &quot;to secure for Scotland a parliament with adequate legislative authority in Scottish affairs&quot;. In a short space of timeabout half the adult population of Scotland signed this document, and thispopular agitation during the 1940s was an important element in the appoint-ment in 1952 of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs, whose recom-mendations we noted on page 28.342. Meanwhile the S.N.P. adhered to its more extreme goal of complete independence, and the policies which it formulated during the 1940s stillconstitute the basis of its platform today. The main plank in this platform isfull political independence for Scotland within the Commonwealth. It is envisaged that close economic relations would continue to be maintained with england, but on the basis of negotiations between partners of equal status.There would be no customs or other barriers to trade between the two countries,and the free movement of labour, goods and capital would continue.The nationalist revival in recent times343. In the late 1940s the S.N.P. was eclipsed for a time by the superiorpopular appeal of the Scottish Convention, which is now defunct. But in more recent years its fortunes have revived, and during the 1960s it developed and expanded to a point at which the nationalist movement could be said to have become for the first time a substantial force in Parliamentary and local govern-ment elections. Some isolated successes had been achieved in earlier years, inthe form of substantial minority votes in Parliamentary bye-elections, and for ashort period in 1945 the party had a representative in Parliament; but it wasnot until the 1960s that it developed sufficient political and organisationalstrength to make a real showing at general elections. Nationalist candiatesstood in fifteen of the seventy-one Scottish constituencies in 1964 and intwenty-three in 1966. No seats were won, but the party&apos;s share of the vote inthe constituencies contested in 1966 averaged over 14 per cent., and its totalvote exceeded 5 per cent, of all the votes cast in Scotland. By a growingminority of voters the S.N.P. came to be accepted as an alternative to the threeold-established parties. In 1967, a period of general discontent in Scotland, theparty proved to be an attractive vehicle for protest votes. In March of that year over 10,000 people voted for the S.N.P. candidate in a Parliamentary bye-election at Pollok, Glasgow; and in November the party again secured repre-sentation in Parliament through a bye-election victory at Hamilton. further evidence of this nationalist upsurge was shown a few months later, in May 1968,when the S.N.P. gained over a hundred seats in the Scottish municipal elections.
344. Thereafter the party appeared to lose some of its appeal, and it seemed that the fortunes of the nationalists were once again on the wane. In May 1970the gain of municipal seats in 1968 was largely wiped out. But at the generalelection in June 1970, although Hamilton was lost, the party retained repre-sentation in Parliament by the election of its candidate in the Western Islesconstituency; this was the first victory by a nationalist party at a generalelection. The party put up candidates in sixty-five constituencies, and securedabout 300,000 votes, over 11 per cent, of all those cast and a quarter of thenumber given to the Labour Party, which in recent years has enjoyed majoritysupport in Scotland. The S.N.P.&apos;s support was not uniform throughout Scotland,tending to be greatest outside the industrial areas. It is interesting to note thatthe Liberal Party, campaigning for home rule but not independence, securedanother 5-5 per cent, of the total vote; concentrating its effort in twenty-sevenconstituencies it captured three seats with only half the number of votes givento the S.N.P. More recently, the results of bye-elections at Stirling in September1971 and Dundee East in March 1973, where in each case the S.N.P. candidatecame second, have shown that the nationalists are still capable of making aconsiderable impact at the polls.Our assessment of Scottish nationalism345. We are not concerned here with whether Scotland should or shouldnot have independence, as the nationalists claim. That is discussed later. our task now, following this brief survey, is to gauge the nature and strength of scottish nationalism. There is no scientific way of doing this. It must necessarilyremain a matter of judgement, based on all the available evidence. Our view isthat on any impartial assessment the S.N.P. must still be accounted a small minority party which has so far failed to consolidate its political position; andon present evidence it seems unlikely that the party will gain the support of amajority of the Scottish people for its policy of complete independence. Thereis, and probably always will be, a core of Scottish nationalists who feel strongly that Scotland will achieve contentment only if it becomes completely independent and is left to work out its own destiny; but the nationalist movement throughoutits history has depended fairly heavily on the general support and sympathy of! people who would prefer something less than complete independence,perhaps some version of home rule which would give the people of Scotland a Parliament or assembly of their own. Furthermore, at its peaks of successthe movement has attracted other supporters with little, if any, interest inindependence for Scotland or anything approaching it but who, keenly aware of their Scottishness and dissatisfied with conditions in Scotland, have wanted to register a protest.346. Perhaps the greatest significance of the Scottish nationalist movementlies not in its advocacy of separatism, but in the means which it has providedfor the people of Scotland to register their feeling of national identity andpolitical importance. Nationalist voters, and the obvious sympathy which theyhave attracted from a good many others who would not themselves be preparedby their votes to endorse a separatist policy; have drawn attention to an intensity of national feeling in Scotland which people outside that country were not generally aware of. While Scottish nationalism provides no evidence that theScottish people as a whole wish to be separated from the rest of the UnitedKingdom, the nature and strength of the support it has attracted over the years
suggest that a substantial body of people in Scotland would be likely to takea favourable view of a change to a system of government which did more thanthe present system to recognise their separate Scottish identity. What that support does not measure is the strength of the body of opinion which favourscontinuation of the present system and rejects further measures of devolution(other than administrative devolution). The advocates of change tend always to be more vociferous and those interested in constitutional change in Scotlandare no exception to the rule. As is brought out later in this chapter, the fullflavour of political life and feeling in Scotland can be assessed only after consideration of the opposing point of view.the development of the welsh nationalist movement347. Political nationalism emerged in Wales at about the same time as it did in Scotland. A year after the formation of the Scottish Home RuleAssociation in 1886, a similar movement, Cymru Fydd (New Wales), was founded in Wales. It rapidly won support throughout Wales and in Parliament,where Welsh Members joined Scottish Liberals in pressing the case for home rule for their countries and in 1914 introduced a Government of Wales bill of their own. The Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, was founded in 1925,but by this time popular interest in devolution had declined and the party&apos;spolicies did not attract much support from the public at large until after theSecond World War. Since then, however, much fortified by a revival of interestin the Welsh language and culture, the Welsh nationalist movement has becomeat least as important an influence in Wales as its counterpart in Scotland.The earlier years of the Welsh nationalist movement348. Plaid Cymru was formed by a small group of people, mostly from theacademic world, who were concerned at the effects on Welsh life of what they saw as a serious decline in national consciousness. The party&apos;s original aimswere threefold: to establish a Welsh Parliament in Wales, to ensure the separaterepresentation of Wales at the League of Nations and to have the welsh language recognised as the official language of Wales. &quot;Our immediate ambition&quot;said a contemporary pamphlet &quot;is a government for Wales which shall be forthe good of Wales&quot;, and it went on to list a number of fields which were con-sidered to need separate Welsh administration, including education, transport,health, housing and the economy.349. The early electoral efforts of Plaid Cymru were not attended by muchsuccess. Even during the severe depression of the 1920s and 1930s the party&apos;scandidates gained very little support. The unemployed continued to look fixedly,if resentfully, to the government in London, apparently seeing no prospect ofsalvation under a separate system of government in Wales.The post-war growth of Welsh nationalism350. Plaid Cymru received its first real electoral encouragement in Parlia-mentary bye-elections in 1945, when its candidates in Caernarvonshire and Neatheach obtained over 6,000 votes; and in 1949 a Plaid Cymru candidate waselected a member of Carmarthenshire County Council. The growth of Welshnational feeling at about that time also found expression in the activities ofthe New Wales Union (Undeb Cymru Fydd), which carried on a campaignduring the 1950s to assess the extent of Welsh support for a Parliament in
Wales. By 1956 some 250,000 people had put their names to a petition in favourof a Welsh Parliament, and it was reported that eight out of every ten peopleapproached had agreed to sign.351. In the general elections of 1959, 1964 and 1966, Plaid Cymru put uparound a score of candidates in the thirty-six Welsh constituencies, and attractedas much as 5 per cent, of the total Welsh vote; but it was not until the 1966Carmarthenshire bye-election that the party&apos;s first Member of Parliament waselected. Other Plaid Cymru candidates did well at bye-elections in the industrialconstituencies of Rhondda West and Caerphilly in 1967 and 1968 and, as inScotland at about the same time, the party of nationalism came to be accepted as a respectable alternative to the older parties. In the process of expansionits policies have naturally undergone some change compared with the originalaims of 1925. The revised policy is full self-government for Wales as a memberof the Commonwealth, but within the economic framework of a BritishCommon Market; and the party envisages that Wales will officially become abilingual nation.352. The general election of June 1970 brought the nationalist movement areverse, in that the Carmarthenshire seat was lost, and the loss was not offset by the gain of another, as it was for the S.N.P. in Scotland. But the generalimpact of Plaid Cymru at the 1970 General Election was by no means negligible.It had candidates in all thirty-six Welsh constituencies, and captured 175,000votes like the S.N.P., rather more than 11 per cent, of the total poll. Its strengthwas apparent in both rural and industrial constituencies. The average vote foreach candidate in 1970 was over 4,800, some 60 per cent, larger than in 1966.Although twenty-five of the candidates lost their deposits, the 1970 results onthe whole provided evidence of an increase in the party&apos;s following.353. Apart from Plaid Cymru, other Welsh movements and societies have sought to foster the Welsh language and culture. Prominent among these havebeen the long-established Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, the WelshLeague of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) and the New Wales Union (UndebCymru Fydd), now dissolved. Also, since 1962, a vigorous and not alwayspeaceful campaign of protest against the alleged official neglect of the welsh language has been waged by the Welsh Language Society.Our assessment of Welsh nationalism354. In electoral terms the relative strengths of the Scottish and Welshnationalist movements are strikingly similar, but in Wales the general symapathy for nationalist ideas seems to be more widespread, even among leading figures in Welsh public life. This sympathy appears to be vested, however, in a desirenot so much for independence or home rule as for a recognition of the need to foster Welsh economic and cultural interests and for a greater say in theway in which Wales is governed.355. Voting in the 1970 general election showed the highest and mostconsistent level of support for the nationalist movement to lie, not surprisingly,among the population in the western half of the country. That is the area where Welsh is commonly spoken and which, largely through its relativegeographical remoteness, has been least influenced by the English. Theindustrialised south and the border counties, closely connected economically
and in other ways with the adjacent counties of England, are the parts of wales which are most anglicised and least convinced of the need for constitutional change. However, both in the 1970 election and in bye-elections of recentyears, Plaid Cymru established substantial pockets of support among theindustrial towns of South Wales, usually presenting a strong challenge to thesuccessful Labour candidates. The attitude survey suggests that, although there is a notable degree of sympathy among non-Welsh speakers for the ideaof preserving and teaching the Welsh language, there is also a feeling that thosewho speak Welsh would be the ones to gain most from devolution; and we have noted from our other enquiries some anxiety among non-Welsh speakers thatthe fostering of the Welsh language could lead to a form of discrimination against those who do not speak it.356. In Wales, as in Scotland, support for the nationalist cause is not, inour view, anything like sufficient to constitute a general vote for independence.The attitude survey indicates that in matters of government and the provisionof public services the spirit of independence in Wales may be less strong thanin some regions of England. But Welsh nationalism has served to focusattention on the strong desire which the people of Wales have to preserve andfoster their own identity and special interests, and this desire seems to evokeconsiderable sympathy even among Welshmen in the industrial and borderareas, whose general attitudes otherwise tend to be more akin to those of english people. It seems that, for a good many people in Wales, the distinctiveWelsh culture and language has come to assume the degree of importance which is attached to the idea of Scottish sovereignty in the minds of people in Scotland. It is interesting to speculate how far this recent revival of interestin Welsh culture is the answer of a sensitive people to the pressures anddisappointments of modern society. Whatever its inspiration, it is an importantpresent-day phenomenon which must be taken into account in any considerationof government reform in Wales.scottish and welsh views on centralisation357. We have traced the development of the movements in favour of thepolitical separation of Scotland and Wales from England, and have attempted to assess their significance. We have noted that they have only a small minoritysupport and that much larger numbers of the people in both countries whoadvocate change wish their distinctive national indentities to be recognised ina system of government in some way falling short of political separation.We now go on to consider, under the two headings of centralisation and the weakening of democracy, how in Scotland and Wales the existence of theseless extreme forms of national feeling colours the nature of dissatisfaction with government which is felt by the people of Great Britain as a whole.358. The centralisation of government in London appears to be moreresented in Scotland and Wales than it is in England. This is not simply becauseScotland and Wales are more geographically remote. Some regions of Englandare further away from London than is Wales. The greater resentment is duerather to the effect which centralisation has of devaluing the Scottish and welsh ways of life. For people in Scotland and Wales centralisation also meansanglicisation; the ways of the United Kingdom Government are regarded asEnglish ways.
359. In Scotland particularly, with its earlier history as a separate sovereign state, there is a feeling that government from London does not sufficientlyrecognise Scotland&apos;s place as an equal, if smaller, partner. For this reason many people in Scotland probably feel more strongly about centralisation than theydo about other threats to democracy. People in Wales, on the other hand,although they feel the effects of centralisation more keenly than most people in England, do not seem to resent it quite so much as people in Scotland.They fear its effect on their way of life, and are anxious to find some means ofincreasing Welsh influence in the discussion of Welsh problems; but they seemrather more prepared than people in Scotland to accept that the UnitedKingdom Government must play the dominant role. This difference of attitudemay be accounted for by the closer geographical, political and economic links with England.The allocation of public expenditure360. In the allocation of public expenditure there is already a considerable measure of Scottish and Welsh influence. The Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales are responsible for the make-up of the annual budgets covering theservices for which they are responsible. And, as is shown by the figures givenlater in paragraphs 589 to 593, public expenditure per head in these two countries is substantially higher by comparison with England than is generally recognised.Witnesses in both Scotland and Wales have attached great importance to having a Secretary of State to represent them in the Cabinet, for reasons which havealmost always included the advantages secured in the allocation of additional public expenditure. It seems that in informed circles in Scotland and wales the political stock of a Secretary of State is largely measured by the degree ofsuccess he has in persuading his Cabinet colleagues to give something extra tohis country.361. The influence of the Secretaries of State and their departments never-theless falls short of what many Scots and Welshmen would like to see. TheScottish and Welsh Offices are departments of the central government. Theirbudgets are subject to detailed Treasury scrutiny, and the policies on whichthey are based deviate from the policies applied to England only to an extentacceptable to Treasury and other Ministers. The expenditure administered bythe Scottish Office does not extend to all Scottish services, and the scope of the welsh Office budget is even more limited. The office of the Secretary of Statefor Wales dates only from 1964, and as yet the pattern of public expenditurein Wales, compared with that in Great Britain as a whole, shows deviationswhich are for the most part only marginal. In the Scottish Office, which has a rather wider range of functions and is much longer established, the influencebrought to bear on the allocation of public expenditure appears to have a greatercoherence about it: but only to a limited extent does it result in a comprehensiveset of separate Scottish policies. In some cases the Scottish Office takes the lead,but in general it adopts, without substantial variation, the policies worked outby the larger functional departments in England and applies much of its energiesto securing the additional funds needed to meet the special Scottish conditions.Any concessions secured in this way are entirely within the framework of the policies of the United Kingdom Government, of which the Secretary of Statefor Scotland is a member.Ill
362. In short, although the existence of the Scottish Office and the welsh office has enabled Scotland and Wales to secure a greater allocation of public expenditure than they might otherwise have done, many people remain dis-satisfied because they think that the present system does not enable the best use to be made of the funds provided. Scotland and Wales do not have globalallocations which they can deploy among the various services in accordancewith their own preferences. In Scotland particularly, where the Scottish office is responsible for a wide range of services, and where there has been time forthe Secretary of State system to be criticised for its defects as well as praisedfor its virtues, there is a feeling that, even if Scotland received no more in totalthan it does at present, there would be advantage in being able to use thattotal allocation in different ways.Political life in Scotland and Wales363. The existence in Scotland of national feeling and of old-establishednational institutions makes it harder for the Scottish people to tolerate the concentration of politics in London. This is particularly so during periodswhen the United Kingdom Government does not seem to be successful in overcoming Scotland&apos;s economic difficulties. At such times there is a feeling that Scotland should be given a chance to solve its own problems, perhaps bypursuing policies which might not be appropriate for the United Kingdom as awhole. It is felt that for this purpose there is a ready-made capital city in edinburgh, the nucleus of Scottish government machinery in the Scottish Officeand abundant political and administrative talent which is now either untappedor diverted to England. People who take this view feel that there is a politicalvoid in Scotland. The more the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibilities are widened,the more evident it appears to informed people that a great deal of specificallyScottish administration is going on in Scotland over which the Scottish people have no direct influence. There is a desire to see established in Scotland a forum for discussion of all this government activity, in which the Secretary of Statecan be called to account. At present the democratic channel to the Secretary ofState is through Scottish Members of Parliament at Westminster. The variety of the functions administered by his departments, and the practical necessityfor him to administer them very largely on United Kingdom lines, inevitablymake him a somewhat unsatisfying political target. The impression is easilygiven that he is reluctant to take a separate Scottish initiative in any matterof real importance, and that his hands are tied by his colleagues in the UnitedKingdom Government. Among hostile critics the opinion has developed thatthe post of Secretary of State is one for a sound party stalwart who, whenconvenient for the government, is prepared to forget that he is a Scot. That isnot the sort of champion which the people of Scotland would most like tohave.364. That is one side of the coin. But note must also be taken of those whosupport the present system. It was brought out in evidence that the over-whelming opinion among those involved in public life in Scotland was infavour of preserving the status quo. Their opinion did not seem to be based ona desire to protect their own positions; indeed, many of them might well gainpersonally from the setting up of a Scottish assembly or government. they believe that, despite all that remains to be done, Scotland has benefitedconsiderably from the present system and that the best way of helping Scotland
is to keep that system and try to increase Scottish influence within it. In replyto the demand for a new focus of political power in Scotland, they point tothe important part which their countrymen already play in the government ofboth the United Kingdom and of Scotland, and it is a fact that there is a relatively high proportion of Scots in the government and in the civil service,with the Scottish Office itself being largely staffed by Scots.365. The supporters of the present system consider that the continued existence of the Secretary of State for Scotland with a seat in the UnitedKingdom Cabinet, and the consequential right of his officials to a place oninterdepartmental committees where United Kingdom policy options areworked out, is of fundamental importance to Scottish interests. They pointout that the present system secures not only open access to United Kingdomfunds, but also a bonus in the form of a Cabinet Minister who can use political arguments to secure special treatment for Scotland. In their view, any system which tended to restrict Scotland to certain revenues or to a block allocationwould not serve Scotland so well, even if it brought political power toEdinburgh. They consider that under such a system Scotland would in practicehave little option but to accept the English lead in most fields of administration,and yet would lose its automatic right to United Kingdom standards, service by service, and presumably be without a Cabinet Minister in London to bargainfor the extras.366. Opinion in Wales is not so divided. Although there is, particularly among those involved in local government, appreciation of the benefits whichhave accrued from the establishment of the Welsh Office, there is a widelyheld feeling that there should be some kind of elected Welsh assembly. In thisrespect Wales is distinguishable from Scotland, where although some people would very much like an elected assembly others would equally strongly opposeit.367. We have already indicated that the majority of people in Wales, althoughanxious to preserve their own way of life, seem prepared to accept that in mostmatters of government Wales will continue to take its lead from Westminsterand Whitehall; but many do seem to feel very strongly that there should be anational forum for debating Welsh affairs, and for bringing the influence ofthe Welsh people more directly to bear on Welsh problems. Indeed, many ofour Welsh witnesses were prepared to assert that there should be an elected assembly while having no clear idea of what it would do. The important thingfor them seemed to be the opportunity for democratically elected representa-tives of the Welsh people to have their say about what the government is doingin Wales, though we have noted a tendency during the time we have beensitting for opinion in Wales to move more in favour of an assembly withspecific functions.368. In both Scotland and Wales the pressure for an elected assembly owessomething to the revival of nationalism, but a contributory cause in scotland has been the fairly widespread feeling that the Scottish Office has now acquiredin relation to the government of Scotland too much power to be exercisedwithout closer democratic oversight in Scotland itself. In Wales, where theoffice of Secretary of State is much newer, this feeling has not yet developed
to the same extent; but indications of it are already present, and much commenthas centred around the fact that the Welsh Council, despite its increasinginfluence, is appointed and not elected. Opinion in Wales in favour of a national assembly seems to have grown quickly, and to be more widespread than inScotland; but whereas most of those who argue in favour of a Scottish assembly would like to see it take over substantial powers from the United KingdomGovernment, most of those who gave evidence in Wales saw a Welsh assemblymore as a Welsh dimension of United Kingdom politics than as a body with power to rival Westminster.Attitudes to government and devolution369. The fact that in most ways Wales has closer connexions with Englandthan Scotland has, and is not quite so resentful of centralisation, is reflected inthe findings of the attitude survey. People were asked how they thought the government&apos;s understanding of the needs of their particular part of Britaincompared with its understanding of the needs of other parts. In Britain as awhole 10 per cent, thought that the needs of their part of the country were better understood than those of other parts; 61 per cent, thought that their needs were understood to about the same extent as those of other parts, while21 per cent, thought that their needs were less well understood. Within this general pattern the answers given in Scotland and Wales reflected an aboveaverage level of discontent, particularly in Scotland. In Wales 39 per cent,thought that their needs were less well understood, about the same percentageas in the South West and the North, which had much the highest figures ofany of the English regions. In Scotland, however, the figure was 49 per cent.,easily the highest in Britain. The significance of this figure can be appreciatedwhen it is compared with that for, say, the West Midlands, where only 11 percent, thought that the needs of the region were less well understood than thoseof other regions; in the East Midlands and the South East the percentages wereeven lower. The South East of England was in fact the only part of the country where any substantial body of people felt that their needs were better understoodthan those of other parts.370. Differences between Scotland and Wales also came out in the answers to questions designed to test people&apos;s general reactions to the idea ofdevolution1. Of all the people in Great Britain, those in Scotland appearedmost favourably disposed to devolution, whereas the general body of favourableopinion in Wales was no greater than the average for all the regions ofEngland.371. It appeared, moreover, that there was some doubt in Wales aboutthe benefits of devolution. In the minds of a good many Welsh people themaintenance of United Kingdom standards in Wales may be rather moreimportant than devolution. Even so, the Welsh are second only to the Scotsin having prominently in mind the idea of self-determination. When asked what improvements they themselves would like to see, 20 per cent, of thosequestioned in Scotland and 9 per cent, of those questioned in Wales spon-taneously suggested more self-government or home rule, compared with only  per cent, in the English regions. Although the response in Scotland and1 For the detailed figures and their interpretation see Research Paper 7, Table 45.
Wales can no doubt be attributed partly to frequent public discussion of the concept, which is seldom raised in the English regions, the findings aresignificant in assessing attitudes to devolution.372. Even in Scotland, however, where on any basis of assessment support for devolution is greatest, concern for the preservation of existing standardsweighs heavily; only one-sixth of the 73 per cent, in Scotland who favouredeither more decision making there or the transfer of complete responsibilitysaid that they would still take that view if it meant that people in scotland would actually be worse off than they are now. Support for devolution inScotland appears to be associated with an assumption (held by many even inthe days before the discovery of North Sea oil) that it would bring about animprovement in the material welfare of the people. The possible effect of devolution on standards of provision, which we have already discussed in theprevious chapter, is just as important for Scotland as it is for the rest of GreatBritain. Even though Scots appear to favour devolution in principle more than other people do, there are few Scots who are so dissatisfied with the presentcentralised system of government that they would support devolution even ifit made them worse off.Scottish legislation373. In discussing Great Britain as a whole we have referred to the complaint that over-centralisation has produced congestion in Parliament. In scotland the existence of a separate system of domestic law has introduced additionalcomplications and grounds for complaint. It has been put to us that there is insufficient understanding of Scots law in London, and that its peculiarities arenot sufficiently catered for by United Kingdom legislation. It is said that legislation is often applied to Scotland by the inclusion of Scottish applicationclauses in a Great Britain Bill when what is really needed is a separate ScottishBill drafted in the idiom of the Scottish legal system. This method of draftingcauses difficulties for Scottish lawyers and hampers the preservation anddevelopment of Scottish legal concepts. It is contended also that the existenceof an &quot;absentee&quot; legislature in London, remote from Scottish public opinion,results in pressure for Scots law to be changed in conformity with English lawrather than on merits.374. Problems of distance make it difficult for Scottish lawyers to pursue their profession, which must necessarily be carried on in Scotland, and at thesame time engage in United Kingdom politics. As a result, very few Scottishlawyers are elected to Parliament, and the expert influence which is exerted onlegislation for England and Wales by the many Members of Parliament whoare qualified in English law is almost totally lacking in relation to legislation for Scotland. This in turn means that too much reliance has to be placed on asmall number of Parliamentary draftsmen working in London.scottish and welsh views on the weakening of democracy375. Most of the complaints about the weakening of democracy in Scotlandand Wales are essentially the same as those made in England, but there are some additional points which are worth mentioning.
The concern for democracy376. The concern for democracy seems to be particularly strong in Wales.This strength of feeling shows itself in the widespread demand for an electedWelsh assembly, and in the vigorous criticism of appointed ad hoc bodies.Such bodies have proliferated in Wales perhaps only a little more than else-where in Britain, but they appear to attract far more resentment. The mostcommon proposal for equipping an elected Welsh assembly with functions isto make it responsible for all or most of the functions now exercised in Walesby ad hoc bodies. It is usually suggested that the activities of these bodies should either be carried out by the assembly itself, working through expert committees,or be made the subject of annual reports which can be questioned and debatedby the assembly.377. As we have already indicated, the Welsh Council appointed by theSecretary of State for Wales has been the subject of criticism of this kind.Within a matter of a few years it has come to seem natural to many Welshpeople that such a body should be elected and not appointed. Criticism of theScottish Economic Council, its counterpart in Scotland, has been directed lessagainst its constitution than against the way it operates. It seems that in scotland the idea of appointed advisers is not generally objected to, but it is felt that inpractice there is too much control by the Secretary of State over what they are doing and insufficient scope for them to recommend independent policies forScotland.The impact of the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office378. We have described the gap in communication which seems to exist between government and people throughout Great Britain. Additional evidenceof this is provided in Scotland and Wales by questions in the attitude surveydesigned to test people&apos;s knowledge of the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office.379. More than half those questioned in Scotland had evidently not heardof the Scottish Office 34 per cent, thought that there was no such office and18 per cent, did not know of it. The remaining 48 per cent, knew that theScottish Office existed, but were largely ignorant of its responsibilities. Knowledgeof the Welsh Office in Wales was not much greater 56 per cent, knew of it,30 per cent, did not think it existed, and 14 per cent, had no opinion. Again,very few people had much idea of the responsibilities involved.380. It appears that, whatever other achievements may be credited to theScottish Office and the Welsh Office, neither has made a clear impression onthe public at large. This finding is significant in two ways. In the first place it provides corroboration in Scotland and Wales of the general conclusion thatgovernment is out of touch with the people. This corroboration must be accounted particularly strong in Scotland, where the Scottish Office has beenestablished in its present form since 1939 and is now responsible for admini-stering a wide range of domestic services. Secondly, the general ignorance ofthe government responsibilities already exercised in Scotland and Wales tends to cast doubt on the quality of the support shown in the attitude survey forfurther devolution. What value should be placed on favourable responses tothe idea of greater devolution if they come from people who do not knowhow much devolution exists already?
381. In our early discussions, before the attitude survey was carried out, itwas suggested to us that, but for a failure of communication on the part of theScottish Office, the popular support attracted by the Scottish National Partyin the years leading up to our appointment would not have been forthcoming.The suggestion was that if the activities of the Scottish Office had received morepublicity, and steps had been taken to see that people in Scotland knew andunderstood what was already being done for them, then much less sympathywould have been developed for the nationalist cause. There is some support forthis view in the attitude survey, which indicates that those who opted for thegreatest degree of devolution tended to have least knowledge of the presentsystem. On the other hand, those respondents who wanted to keep the presentsystem were also generally among those who knew least about it. The people in between, who favoured a moderate degree of devolution, were on the whole the most knowledgeable.382. These results of the attitude survey are not of course in the samecategory as the evidence which we have received from informed witnesses, andit would be unwise to read too much into them, but they do perhaps raise apresumption that many of the people who favour the more extreme kinds of devolution do not really understand the issues involved and are simplyexpressing a general feeling of dissatisfaction and an interest in change. Andalthough respondents in the survey who favoured more moderate forms of devolution tended to be more knowledgeable, it seems that their knowledgewas still very scanty. Those who conducted the survey think that the answersgiven by many people to questions about the existing system were based oncommon sense guesswork rather than on known facts.383. In general our comments about the impact of the Scottish Office inScotland apply also to the impact of the Welsh Office in Wales. It has to beremembered that the establishment of the Welsh Office is much more recentthan that of the Scottish Office, and its responsibilities are more restricted.Anyone concerned to defend the record of the Welsh Office might argue thatdespite its short life it has already apparently made a slightly greater impression on the public than the Scottish Office, and that given more time it could do better. It is difficult however to get round the fact that in 1970, after six yearsof activity, and the publicity attendant on its creation, 44 per cent, of thepeople questioned in Wales did not even know that the Welsh Office existed,much less what it did.summary384. Most Scottish and Welsh people have a particular allegiance to theirown countries which they find no difficulty in reconciling with their loyalty tothe United Kingdom as a whole. The nationalist policy of complete independenceis not supported by anything like a majority of people in either Scotland orWales. But the nationalist cause has attracted a good deal of general sympathy and has focused attention on the strength of national feeling which exists in both countries. The question for us is whether this feeling gives rise to a needfor a change in political institutions.385. Complaints about centralisation and the weakening of democracy arise in Scotland and Wales, as they do in England. In Scotland particularly, centralisation-tion is resented rather more than it is in England; and its effects are complicated
in both Scotland and Wales by the existence of the Scottish Office and the welsh Office as outposts of central government. These offices, under theirSecretaries of State, have undoubtedly been effective in securing additional benefits for Scotland and Wales; but they appear to have made no very clearimpression on the public at large, and the present system is criticised as notenabling them to develop a distinctively coherent set of policies for theirrespective countries and lacking in democratic accountability.386. There is a good deal of popular support in Scotland for an electedScottish assembly, but there is also a strong opposing body of opinion which includes many people experienced in government. Support for an elected assembly in Wales is more widespread, although at least until recently most people have tended to see it as a forum for the effective expression of Welshopinion and as a democratic check rather than as a body with wide executive powers.387. Dissatisfaction with government and support for the devolution of power from London are both probably greater in Scotland than in any other part of Britain. But, as in Wales, many people who favour more devolutionapparently do not realise the extent of administrative devolution which already exists, and they appear to have little idea of the complicated issues which wouldbe involved in further devolutionary reform. Discontent with government in wales is less than in Scotland, but still above the average for Britain as a whole,and among an active and generally well informed minority there is a closeinterest in some kind of devolution. The interest in devolution of the Welshpeople at large, however, may be no greater than it is on average in England.Even in Scotland, where interest in devolution is greatest of all, few people are so dissatisfied with the present centralised system of government that they would support devolution even if it was likely to lower their living standards.
PART IVGENERAL PRINCIPLES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES388. In the preceding chapters we have described what are thought to be the defects in the present system of government. We now seek to determine thegeneral principles that should underlie any reform. This involves looking beyondparticular problems to the wider aspects of constitution making.389. We have already given our reasons for refraining from a root and branchexamination of the whole British constitution1. We are not attempting in thisReport to lay down a complete blue-print for the future, or to furnish theUnited Kingdom with a written constitution. Nevertheless the difficulties anddiscontents which led to our appointment have widespread implications andmay call for quite radical reforms. We therefore think it right; before looking atpossible remedies, to consider what the underlying general principles of ourconstitutional arrangements should be.390. The general subject matter of a constitution is clear enough. It deals with&quot;the rules governing the composition, powers, and methods of operation of themain institutions of government, and the general principles applicable to the irrelations to the citizens&quot;2. But the extent to which these rules and principlesare formulated in any particular constitution is a matter of choice. This can be demonstrated quite simply by comparing the lengths of those constitutionswhich are fully set down in writing. The 1948 constitution of Ceylon (nowSri Lanka), for example, could be set out in twenty-five pages, whereas the indian constitution requires more than 250 pages. The difference is due not only to thefact that India is much larger and more complicated socially, but also to thedesire of Ceylon to have a short and flexible constitution and of India to have along and rigid one3. There are no golden rules about how detailed a constitution should be, or what exactly it should contain. Whatever its form or content,conventions will grow up around it. The important thing in our view is that itshould suit both the character of the people and the times in which they are living.It should reflect the people&apos;s history, traditions and social attitudes in such away that it will be readily accepted as a natural development out of what has gone before. It should have regard also to foreseeable changes in the political,economic and social fields both at home and abroad. Constitutional arrange-ments are meant to last, and must try to anticipate the strains of the future.391. Bearing in mind these requirements we look first at the domestic situation of the United Kingdom and then at its position as a member of the internationalcommunity. Finally, in the light of that discussion, we attempt to formulatesome general principles which we think ought to be kept in view in any con-sideration of particular proposals for constitutional reform. Throughout this chapter we use the term United Kingdom mainly with Great Britain in mind,though most of what we say will be equally applicable to Northern Ireland.the domestic character of the united kingdom392. In earlier chapters we have outlined the history and traditions of theUnited Kingdom and its component parts, and we have said something about1 See paragraph 14.2 Sir W. Ivor Jennings The Law and the Constitution, (University of London Press Ltd.).3 Ibid.-The author also points out that the constitution of the USA needs only about ten pages.
the social background. Looking at this picture from the point of view of constitution making, what are the relevant characteristics? What are theessential features which must be taken into account in attempting to assessfuture constitutional requirements? We consider first characteristics associatedwith history and tradition, and then more recent developments.History and tradition393. An important historical characteristic of the United Kingdom is its essential unity, which has now been maintained for longer than most countries can claim. The geographical separation of the United Kingdom from thecontinental mainland and its achievement of world prominence as one people have had a strong unifying effect which we regard as irreversible. After manydiscussions, and allowing the utmost weight to the arguments of Scottish and welsh nationalists, we decided that our deliberations should continue on thefooting that political and economic unity will be preserved. We give in Part Vour reasons for coming to this conclusion, but it is helpful to anticipate it here.394. This essential unity should not be allowed to obscure another importanthistorical factor, which is that within the United Kingdom there is greatdiversity. There are the Scottish and Welsh nations, whose special characteristicsand needs are already to some extent recognised in special governmentalarrangements. Some regions of England also have their own distinctive tradi-tions. Northern Ireland is different again. And around the shores of Britain there are smaller islands with their own separate communities. We do not look upon this diversity as something which undermines the unity of the UnitedKingdom. On the contrary, we regard it as a source of strength and something to be preserved.395. Another factor is that we are not setting out to build a new constitutionfrom scratch. The United Kingdom already possesses a constitution which inits essentials has served well for some hundreds of years. It has been widelyregarded as a model for others. Our task is to make recommendations for any revision that may be needed to meet changed circumstances. In carrying outthat task we must take full account of deep-rooted national traditions and of theproven value of existing institutions. It follows that there are some extremereforms which in our view it would be pointless to contemplate. Parliament, forexample, though it may undergo some change, must retain supreme authority and continue to be under the control of directly elected representatives. Theposition of the Member of Parliament as the paramount elected representativeof the people must be preserved. Any constitutional innovations should as faras possible be fitted into or grafted on to our existing institutions. Providing a link with the past in this way, they would be far more likely to secure acceptancethan proposals for drastic change.396. The wishes of the people are the most important consideration to betaken into account. As we noted in our discussion of alleged defects, most people understandably have no very clear idea of the changes needed to remedythem. They expect certain results from government. If their expectations arenot met they complain, and if a sufficient number of them happen to be dis-satisfied at the time of a general election they vote the government out and waitto see what the next government will do. But the basic structure of governmentis largely taken for granted. When things go wrong the pressure is for a new
government rather than for a change in the system. And many of those who dofavour some kind of constitutional reform tend not to have thought out very carefully the changes they would like to see. Our impression is that, although some constitutional reform might be welcomed, the great majority of people have no positive preference for specific changes. They do not know, any morethan we did at the outset of our enquiries, what the possibilities are. To deter-mine the wishes of the people for our purposes, therefore, it is necessary toask not so much what people want as what they will be likely to accept if it is put to them.397. A further deep-rooted tradition of the British is their spirit of pragmatismand compromise. They look to practice rather than theory, and if somethingseems to work well enough they tend not to question it. What they are interestedin is a fair and common-sense result rather than strict adherence to doctrine.Any constitutional measure which failed to take account of this characteristicwould be in danger of breaking down.398. With this interest in fairness and common sense goes a high regard for personal liberty. This might be thought so obvious as to be not worthmentioning. But, as we have noted, there are many ways in which personalliberty is being restricted in practice by the growth of government activities.Taken one by one these activities may have the general support of the electorate.But in the aggregate they could eventually have the effect that the individual nolonger felt himself to be a member of a free society. Instead of accepting restric-tions on his own freedom of action because they were clearly desirable for thegood of all, and because they were imposed by a government exercising autho-rity on his behalf, he might come to think that the restrictions were so numerousand overwhelming that, in total, they ceased to be desirable; and he might suspectthat government, so far from being his agent or trustee, had become his master.That unwelcome possibility is not so unlikely that we can afford to ignore it.Any proposals for constitutional reform must be such as will help to preserveand foster individual liberty.Recent developments399. The great advances in technology and large increases in the scale and complexity of government since the Second World War, coming at a time whenBritain&apos;s status in the world has been on the decline, have tended to confuseordinary people and to produce in them a vague feeling of dissatisfaction andinsecurity. The growth in technology, fostered for necessary economic ends,has produced social problems such as those arising from the replacement of people by machines, dull routine work, enforced changes of home and careerand pollution of the environment to which fully satisfactory answers havenot been found. Similarly, mammoth-sized government, although mainly the product of a desire to give the people what they appear to expect, has brought with it as yet unsolved problems arising from the enhancement of central power, the rise of the expert at the expense of the democratic repre-sentative and a gigantic proliferation of decisions which are so complicated and technical that the public is not qualified to judge whether what is being done in their name is right or not. Government seems to have been taken away from the people by its own sheer size and complexity, leaving them with anuneasy impression that their feelings as individuals are no longer properlytaken into account.
400. There is some evidence that disillusionment with government is turninginto apathy. The percentage turn-out at general elections is falling. In 1970it was 72 per cent., whereas in 1950 it was 84 per cent. Apart from a slight risein 1959 there has been a fall in every election during thai, iwenty-year period .Abstention from voting may not be an infallible guide to the level of apathy;but it is an indication which should not be ignored. Another pointer is the membership of the main political parties. We have no reliable figures, but it isnot in dispute that membership has fallen dramatically (although in Wales and scotland the reduction in membership of the main parties has been offset tosome extent by an increase in the membership of the nationalist parties). Thevolume of active interest in party politics now bears no comparison with that of twenty years ago.401. While some people have become apathetic in the face of the increasingsize and remoteness of government, others have felt positive resentment. Asubstantial minority, confident in their own ability to judge what governmentshould do and feeling unable to register their views effectively through theirelected representatives or through membership of a political party, have beenturning to other methods. Among all sections of society there has been a growth of demonstrations and other forms of direct action designed to by-pass the formal democratic process. To exert influence on particular issues which affect them, growing numbers of people now seem prepared to form pressuregroups almost as a first resort. They have discovered that group action works,and for some groups physical protest, often for reasons of publicity, is coming to be a regular part of the pattern. This development, in a country with areputation for moderation and tolerance, may be indicative of a loss of confidence in the traditional democratic processes.402. Government, then, has become all-pervasive and yet remote; and this at a time when, possibly as a result of higher educational standards, people have become more critical and more demanding. One of the principal objectives of constitutional reform, therefore, must be the restoration of public confidence in the democratic processes. This will come about only if people can be broughtto have a better understanding of government, to become more closely identifiedwith it and to feel that it is sensitive to public feeling and susceptible to popularcontrol. The effort required to achieve this might be regarded as &quot;unproductive&quot;Or &quot;inefficient&quot; in the sense that it would be likely to slow government downand make its work more difficult. But showing the electors that they matter as individuals and are ultimately in control is an aspect of &quot;efficiency&quot;, not analternative to it. The problem is to humanise government and keep it demo-cratically alive while permitting it to discharge its essential functions efficiently and with due regard to economy in the use of manpower and other resources.international considerations403. Overshadowing all other external developments at the present time is the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the European Economic Community.How should this important new development affect our approach to devolution1 The latest voting figures for other European democracies are mostly higher even thanthe United Kingdom figure for 1950, although allowance must be made in some cases fordifferences in the voting system. No country comparable to the United Kingdom shows asimilar downward trend in voting.
and to the problems of remote government in general, and does it mean that changes which might otherwise have been thought desirable are now ruled out ?We first consider the specific consequences of Community membership, andthen its effect on the general climate for devolution.The specific consequences of membership of the European Economic Community404. The full implications of joining the Community will not be clear forseveral years to come, but the indications are that, momentous as entry into europe is, it does not have any major specific consequences for the questionsremitted to us. In particular, it does not rule out devolution. The powers thatmight be devolved and the freedom with which those powers could be exercised by the regions would be restricted by Community provisions applicable withinthe United Kingdom. But the range of services concerned is at present limited,and some of the main candidates for devolution, such as the environmental services and education, are least affected. Nor does it appear that membership would prohibit the adoption of any of the forms of devolution in which we are interested. It should be noted that, within the Community, West germany has a federal constitution providing for the exercise of extensive powers atregional level, including some legislative powers, notably in the fields of primary and secondary education, police and the framework of local government.As far as we can see Community membership could also have little effect onany proposals for Parliamentary reform designed to meet regional needs.405. Community law operates only in the fields covered by the EuropeanTreaties, and its immediate consequences are economic. The main subjectscovered are indirect taxation, agriculture and fisheries, movement of labour,services and capital, transport, monopolies and restrictive, practices, state aid for industry and the regulation of the coal, steel and nuclear energy industries.In all these fields the lives of people living in the United Kingdom will beaffected by Community policies. Of particular concern to us are the implications for regional taxation and for regional economic policy.406. The effect of Community membership on the scope for regional taxationwithin the United Kingdom is discussed in Chapter 15. The harmonisation ofany tax throughout the Community restricts the scope for regional variations.So far only value added tax is affected in this way, but in due course other taxesmay be affected also. Regional taxation as such, however, is not precluded, andeven in the case of harmonised taxes some regional variations might still bepossible. The main difficulty is that for some years to come the whole questionof taxation (even, perhaps, some aspects of direct taxation) will be surroundedby an uncertainty which can be cleared only when the eventual pattern ofharmonisation is settled. Until then it might be difficult to make any firm plans for regional taxation.407. In regional economic policy (the means by which the central government,through selective grants and subsidies and decisions about the location of capital investment, equalises economic opportunities of the different regions) there willbe a trend towards co-ordination among member countries. At present this isin its early stages. So far as we can judge it is not likely greatly to interfere withthe continuation of existing regional policies within the United Kingdom,should those policies continue to find favour there. The United KingdomGovernment will share in the formulation of any new proposals designed to
harmonise regional policies and may be expected to receive financial assistance for its own development areas from Community funds. Some of these areas,particularly Scotland and Wales, have figured prominently in our discussions of devolution. How far they will benefit from the Community&apos;s regional policiesno one can say. What seems clear, however, is that Community requirements in this field (regulating, for example, the types of assistance that can be givento industry) will not much affect the scope for devolution, if only becauseregional policy is an aspect of government that must largely remain undercentral control. Whether the United Kingdom were inside or outside theEuropean Community the regions themselves could play only a limited role.We return to this subject later on.408. Inevitably the Community&apos;s concern with such matters as fair tradingpractices and mobility of labour causes some spillover into the social field, andthere are very few areas of government which are not now or may not in future be the subject of some Community law. But any restrictions imposed byCommunity law on the internal government of member countries will be suchas are accepted by those countries after consultation in the ordinary way withthe particular interests (for instance, commercial and professional interests)affected by them. Under the present system of centralised government theUnited Kingdom Government would not accept a restriction inimical to theinterests of one specific area of the United Kingdom without argument; itwould either negotiate an exception or persuade the area concerned to acceptthe disadvantage in exchange for some other benefit. If there were a systemof devolved government the process, more formal and possibly taking longer,would be essentially the same; in some way or another the interest of the area would have to be satisfied.The effect of Community membership on the general climate for devolution409. A further question is the effect that Community membership has on thegeneral climate for regional devolution. How does the acceptance of a measureof government from Brussels affect the case for creating a new focus of loyaltyat regional level?410. This question may be looked at from two opposing points of view.On the one hand, the fresh challenge abroad may make for a greater sense ofunity at home, and people may become so preoccupied with the UnitedKingdom&apos;s role in Europe that their interest in devolution within the UnitedKingdom will be weakened, at least for some years. There is a limit to the amountof change that people can take at one time. There is a limit also to the amountof government they will accept. With, in effect, two-tier central government,from Brussels and London, possibly each with its own separate parliamentary elections, and two or three levels of local government, people may be disinclinedto see introduced yet another level of government and another set of electionsat regional level.411. On the other hand, as the attentions of Westminster and Whitehallbecome diverted more and more to Brussels, government will tend to becomestill more remote, and there may be an enhanced need for some new institutionsto bring the administration of government geographically nearer to the people.People may also feel that regional institutions of government would help to
preserve their distinctive sense of community in the face of increasing uniformitythroughout Europe. It should not be forgotten that within the Community agreat deal of interest in regional problems has developed in Italy and France.412. These different considerations probably cancel out, leaving the climatefor devolution unaffected either way. It is possible, however, that in Scotlandand Wales the second view will carry greater weight, since some Scottish and welsh people seem to fear that membership will in time bring about a furthererosion of their separate national identities and characteristics.Summary of the consequences of Community membership413. Our general conclusion is that the United Kingdom&apos;s membership ofthe European Economic Community does not crucially affect the matters withwhich we are concerned; in particular it does not stand in the way of substantialdevolution. It does, however, place some limitations on the functions that could usefully be devolved and some restrictions on the freedom that the regions would have to exercise their devolved powers, and these are important factors to be taken into account in considering the precise form that devolution could best take. More generally, we think that the climate for devolution is not likely to be greatly affected by membership of the Community.414. Membership of the Community has wider constitutional implications,affecting, for example, the established principles of Parliamentary democracy.How can the people, through their elected representatives at Westminster andin Strasbourg, effectively influence the content of Community laws which apply to them? Is the Community a step along the road to a Europeanfederation ? To the extent that questions such as these affect the good govern-ment of people within the United Kingdom they are of interest to us. But theyare largely questions for the future, and we have not thought it profitable tospeculate about them.International relationships outside the Community415. This discussion of external relations had been confined to the implications-tions of membership of the European Economic Community. The constititionalposition of the United Kingdom is also affected by its membership of theCommonwealth, but not in ways which have a direct bearing on our particular problems. The United Kingdom also accepts external restraints through its membership of the wider international community, and in particular of theUnited Nations. But here again the consequences which flow from these outsideassociations have little effect on the internal matters with which we areconcerned.general principles416. We have looked at the domestic scene within the United Kingdom andat our position as a member of the international community in order to identify the essential characteristics and movements in society which should be takeninto account in assessing future constitutional requirements. We now suggestsome general principles that need to be borne in mind in considering particularproposals for reform. These principles inevitably overlap or are closely inter-related. Some affect the substance of constitutional reform; others are con-cerned more with its acceptability or the spirit in which it should be worked.
417. The substantive scope of any new proposals should be governed firstby the need to preserve unity. The essential political and economic unity ofthe United Kingdom is a long-established fact, and in our opinion it ought tobe preserved. It follows that Parliament must continue to represent all partsof the United Kingdom and retain overriding power, including such power asmay be necessary for effective management of the economy of the UnitedKingdom as a whole. But unity does not necessarily mean uniformity. Withinthe United Kingdom there is considerable diversity, based on differences of history, tradition and culture, which is already reflected in different govern-mental arrangements. It is a source of strength and should continue to be respected.418. The principle of democracy government by the people-must be preserved and fostered; elected representatives of the people must have realcontrol. Where day-to-day control is impracticable, there should be a chain of accountability leading back to elected representatives. Proposals for constitutional reform must also respect the strong tradition of personal liberty.Government should in volume be no greater than is necessary to satisfy thegeneral will at any given time, and should be organised and performed withthe greatest regard for the liberty of the individual. There should be ampleprovision for the investigation and redress of grievances.419. A reform need not be one for which the public has specifically pressed,but it must be one which is likely to be found acceptable. constitutional arrangements, however attractive they may appear in theory, cannot be imposedagainst the will of the people with any real hope of success. Any break with thepast should not be too extreme; new arrangements should be such as willreadily be regarded as a natural development out of what has gone before.They should provide a degree of flexibility; in the fluid conditions of the present day, and with uncertainty about the future implications of entry into Europe,constitutional reforms are more likely to be acceptable if they leave otheroptions open, or can readily be adapted to suit changing circumstances.420. Flexibility is desirable also in the actual working of any new system,so as to absorb the political and administrative strains which inevitably arise in the operation of government. Good communication between governmentand people is essential. Government should be carried out with proper regard for the views and feelings of the people. As far as possible it should be conducted in the open; there should be government by discussion rather than government by edict, with secrecy kept to the minimum. At the same time governmentshould be as simple and as cheap as possible, and be efficiently geared to producing the results desired.421. We do not pretend that this very brief statement of general principlesreflects all the considerations that have to be taken into account. Nor do weattempt to assess the importance of any one of them relative to another. It isnot to be expected that any particular constitutional proposal will be fullyconsistent with them all. Indeed to some extent they may conflict. For example,the current reform of local government will result in fewer and larger authoritiesand a big reduction in the number of elected councillors. Government, it isargued, will thereby be made more effective, with the new authorities havingwider scope and better resources; but it will also be more remote and possibly
less human. A conflict of this kind is likely to arise on almost any proposalfor reform, and in so far as the conflicting interests cannot be reconciled a choice has to be made between them. In the last resort it will be for the public to decide where the balance of advantage lies. We have nevertheless found ituseful to identify some of the main requirements and to keep them before usin examining possible measures of reform.
PART VSEPARATISM AND FEDERALISM
SEPARATISM422. In discussing the main sources of dissatisfaction with government wehave seen that most complaints spring either from centralisation or fromdevelopments which have tended to run counter to the principles of democracy.This Part of our Report, and Parts VI to VIII, having regard principally tocomplaints about over-centralisation, discuss ways in which powers now exercised in Westminster and Whitehall might instead be exercised in the regions, while Part IX deals,not with regional matters but with more general questions of government and the way it is carried on.423. Parliament could transfer powers to a region in one of three ways.It could transfer complete sovereignty in all matters, in effect creating a separateindependent state; or it could transfer sovereignty in certain matters only,retaining sovereignty in other matters, such as defence and foreign affairs;or, while retaining sovereignty in all matters, it could delegate to the regionsthe exercise of selected powers. These three ways of dividing up governmentpower are referred to respectively in this Report as separatism, federalism anddevolution. This chapter deals with separatism, Chapter 13 with federalismand Chapters 14 to 26 with the many different aspects and forms of devolution.424. Our discussion of separatism relates to Scotland and Wales only, andin this context we do not draw much distinction between them. Obviously thetwo countries are different in many ways; we have already mentioned some ofthe differences in Chapter 10, and where they are relevant we refer to themagain in the present discussion. But the main subject of debate whether apeople with a distinct national identity should or should not be incorporatedinto a larger political and economic unit is common to both Scotland andWales. Some factors in the debate may be stronger for one country than for theother, but the factors which influence us most are the same for both. For thepurpose of discussion in this chapter, therefore, we feel justified in looking atScotland and Wales together.the meaning of separatism425. We are concerned here with the general concept of separatism, notmerely with the particular proposals of the Scottish National Party and PlaidCymru. We use the term to mean the separation of Scotland and Wales fromthe rest of the United Kingdom and their conversion into fully independentsovereign states with complete control over all their internal and external affairs.In accordance with our terms of reference we assume that as independent statesthey would remain under the Crown. They would be fully self-governingmembers of the Commonwealth.426. It is apparent from the arguments of nationalists themselves that full-blown sovereignty of this order is a rather uncomfortable concept for Scotlandand Wales. While they wish Scotland, Wales and England all to be completelyfree and equal, their own descriptions of how independence would workpostulate a high degree of co-operation with England, particularly in economic matters, and they assume that this co-operation would be forthcoming.Attempts have been made to get round the difficulty by watering down the
concept of sovereignty or by rejecting it as old-fashioned. It is said thatsovereignty is no longer necessary for full statehood, the implication being that all states are now so interdependent that none has complete freedom ofaction and that, in effect, although Scotland and Wales could not have absolutesovereignty they could have as much sovereignty as any other state.427. We are not satisfied that the question of sovereignty can be dismissedin this way. We are concerned with the realities of constitutional power, and thefact is that even in the modern world a state is either sovereign or it is not.A state which is already sovereign may make agreements with other stateslimiting its own courses of action, and for a variety of reasons the number ofsuch agreements is increasing. But they rest on the sovereignty of the indepen-dent states which make them, and in the last resort an independent state hascomplete constitutional control over its domestic affairs and can order its relations with other countries in whatever way it thinks fit. Scotland and Walescould not be independent states in the sense understood by the world unless they had this kind of authority, and they would not have it if their independencerested upon the continued co-operation of England on some very important matters.428. If Scotland and Wales were to become independent in the full sense, sothat Great Britain consisted of three completely sovereign states, it would thenbe open to the three states to make agreements and to co-operate in the way which many Scottish and Welsh nationalists would like to see. But it cannotbe taken for granted in advance that they would do so. And even if they co-operated initially they might later change their minds. An independent Scotlandretaining its links with the Crown and the Commonwealth, as is usuallyenvisaged, could later break those links, as the Irish Republic did.429. Political and economic relationships with England could be changedalso. Nationalists usually assume that as independent states Scotland and wales would join with England to form a British common market, within which therewould be no military frontiers or passports and no barriers to the free move-ment of people, goods or money. Welsh nationalists have specifically recognisedthat within a British common market of this kind a Welsh Governmenfsfreedom of economic action would in practice be considerably restricted.But both Scottish and Welsh nationalists claim the ultimate right, in all matters,not to co-operate with England. Nor can it be taken for granted that a separatedEngland would always feel able to co-operate with Scotland and Wales. Evenif an ideal partnership existed at the outset, circumstances could change, leading to disagreements; some Scottish nationalists have themselves said that a customs barrier between England and Scotland is not unthinkable, and otherseparatist measures such as restrictions on immigration from England havealso been mentioned. Scottish sovereignty would make such developments as these at least possible.430. We therefore regard separatism as involving the division of GreatBritain into three fully independent sovereign states England, Scotland andWales. Each would have complete constitutional control over all its internal and external affairs and its own direct links with the Crown, and each would be separately represented at the United Nations and in the world at large. In
practice the three states might choose to co-operate closely in various ways;but any proposals for self-government in Scotland and Wales which depended on such co-operation would not, by our definition, amount to separatism.431. We have stated in Chapter 11 our view that the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom should be preserved. It follows from this that wedo not recommend separatism for either Scotland or Wales. In this chapter weconsider the main arguments for separatism and say why we reject them.More detailed discussion of the subject is to be found in the evidence we received in relation to Scotland and Wales and in many published works. Additionalmaterial on the economic aspects of separatism is available in a Survey of the welsh Economy, carried out by Professor G. L. Rees (one of our AssistantCommissioners) and his associates at the University College of Wales, Aberyst-wyth, and published in our Research series1. We have also been able to drawon published material relating specifically to the Scottish economy2, andanother of our Research papers includes a useful general commentary onpublished material relating to both Scotland and wales.the separatist case432. The essentials of the separatist case are that Scotland and Wales areseparate nations and should be treated as such for the purposes of government;that they have suffered from incorporation into the United Kingdom; that theywould be economically viable as independent states; and that only by assertingtheir separate nationhood and achieving full independence can they ensure theirown prosperity. We consider these four propositions in turn, and then go on toconsider briefly how the case for separatism is affected by the United Kingdonfsentry into the European Economic Community.Scotland and Wales as separate nations433. In keeping with the proposition that Scotland and Wales are separatenations and should be treated as such for the purposes of government, it isargued that they are entitled to judge the effectiveness of the way in whichthey are governed not merely by comparison with what is being achieved in the regions of England, such as the North East, where conditions may be similarto their own, but in the light of what they might achieve by themselves if theywere independent; each country should be looked at as a whole, and anycomparison within the United Kingdom should be with England as a whole.Underlying this approach is the idea that Scotland and Wales have, as separatenations, a right of self-determination, and that although in the past they havechosen to be partners in the United Kingdom they could if they wished withdrawand become completely independent.1 Research Paper 8.2 See for example:(a) Dr. R. G. C. McCrone, Scotland^ future: the economics of nationalism, Blackwell.lb) Government and the economic position of Scotland (Professors K. W. Alexander andA. D. Campbell, Written Evidence, Vol. 5).(c) Dr. D. Simpson, Scottish independence: an economic analysis, Upthrust Series, S.N.P.Research Department.(d) N. MacCormick (ed.), The Scottish debate: essays on Scottish nationalism, Oxford&quot;   University Press.3 Research Paper 10 Financial and Economic Aspects of Regionalism and Separatism(Dr. D. N. King).
434. Except for small minorities of Scottish and Welsh people we do notthink that the sense of separate nationhood is the overwhelming political influence which nationalists claim it to be. The Scottish and the Welsh identifythemselves with their own country and are naturally concerned for its welfare,but there are also strong influences operating in the direction of unity within theUnited Kingdom, for so long the accepted political and social background ofthe separate peoples which make it up. The United Kingdom stands for things which have deserved and gained among those peoples both affection andrespect. For example, the Scotsman, rightly tenacious of his own legal system,has profound admiration for the English Common Law, which has been thecivilising authority in the greater part of North America, the continents of africa and Australasia and those regions of Asia which were once part of aBritish Empire. Again, no Welshman, however devoted to his own language andculture, will reject Shakespeare or Burns as compatriots or class them as examples of foreign genius as he would Beethoven and Picasso. The close connectionsbetween the English, Scottish and Welsh, in friendship and marriage no lessthan in trade and business, make it impossible for the average Scot or Welshmanto deny that he is also British; at bottom he is proud of it. He is not the less aScot or a Welshman for that.435. In the case of the great majority of Scots and Welshmen, therefore,there is no basis for saying that their allegiance to their own country eitherexceeds or excludes their allegiance to the United Kingdom as a whole. they regard themselves as citizens of the United Kingdom and do not wish to beregarded as aliens, in however technical a sense, in any part of it. They no morewish to secede from the United Kingdom than do the English people. Centuriesof union have produced a British community and state, and the large majorityof people in each of its constituent countries are happy to belong to it. Neitherconstitutional practice nor common sense suggests that, because they areseparate nations, Scotland and Wales must necessarily be separate states.436. A related but rather different proposition is that for the purposes ofgovernment the Scots and the Welsh should be treated as separate peoples.The essential implication of this is that in the particular interest of scotland or of Wales it may sometimes be right to do things which appear to conflict with the wider interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. In other words,in the context of the present system the United Kingdom, or perhaps England,might have to make some sacrifice in order to help preserve the nationalidentities of Scotland and Wales and to foster their separate sense of com-munity. A good many Scottish and Welsh people would see that as their due as a clause in their partnership agreement with England.437. One example of this would be the adoption of policies designed toensure that as far as possible opportunities for employment were as good inScotland and Wales as in England as a whole. The nationalists argue that thisshould be so, implying that there is something less acceptable about a Scotor a Welshman having to leave his country to get work than there is about aTynesider having to move to London for the same reason.438. To a considerable extent Scotland and Wales are already separatelyadministered, through the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office. But this administration does not extend to all matters and does not permit the adoption
of a comprehensive and distinctive set of policies for each country. In practice the intention has generally been to ensure that comparable standards are provided, service by service, for all citizens of the United Kingdom, and it hasbeen recognised that in order to achieve the required standards in Scotlandand Wales it is sometimes necessary, as in some regions of England, to providefor a per capita expenditure above the average.439. If the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom is to be preserved, England, Scotland and Wales cannot be governed entirely as separateunits, each with a completely balanced and self-contained economy. but without undermining essential unity it would be possible to recognise the separate national identities more fully than at present, both in the system ofgovernment and in the way that government services are administered. this might entail additional public expenditure, not merely to equate the services provided to Scottish and Welsh citizens with those provided to English citizens,but to provide services which are distinctively Scottish or distinctively Welsh,and to foster Scottish and Welsh institutions and culture.440. Our conclusion, therefore, on the first main proposition in theseparatist case, is that the separate national identities of the Scots and the welsh do not require Scotland and Wales to be separated from the rest of theUnited Kingdom as independent states or to be administered as entirely separate communities. If they arc to be recognised in matters of governmentmore fully than at present, this can be done without disturbing the essentialunity of the United Kingdom,The effects of incorporation into the United Kingdom441. The second proposition is that Scotland and Wales have suffered fromincorporation into the United Kingdom. It is contended that their needs havebeen insufficiently understood and catered for by successive governments inLondon, which have been primarily concerned with English needs and have regarded Scottish and Welsh problems as peripheral. Furthermore, the incorporation of Scotland and Wales into a unitary state whose population isoverwhelmingly English is said to have threatened their distinctive ways of life.442. Allegations that United Kingdom governments have neglected scottish and Welsh affairs, and have dealt ineffectively with the problems of unemploy-ment and emigration, occupy a prominent place in nationalist literature. Itmay be that it was not so much London government as an impression of badgovernment which led to the nationalist revival some years ago. If the economic problems of Scotland and Wales had been successfully overcome there mighthave been little pressure for independence, the feeling of separate nationhoodalone being insufficient to get the revival under way.443. Most people would agree that the basic economic problems of Scotlandand Wales cannot fairly be attributed to the union with England; they have arisen because, like some parts of England itself, Scotland and Wales becameover-dependent on heavy industries which have since greatly declined. Theyare now seeking to create new opportunities for employment by attracting new
industries and developing the roads, houses, schools and other public servicesneeded to match the new industrial pattern. The process is inevitably a longone.444. Whether Scotland and Wales would have found themselves in this position if they had not been incorporated into the United Kingdom no one can say; but given that they are so incorporated they are entitled to everyreasonable assistance the United Kingdom Government can provide. It has beensuggested that they have received inadequate assistance, that Scotland andWales have put more into the United Kingdom than they have got out of it,and that having been used for and spoiled by the industrial revolution they arenow being forgotten. This alleged neglect by the United Kingdom Governmenthas provided nationalists with their main practical reason for claiming inde-pendence. They have contended that, to put it at its lowest, no Scottish orWelsh Government could possibly have done worse for their countries.445. Scotland and Wales have indeed made large contributions to theeconomic life of the United Kingdom. Not only have they been major producers of natural resources such as coal and iron-ore, and important centres ofindustries such as steel and shipbuilding on which the United Kingdom&apos;sprosperity has been largely based, but large numbers of their highly educatedand skilled people have left their countries to work in England and other partsof the Commonwealth. Without those people in trade, government service,medicine, education and many other walks of life the United Kingdom wouldhave been much less able to exploit its opportunities.446. But to acknowledge the contribution made to United Kingdom prosperityby the Scots and the Welsh is not to accept that they have been ignored orneglected in times of hardship. We have been persuaded by the evidence sub-mitted to us and by our own independent enquiries that, on the contrary,United Kingdom governments have, at least in recent years, shown a concern for them which might almost be regarded as disproportionately great. Throughthe presence of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales in the Cabinet,and their separate representation on policy-making committees, the specialclaims of Scotland and Wales have been vigorously pursued. The amount ofpublic expenditure per head of population in Scotland and Wales is considerably greater than in england. This is especially true of Scotland, which, perhapssignificantly, has had its own Cabinet Minister and administration for much longer than Wales. There is no doubt that from time to time important decisions have been made in favour of Scotland or Wales largely for political reasons;they have benefited not because, compared with parts of England, they neces-sarily had the best case, but because they had the most effective voice.447. It is true, however, that the special attention paid to Scotland and wales has still left some people there unhappy with government from London. their continued sense of dissatisfaction is due to a number of factors. In the first placemany of them are largely unaware of the special treatment accorded to Scotlandand Wales and are not sufficiently informed to appreciate the material benefits which Scotland and Wales have derived from their membership of the UnitedKingdom. This may be attributable in part to a failure by government to tell1 See paragraphs 589-593.
the Scottish and Welsh people in an effective way what is being done for them;although it is at least possible that if the Scottish Office and the Welsh Officepublicised all their achievements, many of them secured at the expense ofEngland, English resentment might be aroused and in the long run less mightbe gained for Scotland and Wales.448. Secondly, despite all that has been done, the fact remains that govern-ment activity in Scotland and Wales has not so far brought them prosperity;their levels of unemployment have continued to be above the United Kingdomaverage1. The blame is placed on those in London thought to carry responsi-bility, and there is naturally a temptation to imagine that government fromEdinburgh or Cardiff would be better.449. Thirdly, very few people in Scotland and Wales appreciate either the considerable extent to which their affairs are already administered on the spot,by their own countrymen, through the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office,or the very real influence which Scottish and Welsh Ministers and officials exertbehind the scenes, even in matters for which they have no direct responsibility.People therefore tend to think that government from Edinburgh or Cardiffwould be something completely different a fresh alternative inviting hopes of substantial improvement and the availability of this apparently.untried alter-native sharpens their criticism of the present system. It is made to appear thatthe main pressure is for Scottish or Welsh government rather than Londongovernment, whereas it seems likely that the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland and Wales are concerned more with the success of governmentthan where it comes from.450. If people in Scotland and Wales knew more about the present system andthe extent to which it has worked to their advantage, they might well accept thattheir economic problems have arisen mainly from over-concentration on certainheavy industries in an age when there was little economic planning and, more recently, from uncontrollable developments such as changes in world markets,the decline of coal-mining as an economic operation and the difficulties inherent in building up new industries in relatively remote areas. For the rest, no doubt,1 The percentages of unemployment in the various parts of the United Kingdom in recentyears are shown in the following table:	1966	1967	1968	1969	1970	1971United Kingdom        ......	1-6	2-5	2-5	2-5	2-7	3-7Great Britain    .........	1-5	2-4	2-4	2-4	2-6	3-6England............	1-3	2-2	2-2	2-2	2-4	3-north............	2-6	4-0	4-7	4-8	4-8	5-9Yorkshire and Humberside ...	1-2	2-1	2-6	2-6	2-9	4-0East Midlands        ......	11	1-8	1-9	2-0	2-3	3-1East Anglia   .........	1-4	2-1	2-0	1-9	2-1	3-1South East     .........	1-0	1-7	1-6	1-6	1-7	2-south West    .........	1-8	2-5	2-5	2-7	2-8	3-west Midlands        ......	1-3	2-5	2-2	2-0	2-3	4-0North West   .........	1-5	2-5	2-5	2-5	2-8	4-1Wales     ............	2-9	41	40	4-1	4-0	4-7Scotland............	2-9	3-9	3-8	3-7	4-3	60Northern Ireland        ......	61	7-7	7-2	7-3	7-0	8-0Source: Abstract of Regional Statistics 1972, Table 27.
United Kingdom governments must bear some responsibility-they will not always have made the right decisions for Scotland and Wales, nor always havehad the best of fortune but there is no convincing reason for believing thatthe economic record of independent Scottish and Welsh governments wouldhave been better.451. As it is, successive United Kingdom governments have energeticallytackled Scottish and Welsh economic problems. They have designated thewhole of Scotland and Wales as assisted areas, and over the past decade havedevoted very large sums to the encouragement of industrial development there.They have prevented extensions to manufacturing premises in the South Eastand Midlands of England in the interests of the assisted areas to an extent which has sometimes lessened the efficiency of the firms concerned. Mosteconomists who have examined the problem have agreed that without these special government measures the economic plight of Scotland and wales would have been a good deal worse. Whether still more should have been done,and whether all the money put into Scotland and Wales has been spent in themost effective way, may be open to argument. But whatever mistakes UnitedKingdom governments may have made, few of them could be clearly identified as mistakes which independent Scottish and Welsh governments could andwould have avoided. The indications are that, despite their geographicaldisadvantages, Scotland and Wales have enjoyed a standard of living not substantially lower than that of the United Kingdom as a whole, higher thanthat of Northern Ireland, and markedly higher than that of the Irish Republic1.452. In our view, therefore, there are no grounds for the belief that Scotlandand Wales are neglected under the present system and suffer in material termson account of their incorporation into the United Kingdom; on the contrary,they tend to receive preferential treatment. Their complete economic recoveryrequires an expansion of the United Kingdom economy as a whole, since their economic prospects are tied to those of England, and this would be truealso if they were independent.453. Another separatist argument is that, quite apart from its materialeffects, the incorporation of Scotland and Wales into a unitary state dominated by England has threatened their distinctive ways of life. In relation to Scotlandthis argument seems to have little force. If the Scottish ethos is any less strongthan it was we have not noticed it. The old-established national institutions of Scotland continue to thrive, and English influences arising from cross-bordertraffic seem no more likely to break down the essential pattern of Scottish lifethan they have in centuries past. The Scottish people will continue to movewith the times, but will do so in their own way.454. The distinctive culture of Wales has come rather more obviously underpressure. Its geographical, economic and social links with England are closerthan those of Scotland. In an age of television, radio and swift communications,the traditional Welsh way of life has tended to give ground a trend made more noticeable by the steady reduction in the numbers of Welsh speakers.We have been reminded that in times past London governments sought to compel the use of the English language in Wales, thus gravely weakening the1 See, for example, the discussion of comparative gross domestic products in Chapter ii of Dr. McCrone&apos;s ScotlancTs future: the economics of nationalism.
use of the native tongue. But union with England has not in recent yearsprevented the strong revival in Welsh culture, and the characteristic Welshsense of community is still very much alive. For some time now many people have been working for the preservation and further development of the welsh language, with positive government support. And Welsh national institutions,so far from dying out, are increasing in vigour.455. There is no evidence that, in so far as the distinctive features of scottish and Welsh life have been altered by contact with England, this has, at least for very many years, been because the people of England at large have wishedto see English culture take the place of Scottish or Welsh culture. Indeed, aswe have already suggested, it is a mistake to imagine that there is a singleclearly-defined English culture; England is a patchwork of communities, someof them as distinctive in social terms as Scotland and Wales themselves. Ingeneral, conditions within the United Kingdom are such that a way of life willsurvive if those who possess it want it to survive, and the Scottish and Welshways of life at present largely reflect the wishes of their own peoples. TheScottish and Welsh cultures have shown a remarkable capacity to survive theunion with England. Independence is not needed to preserve and foster them.If Scotland and Wales were independent, they would not be insulated from outside influences, and could achieve little in the way of fostering their separatesense of community and cultural traditions that could not equally well beachieved within the United Kingdom.The economic viability of Scotland and Wales as independent states456. The third main proposition in the separatist case is that as independent states Scotland and Wales would be economically viable and would compare with small but thriving modern states such as Norway and Denmark.457. The question whether Scotland and Wales could &quot;go it alone&quot; has been much discussed. In particular there have been disputes about whether scotland is now &quot;subsidised&quot; in the sense that it produces less government revenue thanit absorbs and about its likely balance of payments following independence,and these questions have become further obscured recently by the discoveriesof oil in the North Sea off the Scottish coast.458. Critics of the nationalist movement (mainly Scots and Welshmenthemselves) have said that Scotland and Wales are financially dependent onEngland in the sense that the money they absorb in the form of public expenditure is not covered by the revenue they produce in taxation, and that on becomingindependent they could make ends meet only by reducing standards or raising the level of taxation, neither of which would be politically acceptable. in response to this criticism nationalists have tried to show that Scotland andWales are not subsidised by England, and have suggested that after independencemuch of the government expenditure towards which Scotland and Wales arenow obliged to contribute would be avoided. In particular, they would like tosee expenditure on defence greatly reduced.459. In an attempt to clarify the position for Scotland the Treasury produced in 1969 a &quot;Scottish Budget&quot;1. This suggested, with reservations, that during Estimates of central government revenue and expenditure attributable to Scotland for thefinancial year 1967/8. HM Treasury, October 1969.
the year 1967/68 ScotlancTs share of central government expenditure exceeded the revenue which it produced in United Kingdom taxation by  466m., therevenue deficit amounting to nearly 30 per cent, of Scottish expenditure.In 1971 the Treasury published a &quot;Welsh Budget&quot;1, showing that for 1968/69there was a corresponding deficit in Wales of  182m., or nearly 22 per cent, of welsh expenditure.460. The statistical methods used to arrive at these conclusions have beenquestioned, especially in the case of the Scottish Budget, and not only bynationalists. An illustration of how the figures may be open to question is pro-vided by expenditure on defence. The Scottish deficit of  466m. assumes that Scotland&apos;s share of United Kingdom defence expenditure was  222m.,calculated on a population basis; but, as was made clear by the Treasury,it might be argued that Scotland&apos;s share of defence should be calculated not inaccordance with its proportion of the total population (9-4 per cent.) but inaccordance with its proportion of either the gross domestic product (8-5 percent.) or personal incomes (7-7 per cent.). By these means the figure of  222m.would be reduced to  203m. or  182m.461. The general view of independent economists is that although some ofthe figures used in the Treasury&apos;s Scottish and Welsh Budgets could well havebeen compiled in a different way, thus producing different final results, thoseresults would still have shown that during the years in question expenditurein both Scotland and Wales exceeded revenue by a very substantial margin.The controversy is fully discussed in our Research Papers2.462. We have looked at the Scottish and Welsh Budgets and have referredto them here because they have featured prominently in the general debateabout separatism. In our view, however, they cannot provide a conclusiveanswer to the question whether Scotland and Wales would be viable as inde-pendent states. The fact that these countries now absorb more United Kingdomrevenue than they provide3 does not mean that they could not survive on theirown if they were determined to do so. Since separation would come about only if the Scottish and Welsh people as a whole wanted it, they would presumablybe prepared if necessary to face a fall in standards.463. Nationalists like to think that independence would spur the scottish and Welsh people to greater economic efforts, and that an entirely new situation would be produced in which their economies would be revitalised. The increasedprosperity would generate more revenue in taxation and result in less public expenditure on social benefits such as unemployment pay; the old figures would be irrelevant. All this is speculative. But even if the standard of living inScotland and Wales were to fall initially after separation, it would still be rela-tively high in world terms. Scotland and Wales are advanced countries.

the year 1967/68 Scotland&apos;s share of central government expenditure exceeded the revenue which it produced in United Kingdom taxation by  466m., therevenue deficit amounting to nearly 30 per cent, of Scottish expenditure.In 1971 the Treasury published a &quot;Welsh Budget&quot;1, showing that for 1968/69there was a corresponding deficit in Wales of  182m., or nearly 22 per cent, of welsh expenditure.460. The statistical methods used to arrive at these conclusions have beenquestioned, especially in the case of the Scottish Budget, and not only bynationalists.

cent, and 86 per cent, of the United Kingdom level1; their peoples are well-educated, politically mature and fully capable of running their own affairs.The only question at issue is what standard of living they would have as inde-pendent nations. Provided that they were prepared if necessary to accept somefall in this standard for the sake of independence, both countries would be economically viable.464. Another factor in the debate about whether Scotland and Wales could&quot;go it alone&quot; has been their likely balance of payments. A continuing deficit on the balance of payments would cause major problems of adjustment for anindependent Scottish or Welsh economy, even if the independent governmentsassumed control of all the main instruments of economic policy. Any attempt tomaintain the same standard of government services after independence wouldinvolve a painful process of diverting resources to government use at a timewhen they would be needed to produce a greater volume of exports in orderto cover the trade deficit.465. Although some attempts have been made, it is not possible to determinewith any precision whether or not Scotland and Wales would have initialdeficits on their balance of payments or, if they did, whether the deficits wouldbe small or large. There are some indications that they might both have substan-tial deficits, the Welsh deficit being proportionately greater than that ofScotland2. Scotland and Wales would presumably neither pay taxes to theUnited Kingdom Government nor receive United Kingdom funds to financegovernment expenditure. The United Kingdom Government might cease tomake purchases in Scotland and Wales for government services. The cessation of these flows of government income and expenditure would probably have an adverse effect on the Scottish and Welsh balance of payments. At all events itwould be prudent to assume for the purposes of this discussion that Scotlandand Wales might have initial deficits. This would pose for them difficult problemsof economic management which we discuss later in this chapter.466. Assuming, on the basis of present figures, that following independenceScotland and Wales would each have a budget deficit and a balance of paymentsdeficit, how is that assumption affected by the discoveries of North Sea oil ?For Wales, not at all, although the exploitation of oil off the Welsh coast is apossibility. For Scotland some legal questions might arise on the ownership ofthe oil. We cannot give an authoritative answer to these questions. The most favourable answer would appear to be that Scotland would acquire exclusiverights to the natural resources of the continental shelf adjacent to its coast,and that the oil licences already granted in respect of that area would be re-negotiable by the Scottish Government, since their statutory foundation wouldhave disappeared when the United Kingdom relinquished its proprietaryinterest.467. It is not possible, however, to calculate the value of the oil interests which would accrue to Scotland on these favourable assumptions. We have nosound knowledge of the extent of the resources now existing widely differingestimates have been published nor of the profitability, and therefore theprobable selling price, of a licence to exploit them. For these reasons it is too early1 See Research Paper 10, page 63.2 See Research Paper 10, pages 65 and 66.
to judge how a Scottish Governmenfs budget would be affected by revenuesfrom oil licence fees or royalties, or by taxes on oil profits, or what overalleffect the new flows of income and expenditure would have on Scotland&apos;balance of payments. It is perhaps sufficient for our purpose to say that thereis a possibility of large oil resources becoming available, and that if they couldbe exploited on favourable terms there might be less reason for thinking thatan independent Scottish Government could not maintain present standards of public expenditure without further taxation, and less reason for expectingthat there would be serious balance of payments problems.468. To an unknown extent, therefore, North Sea oil would be a point infavour of Scotland&apos;s economic viability. But we see no reason to doubt thatan independent Scotland or Wales would be viable even without oil. In practiceboth would have great difficulty in developing independent economic policies,as we show in what follows, but neither can be regarded as unsuitable for independence because it is too poor. The whole question of economic viabilityis anyway of secondary importance. The separation of Scotland and Walesfrom the rest of the United Kingdom would come about only if there existedan overwhelming political desire for it on the part of the Scottish and Welshpeoples. In that event arguments about viability would hardly be relevant;viability would take care of itself.Independence as an economic necessity469. The fourth and last main separatist proposition is that only by assertingtheir separate nationhood and becoming fully independent can Scotland andWales ensure their own prosperity. The implication is that they cannot achieveprosperity within the United Kingdom but could outside it.470. What grounds are there for suggesting that Scotland and Wales cannotachieve prosperity within the United Kingdom? First and foremost is the evi-dence that in recent years they have not been so prosperous as most parts ofEngland. Nationalist critics have attributed this largely to the administrationof the United Kingdom as a single economic unit. They have suggested that united Kingdom economic policies are often not appropriate to the circum-stances of Scotland and Wales. For example, deflationary measures such asincreases in taxation and hire purchase restrictions have sometimes been adopted to combat an inflationary situation at a time when unemployment in Scotlandand Wales was particularly high. The introduction of selective employment tax,which discouraged employment in the service industries, was particularlyresented in Scotland and Wales, both countries with a high level of unemploy-ment and an important tourist trade. The heavy duty on spirits has been criticised as preventing the full commercial exploitation of Scotch whisky.In these examples the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole have conflictedwith the particular interests of Scotland or Wales. Clashes of interest have arisenalso in relation to individual undertakings. In the case of Upper Clyde Ship-builders, the interests of the United Kingdom may have appeared to require thetermination of financial support to the company, whereas looking at theproblem from a purely Scottish point of view the continued expenditure ofpublic funds was justified to preserve thousands of jobs and to maintain ashipbuilding industry in Scotland. Cases such as this, in which everything
depends on help from the United Kingdom Government, are said to have developed in Scotland and Wales a &quot;begging-bowl&quot; mentality, tending to saplocal initiative.471. The importance of government in economic affairs has increasedenormously in recent years, building up London still further as the centre ofindustrial and commercial power. It has been argued that this centre of powerattracts able people away from Scotland and Wales, and that the new industrygoing into these countries too often consists of branch factories which requirefew senior staff and are the first to be closed in times of recession. There istherefore a shortage of responsible jobs in Scotland and Wales, and the fear isthat they will become emasculated societies with too little influence over theirown economic fortunes. It is believed that if new centres of power were to be developed within Scotland and Wales, based on independent Scottish and WelshGovernments with the necessary economic tools to control and develop theScottish and Welsh economies in the way best suited to their needs, thenindustrial and commercial interests would be attracted to them, the talents of theScottish and Welsh peoples would be fully developed and employed in theinterests of their own countries, and prosperity would ensue.472. While we sympathise with the sense of frustration which lies behindthese arguments, we do not accept that Scotland and Wales cannot achieveprosperity within the United Kingdom. We have already indicated that in ourview their difficulties arise mainly from economic forces which have very little to do with systems of government. These forces would still be at work even ifScotland and Wales were independent. Under the present system these countries are not left to suffer the full rigours of United Kingdom policies which areunsuitable in their particular circumstances. Regional policies exist to compen-sate them for the adverse effects. New industries are deliberately diverted to scotland and Wales from England. Special grants and other forms of financialassistance are available to industrialists who expand or set up business there.Large new government offices have been deliberately sited in Scotland and wales to provide more work and increase local spending power. Such measures havealready helped Scotland and Wales substantially, bringing in much new employ-ment. That they have not succeeded completely does not mean that they can never do so. They have to be viewed against the long-term nature of the under-lying problems. There may be scope within the existing system of governmentfor regional policies to be made more effective, and there are some grounds forhoping that the resources available for combating industrial decline in the regions will be increased as a result of the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into theEuropean Economic Community. We. see no grounds for assertions that noLondon government will ever bring itself to do enough for Scotland and Wales.473. In our view, therefore, Scotland and Wales can achieve prosperitywithin the United Kingdom. But are there grounds for suggesting that they wouldbe able to do better still if they were independent ? Among the arguments forthis proposition we can see only two worth mentioning. The first is that independence would itself have a strong dynamic effect, generating fresheconomic activity. The second, relevant at present to Scotland only, is that, ifindependent, it could conceivably develop into a relatively wealthy oil state.474. These two arguments are not really convincing; they tend to commandattention because they cannot be disproved. The argument about the dynamic
effect of independence, already touched on in paragraph 463, is necessarilyspeculative. Our own view is that there might he something in it if Scotlandand Wales entered into independence with the general and wholehearted supportof their own peoples; but nothing like that degree of support for independenceexists, and without it the argument cannot be sustained. In any event it wouldbe naive to rely on the dynamic effect of independence to solve, in someunspecified way, and under new and inexperienced governments, long-term problems connected with the basic structure of Scottish and Welsh industry.475. The picture of Scotland as a wealthy oil state rests on the premise thatcomplete control of all the oil off the Scottish coast would pass to Scotlandfollowing independence, and on very early estimates of the quantities of oildiscovered. We have already discussed these matters. Even if it is assumed thatthe oil is sufficient to produce large revenues attributable to Scotland, turningher into a net contributor to United Kingdom funds, this does not mean thatthe economic advantages of remaining within the United Kingdom can be ignored. As part of the United Kingdom, Scotland can derive great benefit from oil. Its physical connection with the oil fields is unalterable. It will benefitdirectly from the development of supporting industries, and from the necessaryexpenditure on roads, housing and other social services. In addition the UnitedKingdom Government will continue to have the duty of devoting a proportionof the United Kingdom revenues, including those arising from the oil, to thesupport of Scottish industry as a whole and the improvement of Scottisheconomic conditions generally.476. It cannot be assumed that oil revenues would solve all the economic problems of an independent Scotland. The great bulk of the population would still rely on other industries for employment. Those industries would still be largely geared to the English market, and the problems of restructuring anddiversifying them, and making them competitive and successful, would remain.Financial aids to industry derived from the oil revenues would help, butthere is a limit to what these aids can achieve, and if Scotland were to be amember of the European Economic Community it would be subject to Com-munity restrictions on the form of its industrial incentives and on the amountof aid it could offer. It would not be able to do substantially more for itsindustry than other members, which would include neighbouring England.477. The two best arguments in favour of the proposition that Scotland andWales would stand a better chance of prosperity as independent states are there-fore hedged around with doubts. Against them must be set the loss, followingindependence, of the material benefits which now flow from membership of theUnited Kingdom and the fact that Scotland and Wales would still be over-overwhelmingly influenced by the economic fortunes of England and by theeconomic policies in operation there.478. The material benefits which would be lost are considerable. The UnitedKingdom Government would no longer have an interest in diverting new industry to Scotland and Wales or in taking other special steps to reduce unemployment there; the poorer regions of England, such as the North andSouth West, would move to the top of the queue. And in competing for new industry on an independent basis Scotland and Wales could not outbid England.Moreover, as a result of independence the people of Scotland and Wales would
lose their right to United Kingdom standards in services such as education,housing and health, and their right to the same social cash benefits as people in England. Subject, in the case of Scotland, to North Sea oil, the indications are that their own standards under independence would be lower.479. The influence which English economic policies would have on Scotlandand Wales following independence arises because all three countries are part ofa single economy. Professor Rees has pointed out that there is no such thingas a separate Scottish or Welsh economy1; there are only the Scottish and welsh parts of the United Kingdom economy. The position would not befundamentally changed by political independence. Scotland and Wales would still be substantially dependent on the very much larger English market, andtheir economic fortunes would still rise and fall with those of England. Theywould to a large extent be obliged in practice to conform to English policies;yet they would have lost the right to influence and question those policies, andwould not be able to vote out an English Government which pursued policiesthey did not like.480. The scope for independent management of fhe Scottish and Welsheconomies would be very restricted. It may be examined first on the assumptionthat border controls would be enforced, thus making it possible to restrict the flow of goods, labour and money between the three countries, and secondly onthe assumption (usually made by Scottish and Welsh nationalists) that therewould be no such controls. We have to consider, on each of these two assump-tions, the extent to which Scotland and Wales could use, in a really independentway, economic controls of the kind which are at present entirely in the handsof the United Kingdom Government. These controls include tariffs, adjustments in the rate of exchange, monetary controls and controls over taxation andexpenditure. The question is a complicated and speculative one; in this chapterwe can summarise the main probabilities only.481. We consider first what might happen with border controls. We haveargued in paragraph 464 that a balance of payments deficit would produce a policy conflict between maintaining the standard of government servicesand expanding exports. With border controls, this conflict might be resolved by devaluation or by tariff restrictions. But devaluation of the Scottish and welsh currencies against the English currency would be politically unpopularin Scotland and Wales; it would reduce the real standard of living and encouragefurther emigration to England. (In fifty years of independence the Irish Republichas never devalued its currency to a level below that of the United Kingdom.)And tariffs to restrict imports would invite English reprisals. Since the Englishmarket would be far more important to Scotland and Wales than their marketswould be to England, Scotland and Wales would be in a weak position.482. So far we have left on one side the policy objective by which an inde-pendent Scottish or Welsh Government would be most critically judged, thereduction of unemployment. It is possible that independent governments witha close knowledge of local economic conditions would be in a better position than a United Kingdom Government to judge how to direct fiscal policy towards improving employment prospects. But if such a policy were confined1 Research Paper 8, page 136.
to raising the level of aggregate demand, further policy conflicts would arise.Deficit spending by the two independent governments would raise the demandnot only for Scottish and Welsh domestic goods but also for imports, thuscreating additional balance of payments problems. In addition, unless well-developed capital markets emerged quickly in Scotland and Wales, governmentdeficits might make it difficult to achieve the necessary balance between fiscalmeasures and monetary measures, which rely on close control over domestic and foreign financial flows and interest rates. In contrast, a United KingdomGovernment can promote domestic expansion of demand in a particular areasuch as Scotland or Wales, absorbing the deficit for that area in the overallsurplus or deficit for the United Kingdom. It is still able to control the overallsurplus or deficit and, in addition, can achieve a much closer co-ordination offiscal and monetary policy through its influence on the domestic capital and money markets.483. Separate control by Scotland and Wales of their own interest ratesand money supply would be possible only if there were stringent restrictionson the flow of money across their borders with England. This would seriously affect the movement of investment capital into Scotland and Wales, which inrecent times has been very substantial.484. With independence Scotland and Wales would be able to devise theirown policies for attracting new industry, but always in competition with thedevelopment areas of England and subject to any relevant European economic community rules.485. In general, therefore, if border controls existed Scotland and wales would be free to adopt more flexible economic policies than are possible withinthe United Kingdom, but in practice this freedom would not be of much use to them. As separate units they might face a potentially serious balance ofpayments problem; they would not be able to run long-term budget deficits;and the new economic measures open to them following independence wouldbe either politically unacceptable or unlikely to succeed in promoting economic growth and removing unemployment. Tariff barriers would damage scottish and Welsh trade prospects; controls at the border could hardly be used to restrict emigration, and any use of them to restrict the movement of capital would not be in Scottish and Welsh interests. The economic policies of Scotlandand Wales would be conditioned by their overwhelming dependence on theEnglish market, and by the wages and investment opportunities on offer inEngland. Any independent action which made conditions worse on their sideof the border, even in the short term, would encourage further emigrationand discourage much-needed outside capital. Industrial incentives could be specially devised to meet Scottish and Welsh conditions, but they would haveto compete with those available in England and would be subject to anyrelevant Community restrictions.486. Influenced no doubt by the obvious difficulties which would arise from border controls, Scottish and Welsh nationalists generally envisage that,by agreement with England, there would be no such controls. Scotland, wales and England would form a single common market, with no restrictions on thefree movement of goods, people or money. What would be the scope for independent economic policies in Scotland and Wales on this alternative
assumption ? The answer is that the absence of border controls would virtuallyremove even the theoretical freedom of economic management which wouldexist with border controls. Devaluation of the Scottish and Welsh currencieswould be even harder to achieve; there could be no independent Scottish orWelsh tariff policies; major differences in taxation would be precluded; subsidies to industry would have to be harmonised with those in England; and indepen-dent monetary policies would be impossible. Scotland and Wales could altertheir patterns of public expenditure as compared with England, but they couldas well do that under a system of devolution within the United Kingdom.487. In this brief discussion we have not attempted to set out a comprehensive and exact judgement of how Scotland and Wales would fare economically ifthey were independent; the material for such a judgement is not available.We can form only general conclusions based on the wide range of evidence and expert opinion that we have received. Those conclusions are that theeconomic fortunes of Scotland and Wales are inextricably bound up withthose of England; that as independent states they would not in practice beable to cultivate a separate prosperity by adopting independent economic policies; that they would be overwhelmingly influenced by English economic policies without having the right to influence them; and that in general theywould be in a weak trading position, largely dependent on the English market and on co-operation from the English Government. On separation from england they would leave behind the very substantial material benefits ofUnited Kingdom membership and take a leap in the dark. The only hopesfor the future with any solid foundation would be those for Scotland basedon the discoveries of oil. But North Sea oil, even if the hopes for it were fully realised, would not solve all Scotland&apos;s economic problems or make possible a real separation of the Scottish economy from the rest of the United kingdom economy. It is not by itself a sound basis for sweeping constitutional change;and the same would apply to Wales if a significant strike of oil were to be madeoff the Welsh coast. Apart from any other factors, both countries have reasonto be wary about over-dependence on particular industries; and one day the oil will run out.488. The overwhelming weight of expert opinion is that, with independence,Scotland and Wales would be materially worse off. In our view they have abetter chance of achieving prosperity within the United Kingdom than theywould have outside it.The effects of the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the European Economic Community489. The general effects of the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into Europe havealready been discussed in Chapter 11. We now consider how it affects the case for separatism. Is the separation of Scotland and Wales from the rest of theUnited Kingdom still possible and, if so, is it a more or less attractiveproposition ?490. In our opinion the United kingdom&apos;s  membership of the Communitydoes not rule out independence. An overwhelming political desire for separationon the part of the Scottish and Welsh peoples could no more be denied withinthe European Community than outside it. It cannot be taken for granted,however, that if Scotland and Wales did become independent they would necessarily be accepted as members of the Community in their own right.
491. The effects of Community membership on the separatist case generally are not such as to alter the main conclusions reached in this chapter. the potential viability of Scotland and Wales as independent states dependsessentially on the political will of their own peoples, and is therefore notcrucially affected.492. The effects of membership on the economic arguments for separatismcan only be guessed at. If Scotland and Wales were to leave the community on becoming independent, a customs barrier would go up between them and england. They would be denied free access not only to the English marketbut to the whole of the Community market. On the periphery of Europe, andwith their industry still in need of reconstruction, it seems most unlikely thatthey could on their own revitalise their economies and compete successfullywith their neighbours. Certainly their prospects in that situation are not suchas to enhance the case for separation from England.493. If on becoming independent Scotland and Wales were to be accepted as members of the European Economic Community in their own right, therewould be no customs barrier with England. Membership of the Communityby England, Scotland and Wales would in itself require a customs unionbetween them. But the economic prospects of Scotland and Wales would notobviously be better than they would be if they remained within the community as parts of the United Kingdom. Admittedly they would be separately repre-sented in Brussels and would be able to press their own case. But within theUnited Kingdom they could benefit to the maximum from both United Kingdomand Community regional policies; they could be treated in their entirety asassisted areas; they could expect to receive special United Kingdom funds for industrial development, and to benefit from restrictions on industrial develop-ment in other parts of Britain; and they could be accepted in Brussels as partsof a member state deserving special financial help. If they were outside theUnited Kingdom they would lose the benefit of United Kingdom regional policies, including the diversion of industrial development from England,and might have difficulty in persuading the Community that their wholeterritories should be regarded as areas qualifying for special assistance. Assmall and relatively inaccessible markets they would be offering little in theway of economic advantage to the Community, but would be in need of themaximum help from it.494. Our general conclusion is that, while the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into europe does not rule out the separation of Scotland and Wales, it does not make it any more attractive; in particular, it might add to the already con-siderable economic difficulties which would face Scotland and Wales as independent states.conclusion495. When Scotland joined with England in 1707 it did so in order to gainaccess to the expanding English and colonial market; England, for its part,wanted a friend rather than an enemy at its back. Since that time, over a periodof centuries, the Scottish and English markets have become one organic whole,and the two peoples have become not merely friends but close members of thesame family. By a different process of history the same kind of relationshiplong ago developed between England and Wales. The overwhelming majority
of people in all three countries do not want any fundamental change in thoserelationships. To many of them the very idea of dividing up Great Britain into three sovereign states would appear nonsensical all the more so followingentry into Europe and against a general background of increasing international co--operation.496. This does not mean that the Scottish and Welsh peoples do not have astrong sense of separate national identity, or that there could be no improve-ment in the arrangements for their government within the United Kingdom.But we do not think that separation and sovereign independence would give any greater satisfaction. It would neither serve the purposes of good govern-ment in Scotland and Wales nor enhance their prosperity quite the reverse.For England, while it might result in some material gains, it would pose somedifficult strategic and defence questions. Quite apart from these practical considerations, however, the English value the old-established unity and haveno wish to see it broken. For them, as for most Scots and Welsh, the mutualtrust and affection which exists is an accepted part of life which ought to be preserved. Many of them have Scottish or Welsh ancestry, and perhaps con-tinuing family ties with Scotland or Wales. Political separation would present for very many people in all parts of Britain a problem of national identitywhich they would find unwelcome and regard as totally unnecessary.497. The paramount reason for demanding or rejecting independence must always be political. For separation to succeed it must command the general support of the people concerned. If it is not widely supported it is a completenon-starter; if it has that support then even the most serious economic obstacleswill not be allowed to stand in its way. In our judgement the necessary politicalwill for separation does not exist. The vast majority of people simply do not want it to happen. We believe that the national aspirations of the Scottish and welsh peoples and their desire for better government are more likely to besatisfied within the United Kingdom than outside it.
FEDERALISM498. There is very little demand for federalism in Scotland and Wales, and practically none at all in England. Few of our witnesses advocated it, and people who know the system well tend to advise against it. Nevertheless it is animportant constitutional model midway between separatism, which we reject,and devolution, which in one form or another we favour. It is operated in anumber of advanced countries, where it has been adopted in preference toany other system. It seems right, therefore, that it should find a place in our discussion.499. Three of the papers in our research series are especially relevant. Theyare a paper by Professor M. J. C. Vile of the University of Kent on federalismin the United States, Canada and Australia1; a paper by Mr. N. Johnson ofNuffield College, Oxford on federalism and decentralisation in West Germany2;and a paper by Miss D. A. Dawson, an American economist on the staff ofGlasgow University, describing financial arrangements in the United States,Canada, Australia and West Germany, and commenting in a more general wayon problems of economic management in those countries3. Discussion offinance is kept to a minimum in this chapter. The financial problems of federalismare similar to those associated with advanced forms of devolution, and sincemost of this Report is concerned with devolution we have thought it better toplace our main discussion of finance in that context. The subject is dealt withprincipally in Chapter 15.500. In this chapter we first explain what is meant by federalism and then,in the light of experience of its operation abroad, we assess its suitability for adoption in the United Kingdom. Like others before us we have concluded that it is not suitable. This is partly because of the difficulties inherent in anyfederal system, and partly on account of the particular circumstances of theUnited Kingdom.the meaning of federalism501. Professor Vile suggests in his paper that formal definitions of federalismhave become meaningless. All that we need do here is to describe briefly what we take to be the general characteristics of a federal system of government and explain how it differs from other systems.502. In a federal system sovereignty is divided between two levels of govern-ment. The federal government is sovereign in some matters and theprovincial4 governments are sovereign in others. Each within its own sphereexercises its power without control from the other, and neither is subordinateto the other. It is this feature which distinguishes a federal from a unitaryconstitution. In the latter all sovereignty rests with the central government;1 Research Paper 2.2 Research Paper 1.3 Research Paper 9.4 To avoid any confusion which might arise from using the word &quot;state&quot;, the units within a federation are generally referred to in this chapter as &quot;provinces&quot;.
if provincial governments exist, they are subordinate authorities, deriving their power from the central legislature, which may overrule them at any time bythe ordinary legislative processes.503. Federal functions traditionally include those in which it is necessaryfor the country to act as one in relation to the rest of the world. The obviousexamples are defence and foreign affairs, but there is also usually a long list of practical matters such as immigration, shipping and telecommunications.Provincial functions traditionally include most domestic matters such aseducation, roads and public health. These are considered to be essentiallymatters of local interest which ought to be within the control of the province.Policies may therefore vary substantially from province to province. between these traditionally federal and traditionally provincial functions, there are othermatters, such as taxation and commerce, in which responsibility is divided between the federal and provincial levels.504. Although sovereignty is usually divided along subject lines, there are other possibilities. A feature of the West German constitution, for example,is that it allocates to the provinces (the Lander) not only certain legislativeresponsibilities but also responsibility for executive action in most subjects,including many in which legislative power lies with the federal Parliament.505. The allocation of functions between federal and provincial governments is set out in a written constitution. This may specifically enumerate the functionsof the federal government and assign the residue of government functions tothe provinces, as in the United States and Australia, or it may enumerate theprovincial functions and leave the residual functions to the federal government,as in Canada.506. The basic terms of the constitution are &quot;entrenched&quot; in that theycannot be amended at the sole discretion of the federation or of any provinceor combination of provinces. Such amendment, for example to bring about are-allocation of powers between the federal and provincial governments, canbe achieved only by special procedures which ensure that widespread support for the change exists. There is a great variety of such procedures. Any changemay, for example, require the approval of the people expressed in a referendum.Or the federal legislature may have power to make the change, but only withthe agreement of a specially large majority. Or final action may have to await the approval of the people as signified by the results of a general election.The provincial legislatures may themselves have a role in the amending process.507. The federal legislature will generally comprise a lower house directly elected by the people at large, and an upper house consisting of provincialrepresentatives, which may have special powers in relation to matters affectingprovincial interests. Any dispute between the federal and provincial governmentsabout the extent of their respective powers may be resolved ultimately by a constitutional court, itself set up under the constitution.508. Federal arrangements normally provide for financial resources to be divided between the federal and provincial governments to match their respectiveresponsibilities under the constitution. Each may be entitled to levy certain
taxes, the proceeds of other taxes may be shared and there will probably be provision for the federal government to distribute some of its funds to theprovinces.509. This short description of a federal system is a much simplified one. Inpractice such systems are complicated and vary a great deal. But the outline wehave given may suffice for present purposes.510. Whereas separatism, as discussed in the last chapter, would give a province sovereignty in all matters, converting it into a completely independent state, federalism would give it sovereignty only in some matters. In these mattersits sovereign rights would be protected by provisions entrenched in the con-stitution. Other matters, not assigned to it under the constitution, would be administered within its borders directly by the federal government, or by theprovincial government only as agent of the federal government. In any systemof devolution under a unitary constitution, a province would have no sovereignrights at all. There would be no written constitution or court which couldultimately prevent its powers from being reduced by the central government;constitutionally it could be overruled by the central legislature on any matter.511. It might appear from this description that a federal system would givethe individual countries of the United Kingdom a large measure of autonomy.In many important domestic matters they would have sovereign powers whichcould not be overridden by the central government. Their entrenched positionin the constitution would give them a status and influence which the centralgovernment would be bound to take into account. At the same time they could still work together in those domestic matters requiring a common policy, andwould still form a single state in the eyes of the world.512. The situation looks very different, however, when one examinesfederalism in action. It then becomes clear that in practice it would not bringthe advantages which it might appear to offer in theory. Before considering,therefore, how federalism might be applied to the United Kingdom, and whatthe consequences might be, we look at developments abroad in those countrieswhich now have a federal form of government.federalism in practice513. Federal theory was developed largely during the nineteenth century,and many of the criticisms which are made of federalism arise because in important respects it is considered not to be compatible with the greater demands made on government in the twentieth century. In the early days of federalismthe part played by government in people&apos;s lives was small. The activities ofgovernment were comparatively simple. It was concerned with only a limitedrange of domestic matters; the major preoccupation was often foreign affairs.In those circumstances it was possible to divide sovereignty neatly betweenfederal and provincial governments. There was unlikely to be much conflict between the mainly foreign and defence responsibilities of the federal govern-ment and the mainly domestic responsibilities of the provincial governments.To all intents and purposes those matters which affected people from day today could be fully controlled at the provincial level.
514. Since that time, however, important changes have taken place. largely due to public demand there has been an enormous increase in the responsibilities of government, as already described in Chapter 8. There have been developments in ideas about social justice. It is now widely accepted that governments should do a great deal to help the needy and to ensure a large measure of equality in public services and general standards of living. And there has recently been a growth of international co-operation which has led to an increase in the numbers and scope of international agreements; these now tend to cover subjects which,in a federal state, would formerly have been regarded as purely provincialmatters.515. As a result of these changes the federal idea of divided sovereignty is becoming difficult to sustain. Provincial governments can no longer keepde facto control over all the matters which are constitutionally their sole responsibility. Their sovereignty is being eroded because their electoratesare demanding more than can be provided without federal help. In mostfederations, therefore, power is fast gravitating to the centre. The entrenchmentof provincial sovereignty in federal constitutions has not prevented this. It hasbeen overcome either by the transfer of provincial powers to the federal govern-ment through changes in the constitution or, more usually, by elaboratemeasures of co-operation between the provincial and federal governments which in theory leave the provinces&apos; powers intact but which in practice put thefederal government in a largely controlling position. In short, to make federalismwork in modern conditions federal countries have been compelled to take steps which tend to undermine the principle of provincial sovereignty on which thesystem itself is based. What is actually in operation is not true federalism.Professor Vile in his paper suggests that in the United States the concentration of power at the centre has become so great that the country may be moving outof a system of federalism into one of decentralised unitary government.516. This general growth in the responsibilities of federal governments is illustrated by their increasing involvement in domestic matters such as education,law enforcement and urban development, all traditionally provincial responsibility-facilities. They are also increasingly taking on responsibility for social security,which is not only a very costly service for provincial governments to providebut also one in which comparisons may easily be made between standards in.one province and those in another. And federal governments are playing an increasingly important part in the internal economic development of theirprovinces.517. The immediate cause of greater federal involvement is often a shortageof provincial funds. Provincial governments, in order to discharge their con-stitutional functions in the ways now demanded by their electorates, tend torequire more money than is available to them from sources provided under theconstitution. They are therefore compelled to turn to the federal government fora re-allocation of revenues or for direct financial help from federal funds.Not infrequently federal help reaches them in a way which undermines their independence. One of the chief obstacles to the proper working of federalism in modern conditions is the impracticability of arranging a division of financebetween the federal and provincial governments which will for any length oftime satisfactorily match their respective functions under the constitution. this difficulty is further discussed in Chapter 15.
518. Federal responsibilities have also tended to grow because of the increasing interest in equalisation. Any arrangement for equalising the standards of public services or general economic conditions between the richer and poorerprovinces has normally to be supervised from the centre. The need for suchequalisation, entirely contrary in spirit to the original federal concept of provincial autonomy, is now widely acknowledged in federations, although theextent to which it is satisfied still varies a great deal1.519. In various ways, therefore, changes in the objectives of government aretending to result in the by-passing of provincial sovereignty. Yet this adjustment of federalism to modern requirements is generally achieved only with difficulty.The formal division of sovereignty between the federal and provincial govern-ments tends to slow down desirable change and may even prevent it altogether.Where sovereign rights are at stake agreement to change may not be easy toreach. Negotiations for a new allocation of functions or sources of revenuebetween the federation and the provinces can be long drawn out.520. It is widely accepted that even at its best federalism is an awkwardsystem to operate. It depends a great deal on co-operation between governments.Our impression is that even in countries where it has worked satisfactorily this isnot because of its intrinsic merits but because those concerned with governmenthave been successful in overcoming its drawbacks. It is almost as though theyhave agreed among themselves that the sensible thing to do is to work round the system. Outside the strictly constitutional division of power there may bean extensive network of machinery for inter-governmental co-operation which makes it possible to overcome or reduce the difficulties inherent in a federalsystem.521. Canada is an interesting exception to the general rule that power infederations gravitates towards the centre. Its original constitution, embodied in the British North America Act of 1867, was so centralised that it could hardly be classed as federal at all; but as settlement of the country was extendedinto new areas by people of different nationalities and languages, the diversenature of Canadian society became increasingly marked, and the dominion government found it impossible to exercise effectively from the centre the powers given to it under the constitution. In order to make the constitution work itwas necessary to operate it in a way quite different from that originally intended.Over a period of fifty years the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (until1949 the final court of appeal in constitutional matters) interpreted the british north America Act in such a way as to appear to reverse its original purpose.Federal powers were restricted and provincial powers were expanded until,in effect, residual power was removed from the federal government to theprovinces2. But although, exceptionally, the Canadian provinces have pre-vented any great movement of power to the centre, it can hardly be said that canada finds federalism a convenient system of government. The pressureswhich have caused power to shift to the centre in other federations have to bemet in Canada by complicated processes of bargaining between the federal and provincial governments. The greater insistence on provincial sovereignty tends to make things more difficult, not less.1 See Research Paper 9.2 For an account of this development see Research Paper 2.
522. When Canada and the United States are looked at together theydemonstrate rather neatly that the terms of a federal constitution, written andentrenched though they may be, have in practice to be amended or interpretedto suit the current requirements of the people. The Canadian constitution,intended to bring about a highly centralised form of federalism, has in practiceresulted in a decentralised system. The United States constitution, based stronglyon &quot;states&apos; rights&quot;, has led to almost unrestricted federal power. And in both cases the constitutional division of sovereignty between the federal and pro-vincial governments has made it difficult to achieve the kind of system thepeople really need.523. It seems to us, therefore, that in the modern world federal countries are hampered by an inflexible system of government. They are having to recog-nise provincial sovereignty when in many respects it is no longer a realisticconcept; and they are compelled to work round the constitution instead ofthrough it.application of federalism to the united kingdom524. In speaking of general principles in Chapter 11 we suggested that a constitution should be made to suit the times in which the people are living.We also suggested that it should be flexible, in order to absorb the political andadministrative strains which inevitably arise in the operation of government machinery. In the light of what we have said about experience abroad it is apparent that neither of these criteria would be satisfied by a federal constitution in the United Kingdom.525. If our general criticisms of federalism are accepted, there would haveto be some very compelling reasons for introducing it into the United Kingdom.Our discussions have led us rather to the opposite conclusion, that there areparticular reasons for not introducing it. In the paragraphs which follow we giveour reasons for thinking that, in addition to the general objections to federalismas a form of government, there are considerations which would make itparticularly unsuitable for adoption in the United Kingdom.The stage of constitutional development526. The greater part of this Report centres on the supposition that it wouldbe better if certain powers of the central legislature and government were to be broken up in some way and dispersed to the individual countries and regions of the United Kingdom. Federalism was designed and is appropriate for statescoming together to form a single unit, and not for a state breaking up intosmaller units. More particularly, it is appropriate to the earlier stages of integration, when relations between provinces and between the provincial andfederal governments are inevitably characterised by a certain wariness andrivalry. Hence the need to have everything down in writing. But the UnitedKingdom has for centuries been governed in a spirit of unity and co-operation,and even if this unity is now being questioned it would hardly be satisfactory toadopt a legalistic system intended for a much earlier stage of constitutional development. No unitary state comparable to the United Kingdom has everchanged to federalism, with the exception of West Germany after the second world War. The circumstances in that case were unique. There Was a desireto avoid a re-concentration of power at the centre, and for this reason the occupying powers insisted on the adoption of a federal constitution. Although
that form of government is evidently now in accord with the will of the WestGerman people themselves, the federation is probably sustained as much by the continuing desire to avoid the political dangers of centralisation as by any specialwish for regional diversity. It has to be remembered also that the earlier historyof Germany is mainly one of political division; unity was achieved only in 1871,and it was not until 1933 that full control was exercised from the centre. Thefederal constitution of 1949, therefore, did not impose something entirely new and out of keeping with modern history.Acceptability of federalism527. We have noted that a federal system of government would require a written constitution, a special procedure for changing it and a constitutionalcourt to interpret it. None of these features has been present in our constitutional arrangements before, and we doubt very much whether they would now findgeneral acceptance.528. Although there are many Acts of Parliament dealing with constitutionalmatters, there is no separate body of entrenched law which enshrines the basicrules of our system of government. Parliament is sovereign and can make oralter any law by a simple majority1. Its Acts are interpreted by the courts,but this is done strictly by reference to the words of the statute itself, not in thelight of any general constitutional principles or supposed limitations on thepowers of Parliament. Ultimately Parliament cannot be overruled by the courts.If it does not like the interpretation put on the law by the courts, it can change the law.529. In a federal system, however, there is more than one legislature andthe powers of each are strictly defined. There may be provision for federal law to override provincial law where the two conflict, but this rule is designed for those fields in which the federal and provincial governments have joint responsibility. It cannot be used by the federal government to encroach uponlegislative territory specifically assigned under the constitution to the provinces.Disputes about governmental powers which cannot otherwise be resolved go toa constitutional court. The effect is therefore to place elected bodies in a positionsubordinate to the judiciary. Inevitably there are some constitutional questionswhich have to be decided more as a matter of individual judgement than inaccordance with the rules laid down in the constitution. This is particularly true of those federations, such as the United States, whose constitutions are in briefand general terms. The work of the judges therefore tends to become political,and their known political views are taken into account when they are appointed.This situation, probably unavoidable in a federal system, is foreign to our owntradition of unitary government based upon the complete sovereignty of Parlia-ment and upon the complete dissociation of the judiciary from matters ofpolitical policy.530. Although there are circumstances in which the benefits to be derivedfrom federalism may outweigh those of any practicable alternative, in our viewsuch circumstances do not exist in the United Kingdom. We believe that tomost people a federal system would appear strange and artificial. It would not provide continuity with the past or sufficient flexibility for the future, and it is unlikely that it would be generally acceptable.1 See paragraph 56.
The dominant position of England531. As far as we are aware no advocate of federalism in the United kingdom has succeeded in producing a federal scheme satisfactorily tailored to fit thecircumstances of England. A federation consisting of four units England,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be so unbalanced as to beunworkable. It would be dominated by the overwhelming political importance and wealth of England. The English Parliament would rival the United Kingdomfederal Parliament; and in.,the federal Parliament itself the representation ofEngland could hardly be scaled down in such a way as to enable it to be out-voted by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, together representing less thanone-fifth of the population. A United Kingdom federation of the four countries,with a federal Parliament and provincial Parliaments in the four nationalcapitals, is therefore not a realistic proposition.532. The imbalance would be corrected if England were to be divided intoa number of units, each having the status of a federal province. It is clear,however, that this artificial division into provinces with independent sovereignpowers would be unacceptable to the people of England. Advocates of federalismhave attempted to get round the difficulty by an arrangement in which the regions of England would not have the full status of federal provinces; they wouldhave elected assemblies with fewer powers than the legislatures of Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland, and a separate body would be established to dealwith all-England affairs. But no matter how this body were to be constitutedand its powers shared with the regional assemblies, the fact would remain thatEngland by its weight of numbers and wealth would continue to dominate thefederation.533. Proposals designed to accommodate federalism by splitting Englandup into several provinces tend to overlook one further point, which is that theprovince which included south-east England might well itself dominate thefederation. Out of a United Kingdom population of 55 million, over 17 millionlive in this region, and since it includes London, the headquarters of bothgovernment and business, its general influence on the economic life of thecountry as a whole is proportionately even greater.534. For these reasons, stated here only in brief terms, we have concluded that there is no satisfactory way of fitting England into a fully federal system.The consequences for political and economic unity535. We have said that we regard as essential the maintenance of politicaland economic unity. Federalism would tend to undermine that unity and makethe objectives of the United Kingdom more difficult to attain. There is apossibility that provinces with sovereign powers would not always be veryready to co-operate with each other and with the central government in the wider interest. In any dispute affecting their own functions they would be ableto hold their corner indefinitely. They might be tempted to withhold co-operation in order to assert their sovereignty, and to use their sovereign powers in provincial matters as a bargaining counter to gain advantages in federalmatters. In our view there is a real danger that provincial sovereignty would lead to intergovernmental rivalry and contention to an extent that would be
damaging to the interests of the United Kingdom. In the inteinational field,and particularly in European Community matters, it would add to the difficultiesof the United Kingdom Governmenfs negotiating position.536. A federal system would be less suitable than a unitary system for meeting the economic needs of the United Kingdom, which has a more openeconomy than most federal countries and is more dependent on overseastrade. Its governments also tend to pursue more radical objectives; a highly developed regional policy is one example. For these reasons it has a greaterneed for instruments of central economic management. In a federal system the base of taxation and expenditure available to the United Kingdom Governmentfor economic adjustments would be substantially reduced. A large part oftaxation and public expenditure would be under the sovereign control of provincial governments primarily concerned with pursuing their own policies in provincial matters; their independent decisions about provincial taxation and expenditure would be geared to that end. The circumstances of mostfederal countries are such that this obstacle to economic management can be successfully overcome. For United Kingdom governments concerned withperforming the economic role which has come to be expected of them thedifficulties would be a good deal greater. We return to this subject in chapter 151.537. Although we recognise, therefore, that it might be desirable to dispersegovernmental power from the centre, so allowing more scope for local autonomyand the open discussion of regional interests, we think that the general dispersal of sovereignty entailed in a federal system would be going too far.conclusion538. After all these criticisms it is right to recall that federalism is the acceptedbasis of government in many countries. And in some of those countries at leastit does result in the preservation of a reasonable balance of power between thecentre and the provinces. We believe, however, that where the results are successful this is due not so much to federalism as such as to the ingenuity and common sense of those who are operating it. By and large the system is not ofany great help to them in modern conditions. It tends to place difficulties in their way. They get round those difficulties in practice often by departing from theprinciple of provincial sovereignty on which the system itself is based. In effectwhat they are operating is not true federalism, and their experience suggeststhat a division of sovereignty may no longer be fully practicable. It may be thatthe demands made on government are growing and changing so rapidly that a formal division of functions between two levels of government can be satis-factorily sustained only when one of them can if need be enforce upon the other redistribution of those functions.539. At all events we have concluded that if government in the UnitedKingdom is to meet the present-day needs of the people it is necessary for theundivided sovereignty of Parliament to be maintained. We believe that only within the general ambit of one supreme elected authority is it likely that therewill emerge the degree of unity, co-operation and flexibility which common1 The economic implications of provincial government are discussed at greater length in research Papers 9 and 10.
sense suggests is desirable. Even if a federal system could be designed to avoiddomination by England (and we do not think it could) it would endanger theessential unity which now exists and make some important tasks of governmentmore difficult to perform. It would probably be regarded by the British people as a strange and artificial system not suited to their present stage of constitu-tional development, and in the end would bring the provinces very little moreindependence than might be achieved within a unitary system. In short, theUnited Kingdom is not an appropriate place for federalism and now is not an appropriate time.540. This conclusion still leaves unsolved all the problems of over-centralisation which we discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. In the chapters which follow we consider how far those problems might be solved by devolution.
PART vi the SCOPE FOR DEVOLUTION INGREAT BRITAIN
INTRODUCTORYour treatment of devolution541. We have seen that one of the main causes of discontent with governmentis the centralisation-ror over-centralisation as many see it of power in London.One of our principal tasks is to consider the desirability and possible means of transferring the exercise of government power away from London and nearer to the people whose lives it affects. This transfer could take many different forms, depending upon the number and size of the geographical areas over which the transferred powers were to be exercised, the extent of those powers,the constitution of the bodies to which they were transferred and the relation-ship of those bodies to Parliament and the central government.542. We have given our reasons for rejecting a transfer of powers whichwould involve the division of the country either into a number of separatesovereign states (separatism) or into states sharing sovereignty with the UnitedKingdom (federalism). There is no great demand in Scotland and Wales,and practically none at all in England, for such solutions, and we are convincedthat the prosperity and good government of the people of all parts of theUnited Kingdom will be better served if political and economic unity, includingthe supreme authority of Parliament, is maintained.543. The transfers of power with which we shall be concerned in this and subsequent Parts of our Report, therefore, are those which would leave over-riding control in the hands of Parliament. The extent of the powers transferredand the conditions under which they were to be exercised would be prescribed by statute and might at any time be changed by Parliament or by Ministersanswerable to it. In other words we shall be concerned with devolution, whichis the delegation of central government powers without the relinquishment of sovereignty.544. The more advanced forms of devolution which we have to considerinvolve the exercise of powers by persons or bodies who, although acting onauthority delegated by Parliament, are not directly answerable to it or to thecentral government for their actions. It is the essence of such arrangements that those who exercise the devolved powers in the various parts of the country have some measure of independence, permitting them to do things in their ownways, which may not always have the support of the central government.In this Part of our Report we consider the limitations that have to be placedon that independence of action in the wider interests of the country as a whole.We have already set out in Chapter 11 the general principles which in ourview should underlie any proposals for constitutional reform. We recognisethat no proposal could be expected fully to satisfy all of them, and our tasktherefore is to establish what is the maximum extent of devolution which wouldbe both practicable and reasonably consistent with the general body of principles.In Chapter 15 we consider the scope for giving subordinate assemblies in the regions power to control revenue and expenditure, and in Chapter 16 we
examine all the principal functions of government with a view to indicatingthose which must continue to be performed at the centre and those which canbe considered for devolution to the regions.545. We should make it clear that in these chapters we are concerned toestablish only what may be regarded as the limits of practicability, and notin any way to indicate our own views on the need for devolution or the extentto which it should be applied in any part of the country. Before reachingconclusions on these matters, we have to examine the various forms thatdevolution might take and the problems that arise. This we do in a series ofchapters in Part VII.546. We deal in Chapter 17 with the most advanced form of devolution withwhich we shall be concerned; in this, which for convenience we refer to aslegislative devolution, powers would be transferred to regional assemblies todetermine policy on a selected range of subjects, to enact legislation to giveeffect to that policy and to provide the administrative machinery for its execution, while reserving to Parliament the ultimate power to legislate for the regions on all matters. In Chapter 18 we consider a more restricted form of devolution, in which Parliament and the central government would remain responsible for the framework of legislation and for major policy in all subjects,and would transfer to regional assemblies responsibility within that framework for devising specific policies for the regions, for the execution of those policies and for general administration; we refer to this as executive devolution.Chapter 19 deals with regional bodies, with few if any executive powers them-selves, whose main function would be to advise others on the formulation and execution of policy; and Chapter 20 with a particular proposal for a scottish assembly which, in addition to advisory functions, would have power to partici-pate in the framing and passage of Scottish legislation introduced in Parliament.Although this division of government activity into various categories is useful for descriptive purposes, it is not a precise one and any new regional body setup could have conferred upon it a combination of legislative, executive and advisory functions. In Chapters 21 and 22, considering an entirely differentorder of ideas, we examine the various ways in which the central governmentand Parliament, without transferring responsibility to bodies with a measure of independence, might themselves arrange for aspects of their work to be conducted on a regional framework or in a regional setting.547. Having examined in Part VI the scope for devolution and in Part vii the various forms that it might take, we record our conclusions in a series ofchapters in Part VIII.the northern ireland experience548. In considering the problems of devolution, we are able to draw onexperience of the operation of an advanced form of devolution in one part of theUnited Kingdom. It has been argued that the manifest failure of devolvedgovernment in Northern Ireland should suffice to rule out all consideration ofits possible extension to other parts of the United Kingdom. We reject thisview. The fact that devolved government did not provide a lasting solution to apolitical and community problem which has persisted for several centuries, andis peculiar to Ireland, in no way implies a defect in the concept of devolutionwhich was there applied. While &quot;home rule&quot;, to use the popular term, failed to
examine all the principal functions of government with a view to indicatingthose which must continue to be performed at the centre and those which canbe considered for devolution to the regions.545. We should make it clear that in these chapters we are concerned toestablish only what may be regarded as the limits of practicability, and notin any way to indicate our own views on the need for devolution or the extentto which it should be applied in any part of the country. Before reachingconclusions on these matters, we have to examine the various forms thatdevolution might take and the problems that arise. This we do in a series ofchapters in Part VII.546. We deal in Chapter 17 with the most advanced form of devolution withwhich we shall be concerned; in this, which for convenience we refer to aslegislative devolution, powers would be transferred to regional assemblies todetermine policy on a selected range of subjects, to enact legislation to giveeffect to that policy and to provide the administrative machinery for its execution, while reserving to Parliament the ultimate power to legislate for the regions on all matters. In Chapter 18 we consider a more restricted form of devolution, in which Parliament and the central government would remain responsible for the framework of legislation and for major policy in all subjects,and would transfer to regional assemblies responsibility within that framework for devising specific policies for the regions, for the execution of those policies and for general administration; we refer to this as executive devolution.Chapter 19 deals with regional bodies, with few if any executive powers them-selves, whose main function would be to advise others on the formulation and execution of policy; and Chapter 20 with a particular proposal for a scottish assembly which, in addition to advisory functions, would have power to partici-pate in the framing and passage of Scottish legislation introduced in Parliament.Although this division of government activity into various categories is useful for descriptive purposes, it is not a precise one and any new regional body setup could have conferred upon it a combination of legislative, executive and advisory functions. In Chapters 21 and 22, considering an entirely differentorder of ideas, we examine the various ways in which the central governmentand Parliament, without transferring responsibility to bodies with a measure of independence, might themselves arrange for aspects of their work to be conducted on a regional framework or in a regional setting.547. Having examined in Part VI the scope for devolution and in Part vii the various forms that it might take, we record our conclusions in a series ofchapters in Part VIII.the northern ireland experience548. In considering the problems of devolution, we are able to draw onexperience of the operation of an advanced form of devolution in one part of theUnited Kingdom. It has been argued that the manifest failure of devolvedgovernment in Northern Ireland should suffice to rule out all consideration ofits possible extension to other parts of the United Kingdom. We reject thisview. The fact that devolved government did not provide a lasting solution to apolitical and community problem which has persisted for several centuries, andis peculiar to Ireland, in no way implies a defect in the concept of devolutionwhich was there applied. While &quot;home rule&quot;, to use the popular term, failed to
resolve this problem, the existence of which gave rise to its establishment,it had, as we show in Chapter 28, considerable success as an experiment indevolved government, which was presumably not uppermost in the minds ofits authors. That Northern Ireland&apos;s economic difficulties have persisted is alsono adverse reflection on home rule; they are a product of the province&apos;s history,economic structure and geographical position, accentuated by the disordersarising out of the community problem.549. In our view, therefore, what has happened in Northern Ireland shouldnot rule out consideration of the application to other regions of devolvedgovernment, including the particular form of devolution applied there. We aresatisfied that a study of the Northern Ireland experience is useful for an under-standing of the technical and practical workings of devolution. In particular it is helpful in dealing with the problem of finance, as we show in Chapter 29,and it provides a guide to those subjects of government which are capable ofbeing devolved.550. The great breadth of the powers transferred to the Northern ireland parliament by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which we noted inparagraphs 157 and 158 suggests that when the Act was framed the list of matters reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament was kept to the minimumthen considered to be necessary for the retention of Ireland as an integral partof the United Kingdom. At no time during its application to Northern ireland was there need to make more than a few minor adjustments to the list. It there-fore provides a good starting point for considering the scope for devolution toother parts of the United Kingdom.551. It seems to us that, with the possible exclusion of those few matters,including the reserved taxes, which were earmarked for ultimate transfer to anall-Ireland Parliament, the list of matters reserved under the 1920 Act is, withminor exceptions, the minimum that would need to be reserved under any new arrangement for the devolution of powers. Indeed the range of matters reservedwould almost certainly have to be greater. There are two reasons for this.In the first place the division between &quot;imperial matters&quot; which require centraldirection and matters of only domestic concern which can safely be left to the regions is no longer as clear as it appeared to be when the 1920 Act was drafted,and Northern Ireland experience suggests the need for some change. Secondly,the considerations which apply to the regions of Great Britain are different fromthose which apply to Northern Ireland. It is one thing to confer independentpowers of decision on a small, detached part of the United Kingdom with a population less than 3 per cent, of the whole. It is quite another thing to devolvea similar range of powers on substantial areas of the British mainland, especially if they amount in sum to the whole of the United Kingdom.552. On examining the working of the 1920 Northern Ireland constitution,we reached certain conclusions about the devolved functions. These are setout in Chapter 28, but it will be useful to state them in summary form here.Greater use of the power to adopt independent policies was made in those matters which did not involve substantial expenditure than in those which did.Northern Ireland was not financially independent, and the application atthe choice of the Northern Ireland Government of the parity principle on
which the financial relationship with the United Kingdom was based had the inevitable consequence that much of the legislation passed by the NorthernIreland Parliament differed only in minor respects, if at all, from the comparablelegislation at Westminster. Where policies did differ and there were financial implications, they differed only with the agreement of the United KingdomGovernment. In our next chapter, however, we give it as our view that a region&apos;sdependence on United Kingdom funds need not mean that it must followUnited Kingdom policies, so that in this respect experience in Northern ireland is not necessarily a guide to what would happen under a system of regionaldevolution in Great Britain.553. There were other important factors operating to restrict the use madeby the Northern Ireland Parliament and Government of their independentpolicy-making powers. In many fields they were compelled by the pressure of public opinion, fostered by the growing ease of communication between thetwo parts of the United Kingdom, to adopt policies or standards which were broadly in line with those in Great Britain; though substantial differencesexisted when home rule began in 1920, as time passed they tended to diminish.These influences towards uniformity might in some ways be stronger in GreatBritain than in Northern Ireland, since they would be reinforced by the absenceof a sea barrier and by the long tradition of common policies and commonstandards.554. A significant change since 1920 results from the increasing tendency for matters, particularly those in the trade and industry field, which were onceregarded as purely domestic to be made the subject of international agreement.Some of the matters which in 1920 were transferred to Northern Ireland nowfall, for example, within the scope of the legislation of the european communities.555. Another factor to be borne in mind is that for the whole period of its existence up to 1972 the Northern Ireland Parliament had a majority of members from the Unionist Party, primarily concerned to maintain against strong opposition Northern Ireland&apos;s position as an integral part of the UnitedKingdom and willing, for political as well as financial reasons, to give at least as much weight to the objective of uniformity of policy with Great britain as to the exercise of regional autonomy. This was true whatever the party in power at Westminster. Even if it had not been so, the extent to which NorthernIreland might, by adopting its own separate domestic policies, have prejudicedthe interests of the people of other parts of the United Kingdom, or widernational interests, would have been limited by its small size and detachedposition. A part of Great Britain which was larger and more populous, and hada greater readiness to use its powers in a truly independent way, would have agreater capacity for undermining the essential unity of the country.556. In considering the Northern Ireland experience we have to bear in mindthese many differences between the province and the other regions of theUnited Kingdom. In those other regions the absence of the sea barrier would tend to increase the cross-border effects Of distinctive regional policies, while thepractical possibilities for the adoption of such policies might be less restricted by the terms of the financial relationship with the centre. The capacity of the
larger, more heavily populated regions of Great Britain, either alone or in combination, to do damage to essential United Kingdom interests would bevery much greater. Politically there might also be a greater readiness to use the devolved powers in a distinctive way, even if this meant rocking the UnitedKingdom boat rather more than the Northern Ireland Government was prepared to do. On the other hand, there would continue to be strong publicpressures for uniformity of treatment, and in many fields the use of the devolvedpowers to develop any very distinctive policies might cause difficulties for the regions themselves.regions of great britain557. These considerations do not preclude the grant of independent policy-making powers to the regions of Great Britain. As we show in Chapter 28,Northern Ireland made some use of its powers to adapt Great Britain policies to its own special needs, and in some cases adopted quite different policies.Even if in other parts of the United Kingdom the pressures to conform and the obstacles to regional variation were to be greater, some distinctive regional policies or styles of administration could be expected to emerge. These mightsometimes lead to conflict between the regions and the centre, or between individual regions. But this and other disadvantages, such as some loss of thebenefits of scale, would have to be accepted if devolution were to be regarded asan important objective in itself. Determination of the scope for devolutionrequires assumptions to be made about the limits of what might be regarded as acceptable.558. We have pointed to the many differences between Northern Ireland andthe regions of Great Britain which might affect the scope for devolution. Butthere are also significant differences between the regions themselves. Scotlandmost resembles Northern Ireland in its degree of physical detachment from otherparts of Great Britain, with which it has only a short land border in sparsely populated country. Difficulties arising out of the adoption of different policies and procedures would be less acute than would be the case if the border werelonger and ran through more heavily populated territory. Scotland has for longhad distinctive legal and administrative systems and legislation of its own inmany subjects. People on both sides of the border are accustomed to the factthat these differences exist. &quot;The Border&quot; itself is a familiar fact of geography;and for this reason, and in recognition of the existence of Scotland&apos;s nationalidentity, inconveniences arising from the adoption of different policies would bemore readily tolerated than if a new and artificial frontier were being created.559. Wales differs from Scotland in having a long land border with England,with heavily populated areas on both sides of the border at its northern and southern extremities. There is far more traffic and communication generallybetween England and Wales, and the economies of the two countries are more closely integrated. Wales has no distinctive legal system and very little legislation of its own, and the Welsh Office is a more recent creation, with a narrower range of functions, than the Scottish Office. The devolution of substantial powers to wales would therefore represent a greater constitutional change and would create greater problems in so far as it led to a divergence of policies on the two sides of the border. But the national identity of Wales and her cultural and
linguistic character put her in a position akin to that of Scotland, and althoughthe practical difficulties would be greater than in the case of Scotland the generalscope for devolution is much the same.560. Devolution of substantial powers to the regions of England would present even greater problems. At least some of the regions, however they weredefined, would have long artificial boundaries, many of them drawn throughareas of substantial population, and the scope for the adoption of genuinelyindependent policies which did not constitute a hindrance to movement acrossthe borders would inevitably be restricted.

CHAPTER 15THE PUBLIC FINANCE OF DEVOLUTIONintroduction561. In the last chapter we explained the nature of devolution. We nowconsider how devolution might be financed, assuming that the political andeconomic unity of the United Kingdom is to be preserved. In drafting this chapter we have omitted a good deal of detailed exposition and have avoidedtechnical language where possible. Some aspects of the subject are dealt within greater technical detail in other papers published with this report.562. In this discussion we are primarily concerned with the financialmechanism of devolution that is to say, how the funds allocated to a regionmight be determined, what powers the region could have in deciding how to spend them and where they would come from. We also take note of the centralgovernments responsibility for managing the economy, and consider whatpowers of expenditure and taxation it would need to retain in order to dischargethat responsibility2.563. For present purposes we assume that the same general order of financialfreedom might be required for the English regions as for Scotland and Wales.This approach is adopted not because we regard the English regions as beingnecessarily on all fours with Scotland and Wales, but because in this chapterwe are seeking to determine the maximum possible extent of financial devolution.It will be evident from what we say later that there are different possible degrees of financial freedom from which to choose, and that financial devolution maypresent fewer conflicts of policy and therefore work more smoothly if it isrestricted to a small number of regions only. Northern Ireland is not a mainconcern of this chapter, but as part of a single United Kingdom economy andfinancial system it must be taken into account3.564. It is helpful to anticipate some of our conclusions in order to make clear at the outset what the main problem is. The indications are that most regions of the United Kingdom pay less in taxes than they receive in public expenditure.In a system of substantial devolution based on the present levels and geographical distribution of taxation and expenditure it would be impracticable for allregions to be wholly self-financing. Most of them would necessarily be dependent1 Three papers directly relevant to this chapter are:Appendix C Regional Taxes.Research Paper 9     Revenue and Equalization in Australia, Canada, West Germanyand the USA.Research Paper 10    Financial and Economic Aspects of Regionalism and Separatism.Two other Research Papers which include material on federal finance are:Research Paper 1      Federalism and Decentralisation in the Federal Republic ofGermany.Research Paper 2      Federalism in the United States, Canada and Australia.Also of particular relevance to this chapter is the evidence of the Treasury, Inland Revenue,Customs and Excise and (as it then was) the Ministry of Transport (see Written EvidenceVol. 10, The Revenue Departments).2 The more general economic implications of financial devolution are discussed in ResearchPaper 10.3 The lessons to be learned from the history of Northern Ireland finance are discussed in chapter 29.
on grants from United Kingdom funds. If those grants were administeredentirely by the United Kingdom Government the essential independence ofthe regions would be at risk. On the other hand the United Kingdom Govern-ment could not simply give the regions whatever funds they asked for. some compromise scheme would be necessary which would bring about a fair distri-bution of United Kingdom funds throughout the country and yet leave the regions free to exercise their devolved powers without undue influence from thecentre.565. Such schemes are difficult to devise. Some people argue that the taskis impossible and that in matters of finance there is no satisfactory half-wayhouse between dependence and independence. In federal systems the mostserious disputes between federal and provincial governments are often aboutfinance. Whatever the constitution may say, the actual distribution of powertends to be dictated by the relative financial strengths of the different govern-ments. The allocations of revenue to the federal and provincial governmentsinevitably become outdated by changes in their respective functions, so that are-allocation is necessary. The negotiation of new financial arrangements is often the subject of long and sometimes bitter controversy, and while thearguments are going on the public continues to suffer from the defects of anoutdated system.566. We have rejected a federal system for the United Kingdom. We arethinking in terms of an arrangement in which the United Kingdom Governmentwould retain sovereignty in all matters. Unlike many federal provinces, theconstituent parts of the United Kingdom would not be straining to preserve anunrealistic measure of entrenched constitutional power. And on its side theUnited Kingdom Government, having by its own motion set up a system of regional devolution, would presumably wish to make that system work. Inthese circumstances the sharp dissensions and protracted bargaining associatedwith federal finance might be avoided; but the practical financial problems which arise from a division of functions between central and regional governments would still be there, and there can be no doubt that any substantial measure offinancial autonomy in the regions would entail a much greater degree ofpolitical controversy between regions, and between regions and the centre,than now exists. Some regional pressures are brought to bear on questions offinance under the present system, but everything is negotiated and decidedwithin the ambit of one central government. Financial autonomy in the regions would make the debate public, and the attitudes of the negotiating parties would inevitably harden. Such a development could introduce a spirit of contentionand divisiveness into British politics which would weaken the unity of thecountry. On the other hand people may feel that more open controversy is needed in the interests of democracy and to ensure that financial justice is being done to all regions. There is some force in both these points of view. In seeking to find a satisfactory system of finance to fit regional devolution it is necessaryto strike a balance between the two.567. Our task therefore is a delicate one. We have to assume a substantial measure of devolution and then discuss the problems of sustaining it with financial arrangements. On the one hand these financial arrangements mustnot imply more regional independence than is likely to be practicable. On theother hand they must not involve so little independence that the objects of
devolution are defeated. For the purpose of this discussion, and without at thisstage making any recommendations in favour of devolution, we assume theexistence of directly elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the eight regions of England. In certain defined fields, roughly represented perhaps by thepresent range of Scottish Office functions, these assemblies would have fullpolicy-making and executive powers, and would be responsible for alladministration. An arrangement of this order represents the maximum degreeof devolution which we contemplate, and is fully discussed later under the heading of legislative devolution. We do not in fact regard this degree of devolution as a practical possibility for the individual regions of England, butfor present purposes we assume that the devolved powers of the regions might include sufficient policy making for them to require the kind of financialarrangement that is appropriate for legislative devolution.568. We start by discussing some matters of general principle, and take note of the present geographical distribution of expenditure and taxation. Wethen consider what powers the regions might have to control their ownexpenditure, and their possible sources of revenue. Finally we discuss theconstruction of an overall scheme of finance to fit the substantial measure of devolution we have assumed.general principlesOur general approach to the problem of finance569. It might be argued that the present mechanisms of public expenditure and taxation are so complicated and delicate, and so closely tied up with the regulation of the economy and balance of payments problems, that it ispotentially dangerous to do anything which would reduce the scope for centralgovernment control. But starting from that position the search for a workablescheme of financial devolution would hardly be worth embarking upon. Thepossible changes would be minimal.570. We have tried instead to approach the problem of finance in a moreopen-minded way, not judging the possibilities by reference to how far theywould disturb the present system, but weighing their technical disadvantagesagainst an assumed will for devolution. We are supposing, in this financialfeasibility exercise, that there would be directly elected assemblies throughout great Britain, and that they would be exercising very substantial powers ofgovernment. That would be a big constitutional change, and one which couldbe brought about only if there were a strong climate in favour of it. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate to regard our existing financial system as sacrosanct, however good it may be for present purposes. While the great power of finance to influence the working of constitutional arrangements mustbe recognised, it should be the servant and not the master of any system of devolution. Finance is not an end in itself, but only one of several importantinstruments which may be used in order to achieve desired policy objectives.571. We have therefore examined the present financial system in a deliberatelycritical spirit, and have sought to explore all reasonable changes which mightassist devolution. We have benefited greatly from the help given to us by thegovernment departments responsible for these matters, and from the assistanceof other expert witnesses and advisers. Our general evidence, on the other hand,contained very little on finance, reflecting perhaps the difficulties of the subject.
The financial balance between Parliament and the regions572. There are no established rules which say that financial powers must be divided between the central and regional governments in a certain way in orderto make devolution work. Experience of federal systems in other countries, andof devolution in Northern Ireland, shows that where functions are divided between two main levels of government the financial arrangements to sustainthat division can take many different forms, and that, with varying degrees of efficiency, most of them can be made to work. Much depends on history andon the political and social background. There are no absolute principles. Whatis feasible and desirable has to be decided in the light of many different objectives,and the priorities given to those objectives may vary from country to country.573. In relation to devolution within the United Kingdom we have chosen to adopt the principle of political and economic unity, and we envisage that parliament would retain full sovereignty. We conclude from this that the mainpowers of taxation should continue to rest with Parliament, and that in relationto both taxation and expenditure Parliament should retain such control as isnecessary for effective management of the economy as a whole. This controlhas become more necessary than ever now that the United Kingdom has joined the European Economic Community and Parliament is committed to measures designed to bring about a European economic union.574. The political implication of these conclusions is clear. If a particularscheme of devolution gave so much financial weight to the regions that theywere in a position to challenge the authority of Parliament, the scheme would gotoo far along the road towards regional autonomy. The regional assemblies,particularly those controlled by parties not in power at Westminster, would be tempted to exert their financial powers to the full. In practice such a scheme could undermine the sovereignty of Parliament and lead to disunity.575. The economic implications of our conclusions about the maintenanceof Parliamentary authority are not so clear, and they have caused us some difficulty. This is largely because the degree of central control necessary for effective management of the economy is a matter of opinion; and opinion mayvary from year to year and from government to government. In their discussions with us the Treasury and the other revenue departments tended to emphasise the importance of public expenditure and taxation as economic tools with which to influence aggregate demand. But not everyone accepts that the centralgovernment can or should control demand in this way. Some disagree with iton principle because it increases the concentration of economic power at thecentre; others suggest merely that it is ineffective, because there are so many other important factors influencing demand which are outside governmentalcontrol that the effect of adjustments in expenditure and taxation can be onlyrelatively small and uncertain. Some consider that monetary policy is more effective.576. We have thought it right to consider financial devolution on the assump-tion that the present methods of control, including the emphasis placed on demand management, will continue. It is conceivable that the country&apos;s policyobjectives and the economic measures necessary to give effect to them willchange, and in those circumstances different answers about devolving expendi-ture and taxation might be arrived at. We have assumed, however, that the
government of the day will continue to pursue commonly accepted objectives which will require centralised economic control. These objectives are, in broadterms, a reasonable rate of economic growth consistent with a high level ofemployment, a healthy balance of payments position and the minimum ofenvironmental damage, and an equitable distribution of the fruits of thatgrowth between persons and regions. Our recommendations must be made to fit into this centralised system of economic control. As will emerge, thisconstraint does not restrict the possibilities for devolution nearly as much as might be supposed.Equality of services and taxation577. Public services, if devolved to regional governments, would inevitablyvary in quality from region to region. Some regions would choose to spendless on a particular service than other regions, or they might decide not toprovide the service at all. How far should such variations be allowed to go,given that the people of all regions would continue to be citizens of the UnitedKingdom directly represented in one sovereign Parliament? And if people were entitled to claim that, whatever region they lived in, the services providedfor them should be equivalent to those provided for people elsewhere, would it follow that they should all pay the same taxes ?578. In Chapter 29 we describe how the financial arrangements betweenGreat Britain and Northern Ireland up to 1971/72 were in practice based onthe principle of &quot;parity&quot;. This meant in effect that as long as the rates oftaxation in Northern Ireland were the same as those in Great Britain, theUnited Kingdom Government gave such financial help as was needed toensure that the services provided for the people of Northern Ireland were kept up to the level of the corresponding services in Great Britain. In its desire forequality of services the Northern Ireland Government voluntarily sacrificednot only its freedom of manoeuvre in matters of taxation but also its rightto adopt expenditure policies substantially different from those operating inGreat Britain. Such differences were made possible only by agreement withthe United Kingdom Government. It is clear therefore that the NorthernIreland financial system as operated in practice was not helpful to devolution.It discouraged departures from policies adopted in Great Britain, whereasone of the main objects of devolution is to increase the opportunities for freelocal choice. If a really effective measure of devolution was wanted for Scotland,Wales and the English regions it would not suffice to apply the parity principle,service by service, as it came to be operated in Northern Ireland. uniformity in standards of service between the various countries and regions would be inconsistent with the objects of devolution. Some different interpretation ofthe economic rights of common citizenship would be required.579. Accepting as we do that citizenship of the United Kingdom entailsa right to some kind of economic equality with other United Kingdom citizens,there seem to be two possible ways in which this might be reflected in the financing of public services devolved to regional governments. Either minimum standards in the devolved services could be stipulated by the United KingdomGovernment, anything provided above that level being a matter for regionaldiscretion; or each regional government could be allocated its &quot;fair share&quot; ofUnited Kingdom resources, so giving it an opportunity to provide standardscomparable to those obtaining in other regions. Our discussions have convinced
us that, at least for the more advanced types of devolution, involving the delegation of policy making, the stipulation of minimum standards by theUnited Kingdom Government would encourage central interference in regionalaffairs. The second method would give the regional governments much moreindependence, and in our judgement would not lead to unacceptable inequalitiesbetween regions. The pressure on a regional assembly from its own electorate,and the necessary process of calculating United Kingdom grants to the region,should ensure standards of service comparable to those in other regions. If,despite these influences, the devolved services deteriorated to too low a level,then as a last resort Parliament could intervene.580. Given that all people were entitled to equality in the devolved services in the sense that the funds made available for those services were distributedfairly between the regions, would it follow that they should all pay exactly the same taxes, regardless of the region in which they lived ? We do not thinkit necessary, as a matter of principle, that they should. Differing amounts arealready paid under the local rating system, and some regional inequalitiesmight well be tolerable if they were necessary for devolution. Substantialregional variations in tax rates within the United Kingdom would, however,clearly conflict with the need to control the distribution of income from thecentre, and must therefore be ruled out. Our views on taxation are set out more fully in paragraphs 617 to 628 and 657 to 666.Equality of economic conditions581. There is another aspect of equality, and that is the more general question of economic imbalance between different parts of the country. Evenif the individual can see that the services and taxation in his region are fair inrelation to those in other regions, he is still unlikely to feel a sense of equalityif his own region, in contrast to others, remains in the grip of industrial depressionand unemployment. Within the present unified system, controlled from thecentre, it is accepted that a region in that position is entitled to extra financial help in order to raise the standard of its economic life nearer to the general level. Special grants and tax incentives have been offered to industrialists who areprepared to develop their businesses in such regions, and development in themore prosperous regions has been deliberately restricted. These and other&quot;regional policies&quot; have been introduced to meet the needs of the less prosperousregions, which, as integral parts of the United Kingdom, expect parity with other regions in economic opportunities.582. Under a system of maximum devolution, how far would the regionscontinue to be entitled to parity in this sense ? And how far would it remain theresponsibility of the United Kingdom Government rather than the regional governments themselves to bring about such equality ? It seems to us a properconsequence of political and economic unity that the central government shouldbe the ultimate guarantor of a general comparability in economic conditions.It would be so regarded by the poorer regions. With devolved powers they could perhaps do more than at present to influence their own economic fortunes;but they would continue to need outside financial help, which would in effectcome from the more prosperous regions, and only the central government wouldbe in a position to order and supervise that redistribution of wealth. The precisedegree of comparability to be aimed at would necessarily be a matter of currentpolitics for which no rules can be suggested.
Conclusions on matters of general principle583. We have seen from this brief discussion of general principles that thereare certain constraints which appear to limit the scope for financial devolution.The constraints are political, not technical, because they flow from our principlethat the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom should be preserved. The first constraint is that Parliament must retain legal and effectivesovereignty in all matters; the second is that the government of the day must have such control over expenditure and taxation as is necessary to stabilise the economy and to foster its development; the third is that a reasonable degree of equality in public services must be maintained between regions; and the fourthis that the central government must be responsible for minimising regionaldisparities in general economic conditions.584. At first sight these four constraints might seem to rule out any substantial measure of regional devolution. They conjure up a picture of uniformity andsubordination to central policies which is the very opposite of what devolutionwould be designed to achieve. But this first impression is false. It will be evidentfrom what follows that, even if these constraints are accepted, there is a greatdeal of scope for regional differences in policies involving expenditure. We havealready suggested that equality in public services might be achieved not by theimposition of national minimum standards but by allocating to each regionsufficient resources in total to give it an equal opportunity to provide standardscomparable to those in other regions. If that concept of equality were to beaccepted the way would be open to very substantial regional variations to suitlocal choice and circumstances. And on the revenue side we shall be discussinga number of ways in which the regions might be given a considerable measureof independence without disrupting the economy. The constraint most difficultto reconcile with the spirit of devolution is perhaps the need to minimiseregional disparities in general economic conditions. In meeting this need thecentral government is bound to play the leading role, and the financial actionwhich a region could take independently to increase its own economic prosperity(perhaps its foremost objective) would necessarily be limited. But even herethere should be room for regional discretion.585. Viewed as a whole, the constraints which flow from the principle ofpolitical and economic unity still leave room for a wide range of financialpossibilities to match regional devolution.the geographical distribution of public expenditure and taxationGeographical comparisons of public expenditure586. To assess the possibilities for financial devolution it is necessary todetermine the expenditure incurred on public services in the respective regions of the United Kingdom under the present system. That will give a rough ideaof the financial benefits which individual regions might stand to gain or losefrom a different distribution following the introduction of a system of devolution-tion. It will also indicate the pattern of regional distribution with which anysuch system would necessarily have to start, since for both financial and political reasons the regional distribution of public expenditure in the first year of a new system could not be very different from that in the last year of the old system.587. The rates of national taxation are the same for all regions. But dopeople in different regions have the same amount of public money spent on
them ? The results of our enquiries on this subject are fully recorded in ResearchPaper 10, and the main findings are discussed in paragraphs 589 to 593 below.As explained in the Research Paper, the figures are subject to considerablequalification and must be used with caution. Their purpose is to establish onlya general order of magnitude.588. We have based our main comparison between the different countries and regions on the amount of expenditure per head of population. We appreciate that this comparison is not an automatic guide to the level of services provided.The same level of service may cost more per head in some regions than in othersbecause of special local conditions or variations in efficiency. A relatively high level of expenditure over a limited period of time may also reflect an attemptto make up a leeway in standards, and can still leave the services in questionrelatively poor in comparison with those of other regions. Perhaps these quali-fications are not quite so important when expenditure per head is looked at inrelation to large areas and over a fairly long period. In any event it seems likely that under a system of devolution expenditure per head would in practice, andin the absence of any better guide, be used as a general yardstick for comparing the levels of regional services.The present distribution of public expenditure in the four countries of the UnitedKingdom589. Table 15.1 shows the relative expenditure on public services per headof population in the four countries of the United Kingdom. It excludes generalservices such as defence, overseas aid and representation, and debt interest,and also, for statistical reasons, certain other services such as agricultural support, subsidies to nationalised transport and some capital expenditure of nationalised industries generally. What is left represents about two-thirds oftotal public expenditure. The statistical qualifications detailed in ResearchPaper 10 are important, but not such as to detract from the usefulness of the table as a general guide to relative expenditures and (less accurately) relativelevels of service. Unfortunately it has proved impracticable to get sufficientlyreliable information to allow a breakdown to be made of the expenditure inTable 15.1 for the individual regions of England.Table 15.public EXPENDITURE PER HEAD BY COUNTRY expressed as A PERCENTAGE OF EXPENDITURE IN ENGLANDYear	England	Wales	Scotland	7Y. Ireland1963-64	100	116	118	1031964-65	100	117	116	1021965-66	100	114	114	1081966-67	100	116	115	1081967-68	100	113	121	1091968-69	100	117	128	1141969-70	100	116	131	118Source: Research Paper 10, Table 22 (P.).
590. It will be seen from these figures that public expenditure per head inScotland has risen sharply in recent years, and in 1969/70 stood at 31 per cent,above the corresponding figure for England. If comparison could be made withsome individual regions of England the figure would undoubtedly be even higher. We cannot judge how far this apparently favourable treatment ofScotland is attributable to the existence of the Scottish Office and a Secretary ofState for Scotland in the Cabinet, but the figures do at least lend general support to those who argue that, in material terms, Scotland stands to gain most byretention of the present system.591. Table 15.1 shows that expenditure per head in Wales is also substantially higher than in England, though it has now fallen well behind the figure forScotland. Rather surprisingly, expenditure per head in Northern Ireland seemsto have been not much above the English level until recent years, and to havereached the Welsh level only in 1969/70; figures for later years might well showa further relative increase.The present distribution of expenditure on services potentially suitable fordevolution592. While the figures in Table 15.1 give a fair indication of the presentposition for public expenditure as a whole, they do not show what the likelyrelative per capita expenditure of regional governments would be under asystem of general devolution. This is because they include local government expenditure and expenditure on central services such as investment grants and social security payments which are unlikely to be suitable for devolution, andthey do not show a breakdown for the individual regions of England. Table 15.2is confined to those services which are, broadly speaking, the main candidates for regional devolution. It includes central government expenditure on generalgrants to local authorities (these grants would presumably be channelledthrough regional governments) and other central government expenditurespecifically related to housing, roads, hospitals, National Health ServiceExecutive Councils, police and university grants. In all it represents rather morethan a fifth of total public expenditure. And for Table 15.2 it has been possibleto produce tentative estimates for the individual English regions, although this proved to be a difficult and time-consuming task which it was practicable tocomplete for one year only. The year 1968/69 was the latest for which this could be done. The regions used are the economic planning regions.593. It will be seen from Table 15.2 that expenditure per head is higher inScotland and Wales than in England, and in each case by roughly the same amount as with the wider range of services in Table 15.1. Within England theNorth does better than all the other regions, but still not as well as Wales, andnot nearly as well as Scotland, its close neighbour. Looked at separately theEnglish pattern shows relatively little regional variation, but compared withScotland and Wales those English regions with the lowest expenditure particularly the East and West Midlands appear very substantially worse off.In effect, central government expenditure per head on those services which appear to be the main candidates for devolution is at present some 38 per cent,higher in Scotland than in the lowest spending English region. Though Table 15.2cannot be taken automatically as a fair reflection of the relative treatment at
present meted out by the central government to the respective parts of theUnited Kingdom (it is a partial picture of one year only), it gives some idea ofthe financial tensions which might arise between the separate countries and regions under a system of general devolution.Table 15.central GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE PER HEAD IN 1968/69ON SERVICES POTENTIALLY SUITABLE FOR DEVOLUTIONEXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF EXPENDITURE IN ENGLANDNorth     .........	114North West      ......	102Yorks and Humberside ...	102West Midlands......	94East Midlands   ......	94East Anglia      ......	99South West      ......	97South East       ......	100England.........	100Wales     .........	119Scotland.........	129Northern Ireland	_iSource: Derived from Research Paper 10, Table 8 (C).	Regional surpluses and deficits594. The estimates of expenditure so far discussed do not of course show theextent to which individual parts of the United Kingdom are net beneficiariesfrom expenditure on public services. To discover that it is necessary to comparethe value of the public services they receive from the centre with the amountthey produce in taxation. This is not normally done in relation to parts of theUnited Kingdom, because under the present unified system of government the calculation is unnecessary. The reasonable needs of a particular country orregion are met whatever tax revenue it produces. But in contemplating devolutionit is relevant to know in general terms the net financial position of each area.It is then possible to distinguish those parts of the United Kingdom whichmight conceivably be self-supporting from those which would need to rely ona redistribution of funds from the centre. There is no official information onthis subject2, but we believe that a geographical breakdown of revenue andexpenditure would show large surpluses of revenue over expenditure in theSouth East and West Midland regions of England, and deficits in NorthernIreland, Wales, Scotland and probably all the other English regions. Some ofthe deficits would be substantial areas with low tax revenues also tend torequire the highest public expenditure. Our impressions of which regions arenet users and which are net providers of United Kingdom funds are based on a range of expenditure and taxation wider than that which might be devolvedto regional governments, so that the pattern of surpluses and deficits which1 In Northern Ireland the distribution of functions between central and local governmentis different from that in Great Britain. For this reason it is not possible to obtain a precisefigure for comparison with the other areas in Table 15-2. The available indications suggestthat a comparable figure for Northern Ireland would be in the region of 130.2 See, however, Research Paper 10, Table 35.
we have described is not a precise financial forecast for a system of devolution.It does nevertheless reflect in a general way the distribution of income and needs among the various parts of the United Kingdom, showing which partsare likely to be in a strong financial position under devolution and which arenot.Conclusions on the distribution of public expenditure and taxation595. We must emphasise that the statistical basis for the conclusions reached in the last six paragraphs is far from complete. Much more detailed studies wouldbe a necessary preliminary to devolutionary reform. But it seems that a systemof financial devolution would necessarily start and probably continue with widedifferences in expenditure per head between Scotland and Wales on the onehand and the English regions on the other, and that under such a system mostparts of the United Kingdom, including much of England, would necessarily be dependent on United Kingdom funds if they were to maintain their presentstandards of service, the bulk of this financial support coming indirectly fromthe surpluses in taxation produced by the South East and West Midland regions of England. That, in essence, is the position now. But technical difficulties would inevitably arise in attempting to formalise what is now informal; and political difficulties could be expected to arise from revealing year by year what is nownot merely undisclosed but largely unrecorded.regional powers of expenditure596. We now turn more specifically to the financial mechanism of devolution.We discuss the powers which a regional government might have to control itsown expenditure, we consider its possible revenues and we suggest possibleschemes of regional finance. This division of the discussion into three parts is somewhat artificial, because in practice all aspects of the subject are inter-related, but it will help to make clear what we have to say.597. The primary purpose of financial devolution would be to enable regional governments to make their own decisions about expenditure. Unless theycould do that the complications of regional revenues would not be worth considering. We therefore now seek to establish what discretion regional governments might have in matters of expenditure, and whether that discretionwould be sufficient to sustain the degree of devolution which we have assumedfor the purpose of this discussion.The purposes of control over public expenditure598. The control over public expenditure now exercised by the centralgovernment is described in the evidence submitted to us by the Treasury.We have already referred to some aspects of it. For present purposes it is sufficient to recall that the allocation of funds to the various public services is now decided at national level against the background of the annual public expenditure Survey. The survey analyses all public expenditure for five years ahead, mainly by reference to service and economic category. The figuresrelate to the United Kingdom as a whole, and except for certain limited purposes are not broken down to show the position for each region. Linked with the survey is an economic projection which measures the demand on resources from both the public and private sectors against the flow of resources likelyto be available in the relevant period. In this context &quot;resources&quot; means not
money but real resources such as materials and manpower. Working on thebasis of national decisions, the Treasury maintains a close and continuingoversight of all public expenditure, including the expenditure of local authorities.The freedom which local authorities have in theory to plan their own expenditure is in practice circumscribed. They have little influence over decisions about thevolume of resources to be allocated to the services which they administer.For much of their capital expenditure they are required to obtain loan sanctionsfrom central government departments, and their financial planning is affectedby Ministerial directives and advice.599. Assuming that regional governments could be furnished with adequatefunds to finance certain devolved services, would the requirements of public expenditure control prevent their using those funds in the way they thoughtbest? To answer this question it is necessary to consider why it is that thecentral government maintains such close control of public expenditure. Itspurposes are many and varied; not least it must ensure that proposed expenditure will be covered by proposed taxation and borrowing. But there are four purposes which are particularly relevant to devolution.(a) The central government wishes to manage the overall level of demandfor real resources and their distribution between consumption, investment and export. This it can do because of the large proportion of resourcesused by the government itself, representing about one-quarter of gross domestic expenditure in 1971, and because it is able to influence privatedemand through transfer payments such as pensions and family allow-ances. It can affect the distribution of real resources both by the composition of its own purchases and by influencing private expendituredecisions through grants and subsidies.(b) It wishes to use its control over real resources and its powers of financingin such a way as to reduce the disparities in regional rates of economic growth and employment opportunities.(c) It wishes to ensure that services operated or financed by central govern-ment are provided throughout the country according to national policies and standards.(d) It wishes to see that all public funds ate properly managed and efficientlyspent.In practice it is not usually necessary to identify the particular purpose forwhich central control is being exercised. But in contemplating devolution it isimportant to distinguish these four different purposes and to establish whetherthey would still be appropriate under such a system.Demand management600. Under a system of regional devolution the central government would still need to manage the demand on real resources, so that purpose (a) would still be there.601. As we explain in paragraph 619, demand management involves the useof the tax system as well as control of expenditure. But since we envisage thatany devolution of financial powers could entail only limited regional controlover taxation, the implications for demand management would arise mainly
from devolving the power to make decisions about expenditure. For the purposesof demand management it has been customary to think in terms of three main categories of public expenditure:(i) expenditure entailing the direct use of real resources, such as current and capital expenditure on goods and services;(ii) transfer payments such as government subsidies and national insurance and assistance benefits, notably retirement pensions; and(iii) purchases of existing assets such as land and buildings.Expenditures within each category have a broadly similar effect on demand.Category (iii) accounts for a very small percentage of the total and has little,if any, immediate effect on demand. Category (ii) has a substantial effect on demand, but we assume that under a system of regional devolution the bulk ofall transfer payments would continue to be made by the central government.We can therefore regard this discussion as relating primarily to expenditure in category (i), which has the most powerful effect on demand.602. Demand management is concerned with total expenditure and itsaggregate effect on the demand for real resources. It is not directly concernedwith the individual objects of expenditure or the policy choices between them,and it would not in itself very much limit the freedom of a regional governmentto decide how to use the money available to it. It would require central controlover the total claim on real resources made by regional governments, but notover its precise allocation between regionally-operated services. Such an arrange-ment would necessarily constrain the power of regional governments to determinetheir own level of total expenditure.603. From the point of view of the central government, concerned withcontrolling the level of aggregate demand, freedom in the allocation of expendi-ture at regional level might raise one difficulty. Regional governments might alter the pattern of their purchases of goods and services in such a way as to favourindustry and labour in their own areas. This would alter not only the regionaldistribution of demand but possibly also the level of total demand for the country as a whole, depending on the extent of the changes in purchasing patterns andtheir consequential effects.604. Our general conclusion on central demand management is that althoughit would impose some constraints on regional governments it would still leave them very considerable scope for discretion in matters of expenditure. Subjectto central control over the total there would be little to prevent them fromallocating expenditure as they wished.Equalising regional growth and employment605. The second of the four relevant purposes of public expenditure control is to reduce the disparities in regional rates of economic growth and levels ofemployment. We have indicated that the devolution of expenditure decisions to regional governments might encourage them to influence the state of the regional economy through their purchasing policies. In addition they might seek to use their expenditure powers to subsidise particular industries throughcurrent or capital grants. But given their other obligations, the financial scopewhich they would have for operations designed to improve growth prospectsand employment opportunities within the region would probably be limited.
Such operations might nevertheless do economic damage to other regions. It islikely, therefore, that regionally-operated policies would be both inadequate and inappropriate. They could not by themselves succeed in equalising the regional economies. Central policy would continue to be necessary, and thecentral government would need to be in a position to supplement or counteract the effects of regional expenditure allocations.606. Under the present system this central function of equalisation between different areas is most obvious in the allocation of grants to industry, whichmay be higher in some areas than others, and in the choice of location forimportant individual projects such as a new power station or a large governmentoffice. Less publicised but no less important are the many decisions made inthe ordinary course of administration about the location of capital expenditureon roads, hospitals, schools and so on, all of which involve weighing the claims of one place against those of another. Under a system of general devolutionmuch of the expenditure involved for example, the main grants to industry would still be administered by the central government, so that regional spendingdecisions would not be directly affected. But expenditure in the devolved services would be a matter for the regions themselves, and in those serviceseach region would be competing for resources with other regions.607. In so far as a region&apos;s object in this competition was to secure themaximum possible total of resources for its own use, we envisage that the outcome would be settled as part of an operation in which aggregate demand would be agreed for the regions as a whole. The hope would be that some independent criteria could be devised which would guarantee each region itsfair share of resources without undue participation by the central government;we discuss later in this chapter how this might be achieved. In so far as a regionwas competing with other regions for particular resources which were regardedas serving the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole, any conflict betweenregions would need to be specially resolved from the centre. In general, althoughunder a system of devolution the central government would still need to controlexpenditure for the purpose of equalising regional growth and levels of employ-ment, this control would be exercised in relation to expenditure still in centralhands, and not to any great extent over regional expenditure.National policies and standards608. The third relevant purpose of public expenditure control is to ensurethat services operated or financed by central government are provided through-out the country according to national policies and standards.609. The implications of this are crucial for devolution, because it involves a central vetting of the individual objects of expenditure. If this kind of controlwere to be regarded as a necessary consequence of political and economic unity, there would be little point in regional devolution. Regional governments would have no real freedom to do what they wanted with the resources allocated to them. The implementation of national policies and standards is, however,a different kind of purpose from the three others we have identified. Theyare a reflection of the economic and financial facts of life within which our recommendations must be made to fit. But the necessity for national policies and standards is a matter of judgement and preference which begs the whole
question of devolution. The present discussion, which is about the financialequipment of regional governments, assumes that regional governments havealready been set up. To the extent that they have devolved to them the respon-sibility for determining policies and standards, the central government wouldnot be concerned to ensure that national policies and standards were applied,and would therefore not need to vet the individual objects of regional expendi-ture for that purpose. In this respect, therefore, there would be no hindranceto the exercise of regional discretion.Proper management and efficient spending610. The fourth and last relevant purpose of expenditure control by thecentral government is to see that all public funds are properly managed and efficiently spent. There are normal accountancy functions which would stillneed to be performed under a system of devolution, but these would be theresponsibility of the regions themselves. In relation to expenditure on the de-volved services they would have their own accounting and audit checks. Undera system of devolution to regional assemblies with policy-making powers itwould be inappropriate to make the regions formally accountable to thecentral government for the way in which they spent their money.611. The obtaining of value for money would require methods of appraisingprogrammes which ensured the minimum use of men and materials. Given a limitation on the funds available and many competing claims on them, it islikely that there would be ample pressure from the regional electorate for efficient methods of expenditure appraisal. There is no reason to suppose thatthis pressure would be less strong under a system of devolution than under thepresent system, or that it would be less effective. Whether the reduced scale of services under a system of regional devolution would raise unit costs, even withefficient operation, is a question we cannot attempt to answer. The little evidence available to us does not point in any particular direction. But at all events we donot think that the central government would need to supervise regional expendi-ture for reasons of management and efficiency.Conclusions on expenditure612. This brief analysis shows that there would really be only one seriouslimitation on regional discretion in matters of expenditure, and that would bethe need of the central government to influence aggregate demand. Because ofthis a regional government might have to trim its proposals to an agreed totalexpenditure. How rigidly it would have to stick to this total it is difficult to say.Actual public expenditure tends to vary from the original estimates by 1 to 1^ percent., so that some slight tolerance would probably be necessary for thattechnical reason alone. But, in any event, within the agreed total a regional governments room for manoeuvre would be considerable. Provided that its total expenditure remained the same it would normally be able to allocate theavailable funds between services and within services in whatever way it liked.So the reform which the advocates of regionalism want more than any other a worthwhile measure of discretion to allocate expenditure in accordance withregional rather than national priorities appears to be practicable in the sense that it would not be precluded by the requirements of demand management andthe other essential purposes of public expenditure control.
613. This wide measure of discretion in expenditure would be a very importantpower for regional governments to have. If its free exercise could be guaranteedit should be sufficient to sustain something approaching maximum devolution.We put it in this way because it might be argued that maximum devolution should give regions the power not merely to allocate an agreed total of expenditure butto decide entirely for themselves what that total should be; and for the reasonsalready explained that does not appear to be practicable. A region could plan itsown expenditure, resulting in a preferred total, but it would have to accept thepossibility that this preferred total would be cut down, either because it repre-sented a bigger share of United Kingdom resources than the region was fairlyentitled to use, or because, taken with the totals for other regions, it repre-sented a bigger claim on United Kingdom resources than the nation as a wholecould afford. And this limitation would still operate even if the region wereprepared to finance its excess expenditure out of additional regional taxation.614. Depending on the kind of devolution it was proposed to adopt, the regions could be given somewhat less than the maximum possible discretion in expenditure. Instead of the power to allocate an agreed total between the devolved services and within the devolved services they might have freedom of allocation only within each service. Another possibility would be to allocateexpenditure between services on a national basis, but to keep the total ofallocated expenditure slightly below the total permissible on economic grounds,leaving perhaps a 5 per cent, margin which the regions would have freedom to use as they wished. This could be a more important change than it seems,because in practice the choices open each year in the allocation of public expenditure are often marginal, the bulk of expenditure being already committed to existing services.regional sources of revenue615. We have established that regional governments could decide for them-selves how to allocate their own expenditure. We now consider how that expenditure might be financed.616. There are six possible sources of finance to be considered regionaltaxes, precepts on local authorities, charges for public services, national insurance contributions, grants from United Kingdom funds, and loans.We consider these sources in turn. We would emphasise that we are not hereattempting to reach conclusions on whether regional governments should or should not be equipped with this or that source of revenue. It would be wrong to do that without knowing precisely what devolutionary arrangement was intended. We are concerned only to identify the revenue possibilities. these would have to be looked at together, in the light of particular proposals for regional devolution and for regional expenditure, and a balanced schemeworked out. In turn, this scheme for the regions would have to be fitted intowhatever pattern of public finance and taxation was adopted for central andlocal government, and would have to leave the central government with sufficientpowers of taxation to preserve its ultimate supremacy and control over the economy.Regional taxes617. In considering possible sources of revenue for regional governments itis natural to think first of independent regional taxes. In our early discussions
we had in mind the possibility that the regions might be financed entirely fromthis source an arrangement giving them the greatest degree of independence.As our work progressed we realised that this would not be possible, first becausethe practical scope for independent regional taxation is too restricted in relationto the likely scale of regional expenditure, and secondly because the poorerregions, owing to their low tax yields and high expenditure requirements,would in any event require substantial grants from United Kingdom funds.Nevertheless it would be possible for independent taxes to play some part inthe financing of regional governments, and we considered it one of our tasksto identify those taxes potentially suitable for regional use.618. In reviewing the possibilities we have not ruled out new taxes, but wehave concentrated mainly on the scope for devolving to the regions thosetaxes already operated by the United Kingdom Government. Our enquirieshave been directed chiefly to administrative and technical feasibility. That isthe most detailed aspect of the subject, and it presents obstacles to devolutionwhich have often been regarded as insuperable. But it has to be kept in mindthroughout this discussion that judging the possibilities for regionalisingcentral taxes is not simply a question of looking at the workings of each tax and deciding whether it could be operated by a regional government. although a tax which passes that test may fairly be regarded as a potential revenueraiser for the regions, that is not the end of the matter. The purpose of centraltaxation is no longer simply to raise money in order to meet government expenditure. It is also required for the pursuit of the more general policyobjectives, economic and social, already summarised in paragraph 576. the pursuit of those objectives would be made very difficult if a large volume of central taxation were to be placed in the hands of regional governments not primarily concerned with achieving them.619. One important economic use of taxation is for the purpose of demand management, which we have already discussed in relation to expenditure.Ability to vary the rates and types of taxation is an important instrument for regulating demand. In most circumstances an increase in taxation cutsdown private spending power, and a reduction in taxation increases it. Andfor manipulating the economy in this way some taxes are more suitable than others. An especially valuable economic tool is income tax. It absorbs a greatdeal of money and for that reason alone its effect on private demand is impor-tant. In addition it is both buoyant and progressive. It goes up automaticallyas income goes up, thus acting as a built-in damper on demand as the economyexpands; and this automatic damping down of demand is accentuated becausethe rates of tax get progressively higher as the taxpayers income increases.The use of taxation for the purpose of demand management is further illustrated by petrol duty. Because the demand for petrol is continuous and inelastic, being very little affected by increases in the rate of duty per gallon, changes in therate of duty bite quickly, so achieving immediately the maximum possiblereduction of spending power.620. Income tax also illustrates one of the social uses of taxation, which isto redistribute income within the country as a whole. Taken in conjunctionwith the social services and cash benefits, the effect of income tax, with itsbuoyancy and progressiveness, and its special system of allowances, is to takeincome away from those who can afford it in order to benefit those who are
financially less well placed. Other taxes play a part in this also, and of course the redistribution of income is geographical well as as social, the poorer regionsbenefiting most. Similar social purposes are implicit in the governmentsdecisions about which taxes to levy. Whether taxes should be levied on incomerather than on sales, or on sales of particular goods rather than on sales generally,are questions which have differing implications for various sections of society;and the answers finally given to such questions tend to reflect not only technical and financial considerations but also the governments political views aboutthe way society should be run.621. For economic and social reasons such as these, it cannot be assumedautomatically that a tax which could be operated regionally should thereforebe devolved to regional governments. The first and natural concern of those governments would be to raise money for their own purposes, not to serve theeconomic and social purposes of the central government, which might well holdopposing political views. Regional governments might not be willing to co-operate in order to produce a pattern of regional taxation convenient for thepurposes of the central government; and in the absence of such co-operation the sovereign power of Parliament to manage the economy and to secure itslegitimate political objectives might be undermined. On the other hand, theeconomic and social purposes of taxation should not be exaggerated. They arenot a conclusive argument against the devolution of all taxes. In particular they should not be used against each tax in turn in order to rule it out for devolution. The proper time to take economic and social factors into account is when a specific scheme of devolution involving a particular pattern of revenue and expenditure has been worked out. At that stage it is a question of looking at whatever regional taxes may be proposed and deciding whether, given thearrangements proposed for other taxation and for controlling public expendi-ture, the central government could do without the proposed regional taxes and still have sufficient leverage over taxation and expenditure as a whole to manage the economy and achieve its legitimate political aims. If the total volume of taxation taken out of central hands were not too great, and the regions&apos; powers of varying it not too extensive, then the United KingdomGovernment might well be able to tolerate some overall loss of control, thence-forth allowing for the independent financial actions of the regions much as it now allows for the independent financial actions of large commercialenterprises.622. Leaving these general considerations on one side, we now turn to theindividual possibilities for regional taxation. There could hardly be a moredifficult time than the present in which to reach worthwhile conclusions. TheUnited Kingdom system of taxation is not in a settled state of administration,and it is difficult to judge how it might be regionalised. As in many other aspectsof our work, the ground has been continually shifting under our feet, and wehave to reach conclusions on taxation against a background of sweepingreforms which are only now beginning to be implemented. From April 1973income tax and surtax have been replaced by a single graduated income tax,and in connection with the proposed tax-credit scheme the whole PAYEsystem is under review. Also in April 1973 the basis of corporation tax waschanged, and purchase tax and selective employment tax were replaced byvalue added tax, completely new to this country. These changes, in some respects
still not fully worked out and in all respects still virtually untried, affect two-thirds of the revenue produced in United Kingdom taxation. In addition, thereis the prospect of tax harmonisation within the European Economic Community.So far this is confined to an agreement that the system of value added tax willbe adopted in all member countries, but further harmonisation proposalsextending to other taxes are more than likely; apart from personal incometax there is scarcely a tax of importance that has not come under discussionwith a view to harmonisation. Regional taxes are not precluded in theCommunity, and some already exist; but it is difficult to think of introducingindependent regional taxes for the first time when the European trend is towardsharmonisation and it is not clear how far this will in future limit the scope for regional variations.623. In this fluid situation we cannot make definite recommendations aboutregional taxation. We can merely note the possibilities. We include here only ageneral statement of our main conclusions. These are amplified in Appendix C.624. Table 15.3 shows the main United Kingdom taxes levied in 1971/72and their relative importance as revenue raisers.Table 15.3KINGDOM TAXES IN m6,4321,5541,4431,4301,125409483106-      998152318- 470454451348166156155We have tried to establish which of these taxes might be devolved to regional governments in the sense that the regions would fix their own rates of tax,within limits, and receive the whole proceeds. Concentrating on administrative and technical feasibility, mainly in the light of the present system but also withan eye to the future, our main conclusions are as follows:(a) It would be practicable to devolve vehicle excise duty, but the regions would not be able to vary the rate on commercial vehicles.1 Death duties consist almost entirely of estate duty.2 The capital gains of companies are assessed to corporation tax.RECEIPTS FROM THE MAIN UNITED1971/72Income taxCorporation taxHydrocarbon oil (petrol duty)Purchase taxTobacco dutyAlcohol duty: SpiritsBeerWineVehicle excise duty: Commercial vehiclesPrivate vehiclesSelective employment taxDeath duties1SurtaxStamp dutiesBetting and gaming dutiesCapital gains tax2Source: Government Departments.
(b) A reasonable scheme could be devised for devolving petrol duty. Thiswould probably involve central collection at a single national rate, as now, the proceeds being allocated to the regions, plus local collectionof a small variable supplement fixed at the discretion of regional governments.(c) A variable regional supplement to the United Kingdom income tax,centrally administered, using PA YE on employees&apos; income and directassessment to the regional tax of all other income, might be worthconsideration; but it would be administratively expensive and couldwell be made impracticable by any new tax-credit scheme. The existingincome tax machinery provides some administrative scope for specialregional taxes on certain kinds of income only.(d) Surtax in its centrally administered form could have been converted into a regional tax fairly easily, but its amalgamation with income taxhas ruled out that possibility.(e) Value added tax is structurally unsuited to regional devolution, but itmight facilitate the introduction of a general retail sales tax imposed ata low rate by regional governments and collected through the machineryof the national value added tax. No definite conclusion is possible until more practical experience has been gained of operating VAT by itself.(/) Capital gains tax and estate duty are weak candidates for devolution.It would be administratively practicable to devolve stamp duty on landtransactions, but the yield would be small and very heavily concentrated in south-east England. There are some minor possibilities for devolutionin the betting and gaming field, in those cases where duties are basedon premises, but here again the yields would be small.(g) Corporation tax is not suitable for regional devolution because thereis no satisfactory way of allocating to individual regions the profits of companies operating in more than one region. The duties on tobaccoand alcohol could not be devolved in their present form and no satis-factory alternative schemes have emerged from our enquiries. purchase tax has been abolished, but even if it had survived we would not have thought it suitable for devolution. The devolution of Selective employ-ment tax, also now abolished, would have been difficult but notadministratively impossible.(h) Whether or not particular taxes are noted in Appendix C as beingcapable of devolution (in the sense that the regions could control therate of tax) their proceeds could be allocated wholly or partly to regional governments, either in accordance with their estimated regional yields or,if that was too difficult or inappropriate, on some more arbitrary basis.The sharing of tax yields between central and regional governments is discussed further in paragraph 627.625. These conclusions, presented in general terms, inevitably understatethe practical difficulties of devolving central taxes to regional governments.With the possible exceptions of surtax (now abolished) and the minor bettingduties based on premises, there are no taxes which could be devolved easily.In all other cases the difficulties would be, at best, considerable; and in somecases the administrative costs would be very high indeed. We assume, however,
for the purpose of this discussion, that these difficulties and costs would be acceptable in the interests of devolution. In our view costs should be kept downwherever possible by the retention of central administration. The presentationalarguments for separate regional tax administrations would in most cases be insufficient to outweigh the very substantial practical advantages of a unifiedsystem of operation. Central administration need not undermine the authorityof the regions provided that they had clear control over the rate of tax.626. The administrative possibilities for regional taxation which we have outlined are affected by other important factors. There are, first, the economicand social factors which we have already briefly discussed. Secondly, there arepolitical factors, centred on the argument that in order effectively to maintain its sovereignty Parliament needs to retain the main powers of taxation. Incometax, for example, is by far the nation&apos;s biggest source of revenue, representingwell over a third of all central taxation. On this ground alone, applying theprinciple that the main powers of taxation should remain with Parliament, itmight be argued that income tax should not be devolved to regional governments,even partially. Thirdly, there are the requirements of membership of the european economic Community. Vehicle excise duty and petrol duty, at present theleading candidates for devolution, are both connected with the economics oftransport, a subject of close concern within the Community. They might beaffected by harmonisation proposals which would make it difficult to introduceregional variations in the rates of tax. All these factors would have to be weighedin the final balance.627. We have said that whether or not taxes are capable of full devolutiontheir proceeds could be allocated wholly or partly to regional governments.This process of earmarking or hypothecating national revenues for specificpurposes is contrary to established practice in the United Kingdom, but is a feature of some federal systems. The usual practice is for the regions to be given a fixed percentage share of one or more federal taxes. Tax sharing on theselines can be done in two ways. In one arrangement a percentage of a certaintax say 25 per cent, of income tax can be earmarked for the regions as awhole, and distributed to them on the basis of some formula which takes intoaccount their varying needs. This kind of tax sharing is similar to a general grant from the central government. Alternatively, each region may be entitled to25 per cent, of the income tax it actually produces. In this case the amount which a region gets is more directly related to the level of its own economic prosperity. The poor regions have relatively low yields, and any shortfall in therevenue necessary to meet accepted regional levels of expenditure has to bemade good from other sources. In either of these arrangements the rates of tax are fixed by the central government, and it has to be remembered thatthese rates can go down as well as up. The regions are not automatically assured of a given level of income, though they would expect to be able to make repre-sentations to the central government about what the rates of tax should be.628. With the exception of a retail sales tax we have not been attracted to anycompletely new taxes which might be suitable for general regional use. Butan approach which might be considered would be to allow the regions toimpose whatever taxes they liked (including perhaps new taxes such as a hoteltax which would not be suitable for all regions) up to an overall limit equivalent
to say 5 per cent, of their total expenditure. The reasoning here is that anyabuse of this power would be prevented by the operation of electoral and marketforces, and that regional taxation on this limited scale could do no great harm to the economy. Its effectiveness would depend on what other sources of revenuethe regions had.Precepts and charges629. It was envisaged in the report of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission thatprovincial councils would meet their expenditure by precepting on localauthorities. The provincial councils which the Commission had in mind wererooted in local government, and their expenditure was small. They were very different from elected regional governments of the kind we have been discussingin this chapter. For this more substantial type of regional institution, exercisingin the main powers devolved from the central government, we consider thatprecepting would be inappropriate. And on practical grounds there is much tobe said for avoiding, wherever possible, any further pressure on the local rates.630. On the other hand charges for regional services might well develop intoa useful contribution towards regional incomes. In the long search for new sources of local government revenue to supplement rates the idea of charging,or charging more, for the services which local authorities provide has been examined repeatedly. The generally accepted conclusion is that, although morerevenue might be raised from these services, a really worthwhile increase wouldrequire a fundamental change in public attitudes, particularly towards charges for education and housing. Such a change may be brought about by sheerfinancial necessity. Expenditure on some government services such as education has become so large in relation to total resources, and shows so little sign oflevelling off, that it may well soon be generally accepted that if these services are to be maintained and improved in the way that people seem to expect, thosedirectly benefiting from them will have to make some contribution towards thecost over and above that which they already make in general taxation.631. It has to be remembered that many of the services which are oftenspoken of as suitable for devolution to regional governments, such as education and housing and public health, are actually provided by local authorities; andit might well be argued that if further charges are possible they should accrue to local authorities. On the other hand, taking education again as the leadingexample, even if the actual running of schools continued to be the responsibilityof local authorities it would still be possible for regional governments, withoverall responsibility for education, to impose an education levy on the parents.In the early years of devolution charges such as these might constitute only a relatively small element in a wider pattern of regional income. Later on theycould become more important.National insurance contributions632. Apart from income tax the Governments biggest single source of income is the national insurance contribution. In 1972 contributions totalledover  3,000m. It has been argued that the so-called contribution is in essencea tax, and from a purely financial point of view it might be possible for the proceeds to be allocated wholly or partly to the regions on tax-sharing lines.
On the other hand we envisage that social security would remain a nationalservice, and to some extent contributions are determined by the size of thebenefits received, so that they are not precisely like a tax. There would be no particular logic in allocating national insurance proceeds to the regions, andto do so might tend to disturb the natural relationship between the providerof the service (the central government) and the customer (the individual).Grants from United Kingdom funds633. There are three possible types of grant which the United KingdomGovernment could make to the regions:(a) general revenue grants,(b) specific purpose grants, and(c) equalisation grants.General revenue grants would be distributed to all regions, probably on thebasis of a fixed amount per head of population, to finance the general activitiesof the regional governments. Special purpose grants would be made availableto all regions willing to undertake a specific activity which the United KingdomGovernment was prepared to subsidise. Equalisation grants would be paid onlyto those regions with relatively low incomes or relatively costly needs. elements of equalisation could be incorporated into either general revenue grants or special purpose grants. We consider the three types of grant in turn.634. General revenue grants would be paid to the regional governments outof United Kingdom tax revenues with no strings attached. The two main problems would be to determine the total amount of the grant and to agree on a formula for allocating it to the regions. We tackle these problems later. Ourenquiries suggest that general revenue grants would be necessary in any con-ceivable system of substantial devolution within the United Kingdom. Thepoint for discussion is how big a part they should play.635. Special purpose grants would be obtainable on condition that they werespent as directed by the central government. In federal systems it is commonpractice to require the receiving authority to match the central government subsidy with a contribution of its own. And for some services in this countryspecific grants to local authorities are paid as a fixed percentage of approvedexpenditure. Special purpose grants may be used to stimulate regions to under-take a particular programme of expenditure, and to compensate them for the resulting benefits which spill over into neighbouring regions. The building of a major road, or the development of a centre of specialist education open toall, may bring as much benefit to neighbouring regions as it does to the regionwhich incurs the expenditure. In the United States, where in the past almost allfederal aid has taken the form of special purpose grants, they tend to be unpopu-lar because they require the receiving state to supply a service to federal specifically -cations without permitting it to tailor the service to local circumstances. Inthe different political climate of Australia, where federal aid as a whole is verymuch larger and there is less emphasis on matching requirements, specialpurpose grants do not appear to be so much criticised and resented. We regard them as a possible source of revenue for regions within the United Kingdom,but one to be avoided where possible. They could be necessary, for example,
to stimulate regional expenditure in certain parts of the devolved services which were closely connected with services still in central hands, but inevitablythey would tend to undermine regional independence.636. Equalisation grants1 would be a political necessity in any system ofdevolutionary finance within the United Kingdom. In such a system the regions would be in a position to spend their money in different ways. But our tradition of equity would require that these differences in expenditure should not be forced upon the regions by financial necessity; they should simply be a reflectionof differing regional preferences. To achieve that fairly it would be necessaryto put each region in the position of having an income, per head of population,equivalent to the income of other regions; and also to give it financial compensa-tion for any adverse local conditions which made the regional services particu-larly costly to provide. To the extent that a particular region had a lower incomeper head than other regions, or more costly needs, it would have to receive agrant to make its position equal to that of other regions. Entitlement to thisequalisation grant would therefore reflect both the relative income positionof the regions and the relative costs of providing regional services, after stand-ardising for efficiency. The relative income position of each regional government,leaving aside grants, would depend primarily on the size of its tax base thatis to say the income or activities within the region from which it derived its taxrevenues; and the relative cost to it of providing regional services would depend upon the region&apos;s special needs.637. The object of equalising tax resources, as distinct from needs, wouldbe to compensate those regions which, while taxing their inhabitants to the same extent as other regions, received a lower revenue per head of population.This would arise where a region&apos;s tax base was relatively small in relation topopulation. It would be necessary to equalise those taxes which were fullydevolved to the regions, or which were shared by the regions with the UnitedKingdom Government in the sense that each region received only the yieldwhich it actually produced. In both these cases a regions&apos; tax revenue would belimited by its tax base. Equalisation of tax resources would not apply to theother type of shared tax, where a proportion of the national yield would be earmarked for the regions as a whole. That, as we have said, would be more inthe nature of a general revenue grant to the regions. A region&apos;s share would notbe affected by its having a relatively small tax base, so that the equalisationof its tax resources would not arise.638. Tax equalisation is a complicated matter, but provided that all regionsoperated the same taxes it would not present any special technical difficultiesin the United Kingdom. The main problem would be to decide how far thelevelling up of tax resources should go. Should the poorer regions be madeas rich as the rich regions, or be raised only up to the existing average ? Should a region which is prepared to help itself by imposing high rates of regionaltaxation get a proportionately bigger grant? Should a region which levieslow rates get a smaller grant? Or should all grants be calculated by referenceto a given rate of taxation, regardless of the rates actually levied? These arequestions which can be decided only when the nature and extent of devolutionand the accompanying financial framework have been determined. They are1 See Research Papers 9 and 10.
important, because in practice they could have a big effect on regional revenuesand indirectly on regional policies, but they are essentially questions for politicaldecision.639. Compared with the equalisation of tax resources, the equalisation ofneeds is much less capable of technical solution. It would be necessary todecide how much money each region would require, per head of population,to finance a given standard of service. That involves deciding, first, what thestandard is to be; and, secondly, what factors should be used to calculateregional differences in the cost of providing that standard. The determination of the standard involves political and social preferences, within the limits ofthe amount of money available. The factors relevant to differential costs are alittle more susceptible to factual analysis, but even here the decisions to be maderequire a good deal of subjective judgement. For example, in working out thecost of providing a given standard of welfare services for old people, it would be generally accepted that a region with a relatively large number of old people would require correspondingly more money per head of its total population toprovide that standard. But how far should such refinements go? Would it be right, for example, to give a region more money because a high proportion ofits old people lived alone ? In the equalisation of needs, problems such as these would abound and they would be difficult to deal with; but considerable experience of them has been built up in the field of local government finance and they should not be insuperable. The more intractable problem would bethat of fixing the standard itself. This has caused difficulty in federal countries,but appears to have been reasonably well overcome in Australia by the inde-pendent Commonwealth Grants Commission, largely because there has beena general preparedness to accept the personal judgement of its members.Loans640. The final source of revenue to be considered is borrowed money. Inpractice loans are raised mainly to finance capital expenditure. About two-thirds of local authority capital expenditure is financed in this way. Loans are also a useful device for meeting short-term deficiencies in general revenue. the borrowing of the Northern Ireland Government has been used almost entirely to finance its own lending to local authorities and other public corporationswithin the province. As explained in Chapter 29, its main source has been theUnited Kingdom National Loans Fund. Sums have been borrowed from thisfund within limits fixed from time to time by the United Kingdom Parliament,and on terms in line with those applying to local authorities in Great Britain.If desired a similar arrangement could no doubt be made to apply to regional governments in Great Britain. Central control of regional borrowing wouldbe necessary. Quite apart from the monetary effects, and the effect on thebalance of payments if loans were raised abroad, regional borrowing could result in a heavy demand on real resources, and the interest payable on moneysborrowed would increase the current expenditure of future years. The precisearrangements for regional borrowing would depend on what other financial arrangements were adopted. On the one hand a regional government whichwas intended to finance itself entirely out of its own independent revenueswould require substantial borrowing powers to meet its heavier capital expendi-ture, paying interest charges and making loan repayments out of its currentrevenues. On the other hand a regional government which was entitled to have
the whole of its budget financed from United Kingdom funds, subject to an agreed formula which would govern the total, might not need to borrow at all.The central government would borrow as necessary and pass on to the regionthe cash it was entitled to under the formula to cover both capital and current expenditure.Summary of revenue possibilities641. The revenue possibilities we have discussed should not be looked at in isolation. They can be properly considered only in relation to particular schemesof devolution and particular arrangements for expenditure; and in the finalassessment it would be necessary to ensure that the central government retainedsufficient control over revenue and expenditure as a whole to achieve itslegitimate economic and social purposes.642. The possibilities for devolving central taxes to the regions (in the sense that the regions would be able to determine their own rates of tax) are cloudedby current reforms of the taxation system and by the prospect of tax harmonisa-tion in the European Economic Community. On this aspect of revenue, therefore,only tentative conclusions can be reached. At present the possibilities fordevolving taxes appear limited. Only vehicle excise duty and petrol duty appearas reasonably straightforward candidates. The feasibility of some kind of regional income tax or retail sales tax depends on future developments. Itwould be relatively easy, however, as a matter of administration, for the proceeds of central taxes to be wholly or partly allocated to the regions, either in accordance with their regional yields or on some more arbitrary basis; andanother possible approach might be to allow regional governments to imposewhatever taxes they wished, up to an overall limit equivalent to a small percentage of their total expenditure.643. Regional precepts on local authorities would be inappropriate for asystem of maximum devolution, but charges for regional services might developinto a useful source of income. The allocation of national insurance contribu-tions to the regions on tax-sharing lines might be possible but would probablybe inappropriate.644. Whatever other revenues they had, regional governments would needgeneral revenue grants and equalisation grants. The problems of equalisingregional incomes and needs would be difficult but not insuperable. Specialpurpose grants might be necessary but should be avoided where possible.645. The extent of regional borrowing would depend on the other financial arrangements made. Regional borrowing powers would need to be controlledfrom the centre.possible schemes of regional finance646. Having considered the powers which a regional government might haveto control its own expenditure, and having identified its possible revenues, we now consider how these raw materials might be used to construct a scheme of regional finance.647. It is desirable first to have some idea of the total amount of money which regional governments would require. Research Paper 10 suggests thata pattern of maximum devolution applying to Scotland, Wales and the English
regions might require total expenditure on the devolved services of the orderof  6,000m., with a corresponding reduction in the expenditure of centralgovernment. On the basis of 1968/69 figures, and excluding transactions betweenthe central government and the regions, central government expenditure wouldbe reduced to about  9,880m., regional government expenditure would be about 5,770m. and local authority expenditure would remain at about  5,7901m.In these figures central government expenditure includes subsidies and grants to nationalised industries; grants to local authorities are included in regionalexpenditure. The figures include both current and capital expenditure. Thecapital expenditure of local authorities would be  1,730m., whereas the regional governments, with much the same total expenditure, would have a capital outlayof only  1,100m. Regional expenditure might therefore be rather less volatilethan local authority expenditure, since it is capital rather than current expenditure which produces big fluctuations. The total regional expenditure of  5,770m.includes  750m. for Scotland and  360m. for Wales, and, as already indicatedin paragraph 593, expenditure per capita in Scotland and Wales would be considerably higher than in England. All these figures rest on assumptions about devolution adopted at an early stage for working purposes only. Theywere designed to help us reach conclusions, not to reflect a measure of devolutionwhich we had already decided upon. They relate to a range of services ratherwider than that covered by Table 15.2. Nevertheless they are a useful generalguide to the amounts of money which would be required by the respectivelevels of government under a system of substantial devolution to the regions.648. The next step is to consider how the expenditure requirements of the regional governments would be met. In the most general terms there are two possible bases of regional finance; we have come to know them as the revenuebasis and the expenditure basis. On the revenue basis a regional governmentwould be given certain fixed sources of revenue, and would be obliged to finance the services devolved to it out of the income those sources produced.On the expenditure basis the region&apos;s expenditure requirements would be measured, and it would then be furnished with the income necessary to meetthose requirements. The system of finance prescribed for Northern Ireland in1920 v/;as the revenue basis, but the system which came to be used in practicewas the expenditure basis. Federal systems rely mainly on the revenue basis.The revenue basis649. If, as we have suggested, most regions are not now self-supporting,even when notionally credited with the yield which they produce from the whole range of present taxation, it might be thought that the revenue basis is hardlyworth consideration, because even if those regions were allocated all presenttaxes they still could not manage on their own. But it appears possible that someof these &quot;dependent&quot; regions might manage with all present taxes if theydid not have to contribute towards central services such as defence and overseas representation; and others might manage under a system of devolution which gave them financial responsibility for only a restricted range of services&apos;And even if all or most taxes were kept at the centre it might still be possible to allocate to particular regions, as their own sources of revenue, a predeterminedshare of central taxes greater than that which they themselves produce. The1 Research Paper 10, Table 25.
revenue basis, therefore, cannot be totally excluded from consideration, andon general grounds it seems to us the natural starting point for this part of thediscussion.650. The advantages of the revenue basis over the expenditure basis are thatit increases the flavour of regional independence and enables the centralgovernment to know with greater certainty what its financial commitments are.The regions, having been furnished with appropriate sources of revenue,would not be entitled as of right to come back for more. The central governmentwould know that its own revenues were available for other purposes. On theother hand the revenue basis might break down in practice because the sources of revenue allocated to a particular region turned out to be insufficient to meet its reasonable needs. The initial allocation of revenues might be decidedfollowing an estimate of needs, but in modern conditions such an estimatecould not remain valid for much longer than say two years. Furthermore, ashortage of income might arise from defects in a region&apos;s revenue structure.For example, the yield from the taxes allocated to it might be insufficientlybuoyant to keep pace with the decrease in the value of money. This has long been one of the complaints against the rating system. And of course under therevenue basis the central government might itself run into financial difficulty.As with the regional governments, there would be a danger that increased expenditure or insufficiently productive taxes would lead to a shortage ofrevenue. This was the experience of the federal government in West germany during the 1950s and 1960s.651. The main drawback, therefore, of the revenue basis, is its rigidity.In theory the allocation of revenues between central and regional governmentscan be changed, but this is likely to be a painful process. Federal experience shows that increases in regional responsibilities are often met not by the alloca-tion of new revenues but by special purpose grants from the central government.Such grants tend to undermine the independence of the regions without giving them the security of the expenditure basis. Another tendency is for the centralgovernment itself to take over services which have become too expensive forthe regions to run out of their own revenues. This inevitably cuts down regionalpower.The expenditure basis652. The expenditure basis would recognise from the start that completefinancial independence is not practicable for the regions. It assumes that the poorer regions at least would not wish to rely on fixed sources of revenue,which might well turn out to be insufficient. It assumes that the regions would ultimately insist on having sufficient funds transferred to them to meet theirreasonable needs. On the expenditure basis regional needs would be measuredat frequent intervals and the funds to pay for them would be guaranteed.Of course there would be a danger that this process would, in itself, reduceregional independence to something hardly worth having. Each region wouldhave to make out its case, justifying its claim to expenditure. And to see whetherits claims were reasonable its expenditure would inevitably be compared withthe expenditure of other regions. To ensure that the reasonableness of its expenditure could not be questioned it might try to match its services with thoseof other regions, thus robbing itself of local choice, one of the main objects
of devolution. This has happened in Northern Ireland and in the poorer statesof Australia. And if the central government played too big a part in the measure-ment of regional needs there might be a tendency for national policies and standards to be adopted in services which were supposed to be the responsibilityof the regions. All these dangers, however, rest on the assumption that therewould be a close, service by service comparison between the regions, whereaswe have suggested that the necessary degree of equality could be achieved bythe allocation to each region of its fair share of United Kingdom resources.To arrive at a region&apos;s total share some independent standard would be needed for each service, but once that share was determined it could be used as the region wished. There would be no compulsion to follow in practice the standardsadopted for the purpose of calculation.The choice of basis653. The revenue basis and the expenditure basis are not mutually exclusivein matters of detail. On the revenue basis the regions&apos; fixed sources of revenuecan be supplemented by grants from the centre, and on the expenditure basis the regions&apos; income may be derived partly from specific taxes or other pre-determined sources of revenue. But the distinction between the two bases isimportant the revenue basis implies that the regions would be looking first and foremost for maximum independence, whereas the expenditure basisassumes that their first priority would be financial equity. In consideringregional devolution within the United Kingdom, it has to be decided which ofthese two different approaches is the more appropriate.654. In our opinion the sensible course would be to reject the revenue basis and accept the expenditure basis. The revenue basis presupposes a degree of regional independence which we consider to be impracticable within a unitarystate. It has been adopted in federal systems for political reasons, to sustaina division of sovereignty, and even in those circumstances it has been made towork only with considerable difficulty and modification. It has been tried inNorthern Ireland, where it quickly broke down, and we consider that it wouldbe equally ineffective in the poorer countries and regions of Great Britain.We doubt whether they would feel justified in accepting the risks which thesystem entails. The tradition of equity and general comparability in standardsbetween different parts of the United Kingdom is too deep-rooted. The regions would want to be assured that they would have an additional claim on centralgovernment funds if the sources of revenue allocated to them turned out to be inadequate; and it seems likely that they would come to regard their revenuesas inadequate quite soon.655. On the expenditure basis the regions would have access to UnitedKingdom funds according to their needs. They would be financially secure.Our enquiries suggest that those people who welcome the idea of regionalindependence would nevertheless regard financial equity as ultimately moreimportant; indeed, for many of them the main purpose of regional independenceis to achieve greater financial equity. Our conclusion is that for financialdevolution within the United Kingdom the expenditure basis is really the only practicable solution.656. The chief remaining difficulty is to build into the expenditure basissome guarantee of regional independence. Three possible ways of doing this
are worth looking at. First, the regional governments might be endowed withindependent revenues; secondly, their expenditure needs might be calculatedby reference to a formula which would give them a guaranteed income over aperiod of years, without their having to go cap in hand each year to theTreasury; and, thirdly, the regions might be given the protection of an inde-pendent exchequer board which would in effect take over from centralgovernment departments the responsibility for fixing regional standards ofexpenditure and for allocating resources between the regions. We consider these three possibilities.Independent revenues for the regions657. In this context it would be unrealistic, initially at least, to rely on charges for regional services. In effect independent revenues could only mean devolvedtaxes which the regional governments could increase or decrease at will. Vehicleexcise duty and petrol duty are at present the only firm and worthwhile possi-bilities. These duties might bring in about a quarter of the amount required for current expenditure on devolved services in all the regions. Even with theaddition of say a 5 per cent, retail sales tax and a 4 per cent, charge on taxableearned incomes over  500, the regions could not meet all their current expendi-ture out of devolved taxation. In Scotland, for example, the total yield in those circumstances from all four taxes would be only about a third of currentexpenditure1. So the yield from regional taxes would not be large in relationto regional expenditure, even when capital expenditure is left entirely out of account.658. The yield from regional taxation would be inflated by equalisationgrants, and the grant formula could be so arranged that an increase in regionaltaxation would automatically lead to an increase in grant, thus in effect extendinga region&apos;s power to increase its own income. A scheme of this kind, alsoincorporating shared taxes, is discussed in Research Paper 102. But anypracticable scheme would still leave the regions very substantially dependenton grants coming from the centre, and in calculating those grants there wouldbe many factors to be taken into account besides the particular patterns oftaxation chosen by the regions. The only revenues over which the regions wouldhave real control would be the devolved taxes, and these alone Would nowherenear cover regional expenditure. The question for discussion, therefore, is whether the independence of regional governments would be increased if partof their income were to be derived from devolved taxes. And by independencewe mean freedom in expenditure.659. This question has been a bone of contention in local government fora very long time, and although we are not directly concerned with localgovernment finance an appreciation of this particular problem is instructivefor our purposes. Year by year local government expenditure has increased,and the yield from rates, the one local tax, has been insufficient to match theincrease. In order to balance the local government budget it has been necessaryto increase continually the proportion of expenditure met from central grants.1 Table 24 of Research Paper 10 estimates that the yield would have been  39-5 per headin 1967/68. Table 4 suggests that in 1968/69 current expenditure in Scotland under a systemof substantial devolution would have been about  116 per head.2 Research Paper 10, Part One, Section III.
These grants now finance about 60 per cent, of local authority expenditure,leaving only 40 per cent, covered by local rates. This degree of financial depen-dence on the centre is generally considered to be unhealthy, and ideas for increasing local revenues, either by reform of the rating system or by introducingnew local taxes, have been much discussed. On the other hand there is a strongbody of opinion, even in local government itself, which does not accept thatit is desirable to increase local revenues. On this view such an increase would bemerely a book-keeping change with, at most, only a psychological effect.It is contended that the expenditure decisions open to local authorities are inpractice marginal, depending largely on the final aggregate of grant moneysreceived from the central government; and that the freedom enjoyed by aparticular authority would be no greater if it received only 20 per cent, of itsincome from grants than if it received 80 per cent. It is the last block of moneyreceived from the centre that matters. Some who take this general line havesuggested that the sensible course would be to transfer the rating system to central government and to finance local government entirely by grants.660. Underlying the pressure for more independent local revenues thereare several trains of thought. There is the notion that the more local government can finance itself, the more control it will have over the way in which its money is spent. There is a feeling that additional independent revenues would givelocal authorities greater constitutional substance, and improve their jointbargaining position with the central government. It is also considered that local authorities should have greater financial and electoral responsibility for raising the money which they spend. And finally there is the technical point that,as the proportion of grant moneys increases, the inevitable anomalies of theequalisation formula are magnified and become less acceptable.661. On examination this body of reasoning does not stand up very well.In deciding how to spend their money, local authorities are inhibited mainly by the policy edicts and day-to-day controls of central government departments.Additional local revenues would not remove those controls, and would still leave local government crucially dependent on central grants. For similar reasons, the constitutional substance and bargaining power of local authorities could hardly be much increased by their having independent revenues whichcovered 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, of their expenditure, rather than 40 per cent.And it seems that their financial and electoral responsibility would be bestbrought home to them not by increasing their independent taxes but by keepingthem down, because with a smaller proportion of local taxes the same amountof marginal expenditure would require a relatively bigger increase in the rateof taxation. This would have a greater impact on the electorate, and wouldmake an authority think more carefully about increasing its expenditure. the anomalies of the present grant formula appear to be a more substantial reasonfor increasing local revenues, because in individual cases they may result inunreasonable shortages of revenue which cannot in practice be made up outof the rates. The Government^ Green Paper of July 19711 gives the impression,however, that the present grant formula could be improved to an extent whichwould make a grant of 60 per cent., or even more, acceptable; if that is so,this last reason for increasing local revenue would be weakened.1 The Future Shape of Local Government Finance (Cmnd. 4741).
662. Our impression is that local authorities as a whole accept that controlover their total expenditure is necessary for economic reasons, and that inin practice they co-operate by limiting their expenditure to the rate of increasestipulated by the central government. Some authorities, no doubt, are hard-pressed because their formula-based grant is unreasonably low, and to meetthe accepted level of expenditure they have to impose uncomfortably high local rates; but it seems to us that a much more general and long-term cause offinancial frustration among local authorities has been the extent of centralinfluence on their detailed expenditure plans, which springs largely from thecentral governments general political responsibility for local services; and ifit were possible to remove that influence, and to get their total income right,most authorities would not think it necessary for that income to include agreater proportion of independent local revenues. There seems to be no realconnexion between the degree of freedom in expenditure exercised by aindividual authority and the proportion of its income which is derived fromindependent local revenues. Though on average the proportion of local authorityincome derived from rates is 40 per cent., among individual authorities the range extends from 10 per cent, to 60 per cent., and there is no reason to believethat authorities near the top of the scale act in a more independent way thanthose lower down.663. How relevant is this for regional governments? Unlike local authoritiesthey would be executing their own policy, at least in a system of maximumdevolution. But their general financial position would be similar to that oflocal authorities. They would be dependent on United Kingdom funds atleast for the last big slice of their income. If they were to be financed on theexpenditure basis, as we have suggested, they would be guaranteed enoughmoney to meet their reasonable needs. In those circumstances the amount of income arising from independent regional taxes would have little financialsignificance. It would be just one element in the regional total, and that total would be finally determined by the amount of United Kingdom grant. Andwhether the proportion of income derived by a region from independent taxeswas relatively big or relatively small it is unlikely that the region&apos;s decisions about how to spend its money would be affected either way. If, despite what we have said in paragraph 613, the regions were given complete freedom todetermine their own total expenditure, it would then become important forthem to have independent taxes, and perhaps equalisation grants geared to therates of those taxes. This is because they would need some means of alteringtheir income at will in order to make it match their chosen level of expenditure,and for reasons of financial responsibility they would normally be expectedto do this by raising or lowering their own taxes. The present policy of demand management does not, however, seem compatible with complete regionalfreedom to fix total expenditure.664. Even if the regions could not fix their own total expenditure, and sodid not strictly need independent taxes for financial reasons, it might still be argued that an elected regional assembly would be constitutionally incompletewithout some independent powers of taxation. It would not have to go to the electorate for money, and might tend to blame its own shortcomings on the inadequacy of United Kingdom grants. Whether it would be made sufficientlyaccountable to the electorate by having vehicle excise duty and petrol duty,
faxes based almost entirely on the use of motor vehicles, seems doubtful; andfor reasons which we have given it is not clear whether the devolution ofmore broad-based taxes such as income tax and retail sales tax would be practicable. It seems likely that, in practice, a regional government would beregarded by its electorate as accountable for the way it ran the devolved servicesrather than for the way it operated any devolved taxes; and it would probablycomplain about the inadequacy of United Kingdom grants under any system.The general constitutional case for regional taxes might therefore be sufficientlyserved if the regions were to share certain major taxes with the central govern-ment, on the lines discussed in paragraph 627. Such shared taxes could make upa very substantial proportion of regional income. In themselves they wouldnot greatly increase regional independence, but the taxes in question would be,in part, the constitutional property of the regions, without argument ornegotiation; and this arrangement would provide some overt recognitionof the fact that the proceeds of United Kingdom taxation spring from the regions themselves, and are not the unfettered property of the centralgovernment.665. The position, therefore, on independent regional taxes, is that by themselves they would be nowhere near sufficient to cover regional expenditure,and as one element in a wider pattern of regional revenue they would probably not increase the freedom of a regional government to allocate its own expendi-ture. Budgetary autonomy within a given total would be possible without any independent revenues at all. But if the regions had complete freedom todetermine their own total expenditure, then they would need independent taxesto give them a corresponding flexibility in total revenue. Whether or not theydetermined their own total expenditure, they might be given independent taxesfor presentational reasons, but for this purpose shared taxes might do just as well.666. Whether in practice the regions would vary the rates of independenttaxes, if they had them, in order to adjust their own levels of expenditure, is open to some doubt. Experience elsewhere suggests that in regions dependenton equalisation grants the rates of regional taxation are strongly influenced by the equalisation formula, and tend not to vary much between the regions.And for both economic and political reasons, those regions most in need of extra income (the poorer ones) are those least able to raise it by imposingabove-standard taxation. On an expenditure basis, with all reasonable expendi-ture underwritten in any event, there would be little incentive for the regions toset their tax levels higher than those of other regions; and if the possible range of variation was limited by the central government as an aid to economicmanagement, the tendency might be for all regions to keep their taxes at themaximum permitted level. The case for independent regional taxes would therefore have to be weighed against the possibility that, in practice, the objectof regional variation would be defeated.A block grant formula667. The second possible way of fostering regional independence on theexpenditure basis would be to calculate the regions&apos; needs by reference to a block grant formula. The regions would then have a guaranteed total incomeover a period of years, without having to bargain each year, service by service,
for the amounts they wanted. They could plan ahead, and would not be exposed to central influence in annual negotiations. The formula would have to be reviewed from time to time.668. The idea of a block grant formula raises the question of measuringneeds, referred to in paragraph 639. At one extreme there is the detailedmeasurement of needs in individual services, together with specific payments to match those needs; at the other extreme there is the general measurement ofneeds by an arbitrary formula, and the satisfaction of those needs by a block grant. The first approach allows for maximum equity. The second gives mostindependence. The more refined the process of measurement becomes, the closer will be the investigation of expenditure plans. The danger with a block grant formula, on the other hand, is that it will break down in practice becauseits measurement of needs is too rough. The poorer regions particularly wouldfear this danger.669. In so far as the object of a block grant would be to give the regionstotal income which they could use as they wished, we consider that thegeneral idea is basically sound. Such a grant would help to foster both regionalindependence and regional responsibility. But in view of the practice whichhas been built up for the detailed measurement of needs, service by service,it is very doubtful whether an arbitrary formula, resulting in a fixed grant forsay five years, would be acceptable or indeed workable. It would be necessaryto construct a more flexible system which, whilst retaining the block grant idea,would include a fairly sensitive measurement of marginal needs, probablyevery year. One possible system is outlined in paragraph 682 onwards.A regional exchequer board670. The last of our three possibilities for fostering regional independenceis a regional exchequer board.671. As we have indicated, the measurement of needs involves a good dealof subjective judgement, and even on technical aspects there would be room for differences of opinion. If the arbiter were to be the central government,itself an interested party, there might be very little gain in independence for the regions. It would therefore be necessary, in our view, to introduce a third party,independent of both the regions and the central government, to take overthe measuring process. We consider that this role should be assumed by a regional exchequer board.672. We have suggested that the United Kingdom has moved so far towardsfinancial equity and economic integration that it is no longer possible to envisage that regional governments could be financed on a revenue basis,under which they would be given a certain job to do and fixed sources ofrevenue to do it with. The imposition of such a system, against all naturaltrends, would either lead to federalism by the back door or break downentirely. Instead, the regions would have to be financed on an expenditure basis.Their needs would be measured first and then met by whatever funds wereshown to be necessary. This arrangement would involve numerous complicated and interrelated ah hoc decisions which could have an important bearing onthe central governments responsibility for economic management and for thegeneral management of the country. It is inevitable, therefore, and proper,
that the United Kingdom Treasury should take part in the processes of regionalfinance. But in our view there would need to be some constitutional check onits power as the dominant interested party. A small and carefully selectedregional exchequer board, with its own specialist staff, should be set up with sufficient authority and expertise to act as a counterweight to the Treasury.It would fix the standards by which regional services would be measured, andwould decide how those standards should be costed from region to region.It would determine the basis on which United Kingdom grants to the regionsshould be calculated, and would be responsible for resolving any financialconflict between regions, or between the regions and the Treasury.673. The board would be set up by statute and its members would beappointed by the Crown. It would have power to summon witnesses and to order the production of documents. Its conclusions would be presented to thecentral government in the form of recommendations, but in the firm expectation that they would be accepted. The board would be in close informal touch withthe Treasury, as with the regional finance departments, and its recommenda-tions would so take account of national as well as regional considerations thatin practice they would not be open to serious challenge by the government.If, exceptionally, the government felt unable to accept the board&apos;s recom-mendations, it would be required to lay them before the House of commons and to present its alternative proposals for the approval of that House by affirmative resolution. In any event there would be laid before the House eachyear a report by the board describing its activities and explaining its decisions.Special reports might also be necessary from time to time.674. The board would be concerned with two main functions: the first wouldbe to decide the total amount of money and resources to be devoted to regionalservices and the second would be to decide how that amount should be distributed among the regions. The first decision must ultimately be one for thecentral government, and it is arguable that in this respect the governmentshould be allowed, if necessary, to depart from the board&apos;s recommendationswithout special reference to the House of Commons. The second decision could possibly be left to the board, subject to a statutory requirement to takethe views of the Treasury into account. These possible variations are left open for future debate. Final conclusions might depend on the number of regionsinvolved.675. There is a precedent for a body such as we have proposed in the NorthernIreland Joint Exchequer Board, discussed in Chapter 29. But in practice that body was essentially a meeting of two negotiating parties the Treasury andthe Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance. It had occasional meetings under its independent chairman, but for all practical purposes it was a constitutionalcover for the working agreements of the two civil servants, one from each ofthe two departments, who were its only other members. The regional exchequer board which we have in mind would not be a meeting of the Treasury and the regional finance departments. It would stand apart from, and above, all the interested parties. Any grant formula would be under continuous pressure,and there would be differences between the regional governments and theTreasury. The board would have a right of conciliation and adjudication.
Working informally we believe that it would provide an effective and generally acceptable means of avoiding a situation in which the strongest party theprovider of the funds inevitably had the last word. It would take the heat outof the argument and absorb much of the political strain inevitably associatedwith the financing of lower-tier governments.676. The constitutional price for this safeguarding of regional interests would be that important financial decisions, some of them subjective, wouldbe put into the hands of a non-elected body. Finance is the very stuff of politics,and it may seem to some that all important financial decisions should be takenby elected representatives. There would not in our view be any serious lossof democratic control in practice. The regional exchequer board would beset up by Act of Parliament. It would in large measure be accountable tothe House of Commons through the presentation of its annual and specialreports, and its decisions could be overturned by the House on the advice of the government. Most important of all it would be dependent for its success and indeed its life on the preparedness of the elected governments at the centre and in the regions to accept its decisions. The constraints under which it would work would be considerable. Against any loss of democratic control must beset the improvement in equity which the board would bring. Under an exchequer board system regional allocations would be determined independently in thelight of a general review. Without a board they would be largely the outcome of regional lobbying and Parliamentary wrangling, and these financial battleswould tend to be won by those best placed and best able to put their case.677. We make no suggestions for the composition of a regional exchequer board, except that it should be small, expert and independent, rather thanlarge, political and representative of the interests concerned. It should obviouslyinclude political expertise. That would be essential. But the member or memberssupplying that expertise would not be there as representatives of any particularpolitical interest. They would be there to contribute their general politicalexperience.678. A regional exchequer board system would permit the maximum applica-tion of technical expertise, and yet would frankly recognise that, at the margin,there would be matters of general financial judgement best decided away fromthe mainstream of politics. Subject to democratic checks of the kind we have mentioned, the United Kingdom Government would voluntarily submit tothe judgement of specially chosen men, in the expectation that they wouldperform their task with moderation and common sense. An indication of how the system might work in practice is given in paragraph 683.Outline of a possible scheme679. We have been concerned mainly to identify the possible components of asystem of regional finance. It would be difficult and probably unhelpful for usto trace all the different ways in which these components might be brought together to form an integrated scheme, but we think it is desirable to provideat least one illustration. This will give us an opportunity to approach, in a rather more down-to-earth way, the central problem of the grant formula.
680. We consider that any scheme intended to bring about the maximumregional independence which is practicable should contain the following basicelements:(a) United Kingdom standards of provision should be determined for allthe devolved services.(b) The degree of equality considered necessary between regions shouldbe achieved not by insisting on the application of United Kingdomstandards, but by allocating to each region sufficient funds in totalto finance such standards. The cost per head of population would vary from region to region, according to local conditions.(c) Subject to the constraints of economic management, each region couldspend its total allocation of funds as it wished. It would have the oppor-tunity to make above-standard provision in some services balanced by sub--standard provision in other services.id) The process of determining United Kingdom standards and measuringregional costs, and of allocating funds between the regions, should notbe in the unfettered control of the central government.681. Most of the difficulties would arise from the determination of standards.They would have to be related to the money available, and be such as to bringabout a distribution of funds which was politically acceptable. This wouldmean recognising, in the case of some regions, that expenditure had beenbelow standard in the past and ought to be increased. But the other regions,whose past share of expenditure had been correspondingly above standard,could not be expected to suffer a big reduction straight away. We have alreadydrawn attention to the very substantial differences in regional expenditureper head under the present system. That situation would be the starting pointof any new system, and it seems that in the cases of Scotland and Wales, and perhaps the Northern region of England, all with expenditure now muchabove average, difficulties could arise whatever their new allocation turned out to be. As poorer regions under the present system they would no doubt beappalled at the thought of a decrease in their relative expenditure, and wouldbe looking for an increase. Yet their relative expenditure per head is alreadyso high that the more prosperous regions might resent any further increase,even if it could be technically justified. In addition, even after the regionalallocations were settled there would be the problem of keeping them sensitiveto quickly changing needs in the period leading up to the next review of standards.682. The scheme which we now put forward as an illustration might go some way towards overcoming these difficulties. It assumes the existence of a regional exchequer board and an annual budgeting process based on standards and costs determined say every five years. The budgeting process would betimed to fit in with the central governments annual Public Expenditure Survey.Northern Ireland is already included in this survey, and in the GovernmentsGreen Paper of July 19711 it is suggested that the local authority rate support grant should be settled annually rather than biennially, and meshed in more TheTFuture Shape of Local Government Finance (Cmnd. 4741).
closely with the Public Expenditure Survey. With this change the whole ofpublic finance central, regional and local could be reviewed at the sametime each year.683. In outline, the procedure for regional finance would be as follows:(a) After examining the devolved services in all regions the exchequer board would determine, for each service, the standards which they considered to be appropriate for all United Kingdom citizens. It would thencalculate, for each region, the cost of providing those standards, allowing for differences in local conditions. The standards might be in quitegeneral terms, but they would be so devised that, if applied throughoutall regions, their total cost would be equal to the present total expenditureon the services in question. The end result of this first stage in theoperation would be a set of figures, one for each region, showing theamount of money needed per head of total population to finance UnitedKingdom standards in the devolved services. These figures would almost certainly reflect a regional distribution of expenditure per head different from that which now obtains.(b) The United Kingdom standards would not be for specific application,but would be used by the board as a financial yardstick against which to measure the regions&apos; proposals for actual expenditure. The generalobject, over the five-year period, would be to move each region to its proper standard of expenditure per head as quickly as current economicand financial circumstances allowed. One region might be moved up on down to its proper standard in say two years. Another might gothe whole five years and still not be quite on its proper standard. the pace of transition would be a matter for the exchequer board to decide,having due regard to the competing claims of the regions. The board would take into account the resources available for regional expendituregenerally, the distances of the regions from their standards, their existing financial commitments and current changes in their needs.(c) A region&apos;s annual allocation of expenditure would be in two parts. Thefirst part would be nearly but not quite equal to its actual expenditureof the previous year, as revised for normal increases in costs. Weenvisage that this first and main part of its allocation would be such anamount as would reasonably suffice by itself in conditions of stringency.It might be say 95 per cent, of the previous year&apos;s expenditure. It wouldbe an assured allocation, receivable every year, and would have theessential advantages of a block grant. The second part of the region&apos;annual allocation would be a matter for adjudication by the regionalexchequer board. The region would put its case for this further expenditure, taking its total allocation up to a limit equivalent to say105 per cent, of the previous year&apos;s expenditure.(d) The region&apos;s proposed budget for the year would, correspondingly, beprepared in two parts. The first part would show its proposed expendi-ture programme on the assumption that it would receive only 95 per cent,of the previous year&apos;s expenditure. The second part would consist ofa series of package proposals showing how the region would make useof further moneys if made available. The budget would also show the sources of revenue from which the proposed expenditure would be met.
These would depend on the pattern of revenue adopted for the regions.The regions could be financed entirely by United Kingdom grantsadministered by the exchequer board, or United Kingdom grants couldbe combined with shared or devolved taxes, as already discussed.Unless wholly financed from the centre the regions would probablyraise loans to meet capital expenditure, and in this case their borrowingproposals would be outlined as well. However the regions&apos; revenueswere comprised, it would be necessary to review their expenditureoverall, in order to determine the amount of United Kingdom grantneeded to make up the total.(e) The region&apos;s two-part budget would be submitted to the exchequer board, and copies would go to the Treasury. When all the regionalbudgets were available, the Treasury would make its representations tothe board, commenting on their aggregate demand effects in the lightof the resources likely to be available in the economy, and taking intoaccount the claims on resources of central and local government andthe private sector. The Treasury might or might not suggest a cut in regional expenditure to reduce the aggregate effect on demand. It wouldalso be free to comment on revenue aspects, including borrowing, andon the proposed distribution of resources between the regions. It might suggest that some regions should be helped more and others less, and itwould be interested in the possible effects of regional expenditure on services still in central hands.(/) Taking into account both national and regional considerations, andkeeping in mind the standard expenditure per head towards which eachregion should he working, the regional exchequer board would recom-mend to the government what the total expenditure of the regionsshould be and how it should be allocated between them. This would determine how much each region would get on top of its basic 95 percent. The result would be a series of regional allocations ranging between95 per cent, and 105 per cent, of the previous year&apos;s expenditure.(g) At the end of five years the exchequer board would review the UnitedKingdom standards and make a fresh computation of regional costs inthe light of the standards and conditions obtaining in the regions atthat time. In effect the regions themselves would make the standards,which would flow from what they had actually chosen to do with their money over the preceding five years.684. This is just one possible scheme. It is only an illustrative outline, and inevitably glosses over a number of difficulties. One difficulty would be thetreatment of exceptional capital expenditure, which might inflate a region&apos;total expenditure for one particular year, thus making it an inappropriatemeasure for the expenditure of the following year. For this reason it might benecessary to take an average of several previous years, or to deal with capitalexpenditure separately. Alternatively, since each of the regions would bedrawing up a coherent plan for the devolved services, including estimates for future years on Public Expenditure Survey lines, against the background of an assured basic income, they might reasonably be required to ensure that thedistribution of capital expenditure over the years was not so uneven as to wreck
the system. In any event the unevenness of capital expenditure would be takeninto account in determining the size of the flexible margin, which we put for thepurposes of illustration at 5 per cent.685. The process of inspecting regional services and determining theirstandards and costs, outlined in paragraph 683 (a) and (g) above, should not present insuperable problems or require large numbers of staff. The boardand its secretariat would be concerned with a range of well-established domesticservices such as education, housing and health, and would be able to call forinformation and advice from existing government departments and localauthorities. Its object in each service would not be to establish a fixed standardwhich would then be imposed for the next five years, but to determine areasonable figure of expenditure per head which would be added to thecorresponding figures for other services in order to arrive at a block allocationper head for the devolved services as a whole. A careful initial inspection of aparticular service in all regions would itself suggest what its essential basicstandards should be (number of pupils per teacher, hospital beds per 1,000population, and so on) and would show readily enough which regions wereabove standard and which below. In the light of this inspection it should not be too difficult to rearrange the existing geographical pattern of expenditure ona notional basis in order to show what a more equitable regional distribution would be. After the first year, reviews would be carried out only at five-yearly intervals, and would be largely a question of making adjustments to what hadbeen decided on the previous review.686. In paragraph 683 (d) the exact pattern of revenue to be adopted for the regions is left open. Grants would be necessary in any event. Our conclusions on the use of devolved and shares taxes are summarised in paragraphs 665 and666. We imply there that although devolved taxes may be considered desirable for political reasons, they would not be essential for financial reasons unlessthe regions were free to determine their own total expenditure. In those circumstances they would operate their own taxes in order to make their total income match their chosen level of expenditure; and the responsibilityof raising their own revenues would impose on them some financial disciplineto counterbalance their freedom to spend on a scale of their own choosing.Under the scheme outlined in paragraph 683, it is conceivable that the regions would, in practice, largely be choosing their own levels of expenditure. would this mean, therefore, that devolved taxes should be regarded as an essential element in their revenues ?687. The scheme recognises that the central government would need to beable to influence aggregate regional expenditure, partly to manage demand andpartly because the level of regional expenditure would affect the amount whichthe central government would have to find for the regions out of centraltaxation. The Treasury would seek to bring central influence to bear by making representations to the exchequer board; and it must be supposed that it wouldusually be looking for a decrease in the level of expenditure proposed by the regions. The Treasury&apos;s representations would be reflected, as appropriate,in the recommendations of the board, and it is possible that some regions atleast would have their budgets pruned. The total finally recommended for eachregion would be guaranteed in the sense that the regions would be free to spend
up to that amount and, in so far as the money required for that level ofexpenditure was not available from other sources, it would be supplied in theform of grants from United Kingdom funds.688. In these circumstances devolved taxes would be of little financial use to a region unless it was in some way able and was in practice willing to choosea level of expenditure significantly higher than that recommended by theexchequer board.689. One view is that the region would not be able to do this, because theboard&apos;s figure would already reflect the region&apos;s own views to the maximum possible extent consistent with the claims of the central government and other regions, and subject to a reasonable margin for error that figure should be adhered to. Even an increase in expenditure balanced by an increase in regionaltaxation could still increase demand to an unacceptable extent; and if theeffect on demand were too small to worry about, then it is likely that theadditional expenditure itself would be too small to warrant the trouble of extra regional taxation. In short, even without devolved taxes the scheme outlined in paragraph 683 would be capable of giving a region all that it could resonably expect. Grants alone, or snared taxes plus grants to make up the required total, would suffice. On this view the region&apos;s ability to plan and allocateits own expenditure would be amply safeguarded by the block grant system and the exchequer board; and the scrutiny of marginal expenditure by theboard, entailing the possibility of a region&apos;s budget being pegged down or evenreduced, would introduce a sufficient element of financial discipline without theneed for independent regional taxation. A system based on grants would suitthe logic of the expenditure basis; it would avoid the complications of devolvedtaxes, and possibly of regional borrowing also; and it would fit in well with themanagement of the United Kingdom as one economic unit.690. Another view is that the central governments need to influence the levelof regional expenditure should not be respected too meticulously, and shouldnot be allowed to deprive the regions of the additional flexibility which theycould get from devolved taxes, or shield them from the responsibility of raising their own revenue. On this view the scheme in paragraph 683 would need to be worked in a rather different spirit, and would take on some of the characteristics of the revenue basis (see paragraphs 649 to 651). The regions&apos;revenues would consist primarily of devolved and shared taxes, togetherwith grants, probably based on settled formulae fixed by the exchequer board,which would take into account, in the case of each region, the relative size ofits tax base and the relative level of its rates of taxation. The arrangements would have to be such that the regions would benefit directly from increasing their own taxes; there would be little point in such increases if they merelyresulted in a reduced grant. Similarly, reductions in regional taxation would not result in an increased grant. The regions&apos; expenditure plans would rest mainly on estimates of the yields from future taxation and from the formula-basedequalisation grants. The regions would be going to the exchequer board not so much as their chief paymaster as to secure economic approval of their plans for expenditure and borrowing; and, on the footing that a fair degreeof latitude could be allowed in total regional expenditure without disturbingthe central governments&apos; control of the economy, they would not expect to
have their plans very much tampered with. The board&apos;s most important pay-master function would be to recommend any special grants necessary to helpa region whose tax resources and formula-based grants were insufficient tomeet the level of expenditure necessary to provide United Kingdom standards in the devolved services. The expenditure basis would therefore be operatingas a general safety net rather than as a means of positively assessing the reason-able money requirements of all regions year by year.691. These two different views partly reflect the difficulty of establishingprecisely how far the central government would need to influence regionalexpenditure in some future system of devolution; but they are also a reflectionof the differences in philosophy which have emerged in our own discussions.Both views are tenable and the scheme in paragraph 683 does not stand orfall on the choice between them. It is reconcilable with either.692. Given the political will (a crucial factor) we think the scheme couldbe made to work. The proposed treatment of the 5 per cent, margin shouldpermit a flexibility which would not be possible with a straightforward block grant based on a fixed formula, and would allow a continuous redistribution of resources in accordance with current regional needs. It would also guard against waste, since marginal expenditure would be in question. At the same timeeach region would be sure of sufficient money every year to finance a modestbudget completely, and would be free to spend its money on the devolved services in whatever way it wished.Scotland and Wales693. Throughout this chapter we have assumed the existence of regional governments in England as well as in Scotland and Wales. If they were confined to Scotland and Wales, which comprise only 15 per cent, of the GreatBritain population, the practical difficulties of financing them would undoubtedly be very much reduced. In matters of expenditure the same local freedomcould be exercised, but the total cost of the devolved services would be much smaller, and the difficulties of demand management correspondingly fewer.There would be a greater possibility of the subordinate governments being able to determine their own aggregate expenditure. The central governmentwould still have, for manipulating the economy, a base of public expenditure and taxation not very much smaller, relatively, than at present. Furthermore,the administrative complications of devolved taxation would be reduced inscale, and the problems of equalisation would be eased. Within Great Britain there would be only three financial patterns to consider and only three sets of conditions to be taken into account in fixing standards and costs in the devolved services. The task of an exchequer board would be easier. Its decisions would affect much less money and many fewer people, and for that reason mightbe more readily accepted.conclusion694. Although it has been necessary to make one or two positive proposals in this chapter we are not here recommending financial devolution. We have tried to establish what financial arrangements would be possible if devolutionshould be considered practicable and desirable on other grounds. We have
sought to avoid the financial pitfalls of federalism, and have concentrated on what could he done within an integrated system of finance applying to thewhole of the United Kingdom. Our general conclusion is that it should bepossible for regional governments within Great Britain to have a greater degreeof financial independence than was exercised in practice by the NorthernIreland Government up to the time of its suspension in 1972, but that thisindependence would be in matters of expenditure rather than revenue. whether that would satisfy a full-scale Scottish or Welsh legislative assembly is a matterof speculation. If devolution in Great Britain were confined to Scotland andWales, the practical difficulties of financial devolution would be very much reduced and rather more financial independence from the centre might be practicable, but Scotland and Wales would almost certainly still be heavily dependent on United Kingdom grants.
SCOPE FOR DEVOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONSfactors affecting the scope for devolution695. In the last chapter we examined the scope for giving regional assembliespower to control revenue and expenditure in their areas. We now, in the lightof more general considerations, review all the principal functions of governmentwith a view to indicating those which must continue to be performed at thecentre and those which can be considered for devolution to the regions.   .696. There are difficulties in the way of discussing in vacuo the scope fordevolving any particular function of government. Devolution, as we have seen,may take many different forms. They fall, however, into two main categories,those in which Parliament devolves prescribed powers in the policy-making,legislative or executive fields to separately elected regional bodies, and thosein which Parliament and the central government themselves conduct their business either in the regions or on a regional basis. In this chapter we areconcerned mainly with the former, since this is where the main problems arise in determining scope for devolution.697. A second difficulty, already noted in Chapter 14, is that the scope for devolution may depend upon the particular region or regions being considered,while a proposal for devolution to selected regions gives rise to questions very different from those which would arise if devolution were being considered forall regions of the United Kingdom.698. Then there is the question of the criteria to be applied. Some mattersclearly offer no scope for devolution at all, since the need to maintain fullcentral control follows directly from the decision to retain political and economic unity. Obvious examples are the conduct of foreign and Commonwealth affairs and defence. But in most cases there is no ready answer to the question whethera particular function is or is not capable of being devolved. One purpose of devolution is to satisfy a demand for a greater measure of independence, andthis may be regarded as of such importance as to override any objections solong as the essential requirements of political and economic unity are met.But if rather less weight is attached to devolution for its own sake and theother purposes which it would be designed to serve are taken into account,it may be found that for some functions devolution, while theoretically possible,would be open to such great objection as to be ruled out as a practical proposition.699. Apart from satisfying a demand for greater independence, devolutionmay be regarded as serving three main purposes. It may facilitate the adoptionof policies and procedures best suited to the needs or wishes of the individualregions; it may provide a greater element of political accountability and greateropportunity for participation in government; and it may lighten the load at thecentre. The practical scope for devolution of any particular function of govern-ment is affected on the one hand by the contribution it could be expected to
make to these three objectives and on the other by any disadvantages, includingincreased costs and demands on resources, that might result from havingseparate administrations.700. As regards policies and procedures, the questions to be asked are whatwould be the scope for regional differences, to what extent differences wouldbe likely to occur in practice and whether any co-ordination of policies and procedures needed for the maintenance of political and economic unity could resonably be expected to be achieved under the particular form of devolutionbeing considered. In making this last assessment one has to take a view of theextent to which regional authorities, while naturally wishing to exercise theirdevolved powers in an independent way and to look primarily to their own interests, could be relied upon to consider also the interests of other regionsand the wider interests of the United Kingdom as a whole.701. The contribution to greater democratic accountability which devolutionmight make possible would depend on both the nature and volume of thework transferred. While some functions offer wide scope for the exercise ofpolitical judgement and oversight, others, of a more routine kind, do not.If a particular function is exercised on a substantial scale, measured in terms ofthe staff, premises and equipment employed, devolution would, even if ithad no other advantages, transfer to the region an important managementfunction. On the other hand, devolution which involved either the breaking up of a small, highly specialised unit, a research laboratory or technicalinspectorate for example, or elaborate arrangements for the sharing of services,would have obvious disadvantages.702. Similarly, while the devolution of some functions would result in asubstantial lightening of the load on central government, the devolution of others would make little impact, and in some cases might indeed be counter-productive in that it would place on departments a heavy new burden ofco-ordinating the work of the various regions.703. All these factors have to be taken into account in considering scope for devolution. At this stage we are not attempting to identify functions which ought to be devolved. Our views on the desirability of devolution whether itwould be better and more acceptable to the people to have certain things decidedat the regional rather than at the United Kingdom level and on the formsof devolution to be preferred are given later on. Our immediate object is themore limited one of making a realistic assessment of the practical scope for devolution, and for this purpose we have necessarily to state our conclusions in general terms. We consider in Parts VII and VIII the functions which mightbe devolved under particular schemes, but even there we are unable to reach any very precise conclusions, since firm decisions could be taken only aftermore detailed enquiry and consultation with the various interests concernedthan it would have been appropriate for us to undertake.review of departmental functionsGeneral704. In Appendix D we review the main functions of government whichmight be regarded as candidates for devolution. We have found it convenient to do so by reference to the government departments with responsibilities inEngland. In each case we describe the nature of the departmental functions,
the arrangements, if any, which have been made for them to be exercisedregionally and locally, the principles which have been followed in determiningthose arrangements, and the extent to which the Scottish Office, Welsh Officeand Northern Ireland departments have responsibilities in comparable fields.We then consider the principal factors which have to be taken into account in judging the scope for devolution of the functions in question.705. Our review is necessarily concerned with the existing functions ofgovernment. It has to be borne in mind, however, that the functions of govern-ment change. Some cease to be relevant and are abandoned. Those that remainmay in time come to be exercised in very different ways. Some quite newfunctions may appear. Since one of the objects of devolution would be to allowthings to be done in a distinctive regional way, some departures from theexisting functions could be expected.706. Our conclusions on the scope for devolution are briefly summarised in the paragraphs which follow. Reference to the Appendix is necessary foran understanding of what the functions involve and the grounds on which theconclusions have been reached.Environmental, education, health and social services707. This heading covers the functions which in England are the responsi-bility of the Department of the Environment, the Department of education and Science and the Department of Health and Social Security. To a largeextent comparable functions in Scotland and Wales are the responsibility ofthe Scottish Office and Welsh Office respectively; in Scotland many are thesubject of separate legislation.708. The Balfour commission recommended in 1954 that functionsshould be transferred to the Scottish Office if distinctive Scottish interests would thereby be better served and interests which Scotland had in common with the rest of the United Kingdom or Great Britain would not suffer. Thesecriteria appear in practice to have been applied, and the existing Scottish Officefunctions are obvious candidates for the more advanced forms of devolutionwe are now considering. This does not necessarily mean that full responsibilityfor such functions could be handed over to independent governments in scotland or Wales or the English regions. Under the existing arrangements there is little likelihood of policies and practices in the three countries falling out of line tosuch an extent that serious inconvenience or hardship could be caused, sinceall are under the control of the same Parliament and of the same government.With separate governments, however, these unifying elements would be lackingand very different and conflicting policies might be adopted.709. There would nevertheless be considerable scope in the environmental,education, health and social services for the devolution of functions of a kind which have been transferred to the Scottish and Welsh Offices. They are all,to a greater or lesser extent, capable of being administered in distinctive regionalstyles; and if policies diverged there would on all sides be a strong incentive,if only on grounds of self-interest, to ensure that differences were kept withinthe bounds of acceptability. It would, for example, be inconceivable that there Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs 1952-1954 (Chairman, The Earl of Balfour)Cmd. 9212).
should be national health services in some regions but not in others, and in theinterests of people everywhere the various regional services would have to be closely co-ordinated.710. Some functions in these fields have not been transferred to the Scottishor Welsh Offices and would offer smaller scope for devolution. The mostimportant of them are social security, the nationalised transport industries and civil scientific research and development policy.711. The social services providing cash benefits national insurance,industrial injuries, family allowances and supplementary benefits are admini-stered throughout Great Britain under common legislation by the Departmentof Health and Social Security. In social services of all kinds there would be pressure under devolved government to equalise standards at the level of thebest obtaining in any part of the country, and this would limit the scope for thej^idoption of distinctive regional policies. But there would still be room for considerable variation where standards were not directly comparable, as forexample in the local authority community services. In the case of the cashsocial services, however, there is a simple and unquestionable scale of measure-ment, and any differences in rates of contribution and benefit would be immediately apparent, particularly in view of the large-scale movement betweenregions, often involving the splitting of families. Although it is arguable thatthere could be regional variations to take account of differences in the costof living, people throughout the country have for so long been accustomed touniform rates of benefit and uniform contributions that it is most unlikely that under a system of devolution they would be content with anything else. This isborne out by experience in Northern Ireland, where legislation relating to social services providing cash benefits follows very closely that in Great Britain,ifHhe rates of contribution and the benefits being the same. While, therefore, the devolution of the main policy-making powers in this field would be possible,it would seem to serve little purpose.712. The transport industries for which the Department of the Environmenthas responsibility throughout Great Britain are the railways, road haulage andthe ports. In so small and congested a country it is obviously desirable thattransport services in the various regions should be closely co-ordinated andthat barriers to movement arising from the adoption of differing regional policies should be kept to a minimum. This points to the retention of somecentral control over services operating over long distances, such as the mainline railways and freight services. There might similarly have to be somerestriction on the devolution of responsibility for port development sinceabout 85 per cent, of the country&apos;s imports and exports pass through fifteenQ najor ports, each of which serves the country as a whole and not exclusivelyor mainly its own hinterland.713. Civil scientific research and development policy is another field in whichdevolution, though not impossible, would, almost certainly have to be restrictedin the interests of ensuring the most efficient use of limited resources.Internal and legal affairs714. Under this heading we include the functions of the Home Office andthe Lord Chancellors Department, both of which are concerned almost
exclusively with matters relating to England and Wales. The separateadministration of these functions by the Scottish Office derives from theexistence of the separate Scottish legal system. The matters for which,exceptionally, the Home Office administration covers Scotland are immigration,nationality and community relations, which because of their internationalimplications offer little scope for devolution, and a few smaller matters, such ascontrol of dangerous drugs, explosives and vivisection, which could be devolvedbut which can probably best be administered to general advantage on a UnitedKingdom basis.715. Many of the major functions of the Home Office those relating to thepolice, criminal law and administration, prisons, probation and after-care derive from the general responsibility of the Home Secretary for the maintenanceof law and order in England and Wales. The Secretary of State for scotland has a similar responsibility in Scotland. These functions would offer scope for devolution, but it must be recognised that if they were wholly devolved ministers of the central government could no longer be responsible for the maintenanceof law and order. There are obvious objections to the wide dispersal of power in this field.716. The responsibilities of the Home Office for some constitutional matters and for civil defence could not be devolved. The remaining functions of thedepartment, and the functions of the Lord Chancellors Department, would offer some scope for devolution, but generally the work of these departmentslends itself less readily to devolution than the work of those concerned withenvironmental and personal services.Agriculture, fisheries and food717. The responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodextend to Scotland in relation only to the operational control of epidemicdiseases of animals, the State Veterinary Service, the supply and price of food to the consumer, food defence planning and external relations. They extend to wales in all matters, though for most of them the Secretary of State for Walesshares responsibility with the Minister.718. Agriculture is an industry with special regional characteristics and manyaspects of the work of the departments notably in connection with estate management and land use, agricultural education and advisory services, andsome comparable functions in the fisheries field-would offer scope for devolution.719. There would, however, be strong grounds for retaining some central control over other matters, notably those that have not been transferred to theScottish Office. There would also be limitations on the scope for devolvingmeasures for the financial support of agriculture and fisheries, which constitute an important part of the work of the departments. The policies adopted are much influenced by international considerations, including questions of balanceof payments. Price support measures, and most other grants and subsidies to farmers and growers, are now subject to regulation by the European economic community, leaving little or no room for regional decision.
Trade, industry, employment and communications720. Under this heading we consider the functions of the Department ofTrade and Industry, the Department of Employment and the Ministry of posts and Telecommunications. The Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales have no executive responsibility for these functions. They are, however,closely concerned with the way in which the functions are exercised; althoughthe statutory responsibilities remain with other Ministers, the Secretaries ofState, by virtue of having seats in the Cabinet, are able profoundly toinfluencegovernment policies in industrial matters.721. The scope for devolution of trade and industry functions is limited bythe extent of international regulation, in particular by the obligations arisingfrom membership of the European Communities, and by the need to retain some financial and economic controls at the centre, a matter which we discussedr in our last chapter. It is limited also by practical considerations relating to theorganisation of industry and industrial services. Employers and trade unions are organised mainly on a Great Britain or United Kingdom basis ; not onlyindividual industries, but in many cases individual enterprises, have a widespread over the country, and with the growth of international companies theextent of this is likely to increase.722. The objective of the Department of Trade and Industry, as set out inthe White paper issued in 1970 at the time the department was created, is toassist both industry and commerce to improve their strength and competitiveness.Its functions, other than those relating to overseas trade and shipping, which on account of their international implications must obviously remain undercentral government direction, can be grouped under four headings the^   regulation of industry and commerce, general aids to industry, regional industrialb    policy and control over the nationalised industries.723. Any disparities in the law regulating industry and commerce in different parts of a single market area are inconvenient and damaging to efficiency.For this reason Northern Ireland for the most part chose not to exercise itstransferred powers in relation to industry. It agreed to the application to theprovince of United Kingdom legislation relating to such matters as price control; restrictive trade practices, monopolies and mergers, retail price maintenance and trade descriptions; while in other matters, such as companylaw and weights and measures, where it chose to legislate, the law is on linesvery similar to that passed at Westminster. Some Scottish law for example,that relating to companies, partnership, registration and bankruptcy differs from the law applying in England and Wales. The differences cause incon-IS venience, and there is recognition on both sides of the border that opportunity should be taken where possible to remove them. Thus we observe from theannual reports of the Law Commissions that a draft code of the law of contract,for application throughout the United Kingdom, has for some time been in preparation. There is indeed a tendency internationally to move towards theadoption of uniform codes in several commercial fields so as to facilitateinternational trade, and the policies of the Department of Trade and industry will in future be developed within a European framework. This group of thedepartments functions would therefore offer little scope for devolution.1 The Reorganisation of Central Government Cmnd. 4506.
724. The second group of functions consists of the various services provided to help industry advisory services, research, financial aid, export promotionand export credits. Since most industries are organised on a United Kingdombasis, with little concentration in particular areas, there are obvious advantages in applying centrally determined policies, though not necessarily using centralstaffs. To a large extent, officials are at present regionally or locally based tobring them nearer the customer, and there is little scope for more advancedforms of devolution.725. Regional industrial policy is part of the machinery by which, for economic and social reasons, attempts are made to correct regional imbalance.It is made up of positive and negative elements, the positive element being thegrant of financial inducements in various forms for the establishment of new industry and for the expansion of existing industry in certain areas, and the negative element the control by the issue of industrial development certificates of the right to develop in a particular area. Only the central government candecide where restrictions on development should be applied, where it shouldbe encouraged by financial assistance and what funds should be made availablefor that purpose. What is involved is a redistribution between regions of capital investment and jobs. The scope for devolution would therefore be restricted tothe way in which the money allocated to the regions was actually spent. Thisscope might be further restricted by the need to avoid wasteful competition between regions, by the interest which the central government would continueto have in the treatment of industries which were important to the UnitedKingdom as a whole, and by the need to ensure generally that the exercise of regional choice in this important field did not interfere too much with the centralgovernments management of the economy. Further restrictions would be imposed by European Community rules governing the kind of assistance whichindustry might be offered.726. The fourth group of functions of the Department of Trade and Industryrelates to its responsibility for the nationalised industries and public corpora-tions gas, electricity, coal, steel, atomic energy and civil aviation. this responsibility extends to Scotland and Wales, except that in Scotland theScottish Office is responsible for electricity. In view of Scotland&apos;s relativelydetached position and self-sufficiency in relation to the generation and use ofelectricity though there is some &quot;export&quot; to England devolution to a scottish government might be possible. But for electricity outside Scotland,and for the other nationalised industries over the whole of Great Britain,there would be little scope for devolution. The transfer to the regions of full powers in relation to the industries would involve the breaking up of theirexisting structures and would impose on the regions responsibility for verylarge capital expenditure. In our view organisation, development plans and capital investment would have to remain under central direction; but it mightbe possible for the regions to be given some limited powers in relation, forexample, to distribution and sale as distinct from production.727. Although the main responsibilities for civil aviation would have toremain at the centre, including regulations for the purpose of flight safety,air traffic control and the licensing of the majority of services, the regionsmight be given some powers in relation to services operating within their ownareas and the provision of local airports.
728. The functions of the Department of Employment-notably those relating to the employment services, training and safety and health would offer scope for devolution. But functions in connection with industrial relations,incomes policy, foreign and Commonwealth labour and race relations wouldhave to be retained mainly at the centre.729. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is concerned with postal and telecommunications services and broadcasting. The postal services can beregarded in the same light as other nationalised industries. Though devolutionwould not be wholly impossible, they are, to some extent, subject to international agreement, and in federal states are usually under central control. On the broadcasting side international regulation is of even greater importance. Thehistory of the dispute between the United Kingdom and Isle of Man Govern-ments, which we briefly recount in Chapter 32, gives an indication of theinternational and domestic problems which can arise out of a division of responsibilities for broadcasting between territories which form a single area for the purposes of international control. It would not be practicable for the regions to assume full responsibilities for broadcasting. At the very least central control of the allocation of frequencies would have to remain; but some powers for the protection of regional interests in broadcasting might be devolved.summary730. This brief survey of the principal functions of government, other thanthose relating to foreign affairs, defence and finance and taxation, has shownthat outside the trade and industry field there would be substantial scope for devolution. The scope would be greatest in the case of the environmental,education, health and other social services which in Scotland and Wales arethe responsibility of the Scottish and Welsh Offices. Some of the functions forwhich the responsibility of the Whitehall departments extends to Scotlandand Wales, notably those in relation to the social services providing cash benefits, the nationalised transport industries and civil scientific research anddevelopment policy, would offer smaller scope for devolution. In generalthe functions offering the greatest scope would be those in which the major part of the responsibility for executive action has been conferred on localauthorities.731. Some of the functions of the Home Office and, to a lesser extent,the Lord Chancellors Department might offer scope for devolution. Butexcept in Scotland, where there is a quite separate legal system and comparablefunctions rest with the Scottish Office or the Lord Advocate&apos;s Department,there would in most cases be good grounds for retaining powers at the centre.732. Agriculture, fisheries and food functions would offer possibilities,but the main policy decisions on price support measures and on other grants and subsidies would have to be taken centrally. Similarly, while there wouldbe some scope in the trade, industry and employment field, it would be severelylimited by the obligations imposed by international agreement, particularly those arising from membership of the European Communities, and by therequirements of economic management. Some aspects of broadcasting mightbe devolved.
PART vnTHE FORMS OF DEVOLUTION
LEGISLATIVE DEVOLUTION733. In this Part of our Report we consider, in a series of chapters, thevarious forms that devolution might take. Our concern in each case is toexamine the possibilities, to identify the problems which arise, to suggesthow they might be resolved, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of theparticular form of devolution and generally to provide all the informationneeded to allow conclusions to be drawn on its suitability for application tothe various regions. Our own conclusions are to be found in Part VIII.734. We start in this chapter with the most advanced form of devolutionwith which we shall be concerned, one in which powers would be transferredto the regions to determine policy on a selected range of subjects, to enactlegislation to give effect to that policy and to provide the administrative machi-nery for its execution, while reserving to Parliament the ultimate power to legislate for the regions on all matters. The Northern Ireland experience isparticularly relevant, since the Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided ameasure of devolution of this kind. To distinguish it from the forms of devolution-tion to be examined in later chapters we refer to it as legislative devolution.735. We examine first the problems that arise over the definition and extentof the powers transferred to the regions. We then go on to consider questions relating to the constitution and mode of operation of the regional institutions of government. Finally, we discuss the main implications of legislative devolution for the institutions of central government.736. Although we received proposals for legislative devolution to english regions, this form of devolution is more usually discussed in the context ofScotland and Wales. The problems which arise on its application only to one orother of those two countries, or to both of them, are in some respects different from those which arise on a general application to all parts of the United King-dom. We note these differences as we go along.the devolved functionsThe definition of devolved functions737. In the last chapter we examined all the main functions of governmentand indicated in general terms the possibilities for devolution. We now haveto give a little more precision to those findings by relating them to legislative devolution. Before we can do this, however, we need to consider more closelywhat this form of devolution would involve, and in particular what restrictions,if any, it would be appropriate to place on the exercise of the devolved powersand what overriding powers would have to be retained at the centre.738. There are two possible ways of defining the matters to be devolvedto regional assemblies with legislative powers\ The first is to list the mattersupon which the assemblies will be able to legislate, leaving the residue to Parlia-ment. The second is to list the matters on which only Parliament will be ableto legislate, leaving the assemblies with the residue. By the first method the regional assemblies would be precluded from legislating on any new or hithertounforeseen matter not included in the list; by the second they would be able
to legislate on any such matter by virtue of their residual powers. In both casesParliament retains the power to legislate on any matter. As we have seen,the second method was adopted in the Government of Ireland Act 1920.In federal constitutions, where the problem is not quite the same since the centiallegislature does not in general have concurrent power to legislate on mattersassigned to the provinces or states, there are examples of both methods. Theconstitution of Canada adopts the first, assigning specific matters to provinces and leaving the residue to the Parliament of Canada. In the constitutionsof Australia, the United States and Switzerland, on the other hand, the powersof the central legislatures are specified, and the residual powers are left to theconstituent units.739. Whatever method were chosen for the transfer of powers to regional assemblies, it is to be expected that there would be occasional doubts and dis-putes about the extent of the transfer. Absolute precision in definition has notbeen attained in any constitution involving a division of powers between twolevels of government. In the case of Northern Ireland there were procedures toensure that, as far as possible, legislation enacted by the Northern ireland parliament was within the limits of the powers transferred to it. Although therewere some indeterminate areas, by and large the division of powers was wellunderstood by the departments of the two governments, and any uncertaintieswere resolved in consultation between them. It was the practice when a bill was passed by the Northern Ireland Parliament and submitted to the Governorfor the grant of the Royal Assent for it to be accompanied by a certificatefrom the Northern Ireland Attorney General to the effect that the powersof that Parliament had not been exceeded. If any doubts remained at that stage the possibility of withholding Royal Assent had to be considered. Therewas provision in Section 51 of the 1920 Act enabling constitutional questions,including the question whether the provisions of a Bill were beyond the powersof the Northern Ireland Parliament, to be referred to the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council for decision.740. In addition the validity of an Act or other legislative instrument of theNorthern Ireland Parliament, or of any action of the executive, could be challenged in the courts, and there have been cases where this has been done.In a case in 1972 which attracted public attention the legality of certain action taken by members of the armed services in support of the civil power was suc-cessfully challenged. The action had been taken in accordance with powerspresumed to be conferred under legislation of the Northern Ireland Parliamentrelating to the preservation of law and order, which was a transferred matter.But since naval, military and air force matters were not transferred, the confer-ment of those powers was held by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal to beinvalid, although for many years they had been exercised on the assumptionthat their validity was not in question. This decision of the Court led to the enactment in the United Kingdom Parliament as a matter of urgency of amending legislation to declare that the Northern Ireland Parliament had thepowers which it had hitherto been assumed to possess.741. This was one of a series of measures amending the 1920 Act so as to clarify or extend the powers of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The amend-ments did not affect the constitutional position of Northern Ireland to any significant extent. Most of them were made to remove small inconveniences
that could not have been foreseen when the Act was passed. They were includedeither in United Kingdom statutes dealing specifically with Northern Irelandmatters, or in statutes on particular topics not primarily concerned with northern Ireland. An example of the latter was a provision in the Theft Act 1968enabling the Northern Ireland Parliament to deal with offences relating to thePost Office, even though postal services was a reserved matter.742. It is desirable that the method of transferring powers to a regionalassembly should be one which produces the greatest clarity and precision. Thelarger the area of uncertainty, the greater will be the impediment to smoothadministration, the need for amending legislation to remove the uncertaintiesand the risk of dispute between central and regional government. This last point is of some importance since regional governments in other parts of theUnited Kingdom might not always be as ready as was the Northern ireland government for almost the whole period of its existence to reach accom-modation with the United Kingdom Government on matters which might become the subject of dispute.743. Another factor affecting the choice of method of transfer is the likelihood-hood of the need for periodic adjustment for policy reasons. A regionalassembly interested in securing the widest degree of freedom consistent withthe maintenance of political and economic unity would be likely to favour anarrangement which gave it full legislative power subject only to prescribedexceptions. But new matters arising atomic energy and space exploration arerecent examples tend to be of a kind and on a scale which call for centralfinancing and control. Furthermore, the growing tendency for policies, evenin matters hitherto regarded as wholly domestic, to be determined by inter-national agreement, and some uncertainty about the pace and direction of thedevelopment of the European Communities, might suggest caution in the selection of matters to be transferred and a preference for the transfer ofprescribed matters only. Although the United Kingdom Parliament would in theory be in a position, in the light of developments in the international field or elsewhere, to take back powers already transferred, difficulty would arise ifthere had to be frequent resort to such action.744. For these reasons we think that the better method would be to list thefunctions to be transferred. In the case of Scotland one possibility would be to define the transferred functions as those now exercisable by the Secretary ofState for Scotland or by the Scottish Law Officers under any Act of parliament or under any law or custom, with additions or deletions as desired. There is something of a precedent for this. When the office of Secretary for Scotland was created in 1885, specific functions were at first transferred to the newMinister; but by an amending Act of 1887 he was given, with prescribedexceptions, all the functions of the then Secretaries of State so far as theyrelated to Scotland. There are, however, good reasons for not adopting thisapparently simple solution. The statute would not on its face indicate the natureof the transferred functions, and it would probably not produce the desireddegree of precision. Members of Parliament would want to know the full extent of the transfer of power they were being asked to approve, since even ifthere were agreement on the broad scope there might be a desire for detailedadjustment. Moreover, transferred functions could not conveniently be defined
in this way if they were to differ substantially from the functions of the Secretaryof State for Scotland at the time of transfer; and the method could not be usedto define functions to be transferred to regional assemblies in parts of theUnited Kingdom which did not already have their own Secretaries of State.745. In our view, therefore, the functions to be transferred would need to belisted with as much precision as possible. There could not be complete precision,and statutory provisions and procedures for the removal of doubt and for the determination of disputes similar to those included in the Government ofIreland Act 1920 would be required. Although there are difficulties of definitionin this form of devolution, we are satisfied that they could be overcome.The protection of human rights746. In any consideration of the range of matters on which power to legislatemight be conferred on regional assemblies, one factor to be taken into account is the nature of the restraints, if any, that would have to be placed on theexercise of that power. Broadly speaking, restraints may be needed either toprotect human rights or to ensure the maintenance of minimum standards inthe provision of the devolved services. We examine the requirements underthese two headings.747. In the case of Northern Ireland the 1920 Act as amended placed onlyone specific limitation on the exercise of the transferred powers in the field of human rights. The Northern Ireland Government and Parliament, in theirlegislative and executive actions, were debarred from practising any form of religious discrimination. Apart from this specific exception, their freedom in law in relation to the devolved functions was limited only by the need to conform to international agreement.748. When we took evidence in Northern Ireland, suggestions were put tous for amendment of the 1920 Act to ensure the preservation in the province of basic human rights of a kind which in some overseas countries are enshrinedin Bills of Rights, and we have considered whether such a provision should beincluded in statutes devolving legislative powers to institutions of governmentin other parts of the United Kingdom.749. In the proposals put to us in Northern Ireland the rights to be safe-guarded to all persons, whatever their race, colour, religion or political opinion,included freedom of speech, freedom of peaceful assembly, procession anddemonstration, freedom of the press and of publication, freedom of associationfor lawful purposes, liberty and security of the person, right to hold public offices without having to take oaths and political tests, right of employment without discrimination, entitlement to consideration for family housing without discrimination, impartially drawn electoral boundaries and fair elections,respect for privacy in family life, home and correspondence and the entitlement to vote and to be elected to central and local government at the age of eighteen.750. Most of these proposals derive from the Universal Declaration of human Rights and United Nations or European Conventions on the subject,where they are necessarily expressed in very general terms. In most cases therights are not absolute. They must be exercised in such a way as not to conflict
with the rights of other persons. The problems are to maintain a proper balance between freedom and order and to reconcile the freedom of the individual withthe obligations of the citizen. Thus every society finds it necessary to placerestrictions on the right of free speech. The nature and extent of the restrictionsvary according to prevailing views and the dangers to be protected against.The difficulties in the way of striking a balance have been well illustrated inrecent years in debates on legislation against incitement to racial hatred.Similarly, freedom of assembly, procession and demonstration cannot beabsolute since there may be circumstances in which these activities are likelyto give rise to public disorder even though this may be through no desire of the organisers or participants. Freedom of association for lawful purposes leavesopen the question of what is and what is not a lawful purpose. Liberty and security of the person must be limited by the need to provide for the arrest,trial and punishment of those who offend against the law.751. The translation of abstract ideals taken from international declarationsand conventions into domestic laws which are capable of being enforced thuspresents great difficulty. There are two possible courses. One is to give the law a specific content by setting out in detail both the nature and extent of the rights to be conferred and the conditions under which they may be enjoyed. The otheris to express both rights and conditions in more general terms. The formergives greater certainty and makes enforcement simpler. But since the balance between freedom and order is a delicate one, requiring to be redressed as circumstances change, there may be frequent need for adjustment and amend-ment of the law. A correct balance at any particular time is a matter of politicaljudgement and political judgement may be, or may be thought to be, taintedwith bias of precisely the kind that it is the purpose of a Bill of Rights to prevent.Moreover, new rights have to be prescribed from time to time to meet changingideas. Thus only recently has it been thought right to give votes at the age of eighteen. And universal franchise in local government elections, which was recently a lively political issue in Northern Ireland, was not considered appro-priate in Great Britain before 1948. If, therefore, the rights to be enjoyed by thepeople in a region with its own legislature were to be prescribed in detail in aWestminster statute, Parliament would have to continue to take a close interestin the region&apos;s day-to-day affairs in order to keep a watch on the working ofthe existing law and the need for any amendment. Amending legislation would generally cover the same ground as, or would overlap, regional legislation,and the division of responsibility between the centre and the region would beblurred and might well give rise to considerable confusion and inconvenience.752. Most of the difficulties would be avoided by adopting the alternative course of expressing both rights and conditions in general terms. It wassuggested to us in Northern Ireland that provision might be made permittingrestrictions on the exercise of the prescribed rights, but only such as were&quot;determined by law, necessary for the common good, reasonable in extent andcompatible with the nature and object of the rights involved&quot;. It would then beleft to the courts to give precision to the general terms. The courts would bebrought into play in this way if the validity of any piece of regional legislation was challenged as being in conflict with the Bill of Rights, or if an individualsought redress from the courts for the infringement of a particular right. Theresult would be to create, over a period of time, a body of case law defining
the nature and scope of each right. This process, which is a familiar one insome countries with a written constitution (notably the United States), is not inconsistent with our own system of judicial interpretation of statute law,and has advantages which should not be lightly dismissed. There is force in the argument that giving precision and substance to rights, defined only in general terms by the legislature, by the method of judicial decisions in actual cases ismore likely to produce an apt and workable body of law than any attempt atinitial comprehensive definition, and that in the course of time the law would assume a degree of certainty whereby the citizen might know tolerably wellwhat his rights were and how, if they were infringed, he could seek redress.753. But this approach to the problem is not without its own difficulties.The wide discretion it leaves to the judiciary means that it is the judiciaryrather than the legislature which is effectively making the law. It imposes uponthe judiciary a burden in a field of decision which is not strictly its own. Anduntil a body of case law has been established, the inferior courts are not in aposition to interpret with confidence the generally expressed statute. There aretwo disadvantages in this approach. The first is that the building up of precedentsis a protracted exercise and largely a matter of chance; the method does not provide for a swift, certain and inexpensive redress of grievances. The second is that the experience of other countries suggests that there might be a dangerof appointments to the judiciary and judicial decisions being brought into thefield of political controversy, with unfortunate consequences in a loss ofconfidence in the impartial administration of justice.754. In our view these objections should suffice to rule out the inclusion ofa Bill of Rights in any statute establishing a regional legislature. We are aware that in recent years Parliament has provided Bills of Rights in the constitutionsof some self-governing dominions. It is clear that, whatever may have been thevalue in the countries concerned of these provisions for the recognition and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, they do not offersolutions to the difficulties we have noted. Moreover, in one essential respecta region of the United Kingdom with its own legislature would differ fromthose independent Commonwealth countries. It would not be a sovereign state.Parliament would retain ultimate powers over the region in all matters, andthis would greatly lessen the need for including in its constitution provisions ofa kind designed to ensure the maintenance of standards which would be regardedas acceptable in the rest of the United Kingdom. In the ordinary course itcould be left to the regional legislature, within the scope of its devolved powers,to enact such provisions as were considered desirable for the protection of theindividual and for the investigation of complaints and the redress of grievances.In the last resort Parliament could intervene if necessary.755. An argument against qualifying the grant of subordinate legislative powers by the imposition of limitations designed to guarantee human rightsis that such qualification, if necessary in the regions, must be no less necessary at the centre. In other words, there must also be a need to curb the sovereignpower of the supreme legislature, as is done, for example, in the United States,by subjecting that power to some overriding judicial authority which will keepthe exercise of it within &quot;constitutional limits&quot;. We have not discussed thisquestion, partly because it does not arise specifically out of the devolutionary
proposals we have examined, and also because there is no evidence that thepublic conscience, as made effective through our existing democratic institutions,is not adequate to provide the protection called for.The maintenance of minimum standards756. Leaving aside the question of basic human rights, it is arguable that political and economic unity, involving a common citizenship of the UnitedKingdom, should carry with it a right to some kind of equality between oneregion and another in the provision of government services. Complete equalitywould never be possible. Even now there are substantial variations in the standards of services provided by the various local authorities, and the main object of devolution would be to permit local choice. But should there be aminimum standard of provision? In education, for example, should there bea uniform policy in such fundamental matters as the school-leaving age and teachers&apos; qualifications, leaving the subordinate authorities to determinepolicy and to administer the education service within a broad framework laiddown at the centre? Or should each region have full freedom to lay down itsown education policy, subject only to compliance with any obligations resultingfrom international agreement?757. On one view, the preservation of minimum standards in this way is unnecessary, and the equality of rights which should stem from commoncitizenship could be adequately secured by other means. In putting forwardour financial proposals in Chapter 15, we have suggested that it would sufficeif there were to be an arrangement which ensured the availability to eachregion of a fair share of total United Kingdom resources so that it had theopportunity to provide standards comparable to those obtaining elsewhereover the whole range of transferred services. There would in any event be serious difficulties in the way of devising a satisfactory scheme for the pre-scribing by Parliament of basic minimum standards. Experience with localauthority services shows that the minimum tends to be fixed so high that ineffect it becomes the maximum, and that the necessary policing of standardsby the central government encourages too much interference in local affairs.It would equally be possible for the discretion of a regional authority to beeroded in this way. The central government might seek to ensure the applica-tion of a United Kingdom policy in a devolved subject by representing it as aminimum standard. It might, for example, insist that comprehensive educationwas a minimum entitlement for children of all citizens of the United Kingdom,even though there was known to be overwhelming opposition to it in some parts of the country. The objection to minimum standards is that they could soeasily be used to whittle away the legislative discretion of the regional assemblies.758. On the other hand, certain risks would be involved in conferringunrestricted legislative power on the regions. The risks are of two kinds. Thefirst is that a particular region might use that power, with the support of amajority of the electorate, to give effect to policies so extreme as to be regardedas intolerable in other regions or by Parliament and the central government.While this may be an unlikely contingency it is by no means impossible. Inrelation to almost any field of government activity it is not difficult to imagine
policies whose adoption by one region would be regarded elsewhere as beinginconsistent with standards which ought to be maintained in all parts of a country which remained a political and economic entity.759. The case for providing safeguards against the adoption of extremepolicies would be strongest in any region in which one party was likely to be in apermanent majority in the elected assembly. The system of parliamentary government now in operation at Westminster depends on the opposition party having a real prospect of achieving power. But in some regions this mightnot be so. If voting were to follow the pattern in elections to the United kingdom parliament, Wales, and to a lesser extent Scotland, would be likely to havelarge Labour majorities, while some regions of England would be predominantly-nantly Labour and others predominantly Conservative. Later in this chapterwe put forward proposals for a system of proportional representation in regional assemblies. This alone, while it would not turn a minority into amajority, would be likely to result in a party representation substantiallydifferent from that secured by the system of voting used in parliamentary elections. But even without proportional representation we believe that partyrepresentation in the assemblies would not necessarily reflect party representa-tion of the region at Westminster. Nowhere would there be likely to be a domi-nant issue, such as the border question in Northern Ireland, which would cause people to vote in a certain way regardless of all other considerations,and party allegiances might be expected to change from time to time in the lightof the performance of the majority party in the assembly. Nevertheless, the strong possibility of prolonged one-party government in some regions remains.760. The second, and perhaps more serious, risk is that the various regions would adopt policies which, while not unreasonable in themselves, would,when taken together, be so incompatible as to undermine political and economic unity, or at least to have consequences that would be regarded as unacceptable.While it might be expected that, if only on grounds of self-interest, regions would wish to ensure that policy differences were kept within the bounds ofacceptability, this might not always be so.761. The question that has to be considered is whether the risk of the adop-tion of extreme or incompatible policies would be so great as to require safe-guards to be provided and, if so, what form those safeguards should take.In our view two essential safeguards would be the retention of the supreme authority of Parliament and the power to veto regional legislation.The supreme authority of Parliament762. All United Kingdom law applying to a region at the date of transferof powers under a scheme of legislative devolution would continue to applyuntil superseded by new or amending regional legislation. It is inherent in the concept of legislative devolution that Parliament would then, despite the transfer,retain in full its own power to legislate for the region on any matter. It is this power that distinguishes this form of devolution from a federal arrangement.In the case of Northern Ireland the matter was placed beyond doubt by theinclusion in the 1920 Act of Section 75, providing that, notwithstanding theestablishment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland or anything contained inthe Act, &quot;the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom
shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things&quot;in Northern Ireland. Section 6 of the Act provided that legislation of theNorthern Ireland Parliament should always be read subject to Westminsterlegislation applying to Northern Ireland and would be void so far as it wasrepugnant to it. The subordinate status of the Northern Ireland parliament was thus made quite clear. In practice, however, prior to the decision in 1972to suspend the Northern Ireland constitution, the United Kingdom Parliamentrefrained from legislating for the province on matters with which the NorthernIreland Parliament could deal, except at the request and with the agreementof the Government of Northern Ireland, recognising that any departure fromthis practice would undermine the authority of the Northern Ireland Govern-ment. In many instances Westminster legislated for Northern Ireland by agree-ment; in such cases the freedom of the Northern Ireland Parliament waspreserved by the inclusion of a provision enabling that Parliament to alter orrepeal the United Kingdom Act so far as it applied to Northern Ireland.763. In any other region to which legislative powers were devolved, it wouldbe possible to restrict the use of those powers by making more extensive useof Parliament&apos;s paramount power to legislate for the region. Since Parliamentarylegislation would always override regional legislation, this power could be usedto prevent abuses and the adoption by the various regions of policies whichwere incompatible. Parliament could if it wished go further and lay down a framework of law within which the regions would be obliged to operate.But this would involve a substantial departure from legislative devolutionas we conceive it. It would amount in effect to a sharing of responsibilityfor policy between the central and regional authorities, and be more nearlyakin to arrangements of the kind we describe in our next chapter under the heading of executive devolution.Royal assent to regional legislation764. In Northern Ireland another &quot;long-stop&quot; provision against abuse of the transferred powers existed in the need for Bills of the Northern ireland parliament to obtain Royal Assent before being enacted. Under Section 12 ofthe 1920 Act it was the Governor of Northern Ireland who gave or withheldAssent, and in doing so he was required to comply with any instructions givenby Your Majesty in respect to any Bill and, if so directed, to reserve a Billfor signification of Your Majesty&apos;s pleasure. The Bill would then not comeinto force unless and until, within one year of its presentation to the Governor,Assent was given to it. When a new Governor was appointed it was the practice to include in the royal instructions given to him a requirement that he shouldnot assent to a Bill if instructed by one of Your Majesty&apos;s Principal secretaries of State to reserve it.765. There is no record of Royal Assent ever having been refused to a Bill ofthe Northern Ireland Parliament. But in at least one instance the Governor was instructed to reserve a Bill, and Royal Assent was given to it only after UnitedKingdom Ministers had considered the desirability of advising its refusal.We believe that it would similarly be necessary for the United kingdom authorities to have a power to veto a Bill passed by any new regional assembly.However unlikely this may be, circumstances could arise in which a veto wouldhave to be considered, either to ensure compliance with international obligations,
or to safeguard some other essential British interest, or to prevent adoption of policies considered to be inconsistent with the maintenance of the essentialpolitical and economic unity of the United Kingdom. We regard this power of veto, like the retention of Parliaments paramount power to legislate, as anessential feature of a non-federal constitution.766. If, as we suggest, any new regional legislature were to consist of your majesty and an elected assembly, there would be a requirement for Bills passedby the assembly to obtain Royal Assent, and the power of veto could be exercised by withholding Assent. We have questioned, however, whether this would bean entirely appropriate means of exercising the power of veto and have con-sidered what possible alternatives there might be. The one that appears to usmost attractive would permit Parliament, on a government motion, to decide that a Bill passed by the regional assembly should be vetoed. The statuteconferring powers on the assembly might authorise a Secretary of State to direct that a Bill passed by the assembly should not be submitted for the royal assent for a period of, say, forty sitting days of Parliament. On the expiry ofthat period the Bill would be submitted for Assent unless during that periodParliament, by resolution of both Houses, had directed that it should be vetoed.(The procedure could be slightly modified if the constitution of the regionalassembly were to be such as to make Royal Assent to its Bills unnecessary.The statute might then provide that any Bill passed by the assembly would automatically become law after, say, seven days, unless during that time theSecretary of State issued an order suspending its enactment for forty days,during which time it could be vetoed by Parliament.)767. A procedure along these lines would have the advantage over the conventional procedure for Royal Assent that the intervention of the UnitedKingdom Government would be brought into the open. The Governmentwould have to state publicly its reasons for wishing to veto a Bill, and wouldhave to secure the approval of Parliament, where representatives of the regionconcerned would be able to put forward the regional point of view. There might also be some disadvantages. People in the region might fear, and perhaps with good reason, that the United Kingdom Government would be more ready toexercise the power of veto directly in the political arena than indirectly throughthe device of recommending refusal of the Royal Assent. Even if it seemed likely to make no difference in practice, they might prefer any intervention intheir affairs to be made through the Sovereign as part of their legislature thandirectly by the United Kingdom Government and Parliament. Constitutionallyit might look a little odd to interpose an outside authority between the twoconstituent parts of a legislature. Despite these considerations, however, wewould favour the adoption of a procedure which allowed Parliament to vetoregional Bills.Extent of devolved functions768. We envisage, therefore, that any scheme of legislative devolution wouldinvolve the transfer to the region of power to determine policy in prescribedsubjects and to enact legislation to give effect to it, and that, while there wouldbe some restrictions on the powers of the region in relation to finance (which we discuss later in this chapter) and it would be required to comply with international
agreements, there would otherwise be no restrictions on the use of the devolvedpowers. The sovereign powers of Parliament would be retained in full, butthere would be a convention that those powers would not ordinarily be used to legislate on a transferred matter without the consent of the region. The powers would, however, be available for use in exceptional circumstances to securethe enactment of legislation which the central government regarded as essentialto apply to the region but which the regional assembly was unable or unwilling to enact itself. United Kingdom Ministers would also have a power, exercisableperhaps only with the approval of Parliament, to veto regional legislationconsidered to be unacceptable. But this power, like that of securing Parliamentarylegislation without the agreement of the region, would in practice have to beregarded as a weapon of last resort. Frequent recourse to either of them wouldbe bound to undermine regional autonomy and the smooth working relation-ship between central and regional authorities which would be essential to good government.769. In examining the scope for legislative devolution it has therefore to beassumed that these reserve powers could not often be used to veto regional policies or to impose central government policies on an unwilling region. Inrelation to any particular matter considered for transfer one has to assess thepossibility of circumstances arising in which the powers might have to be used.It is not difficult, as we have already said, to imagine in almost any field ofgovernment activity regional policies either so extreme or so incompatible thatthey could not be tolerated by the central government. But if, on a realisticassessment, it is considered to be highly improbable that any region would wishto adopt such policies, or would persist in its resolution to adopt them in the face of strong objection from the central government, then the risk that this might happen is one that could properly be accepted, reliance being placed as a last resort on the use of the reserve powers.770. Any form of devolution which involves the sharing of powers between two levels of government will work only if there is a readiness on both sidesto co-operate in making it work. In the case of legislative devolution, this means that the central government must be prepared to allow maximum freedom tothe region in respect of the transferred matters, to accept that in a clash of views on which a compromise does not prove possible the regional view willgenerally have to prevail, and to use its reserve powers only when the issue at stake is such that it is left with no acceptable alternative. The regional authorities for their part must be prepared to co-operate with each other and with thecentral authorities in devising common policies and procedures when theseare needed, to have regard at all times to the wider United Kingdom interestsand to the views of central government and the other regions, to adjust their policies accordingly in all reasonable circumstances, and to accept that ultimatepower in all matters rests in practice as well as in law with Parliament.771. If it is not accepted that both central and regional authorities could be relied upon to strive to administer a scheme of legislative devolution in thisspirit of co-operation, legislative devolution is not to be contemplated. But ifit is accepted, there would in our view be considerable scope for devolution.The extent of the transferred matters could not, as we noted in Chapter 14,be as large as in the case of Northern Ireland under the 1920 Act. It wouldbe limited by the likelihood that the regions of Great Britain, particularly
Scotland and Wales, would be more ready to use the transferred powers in anindependent way (and less inhibited by the financial arrangements), by thegreater cross-border effects of distinctive policies adopted by regions geographi-cally less detached, and by the greater capacity of the larger regions to do harm to wider United Kingdom interests by the adoption of policies designed for purely regional purposes. Other limiting factors would be the growing tendency to international regulation of matters hitherto regarded as purely domestic and in this respect the United Kingdom&apos;s European obligations are par-ticularly relevant and the increasing complexity and cost of many governmentactivities, which as a consequence become more easily exercisable over widerareas; for these reasons federal countries, as we have seen, have found a needfor greater federal intervention in matters which by their constitutions areallocated to the states or provinces.772. In selecting subjects for transfer, much would depend on the particularregions being considered and on the total geographical extent of the proposeddevolution. Legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales would offer greaterpossibilities, as well as being a more likely prospect, than legislative devolution to the regions of England; and the existence of the separate system of Scottishlaw means that different considerations apply to Scotland and Wales respectively.773. It is not our purpose in this chapter to reach firm conclusions or tomake recommendations. But it would appear from the review of government functions in the last chapter and in Appendix D that the matters that could betransferred to a legislative assembly with the greatest advantage (in terms ofthe scope they offered for regional variations in policy) and with the leastpractical difficulty (in terms of potential inconvenience resulting from regionalvariations and of loss of economies of scale) would for the most part be found from among those which are outside the trade and industry and social securityfields and are now in Scotland the responsibility of the Scottish Office. Theprincipal candidates for devolution would be local government, town and country planning, housing, roads and some other environmental services, the health services, education, some aspects of agriculture, fisheries and food andsome of the miscellaneous subjects dealt with by the Home Office. The preservation-tion of law and order and the many associated services are other possibilities,though in these cases the arguments for the retention of central control arestronger.774. It would not be necessary under a scheme of legislative devolution fora regional assembly to be precluded from debating matters in which it did nothave devolved powers. The assembly would naturally have an interest in theoperation of central government policies in the region and in the implications for the region of proposed new policies, and would wish to debate them witha view to formulating a regional view to be presented to the central government.Finance775. In Chapter 15 we sought to establish, as a background to our wholediscussion of devolution, how far it would be practicable to devolve financialpowers to regions within the United Kingdom, and for most purposes of that discussion we assumed the existence of elected regional assemblies with legisla-tive and policy-making powers of the kind we are now considering. We concluded that it would be possible for regional assemblies within Great Britain to have a
greater degree of financial independence than was exercised in practice by theNorthern Ireland Parliament up to the time of its suspension, but that their independence would be in matters of expenditure rather than revenue. Iffinancial devolution in Great Britain were confined to Scotland and Wales,rather more independence might be practicable. In those circumstances thecentral government would still have, for manipulating the economy, a base ofpublic expenditure and taxation not very much smaller than at present, and itwould therefore have less need to influence the financial planning of the sub-ordinate governments than if devolution extended to all parts of Great Britain.Even so, Scotland and Wales would almost certainly still be heavily dependenton United Kingdom grants.776. We are now discussing the implications of legislative devolution ingeneral, and are not attempting to make financial proposals for particularschemes of devolution or for particular regions. The only question forconsideration here is whether the maximum scope for financial devolution whichwe established in Chapter 15 would be sufficient to support the constitutional status of elected regional assemblies with their own legislative and policy-making powers. We consider that it would. For reasons we have already giventhe totals of both their income and expenditure would ultimately be decided by others, but the amounts allocated to them would be fixed on the recom-mendation of an exchequer board genuinely independent of the UnitedKingdom Government, and they would be able to spend their money on the devolved services as they wished, without regard to what was being done inother regions. They might have some powers of independent taxation, or an agreed share in the proceeds of certain central taxes. Such revenues would still leave them substantially dependent on United Kingdom grants; indeed itwould be possible for them to be financed wholly by such grants. But to securethose grants they would not be required to go cap in hand to the Treasury.All their financial dealings would be with the exchequer board, which, whilehaving due regard to United Kingdom interests, would serve to insulate the regions from undue central influence.777. It seems to us that these arrangements would give a regional legislativeassembly sufficient financial power to support its policy-making function. its freedom to allocate expenditure would be particularly important, and in that respect we can see very little difficulty in the way of regional discretion. It ispossible that the idea of a legislative assembly which had to consult othersabout its budget and was not the complete master of its own financial destinywould not readily gain acceptance; but in modern conditions complete financial independence is fast becoming impossible to achieve, even for federal provinceswith some sovereign powers. Ever greater co-operation between provincialand federal governments has become necessary in order to meet the huge andquickly changing financial demands of present day life. The concept offederalism itself is changing its character. And with Europe developing towardseconomic and monetary union there is now the prospect of hitherto completelysovereign Parliaments submitting their financial plans to higher scrutiny. Inthese circumstances the idea that the right to make law should carry with itcomplete financial autonomy and a corresponding right to tax cannot be supported. Experience in Northern Ireland has shown that legislative powerscan be exercised without such financial independence; it was the formal pretence
of financial independence which attracted the main criticism. We see legislativeassemblies in Great Britain as being in a position to exercise greater financial independence in practice than did the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Inparticular, they would be in a position to develop their own separate policies and standards of expenditure in the devolved services. If, in return for that additional independence, there had to be a more open acceptance of the need to rely on United Kingdom funds (which, after all, are provided by the regionsthemselves) and of the necessity to co-operate with the United KingdomGovernment and with other regions in the economic and financial interests ofthe country as a whole, then those interested in devolution would probablyregard that as a small price to pay.the regional legislatureAn elected assembly778. We take it as axiomatic that a body wielding the substantial powers we arehere assuming, including the power to legislate and some control over finance,must be popularly elected. The main questions which arise concern the methodof election, the number of members, the period for which they are electedand the need or otherwise for a second chamber.Method of election779. Members of legislative assemblies in the regions would not necessarily have to be elected by the system that has become familar through its use for elections to the Parliament at Westminster. Of the many other possible systemsit has seemed to us that two the alternative vote and the single transferable vote should be considered as practical alternatives.780. Under the relative majority system, which is the term applied by political scientists to the Westminster system, each voter may cast only onevote and in each constituency the candidate securing the greatest number of votes is elected. The system has the great merit of being easy to understandand to operate. There are other advantages. In every part of the country thereis one person who is the sole representative in Parliament of his constituents;most of them know who he is and look to him to take an interest in theirconstituency and personal affairs. The system, by tending to exaggerate the representation in Parliament of the major parties in relation to their votingstrengths in the country, and that of the party forming the government inrelation to all other parties, helps to produce governments which havesubstantial majorities and are therefore in a strong position to ensure the implementation of their policies. But it is not without disadvantages. Chiefamong these is that it allows a member to be elected with the support of only a minority of voters. It tends to force political expression within the limitsfixed by the two major parties and, because of the danger of splitting the vote,to give great advantage to candidates sponsored by the local party machine,which in a safe constituency usually determines who is to be the local member.781. The alternative vote system eliminates the possibility of the election of a candidate on a minority vote. There is, as in the relative majority system,only one representative for each constituency, but each voter may cast more
than one vote, putting the candidates in the order of his choice. First preferencesare counted, and if one candidate has an absolute majority of the votes casthe is declared elected. If not, there is a second count, in which the candidatewith the lowest number of first preference votes is eliminated and his votesare distributed among the other candidates according to the names marked onthe ballot papers as second preferences. If still no candidate has received an absolute majority, another candidate is eliminated and his votes distributed. this procedure is continued until one candidate has obtained an absolute majority.782. Though slightly more complicated than the relative majority system,the alternative vote is easy to understand and to operate. In addition to elimi-nating the return of candidates on a minority vote, it helps small parties and independent candidates by dispelling any feeling that votes given to them maybe wasted. It does not, however, produce representation proportional to partystrength, and it is less likely than the relative majority system to give any single party an absolute majority of seats.783. The single transferable vote system is one, and in our view the most satisfactory, of many which aim to give the parties representation in proportion to the numbers of votes they receive. Each constituency elects not one but three or more members. As in the alternative vote, electors put the candidatesin the order of their preferences. To be elected a candidate must attain a quota of votes. In a three-member constituency the quota is one more than a quarterof the votes cast; in a four-member constituency it is one more than one-fifth of the votes cast, and so on. The method of counting the votes is a little compli-cated, but the essentials are as follows. If when the first preferences are countedany candidate has his quota, he is declared elected. Votes in excess of the quotaare transferred to the other candidates in proportion to the second preferencesshown on his ballot papers. This process is continued in a series of countsuntil all the seats are filled. If, on any particular count, no candidate attainsthe quota figure, the candidate with the least number of votes is eliminatedand all his votes are distributed among the others.784. The principal advantages generally claimed for the single transferable vote are that the parties secure representation on the basis of their true strengthsin the country, small parties are assured of a hearing, independent candidateshave a chance of election and there are few &quot;wasted votes&quot; going to defeatedcandidates. The system gives the elector a greater variety of choice, includingchoice between members of the same party. The main disadvantage is that thereis less likelihood than under the relative majority system of any one partysecuring an absolute majority of seats. Other disadvantages arise from havinglarge multi-member constituencies. Inevitably there is less close contact between members and constituents; it costs more for the small party or independentcandidate to fight an election; and the electoral process is more complexto operate and less easy for the voter to understand. There is a difficulty toowith bye-elections since the system cannot then be applied; this can probablybest be overcome by the use in such elections of the alternative vote system.785. The relative advantages of these three systems can, we think, be sum-marised briefly as follows. In terms of simplicity and ease of operation, therelative majority system is the best, the alternative vote is not far behind,while the single transferable vote system is rather less satisfactory. In terms of
enabling voters&apos; preferences to be translated into representation in the assembly the relative majority system is the worst, the alternative vote is somewhatbetter and the single transferable vote is by far the best. In terms of facilitating the formation of governments with working majorities the relative majoritysystem is likely to be the most effective, the alternative vote rather less so andthe single transferable vote still less.786. The question we have had to consider is which of these three systems of election would be the most suitable for regional legislatures. The Governmentof Ireland Act 1920 applied the single transferable vote system to elections tothe Northern Ireland House of Commons, apparently to facilitate the properrepresentation of minorities. But in 1929 the Northern Ireland Parliamentabolished it, putting in its place the relative majority system in use at West-minster. The Northern Ireland Government at that time defended the abolitionof proportional representation by reference both to the generally recogniseddisadvantages of having large multi-member constituencies and to its tendency in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland to cloud the central issueof whether the province was to remain a part of the United Kingdom. Con-adversely, many of our witnesses in Northern Ireland proposed its restorationbecause they believed that abolition had contributed to the polarisation of politics around this issue.787. No similar consideration would apply in any other region, and on general grounds we would favour the single transferable vote for regionallegislative assemblies. It is easy to exaggerate its complexities and the disadvan-tages arising from the use of multi-member constituencies. The system wasoperated in Northern Ireland between 1920 and 1929, apparently without serious difficulty for the electorate or for administering officials, and has again been used in elections this year to the new Northern Ireland assembly and local authorities. It is also in use in other parts of the world. The objection that it tends not to give any one party a majority in the assembly would beless substantial when the government was concerned with responsibilities inthe domestic field only than would be the case with a government having totake important decisions on major questions of policy, for example in the fields of defence, foreign affairs and management of the economy, all of whichsubjects would necessarily be reserved to the United Kingdom parliament and Government. An overriding requirement for the regional assemblies would,in our view, be to ensure the proper representation of minorities, and it wouldbe no bad thing for a regional government to have to pay regard, in the formu-lation of its policies and in its administration, to the views of the minorityparties, or indeed to be obliged to seek a consensus with them. This would be particularly desirable in any region in which there were likely to be long periodswithout alternation of parties in power.788. We, therefore, favour the single transferable vote system, as the onemost likely to give parties representation in proportion to their support in the region. Consideration might be given to the possibility of combining it withthe use of the alternative vote system in areas of sparse population whereconstituencies would otherwise be unduly large. We should make it clearthat this conclusion is specific to elections to regional assemblies; we are nothere concerned with elections to the United Kingdom Parliament.
Size of the assembly789. The Northern Ireland House of Commons had 52 members. This number was acknowledged to be too small. The field from which Ministers had to be selected was too restricted; and when Ministerial appointments had beenmade there remained too few back-benchers, a defect that would have been particularly marked on the government side if it had not enjoyed so large amajority and if greater use had been made of committees of the House. On theother hand a regional assembly very much larger than this would be unwieldy.The precise number of members needed would depend on the extent of the devolved functions, the geographical area covered and the method of working,but we think that something of the order of a hundred would be about right.790. If, as we have suggested, election of members were to be by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, the number of members in a constituency would never be less than three and the average number mightbe rather higher. What this would mean in terms of size of constituency can beseen by making a comparison with representation at Westminster. There wouldprobably be advantage to all concerned if the Parliamentary constituency boundaries, which follow local authority boundaries so far as possible, couldbe used for the purpose of regional elections. This would not, however, be essential and some crossing of constituency boundaries would probably be inevitable.791. Scotland, for example, now has 71 Members of Parliament. If this number were to be unchanged, and if for the purposes of election to a scottish assembly the existing constituencies were to be combined in pairs, each newconstituency so formed returning four members, the assembly would havea total of 142 members. If this number were considered to be too large, existingconstituencies might be combined in threes, each new constituency so formedreturning either four or five members, making a total of about 100 or 120.But a uniform pattern would not be necessary, and three-member constituencieswould probably be preferred in the more sparsely populated areas so as tokeep them as small as possible. We give these figures only by way of illustration;we have not attempted to draw up a detailed scheme.Frequency of election792. All the members of a regional legislative assembly would be electedand would retire together. For what period should they be elected, and should there be provision for calling a general election before the expiry of that period ?Members of the House of Commons are elected for a period of five years, butParliament may be dissolved at any time during that period on the advice ofthe Prime Minister. This arrangement, which also applied to the NorthernIreland House of Commons, was criticised by some of our witnesses on thegrounds that it gives the party forming the government the great advantage ofbeing able to call a general election at a time which appears most favourable toit and that the development of the technique of public opinion polls has addedto this advantage. The remedy suggested was the holding of elections at fixedintervals.793. We have considered the relevance of these views to elections to regionallegislatures. An obvious objection to a fixed term is that the government might
during its course lose its majority, either through loss of seats at bye-electionsor through failure to retain the support of its members, and then be unable tosecure approval for the implementation of its policies and its financial pro-gramme. One possibility might be to provide for early dissolution in circum-stances in which the government was no longer able to command a majority in the assembly, but not otherwise. The assembly might, for example, beempowered to submit an Address to Your Majesty for its own dissolutionfollowing a vote of no confidence in the government. Such an arrangementcould, however, be manipulated by the ruling party in its own interest. It mightbe used to allow an election to be held at a time considered favourable to theparty in power when its effective majority in the assembly and its capacity to govern had not in fact been lost.794. Another possibility would be to provide for regional assemblies to be elected and dissolved at the same time as the House of Commons. As well asremoving from the regional government the ability to call an election at a timeapparently most favourable to it, this would heighten the interest in elections and encourage a large vote. It would also avoid the election of assemblies, asoften occurs in the case of local authorities, on the basis of a protest againstthe government in power at Westminster, thus increasing the likelihood ofdisharmony in the working relationships between the two levels of government.But under such an arrangement the assemblies would at all times be liable to bedissolved through circumstances quite outside their control, involving perhapsissues of policy of little regional significance. Dissolution might take place at atime that was highly inconvenient; and the ensuing election would tend to befought on national rather than on regional policies.795. In our view the choice lies between an arrangement of the kind that now applies at Westminster and one providing for fixed-term assemblies with no provision for early dissolution. And since in some regions there could well belong periods in which the assembly was dominated by one party, and we would think it most undesirable to give that party the added advantage of being ableto decide when elections should be held, we have a preference for the fixedterm. We do not think it would give rise to any insuperable difficulties. If a regional government were at any time to lose its majority and feel unable tocontinue in office, it is to be expected that there would emerge an alternativegovernment commanding sufficient support to enable it to secure the passage of essential business; there would be compelling reasons for the parties to co-operate at least to that extent.796. Five years would probably be too long an interval between elections.On the other hand a regional government would need sufficient time to putits policies into effect, so that a very much shorter period would be open to objection. A fixed term of four years would be about right.797. Once again, as in the case of proportional representation, we must make it clear that our suggestion for a fixed term is specific to regional legis-Legislatures; we are not concerned with a possible reform of the Parliamentarysystem.798. Elections to the new county councils in England and Wales, and to thecorresponding new local authorities in Scotland, will be held every four years,
and the timing of elections to regional assemblies in relation to these localauthority elections would have to be considered. The two could be made tocoincide. The arguments for and against this are similar to those which applyto the timing of regional assembly elections in relation to elections to Parliament.Combined elections to regional assemblies and county councils would probablyarouse maximum interest, and the composition of the bodies so elected at thetwo levels would be likely to be such as to promote greater harmony in workingrelationships than if they were to be separately elected at times when the politicalclimate was different. The separation of elections on the other hand wouldmake it easier for the voter to distinguish regional and local issues.The need for a second chamber799. Like the Parliament at Westminster, the Northern Ireland parliament had an upper chamber, which was there known as the Senate. Though differentlyconstituted, and with wider powers in relation to legislation, it had much thesame role as the House of Lords except that it had no judicial function. Wehave to consider whether other regional legislatures should have second chambersand, if so, how they should be constituted.800. The functions of a second legislative chamber are generally considered to be, first, to give further opportunity for discussion and amendment oflegislation introduced in the first chamber; secondly, to provide a forum forthe introduction of non-controversial Bills and generally to relieve the pressure on the first chamber; thirdly, to act as a long-stop against action by a govern-ment which could be considered contrary to the country&apos;s long-term interests or in some sense unconstitutional; and fourthly, to bring into the legislaturepersons of distinction in different fields who do not wish to be members of orto stand for election to the lower chamber but who can make a valuable contribution to the work of the legislature. In countries with federal constitutionsthe second chamber performs the additional function of providing representationof the interests of the constituent states, but this would not apply in the caseof regional legislatures.801. We have examined the working of the Northern Ireland Senate tosee how far it was successful in performing these functions. The conclusionwe reach is that, although the Senate was regarded in Northern Ireland asserving a useful purpose, there was no essential need for it. As regards thefirst two functions, which relate to the sharing of the burden of work betweenthe two chambers, we see no reason why the Northern Ireland House ofCommons, with some small procedural changes, could not without unduepressure have undertaken the whole of the Northern Ireland parliamentary business. The other two functions of a second chamber to act as a long-stopagainst hasty and unconstitutional action and to bring into the legislaturepersons of distinction who would not stand for election are interrelated, andin Northern Ireland the Senate&apos;s contribution to them was almost completelynullified by the method of selection of its members. With the exception of theLord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry, the members were elected by the Northern Ireland House of Commons by a system of proportional representation. This inevitably produced a Senate which was a small-scalereplica of the House of Commons; and such a body could hardly have been
expected to be very effective in acting as a brake on the House of Commons,if that were needed, or to include persons of distinction not closely associatedwith the political parties.802. We have considered other possibilities of constituting a second chamberin a regional legislature. We have not, however, been able to devise a con-stitution which would not be open to some objection. And while there mightbe some value in having a second chamber with power to delay ill-advisedlegislation, there is less need for this, and for a body to act as a constitutionalwatchdog, in a subordinate legislature than in one which has sovereign powers.Parliament and the central government, by the use of their overriding powers,would if necessary be in a position to nullify the acts of the regional legislature.In addition it should be possible for minority interests to be adequately repre-sented in an assembly elected, as we have suggested, by a system of proportional representation. For these reasons we conclude that regional legislatures shouldnot have second chambers.the regional executiveExecutive authority803. We envisage, therefore, that a regional legislature would consist ofYour Majesty and a single-chamber body of about a hundred members elected for a fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation. Executive power would remain vested in your majesty, and be exercised mainly through Ministers of the Crown, who wouldbe in charge of departments of the regional government.804. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided for the appointment of a governor to exercise on behalf of Your Majesty any prerogative or executive powers delegated to him. Thus it was the Governor, or in his absence Com-missioners appointed to act in his place, who exercised such functions asthe opening and prorogation of Parliament, the grant of Royal Assent toBills and the appointment of Ministers. In our view, the appointment of a governor for any other region of the United Kingdom which had its ownlegislative assembly would be unnecessary and inappropriate. We would suggest that the executive functions of Your Majesty, in so far as they werenot within the competence of a Minster of the Crown, might be delegated toCommissioners specially appointed when required.805. A possible alternative to the appointment of Ministers for the exerciseof the executive powers of government would be to place the powers directlyin the hands of the assembly or of committees of the assembly, much as is done in the case of local authorities. We consider this possibility in our nextchapter, which is concerned with arrangements for devolving executive powers.Where major policy making and legislation are being devolved, the committeesystem would not in our view be appropriate and the Ministerial system is needed to ensure the , rapid and efficient crystallisation of policy and the promotion of the legislation necessary to give effect to it.The civil service806. We have considered whether, in the regions to which policy-making and legislative powers were devolved, central and regional government officials
could continue to belong to a unified service. In Northern Ireland the civilservice is separate from the United Kingdom civil service, although it closelyresembles it in structure, pay and conditions of service. Officials of the scottish and Welsh Offices, on the other hand, are part of the United Kingdom civilservice and are interchangeable with their colleagues in other departments;they have no difficulty in pursuing the interests of their own departments,even when these are in conflict with the interests of other departments. this might suggest that officials could continue to serve loyally a government setup under a scheme of regional devolution without disturbing the present civilservice structure. If this could be done it would maintain the flexibility andpromotion opportunities associated with a single service.807. Elected governments, however, are not comparable to departments ofthe same government; the former have their own power bases while the latterdo not. We think that regional governments would wish to be responsiblethemselves for the selection of their senior officials and would not be preparedto accept that personnel matters should be handled by a department of thecentral government. It seems to us to be inescapable, therefore, that each regionwith a devolved legislative assembly should have its own separate civil service.It might, however, following the practice of the Northern Ireland Government,make some use of the United Kingdom civil service selection procedure.Arrangements which facilitated the interchange of regional staffs with the staffs of both central and local government would help to promote smoothworking relations between the different levels of government.Nomenclature808. We were told that in Northern Ireland much confusion was caused bythe use of designations such as Parliament, House of Commons, Member ofParliament and Prime Minister duplicating those at Westminster. We thinkthat this should be avoided by the use in the regions of distinctive designations,as is done, for example, in most of the provinces of Canada, which haveLegislative Assemblies and Executive Councils headed by Premiers.implications for central government809. We now consider the implications of legislative devolution for the institutions of central government itself-for Parliament, for Ministers and their departments and for the civil service. The first point to make is that much would depend on whether legislative devolution were to be applied over thewhole of Great Britain or to selected regions only. If, for example, it were to be confined to Scotland and Wales, with Parliament continuing to be the solelegislative assembly for England, the range of functions of Parliament and ofthe departments of central government, other than the Scottish Office and the welsh Office, would remain largely as at present. If, on the other hand, legisla-tive devolution were to be applied to all regions, Parliament and the centralgovernment would be very substantially affected; and although we recognisethat it is highly unlikely that legislative powers will ever be devolved to theEnglish regions, we have not thought it right to ignore the possibility completely.
Parliament810. If legislative devolution were to be applied throughout Great Britain,Parliament would cease to be responsible for the functions devolved to the regions. It would retain its ultimate power to legislate on those subjects, but would exercise that power only in exceptional circumstances. It would have more time to devote to the reserved matters like constitutional and external affairs, defence, finance and trade and industry, and to European affairs.Individual Members of Parliament would be freed of a great deal of consti-tuency business, most of which at present relates to matters which are strongcandidates for devolution; for help on those matters members of the public would look instead to their representatives in the regional assemblies. Membersof Parliament would then be able to take on additional work and might perhapsassume a larger and more powerful role in the policy-making processes. even so it might be found that the House of Commons could function satisfactorilywith fewer Members, and if the extent of devolution were sufficiently largethere would be a case for considering some reduction in its size.811. If devolution were to be to selected regions only, a problem would ariseover the level of representation of those regions in the House of Commonscompared with that of regions which did not have legislative assemblies of theirown. The question of Irish representation at Westminster was one of the most difficult and most bitterly disputed in the various Irish Home Rule Bills, and itcannot be said that the solution adopted in 1920 was an entirely satisfactory one.812. One proposal was to give Ireland no representation at Westminster.This was obviously indefensible since Ireland would continue to have a closeconcern with much of the business transacted there, particularly in relation tothe reserved services, including most aspects of taxation. Another proposal wasto allow the Irish Members to vote on &quot;imperial&quot; issues but not on those of domestic concern to Great Britain the so-called &quot;in and out&quot; principle butthis was regarded as impracticable. And so the solution was adopted of givingIrish Members full rights but reducing their numbers in proportion to electors.The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958 gives NorthernIreland 12 seats, which, allowing for the abolition of the university constituency,is the number fixed in 1920. If all constituencies in the United Kingdom wereto have the same number of electors and the total number of constituenciesremained unchanged at 630, Northern Ireland&apos;s representation would beincreased to 17.813. The representation of Northern Ireland by 12 instead of 17 Membersis based on no precise numerical considerations. The Northern Ireland elector,instead of having a full vote at Westminster on things that concern him andno vote on things that do not, has something like a two-thirds vote ineverything. An &quot;in and out&quot; arrangement if it were workable would be morelogical. We do not consider, however, that it would be possible to devise ascheme that would be free from serious difficulty. There would need to be a precise statement of the circumstances in which the regional Members couldor could not vote. If their ability to vote on any particular matter had to bedecided at the time, either by the House or by a Speakers ruling which was open to challenge, the position of the regional Members would be a continuing
political issue. Ability to vote could not depend simply on whether the matter at issue related to a reserved or transferred subject. Any issue in Westminsterinvolving expenditure of public money is of concern to all parts of the UnitedKingdom since it may directly affect the level of taxation and indirectly influence the level of a region&apos;s own expenditure. Our enquiries have shown that theNorthern Ireland Parliament^ freedom of action on transferred matters wasin practice often severely restricted by decisions taken at Westminster, eventhough they may have had no direct application to Northern Ireland. It is right,therefore, that regions with their own legislative assemblies should have botha voice at Westminster in debate on most transferred subjects and a vote onthe decisions taken. The area of decision from which their representativescould appropriately be excluded is very small and its demarcation would beby no means simple or beyond dispute. A further difficulty would arise if the exclusion of some Members of Parliament from participation in certain issues were to deprive the government of the day of its majority in the House ofCommons.814. In our view, therefore, all Members of Parliament, whether or not they come from regions with their own legislative assemblies, must have the same rights of participation in the business of the House of Commons. There remains the question of the size of the regional representation. Scotland is at presentrepresented in Parliament by 71 Members, and this number would be reducedto 57 if Scotland&apos;s total representation in proportion to population were to bethe same as that of England. Corresponding figures for Wales are 36 and 31respectively. If legislative devolution were to be extended to Scotland andWales, but not to England or to the English regions, should the representationbe changed? In the case of Scotland, for example, should it remain at 71, bereduced to 57 or, following the example of Northern Ireland, be reduced even further?815. A case can be made in support of any of these three possible courses.It can be argued that the maintenance of the representation of Scotland andWales at their present levels would be justified by their separate nationalstatus. England already has a preponderance of representation in Parliamentcompared with the smaller nations. To base representation simply on the basisof counting heads is to ignore the important nationality factor. Moreover,there are ample precedents, for example in international organisations and inthe second chambers of many federal countries, for giving to smaller states agreater representation than would be justified by their populations. On theother hand, it is possible to argue for the removal of the over-representationof Scotland and Wales on the grounds that it would both be undemocratic andconstitute a grave injustice to the people of England if this over-representationwere to be retained when Parliamentary time had very largely to be devotedto debating and legislating for England on matters for which Scotland andWales had their own legislative assemblies. Indeed, in those circumstances there would be much to be said for reducing the representation of Scotlandand Wales below the level based on population, as was done in the case ofNorthern Ireland; the amount of this reduction would be a matter fordiscussion in the light of the extent of devolution, and it is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rules.
Ministers and their departments816. If legislative devolution were to be applied over the whole countrythis would have a profound effect on the machinery of government at the centre.In relation to the devolved functions there would be nothing which could beregarded as national policy. Where, under the existing arrangements, responsi-bility is dispersed among different departments in England, Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland, it is often though by no means always the Englishdepartment, much larger than the rest, which takes the lead in developing new policies; it does so in consultation with the other departments, which aregenerally content to follow and to apply only a few distinctive touches to take account of local circumstances. If the English department were to be broken up into a number of regional departments, each responsible to its own assembly,there would no longer be a department which, by virtue of its greater size,would be the natural leader and in a position to take a broad national view.The adoption in so small a country of a number of independent regional policies and the absence of a national policy would have unfortunate conse-quences. On matters of domestic policy it might very quickly produce a requirement for elaborate machinery of consultation and co-ordination, leadingperhaps to the formulation of what would amount in effect to a nationaluniform policy by clumsy and inefficient means. There would inevitably be difficulty also in the field of international relations, especially those of acommercial character.817. Central government would not in any event be wholly without interestin a devolved subject. Some machinery would be needed for the co-ordination of regional policies and administration, for the collection of information and statistics and possibly for the provision of some common services, and it isdifficult to believe that the central government would not have a part to play inthose operations. It would at the very least need to be kept informed of all aspects of the subject so as to equip itself to deal with possible interactionswith matters for which it remained responsible and with any internationalimplications. The machinery of government would have to be adapted todeal with these residual functions. The best method of doing this would dependon the arrangements made for dealing with relations generally between thecentral and regional governments.818. The question of the representation in the central government of the regions with their own legislative assemblies presents some difficulty. TakingScotland as an example, it is likely that most of the existing statutory functionsof the Secretary of State for Scotland would be devolved, and officials of theScottish Office engaged upon them would be transferred with their work tothe new Scottish Government. The functions of the Secretary of State which remained with the central government would be those few statutory functions which were not devolved, together with the functions of exercising an oversightof the administration in Scotland of the reserved services which were theresponsibility of other central government departments and of representingScottish interests in the Cabinet. An additional function not now existing wouldbe to act as channel of communication with the Scottish Government and tokeep a watch on the working of the devolution machinery. These are functionsof a kind which, under the 1920 constitution, the Home Secretary performedfor Northern Ireland.
819. Unless the executive functions of the Secretary of State for Scotlandretained by the central government were to be substantial and it is possiblethat some of them could be transferred to other central government departments there would in the ordinary course be little for a Secretary of State to dowhen devolution was working smoothly, that is to say after the initial running-in period and in the absence of a crisis of exceptional gravity such as NorthernIreland has experienced. Retention of the office of Secretary of State forScotland with a separate department for Scottish affairs would then be difficultto justify. The principal spokesman for Scotland would be the head of theScottish Government, and it would detract from his status if there were alsoto be a Secretary of State for Scotland in the United Kingdom Parliament.Provision would, however, still have to be made for the continued exercise ofthe few but important central government functions which remained. It wouldbe to the advantage of the Scottish people if they could continue to have arepresentative in the Cabinet, particularly if the central government remainedresponsible for major functions in relation to finance, trade and industry,on which the prosperity of Scotland depended. A solution might be found bycombining the office of Secretary of State with some other office, such as thatof Paymaster General, Lord President of the Council or Lord Privy Seal,so selected as to allow the holder to act as the special representative of scotland in the Cabinet without prejudice to his other responsibilities.820. A similar arrangement would have to be made for Wales if it had itsown legislative assembly. Or Scotland and Wales could become the responsi-bility of a single Minister. This would have some advantage in that the problems arising in relation to the two countries would be of a similar nature. Difficultymight arise when, as would be bound to happen from time to time, the. twocountries were in competition, for example over some large industrial develop-ment which could be located in one or the other but not in both. A solution ofthis kind would nevertheless have to be applied if legislative devolution wereto be further extended and a more or less uniform system were to be appliedto all regions. It would then be quite impracticable for each region to berepresented in the Cabinet by its own Minister, and the obvious solution wouldbe to have a Secretary of State for all regional affairs, possibly assisted byjunior Ministers responsible under him for the affairs of the individual regions.The civil service821. We have seen that under legislative devolution each region would need to have its own civil service. The United Kingdom civil service would be reduced in size. If devolution were to be applied to all regions, with most of the environ-mental and personal services being devolved, it would also be changed in character. It would be almost exclusively concerned with the reserved subjectssuch as defence, foreign affairs, finance, trade and industry. The few civilservants needed to deal with the central governments residual interests in the devolved services would be far removed from the seats of policy making andday-to-day administration. Frequent interchange between them and regionalofficials would help to ensure that at all times there existed at the centre theunderstanding of the working of the devolved services needed both to facilitaterelations between the central and regional governments and to enable theproblems of government to be seen as a whole.
822. Some increase in the total number of officials employed at the centre and in the regions could be expected. Any measure of devolution which creatednew centres of political power would involve the emergence of new posts forthe servicing of the new institutions and for liaison between the old and thenew, and there would probably be few if any countervailing savings. Anyassessment of the amount of the increase and of the consequential additional cost would have to be based on detailed assumptions about the nature of thenew institutions and the extent of the transferred matters, and we have not considered that it would be useful for us to attempt such an assessment.summary823. In this chapter we have examined a form of devolution in whichpowers would be transferred to the regions to determine policy on a selectedrange of matters, to enact legislation to give effect to that policy and to providethe administrative machinery for its execution. Parliament would retain thepower to legislate for the regions on all matters, but we have given our reasonsfor thinking that it would be inconsistent with this degree of devolution forthe powers to be used without agreement other than in exceptional circum-stances. Similarly the power of the United Kingdom authorities to veto regionallegislation by advising the withholding of Royal Assent would have to beregarded as being available for use only as a last resort. Matters suitable for transfer to the regions would be those in which there would be substantial scope for regional differences of policy and a reasonable likelihood that the co-ordination of regional policies and administrative procedures needed in the wider national interest could be secured without resort to central direction.We have suggested that these matters would be found mainly from among those which are outside the trade and industry and social security fields andare now in Scotland the responsibility of the Scottish Office. As regards financialpowers, we have concluded that the maximum scope for devolution which weestablished in Chapter 15 would be appropriate and would suffice to supportthe constitutional status of the regional authorities.824. We have suggested that the regional legislature might consist of your majesty and a single chamber of about a hundred members directly elected for a fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of propor-tional representation; and that executive powers might remain vested in your majesty and be for the most part exercised by regional Ministers appointedfrom among the members of the assembly. We have questioned the need forthe appointment of a Governor. We have examined the implications of legisla-tive devolution for institutions of central government, including the representation in Parliament and the central government of regions which had their own legislative assemblies.825. A distinctive feature of legislative devolution, by comparison with the others we shall examine, is that the region would acquire virtually undividedresponsibility for the transferred matters. There would be a clear and easilycomprehended division of functions. All decisions on policy and administration in the transferred matters would be taken nearer to the people affected bythem and by their own representatives, who would at all times have the interestsof the region primarily in mind. The regional assembly would be able to devotefar more time than Parliament now can to the affairs of the region, and one
would expect that as a consequence both the quality of the decisions taken andthe element of democratic control would be enhanced. Another advantage to be expected would be some reduction in the burden on Parliament and thedepartments of central government.826. These advantages might not, however, be as great as at first sightappears. The scope of legislative devolution would be limited by the need toretain at the centre the important trade and industry functions. Even in the devolved subjects the opportunity to introduce genuinely independent policieswould in many cases be limited both by the need to comply with international agreements and by the obligations stemming from common membership ofthe British community, including the need to co-ordinate policies so as tokeep to an acceptable level any adverse cross-border consequences of policydifferences. The difficulties would not be so acute if legislative devolution wereto be confined to Scotland and Wales, where it would attract greater interestand would be a more realistic proposition than in the regions of England;but the relief at the centre would not then be significant.
EXECUTIVE DEVOLUTION827. In the system of legislative devolution considered in the last chapterParliament would legislate for the regions on devolved matters in exceptional circumstances only, and the central government would have no executive responsibilities for such matters. In this chapter we consider an arrangement,which for convenience we have called executive devolution, the essence ofwhich is that Parliament and the central government would be responsible forthe framework of legislation and major policy on all matters but would,wherever possible, transfer to directly elected regional assemblies the responsi-bility within that framework for devising specific policies for the regions, forthe execution of those policies and for general administration. The regional assemblies, although obliged to implement United Kingdom policies, would beable to exercise a substantial measure of discretion in the way this was done,developing their own distinctive styles of administration and bringing themaking of decisions nearer to the people affected. The intention would be topermit the maximum amount of regional participation and variation consistent with the general policy aims of the United Kingdom Government.definition of the devolved functionsThe problem of definition828. If there are to be two tiers of elected government in this way, the first question that arises is how functions are to be divided between them. one possibility would be to seek to draw a line between policy making on the onehand and executive or administrative action on the other. But the distinctionbetween policy making and administration is not a precise one, and underthe present arrangements they are not clearly separated. Ministers and govern-ment departments perform both roles. Ministers may, for example, decide to have a new policy about housing subsidies. Legislation is promoted to giveeffect to it, and this is likely to be supplemented by statutory instruments. Theactual operation of the policy will probably be devolved to local authorities.But the authorities may be required to conform to Ministerial directives andto submit for Ministerial approval their proposed schemes for implementing the policy laid down by government and Parliament. In such a chain there isno obvious point at which policy making ends and administration begins.Legislation gives effect to a policy decision. Statutory instruments and directivescan be seen as administrative devices concerned with implementing that decision.But they can equally be classified as supplementary policy documents. And even when one gets down to the point at which the local authority is applying thelegislation to the citizens in its area, the authority will certainly see itself asmaking both policy and administrative decisions, leaving much of the latter to its permanent officials while reserving the former for determination by thecouncil or its committees.829. This suggests that the division of functions needed for the establishmentof regional assemblies with mainly executive powers would not be capable ofsimple definition. The assemblies would have a share in policy making. the division would be an arbitrary one in that the range of powers conferred on
the assemblies would depend upon a political judgement of the extent of thecontrol it was necessary to retain at the centre. There is nothing new in this.A line has now similarly to be drawn in statutes conferring functions on localauthorities. The same kind of division has also to be made in relation to the nationalised industries and to other nominated bodies to which specified powersof government are devolved; the bodies have the powers and duties prescribed,often in considerable detail, by Act of Parliament, which may also confer onthe appropriate Minister power to give directions and to intervene in one way or another in their operations.830. While these examples show that there is nothing novel in the idea of creating bodies with subordinate policy-making and executive powers, theyoffer no guidance on where the line should be drawn between the functions ofsuch bodies and the functions of the central government, or indeed on theprinciples to be applied in drawing that line. In relation to regional assembliesthere would be an additional problem arising from the fact that many of thematters generally considered most suitable for regional devolution relate to services for which operational responsibility has already been conferred on local authorities. In all parts of Great Britain local government is beingreformed and strengthened to enable it to provide those services more effec-tively and economically without being subjected to excessive regulation throughfinancial and other controls. We are required by our terms of reference tohave regard to these developments in local government, and the question arises whether the scheme we are now considering would involve yet further changes in the structure of local government or in the responsibilities allotted to local authorities. This would seem to depend upon the way it was applied,and there are a variety of possibilities.831. One would be for Parliament to distribute the executive and admini-strative functions to be performed below the centre between the regional andthe local authorities, so that each would be autonomous in the functionsallotted to it. This would be to follow the pattern of the Local government act 1972 whereby county and district councils will work in parallel, eachperforming its prescribed functions under the surveillance of the centralgovernment, and neither being subordinate to the other. It would mean theinterposition of another tier of government at the regional level, with theallocation to the new regional authorities of certain limited and defined executive and administrative functions in matters having a special regional dimensionand in matters crossing local government boundaries. On that basis localauthorities would retain their present autonomy in whatever functions wereallotted to them, and it might well be that this would leave the newly reformedsystems of local government substantially intact. It would also involve nochange in the new local government maps.832. A second possibility, which is a more radical concept, is that the regional authorities would be responsible within their areas for the application andimplementation of all policies emanating from the central government saveonly those in which the central government had retained those powers to itself or conferred them upon some other agency, as, for example, the boardof a nationalised industry. On this basis local government would be subordinateto regional government and it would be for each regional authority to decide on the distribution of functions between itself and its local authorities. Indeed
it might be within the competence of a regional authority to devise and adoptits own structure of local government. A further consequence would be that local authorities would exercise their responsibilities under the surveillanceand direction of the regional authorities rather than under the central govern-ment. Manifestly, executive devolution of this order would be likely to involvesubstantial changes in the present systems of local government and indeedvariations in the structure of local government between one region and another.833. A third possibility would be an ad hoc approach whereby the centralgovernment would specify in each separate field of legislation involving devolution-tion of functions from the centre how the powers devolved were to be allocatedor shared between the regional and local authorities. In some fields it mightbe thought appropriate to give the regional authority the fullest discretion and responsibility in the execution of the legislation, including powers to decide on the distribution of functions between itself and the local authorities; in others it might be more desirable to limit this discretion by reserving to thelocal authorities specified executive functions in the exercise of which theywould be autonomous.The example of the Welsh Office834. The range of responsibilities of the Welsh Office provides a useful guideto the functions which might be conferred on a regional assembly. When thedepartment was first created in November 1964 it took over virtually all thefunctions in Wales of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.Substantial additions have since been made, and the department now hasresponsibility for most of the matters which in England are the concern of theDepartment of the Environment or, in the case of primary and secondary education, of the Department of Education and Science. For all these matters the major policies and the legislation on which they depend are, for the mostpart, common to England and Wales. Special provision for Welsh interestshas sometimes been included in statutes of general application, while therehave been a small number of statutes, mainly relating to the Welsh language,limited specifically to Welsh matters. But in the normal course the Whitehalldepartments take the lead in the development of new policies and the ministers in charge of them have the main responsibility for the preparation of new legislation, including subordinate legislation, and for its passage through parliament. Consequential executive action in Wales, including all dealings with the Welsh local authorities, then becomes the exclusive responsibility ofthe Welsh Office.835. The Welsh Office, like any other government department, is accountable to Parliament for its actions. The suggestion has been made that it should insteadbe answerable to a Welsh body democratically elected for the administration in Wales of the policies laid down by Parliament. Regional assemblies inEngland might take over comparable functions from the Whitehall departments.In the case of Scotland the transfer of executive functions to a Scottish assembly would have to take account of the fact that much domestic legislation ispeculiar to Scotland so that the Scottish Office tends to have a wider concernthan the Welsh Office with the development of new policies as well as with theirexecution.
836. While the existing relationship between the Welsh Office and thepolicy-making departments in Whitehall provides some kind of indication ofthe relationship that might be worked out for the division of functions between the central policy-making authorities and regional authorities withmainly executive functions, the two situations are not comparable. As amember of the United Kingdom Government, the Secretary of State for Walesnow shares with his Cabinet colleagues responsibility for the determination of policy, and he is naturally concerned to ensure that his department in itsexecutive action gives effect to that policy. The Welsh Office will have been consulted by the Whitehall department at all stages in the formulation of thepolicy, and any conflict arising then, or later when the agreed policies are being applied, is resolved by interdepartmental discussion or, in the last resort, inthe Cabinet. If, on the other hand, there were to be a formal division ofresponsibility between the United Kingdom Government and an elected welsh assembly, the Government would have nothing like the same control over the ways in which its policies were being applied in Wales.The form of the statutes837. A useful insight into the practical problems of dividing responsibility between central and regional authorities can be obtained by considering how this division would be reflected in the statutes. The object would be to include in the statutes only the framework of general policy, leaving to the regions alarge measure of discretion in the way it was applied. In many cases Acts ofParliament do not now prescribe policy in great detail. They leave much to be filled in by subordinate legislation, and they confer other discretionary powerson the responsible Minister or Ministers. This method of drafting statutes hasthe advantage of permitting flexibility in the application of policy. Withoutrecourse to fresh legislation adjustments can be made to meet changing circum-stances and to overcome difficulties which have arisen in the course ofadministration; and a new government may be able to give a different slantto administration within the terms of the existing statute. When a statute ofthis kind has to be administered in England by one Minister and in Wales by another, some divergence of policy within the framework of the statute may bepossible; but, as members of the same government, the two Ministers will ensure that there is no incompatibility in their administration and that anydivergence is kept within acceptable bounds.838. Other considerations would arise if responsibility for executive actionin different parts of the country were to be conferred not on different Ministersbut on bodies which were independent both of the central government andof each other. To the extent that functions were transferred to the regions,the central government would no longer be in a position to insist on uniformityor to permit only such variations as were acceptable to it. It would indeed be one of the main objects of devolution to permit regional variations to bemade in accordance with regional preferences. The problem would be to draft the statutes in such a way as to leave the central government with sufficientpowers to ensure that its general policies were being pursued, while at the sametime giving the regional assemblies adequate scope in their executive actionto apply those policies in accordance with regional needs.
The example of education839. To illustrate the problem of drafting it is helpful to look at a typicalpiece of legislation on a subject for which the Welsh Office now has responsibility in Wales. Primary and secondary education is one such subject. The law is tobe found in the Education Act 1944 as later amended. Section 1 of the Actconfers on the Minister (now the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceor, in respect of primary and secondary education, the Secretary of State for wales) the duty &quot;to promote the education of the people of England andWales and the progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose,and to secure the effective execution by local authorities, under his controland direction, of the national policy for providing a varied and comprehensiveeducational service in every area.&quot; It is immediately apparent that if regional assemblies were to be given functions in connection with education, this duty would in some way have to be shared between a central government minister or Ministers and the assemblies.840. In some matters the Act lays down policies in specific terms. Thus inSection 35 it prescribes the school-leaving age, and in Section 61 it prohibitsthe charging of fees by schools maintained by local education authorities. Butfor the most part policies are laid down in general terms only, leaving thedetails to be filled in by regulations made by the Minister. These regulationscover such matters as premises, furnishing and equipment, school meals and milk, grants to pupils, medical examination and treatment, the education ofhandicapped children, the training and certification of teachers and their salaries and superannuation. In addition the Minister is given a wide range of executive and quasi-judicial functions. He approves schemes made by the educationauthorities for the provision of the various forms of education and forco-operation between education authorities. He is responsible for inspection,conducts special enquiries, issues directions, calls for returns and reports,determines disputes and appeals, issues orders of exemption from variousstatutory requirements, confirms compulsory purchase orders and gives loansanctions. The original Act of 1944 contained 122 Sections and 9 Schedules,very many of them conferring powers of one kind or another on the Minister.Some of these powers are of great importance for the determination of educationpolicies. The organisation of secondary education, for example, depends noton any specific provisions of the statute or even on statutory instruments, butupon a requirement on local education authorities to secure the ministers approval to their development plans. Successive governments have accordingly been able by administrative action alone to impose their own policies forsecondary education.841. Under a system of executive devolution the responsibilities for matters which are now the subject of regulations or of administrative action by theMinister would have to be apportioned between the central and regional governments. Central policy would have to be prescribed in such detail as to preclude what would be regarded as excessive regional variation. On theone hand there would be what some people would regard as a welcome check on the power of the central government, which would be required to lay downits policies more openly and with greater precision than at present and wouldhave less scope for government by administrative decision. On the other handsome of the valuable flexibility which the existing statute allows would be lost.
The distribution of functions between central and regional government842. How then could the Ministerial duties and powers under the education act be shared with regional assemblies? Clearly it could be done in a great variety of ways. One possibility, the most extreme, would be to transfer tothe assemblies all the powers specifically conferred by the Act on the Minister,leaving as his only function that of keeping watch on the working of theeducation system generally and of presenting to Parliament any new legislative proposals. In any amending legislation the central government policy, iiiwhatever was considered to be the requisite amount of detail, would have to belaid down in precise terms. Everything else would be left to the assemblies.This would have the advantage that there would be a sharp division of functions,with the Minister being unable to interfere with the exercise by the assembliesof the responsibilities conferred on them by Parliament. All concerned wouldknow exactly where they stood. It is probable that in these circumstances therewould be a tendency for policy to be laid down in the statutes in greater detailthan at present, and there might be more frequent need for amending legislation to give effect to policy changes, thus adding to the burden on Parliament.843. Another possibility, taking the Act as it stands, would be to leave theMinister with responsibility for subordinate legislation, or for certain categories of subordinate legislation perhaps statutory instruments subject to affirmative resolution procedure, or those subject to either affirmative or negative resolution procedure, or all statutory instruments which are required to be laid beforeParliament but with none of his executive or quasi-judicial functions. although many functions of this kind might appropriately be transferred to the regions, itis unlikely that they could all be so transferred without depriving the Ministerof an essential element of policy control. In the drafting of statutes there appearsto have been no consistency of practice in deciding whether a particular matterrequiring Ministerial control should be dealt with by subordinate legislation or by administrative action; and statutory instruments themselves commonlyconfer executive functions on Ministers. We have, for example, already notedthat in the Education Act the organisation of secondary education is not subject to statutory regulation but is left to the Ministers administrative action, although other matters of seemingly no greater importance are regulatedin considerable detail by statutory instrument. If the Ministers powers wereto be confined to the making of subordinate legislation, it is to be expectedthat there would be a tendency to frame any new statute so as to permit himto legislate in this way for matters which are now left to administrative decision.While this might have advantage in improving democratic control, it would again lead to some loss of flexibility.844. The conclusion we have reached is that there is no general rule whichcould be applied to determine whether any particular function of the minister under the Act should or should not be transferred to the regions. The advantages and disadvantages of transfers would have to be considered in relation to eachfunction, and the Act or statutory instrument amended to effect the transferwhere appropriate. In some cases, as for example in the organisation of secondary education, more extensive amendment might be required to secure a proper distribution of functions between the Minister and the regional assemblies. Every statute and every statutory instrument relating to a subject
which was to become the concern of the assemblies would have to be reviewed in this way. This would be a heavy task, but by no means an impossible one.845. The task would be less formidable if the establishment of regional assemblies, the allocation to them of functions and the definition of thosefunctions were contemplated as a fairly long-term process. We do not indeedforesee that it could be anything else. The most practical approach might be toset up the new assemblies and in the first place confer upon them certainprecisely defined powers in those fields of government, such as strategic planning,where it is generally agreed that the problems cannot be satisfactorily tackledat the local level. At this stage local authorities would be likely to retain most oftheir present powers and would be working &quot;in parallel&quot; with the regional assemblies in the way described at paragraph 831. The next step might be to seek, as new legislation was brought forward or as earlier legislation wasconsolidated, to draw a line between the functions to be retained by the Ministerand those to be devolved to the regions, the line being the one thought most appropriate to the particular Bill under consideration. Clearly the line mightbe differently drawn in different enactments, but it could be reasonably expectedthat in the the course of time, working on this pragmatic basis, some general principles would emerge. This gradual approach would be designed to avoid any serious error and at the same time provide a fund of experience for guidance in the framing of subsequent legislation. It could be, indeed, that some of thedifficulties which appear so formidable in theory would be found to be manage-able in practice and in the context of a single subject.846. In dividing up functions between Ministers and regions through theamendment of existing legislation or in new legislation, both central governmentand Parliament could be expected to wish to reserve to Ministers rather morethan the regions might consider appropriate. If too much were to be trans-ferred to the regions, Ministers would be in danger of losing their ability tocontrol and adjust policy and to secure its application by the assemblies, whichwould sometimes be of a different political complexion from the centralgovernment and out of sympathy with its policies. If, on the other hand, too much were to be retained at the centre, and only administration of a routinekind with little political content were to be transferred, the assemblies mightnot have a worthwhile job to do. In relation to a service such as education, forwhich operational responsibility rests mainly with the local authorities, thedistribution of functions would need to be one which permitted the orderlydevelopment and administration of policies and left central, regional and localgovernment each with its own well-defined range of functions, adequate incontent to attract and sustain political interest. The regions would need somesafeguard against encroachment by the central government on their preserves,while the central government for its part would require some means of ensuring that the regions gave effect to the policies laid down by Parliament.Lessons from abroad847. There are systems of government in other parts of the world whichoperate on the basis of drawing a distinction between policy making and administration. The Swedish and West German systems are perhaps the bestknown and we have enquired into their working. At our request Mr. Neil Elder,
Senior Lecturer in Political Studies in the University of Hull, prepared a paper1for us on regional government in Sweden, and Mr. Nevil Johnson, NuffieldReader in the Comparative Study of Institutions in the University of Oxford,prepared a paper2 on federalism and decentralisation in the Federal republic of Germany.Sweden848. In Sweden policy making is the responsibility of small Ministries, whileadministration is hived off to appointed public boards, which operate bothcentrally and regionally. Acts of Parliament are generally in outline form;although they may distinguish between functions appropriate to Ministers andthose appropriate to the relevant boards, the detailed distribution of functionsis left to be determined by Ministers by means of supplementary regulations and working instructions to the boards. Administration then becomes the sole responsibility of the boards, and neither they nor the Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the actions of the boards. The separation of policy makingfrom administration is not, however, nearly so clear-cut as this brief statementof responsibilities might suggest. There is at all times close co-operation between ministers and boards. Each Ministry has a policy group on which the relevantboards are represented. In this way the boards participate in the formulation ofpolicy, and the Minister is kept informed of their activities. He may intervene in many ways he has, for example, close financial control and powers may bedrawn back from the boards to the government at will.849. Members of Parliament in Sweden are concerned with general policyrather than its application and much of their time is spent in serving on parliamentary committees or on commissions of enquiry, which are extensivelyused for working out new policies. Members of Parliament are not, as in thiscountry, much concerned with the grievances of their constituents. There is notradition of their acting in this role, and the various legal controls which existdiminish the need. Civil servants working in the Ministries and boards areindividually responsible in law for their actions, and ultimate legal sanctionmay be exercised against them for negligence or other faults. There is extensiveprovision for administrative appeals against actions of the boards on grounds of either legality or desirability. And three Ombudsmen elected by Parliamenthave important powers in the examination of administrative practice. Theprinciple of the publicity of official documents also has a part to play in thisrespect.850. There are aspects of the Swedish system which are of interest to us.Freeing the United Kingdom Parliament and the departments of central govern-ment from concern with the details of administration, so permitting them to concentrate on general policy and long-term planning, would be one of the objects of devolution. The Swedish system has, however, features which couldnot be imported. The wholesale hiving off of government functions to appointedboards would be unlikely to find favour in this country, where steps in thisdirection have already given rise to demands for greater democratic control.Nor can it be expected that Parliament and its individual Members would beprepared to divest themselves of all concern with the administration of policy.1 Research Paper 3.2 Research Paper 1.
Even in Sweden, with its very different traditions, it would appear that theboard system works best in purely technical spheres which are politically non-controversial, and there is growing Parliamentary interest in administrativematters. Though in this country there is some scope for hiving off to specialistboards, our concern is rather with devolution to democratically elected assemblies in the regions. It is apparent that the Swedish system can providelittle assistance in suggesting the form that this devolution might take. the separation of the policy-making functions of the Ministers from the admini-strative functions of the boards, and the degree of independence of one fromthe other, are by no means as closely defined as would be necessary in a systemof devolution to elected assemblies; and the system therefore offers no guidance on the problems of preventing the encroachment of central government on the regions and of ensuring the application by the regions of central government policies. Moreover it depends on the legal responsibility of individual civilservants and a fully developed system of administrative law, both of which areabsent in the United Kingdom and, it might be thought, alien to our tradition.West Germany851. An examination of the system of government in the Federal republic of Germany has proved more helpful. The system is not one of executivedevolution as we visualize it, but has a good deal in common with it. west germany is similar to the United Kingdom in size, population and general economic type. But there are important differences in the systems of government.West Germany has a federal constitution, founded on the Basic Law of 1949,sovereignty being shared between the federation and its member states, theLander (ten in number, not counting West Berlin, which is technically outsidethe federation). A distinguishing characteristic of German federalism is thatthe federal Parliament and government are primarily responsible for legislatingon matters of principle and for policy decisions, while the execution or administration of policy is normally the responsibility of the Lander.852. The Basic Law starts by giving a general legislative competence to theLander. But this general competence is circumscribed by provisions which givethe federal authorities exclusive competence in certain subjects, concurrentpowers in others, and power to make framework provisions, leaving the Landerto fill in the details with their own legislation, in yet another group of subjects.Where there are concurrent powers the Lander may legislate in so far as thefederal Parliament has not done so; in the case of conflict federal law takesprecedence over Land law. In practice the federal Parliament has made extensiveuse of its concurrent powers and the legislation of the Lander is largely confined to the three subjects education below university level, police and the generalframework of local government in which they have exclusive competence.Even in these fields, particularly education, pressure for uniformity and the growing financial involvement of the federation are tending to restrict thefreedom of individual Lander. Nevertheless the existence of these legislative powers provides the Lander with an important political base.853. Under the Basic Law the Lander are for the most part responsible forthe administration of both federal and state laws. There are some exceptions.The federal government, either directly through its Ministries or by delegation to agencies and corporations, administers a small number of services, including
foreign affairs, railways, postal services, shipping and some aspects of taxation;while for some other services, including military and civil defence, motorwayconstruction, air traffic control and atomic energy, the Lander themselves actas agents of the federal government.854. There are other differences between the two countries which have tobe taken into account in considering the relevance of West German experience to a study of the scope for devolution in the United Kingdom. Perhaps the mostimportant of these concerns the character of public law. British statutes are largely concerned with the translation into legal terms of detailed administrativeprocedures and instructions; they confer duties on local authorities or other bodies and, as we have seen, very many controlling and supervisory powersof one kind or another on Ministers. In Germany, on the other hand, statutesare normally drafted in general declaratory terms, providing only a framework of policy and leaving to all levels of government considerable initiative in its application. These discretionary powers have to be exercised in accordancewith general principles which govern public action in particular sectors of social and economic life, and any alleged failure to respect such principles maybe challenged in the courts. Most general administrators are lawyers by training and there is a largely legalistic approach to administration, with extensivereliance on judicial decisions. All these procedures, which are very different from our own, appear in practice to simplify the task of drawing and main-taining a division between the policy-making functions of the centre and theadministrative and executive functions which are devolved. We have neverthe-less found it helpful to have regard to the West German experience in consideringin the paragraphs which follow the form that executive devolution might take in this country.The centralising tendencies of government855. We have noted as one of the problems associated with the establish-ment of regional assemblies with mainly executive functions that of devolvingupon them a range of responsibilities sufficiently large to sustain political interest and of defending this measure of devolution against the encroachmentof the central government. In the absence of some political or constitutionalcheck, there would be a real danger that Parliament and the central governmentwould prescribe policies and procedures in such detail as to leave the assemblieswith little room for manoeuvre. The centralising tendencies of government are such that even if the assemblies were to be given an adequate degree of freedomat the outset it would be constantly at risk. It has for long been the complaint of local authorities that, while successive governments proclaim that it is theirpolicy to remove controls over local authorities, they do little to implement itand tend instead in their legislation to restrict even further the authorities&apos;freedom of action. The fact that Parliament refrained for many years fromlegislating for Northern Ireland on transferred matters without the consent ofthe Northern Ireland Government is not a pointer to what could be expectedto happen if regional assemblies with mainly executive functions were to beestablished. Parliament would continue to legislate for the regions and theamount of freedom given to them would depend entirely, as it does with localauthorities, on the content of the individual statutes conferring functionsupon them.
856. In West Germany there are powerful constitutional checks on theencroachment by the federal government on the preserves of the Lander.The Basic Law confers upon the Lander exclusive responsibility, includingpowers of legislation, in certain matters and, with only a few exceptions,responsibility for the administration of all laws, whether made by the federalor Land Parliaments; and the Federal Constitutional Court is there to adjudicatein any dispute over the division of powers. The federal authorities can acquireadditional powers at the expense of the Lander only by securing an amendmentof the constitution.857. Another important safeguard of the Land powers lies in the existence ofthe Bundesrat, the second chamber of the federal Parliament. This is made upof forty-one members, appointed by and from the governments of the Lander in numbers roughly in proportion to their populations. The membership of the bundesrat therefore reflects the political complexion of the Land governments as they change, and in any division the representatives of a Land cast theirvotes en bloc. The consent of the Bundesrat is required to a wide range of federalmeasures, including all those which involve consequential legislative or administrative action by the Lander. If there is disagreement between the bundestag (the lower chamber) and the Bundesrat the matter is decided by amediation committee consisting of eleven members of each House, who vote as individuals. The committee has been used extensively and successfully to resolve differences over legislation. The Bundesrat can initiate legislation, butrarely does so. Its primary task is to scrutinise legislation coming from the bundestag, and in performing this task it has an important influence on the actions of the federal government.858. It would in our view be unrealistic to think in terms of the creation inthis country of a chamber of Parliament comparable to the Bundesrat, in place of the House of Lords, to look after the interests of the regions. But itwould be right, and indeed essential, for the smooth working of executivedevolution for the regional assemblies to be consulted on the content oflegislation relating to matters for which they had responsibility. One possibility would be to set up a statutory council representative of the regional assemblies,with a right to be consulted on proposals for new legislation affecting regionalresponsibilities and to present its views in the form of a petition, which would belaid before Parliament, together with the comments of the Minister, before thelegislation was approved. The power of decision would remain with Parliament.But by this means Parliament would be regularly reminded of the regions&apos;legitimate interests. A formal expression of these interests might also be recordedby including in the statute providing for the establishment of regional assembliesa preamble stating the intention to confer upon them wide powers of executionof policy.859. While provisions of this kind would be helpful they could do no morethan establish a framework of operation. In the last resort the preservation ofthe powers of the regions and the viability of the whole system would depend ona continuing willingness on the part of Parliament and the central governmentto make it work. Even in West Germany, where the independence of theLander is protected by the terms of the constitution, a great deal depends onthe willingness of the federal and Land governments to co-operate; general support for the federation seems to rest on a desire to avoid a concentration of
powers at the centre rather than on any strong preference for regional diversity.There is a growing emphasis on federal responsibilities, and this has tended to fix popular attention on national rather than Land politics.The safeguarding of central government policies860. Parliament and the central government would be more ready to givediscretion to regional assemblies to administer policies centrally determined inthe way best suited to the requirements of the regions if they could be satisfiedthat the discretionary powers would in fact be used to further those policies and not to frustrate them. If, for example, regional assemblies were requiredto make regulations to give effect to some policy laid down in the statute, therewould need to be some means of ensuring that suitable regulations were made.However unlikely it may be, the possibility would at least exist that a particularassembly which was opposed to that policy might either fail to make theregulations or make them in terms which were deliberately unsuited for thepurpose. There have been a few instances of refusal by a local authority tocomply with a duty laid upon it by Parliament. To meet such circumstances the statutes furnish Ministers with remedies of one kind or another, including thepower to discharge functions themselves or through some other authorisedbody or person in the name and at the expense of the offending authority.In general, local authorities accept without question that policy making is thepreserve of the central government. It is possible that regional governments,with greater weight, and perhaps strong national or regional feeling behind them, would not always be so amenable. Some measure of disagreement,forcibly expressed and at times acted upon, could be expected. This would indeed be a natural and by no means undesirable consequence of any genuinemeasure of devolution. The central government would, however, need to bein a position to secure the implementation of its policy and to step in if a region either exceeded the limits of its devolved powers or failed to exercisethem.861. In West Germany there is provision, if a particular Land fails to execute federal law, for the federal government to refer the matter to theConstitutional Court and, in certain circumstances, to proceed to federalexecution. In practice, we understand, there are few disputes and there hasbeen no need to invoke these procedures. The representation of the Landerin the Bundesrat reduces the prospect of legislation being passed which theydo not support, and since responsibility for implementation is theirs as of right it is accepted that they will fill in the details of legislation according totheir own political outlook.862. What remedy would the central government have in this country inthe face of a recalcitrant regional assembly? One possibility would be to makethe exercise of the regions&apos; subordinate policy-making powers in some waysubject to central government approval. But this would hardly be consistent with the objects of devolution. If regional assemblies are to be given any realpower they must be independent of day-to-day government control or super-vision of the exercise of the functions conferred upon them. The government must have a power of intervention which is exercisable only where a regionalassembly has failed to comply with an obligation placed upon it.
863. Ideally, to protect the freedom of the assemblies, this reserve power should be exercisable only on the decision of an independent arbiter. If thematter in dispute concerned the vires of the assembly&apos;s action it might bepossible to refer it to the courts for a decision; to make such a power of judicialreview workable it might be desirable for the assemblies, like local authorities,to be accorded corporate status. But if no question of law was involved, theaction of the assembly being merely unsuited, and perhaps deliberately so, togive effect to central government policies, the Minister could not have recourse to the courts. To meet contingencies of this kind we see no alternative to con-ferring on central government default powers of the kind they have in relationto local authorities. In the last resort Parliament could, of course, by amending legislation rescind some of the power conferred on the assemblies. Or, if thefinancial arrangements made this practicable, pressure might be brought tobear on the offending assembly by a threat to withhold financial support.It must be recognised, however, that there would be strong political resistance to the use of any of these powers of coercion and that a system of devolutionwhich required any frequent resort to them could not possibly survive; either the regions&apos; powers of independent action would have to be extended, or allpower would have to be returned to the centre.Relations between central and regional government864. It would be one of the objects of executive devolution to free centralgovernment from responsibility for detailed administration and so permit itto concentrate on policy and long-term planning. But policy is not made in avacuum. Recognition of the need for change requires full knowledge of theworking of existing policy and of its strengths and weaknesses. Governmentdepartments now derive this knowledge from the exercise of their responsibilities for administration, which brings them into direct contact with the services concerned, the people engaged in them and the day-to-day problems arising.When, in relation to a particular matter, the responsible department has nocontinuing executive function, it is generally slow to recognise the need forchange and ill-equipped to respond when this is brought to its notice.865. How then could the departments of central government acquire allthe information needed for policy making if the executive responsibilities hadbeen devolved to the regions? The regions could be expected to draw attentionto any dissatisfaction with existing policy and to express their desire to see itchanged. A statutory obligation could be placed on them to supply departments with all the information they needed. But this would not be an adequate sub-stitute for the personal contacts the departments now have, and they would need to maintain close working relationships with the regions at the different levels.866. We have already noted as a feature of the West German system ofgovernment an increasing need for co-ordination and co-operation between thefederal and Land authorities. Starting from the top, to discuss matters ofcommon concern there are regular conferences of the heads of the land governments and between them and the Federal Chancellor. Similarly, there areconferences of Ministers of the different Lander in each of the main functionalareas of Land administration, and these are very often attended by theappropriate federal Ministers. There are similar conferences at official level.
Each Land has a respresentative, either a Minister or senior official, in thefederal capital, whose job it is to maintain contact with the federal Parliament,departments and agencies. Land officials spend much of their time in Bonn,and federal officials make frequent visits to the Land capitals. The extent ofthe more formalised official co-operation is indicated by the fact that sixMinistries of the Land North Rhine Westphalia were stated in a 1968 publicationto be involved in about four hundred federal/Land committees. Much of this connection-operative effort is reflected in formal agreements, treaties and conventions;it has been estimated that between 1949 and 1960 about 340 such agreements were entered into. While the complexity of these relationships may derivein part from the federal nature of the constitution and the rigidity which thisintroduces, the West German experience gives some indication of the extentof the new administrative machinery that might be involved if a system of executive devolution were adopted in this country.867. The question arises whether the central government would need tohave its own more direct method of keeping in touch with the administrationof current policies through a system of inspection. This is a device nowextensively employed, particularly in relation to services administered by thelocal authorities. Inspection serves two purposes. Its first and main purpose isto ensure that administration is efficient and that proper standards of service are being maintained. This is partly an advisory and partly an enforcementfunction. The inspectors must therefore be responsible to the authority whichhas the power of enforcement, for example by giving directions or by interveningin some other way when things go wrong. Ministers now have these enforcementpowers and the inspectors are appointed by them. If the powers were to betransferred to regional assemblies as part of the devolution of executive responsibility, it would seem to be appropriate for inspectors to be appointedby and to report to the assemblies.868. The second purpose of inspection is to assist in bringing to light anydefects in existing policy. The inspectors are the eyes and the ears of thedepartments, and their experience can be drawn upon for the formulation ofnew policies. If, with a system of executive devolution, the departments wereto remain responsible for inspection, they would retain this valuable directsource of information, which could additionally be used to provide a check onthe proper application by the regions of central government policies. If, onthe other hand, responsibility for inspection had been transferred to the regionsas the authorities primarily responsible for the execution of policy, the centralgovernment would have to rely for information on the other, less direct, methodswe have discussed.869. It is not possible to reach any general conclusions about the employment by the central government of systems of inspection which would be applicableunder any scheme of devolution and to any devolved service. Inspection hasto be treated as an executive function which, in relation to any particular subject,has to be considered for devolution alongside all other executive functions.Whether it should appropriately remain at the centre or be transferred to the regions, or possibly be divided between the two or in some way shared would depend on the precise way in which policy-making and executive functions were being shared between the two levels of government.
scope for devolution of executive powersDepartmental functions870. We examined in Chapter 16 the suitability for devolution of all themain functions of government. The drawing up of a scheme for the devolution of executive power would involve a great deal more than the selection of subjects suitable for devolution. We have seen that for each subject all the relevant statutes and statutory instruments would have to be reviewed andamended so as to distribute powers between the Ministers and the regions.This task could be satisfactorily undertaken only by the appropriate governmentdepartments in the light of the fullest information about the working of theexisting arrangements. Consultation with local authorities and other interested bodies would be needed, and at the end of the day decisions of a politicalnature would have to be taken. We can do no more than indicate in general terms what the scope for executive devolution might be.871. Since devolution of specific functions would be at the will of parliament and subject at all times to amendment to meet changing circumstances, thereare probably very few subjects which would offer no scope at all for regionalinvolvement. But the subjects offering the greatest scope would be those wehave already indicated as being most suitable for legislative devolution, whichare most of those now devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Offices. Many ofthem concern services operated by the local authorities, and the regions couldvery largely take over from the government departments their responsibilities for day-to-day relations with the authorities. In education, for example, theymight become responsible for the general supervision of local educationauthorities, including the inspection of schools, for the grant of all approvalsof development plans and of schemes of provision for primary, secondary,further and special education and for the control of capital investment.Functions in relation to appointed bodies872. We have earlier noted that one of the most persistent complaints madeto us relates to the increase in the number of bodies appointed to execute oradvise on specialist functions and the lack of adequate democratic control oversuch bodies. These so-called ad hoc bodies were said to operate behind closeddoors and to decide matters of public importance without the restrictions thatwould be imposed by a framework of public accountability. In Wales it wassuggested that such bodies should be brought under the supervision of an elected Welsh Council, either by a complete transfer of their functions to theCouncil or by requiring them to report periodically to the Council on their work so that it could be openly discussed.873. The ad hoc bodies may be classified under five headings according totheir primary functions. There are, first, the executive bodies, providing personalor social services with funds derived mainly from the government; examples are the regional hospital boards, tourist boards and arts councils. Secondly,there are the industrial or commercial bodies such as the gas and electricity boards, deriving their revenues mainly from sales to the public. Thirdly, thereare bodies performing a mainly advisory function, such as the economic planning councils. Fourthly, there are bodies, such as rent assessment panels,which have an appellate function. And finally, in the field of the nationalised industries, there are bodies concerned with consumer protection.
874. It must be assumed that the functions given to these bodies have beenconsidered unsuitable for direct exercise either by a government department or by local authorities. There may be many reasons for this. Particularly if theoperations are commercial in character there may be advantages in hiving themoff to a single-minded corporation. The appointment of specialist bodiesenables the government to draw, often very economically, on expertise availableoutside the public services; it relieves Ministers of responsibility for the conductof day-to-day operations, which may involve the taking of decisions on techincal or cultural matters on which there is little or no scope for the exercise of politicaljudgement; and it enables people outside government with an interest in orresponsibility for the matter concerned to share in the process of decision.There are in fact several good and traditional reasons for hiving off blocks ofwork to specialised agencies; and these have been reinforced rather thanweakened by modern thinking about the proper role of the civil service.875. Specialist bodies have sometimes been preferred to local authorities on the ground that there were no local authorities operating over areas con-sidered to be appropriate for the exercise of the particular function, or becauseeither the government or the specialists concerned lacked confidence in the ability of the authorities to exercise it satisfactorily. There have been manydisputes between central and local government over this, and one of the objects of local government reform has been to strengthen local authorities so as to equip them to take over functions which are now considered to be beyond their capacity.876. The ad hoc bodies are not of course wholly free from public control.There are many ways in which they may be subjected to the will of governmentand required to account for their activities to the responsible Minister and toParliament and hence indirectly to the electorate. Members are invariablyappointed by the Minister for limited terms, so that the composition of the bodies may be changed at least at intervals and may be questioned in Parliament.In many cases the Minister has a power of direction. In the case of the national-ised industries, for example^ the responsible Minister is normally empoweredto give a board &quot;such directions of a general character as to the exercise by it of its powers as appear to the Minister to be requisite in the national interest&quot;.877. Most bodies are required to publish annual reports giving an account oftheir activities, and such reports may be the subject of debate in Parliament.If the bodies administer government funds they are usually required to submit their annual accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who examinesthem and lays them before Parliament with his report; the accounts may thenbe examined and reported upon by the appropriate Parliamentary committee.There are other possibilities of scrutiny by Parliamentary committees. Theactivities of nationalised industries, for example, have been examined in depthby the select committee established for that purpose, and those of the arts council were examined by the Estimates Committee in 1967/68. In general it isprobably true to say that Parliament either has or could obtain facilities forscrutinising and debating the work of any government-appointed body. As thenumber of such bodies is so great, problems of Parliamentary time arise; but itmight be expected that time for debate would be found in any case in whichthere was sufficient demand.
878. There is therefore a substantial degree of supervision of the work ofad hoc bodies, particularly of those with executive functions, and the descriptionsometimes applied to them as working in secret or as exercising an unlimitedcontrol over people&apos;s lives is exaggerated. Nevertheless there is substance inthe complaint that many of these bodies are remote from the public they are intended to serve; and the establishment of elected assemblies in the regions would provide an opportunity to bring the views and pressures of the electoratemore readily and more directly to bear on matters which are the concern of theexisting bodies than is possible at present.879. This would not necessarily involve the transfer to the regional assembliesof all the functions of the appointed bodies. The circumstances which led in thefirst place to hiving off a function from central or local government to a specialistbody, arising from the nature of the function and the presumed advantages tobe obtained from putting it in the hands of a single-minded specialist body,would in many cases still apply. This would generally be so in the case of bodieswith a commercial or industrial function; advisory and appellate bodies also need to be comprised of persons with knowledge and experience in the particularfield, and these may not be available in an elected assembly; and there ismuch to be said for keeping consumer protection bodies, as the watch-dogs ofthe public, independent of any arm of government. There may be exceptions inall these categories, where an elected regional assembly could itself take overthe functions of an appointed body. But it is in relation to the remainingcategory, that of executive bodies providing personal or social services financedout of public funds, that the arguments for the direct assumption of their functions by regional assemblies might be expected to be most weighty, since these are the traditional functions of government.880. Much of the local authority criticism of centralisation has been directed to the treatment of the health services. There has been a progressive removalof responsibilities from the authorities, first for hospitals and now for thecommunity health services. Under the National Health Service ReorganisationAct 1973 the National Health Service in England, together with the schoolhealth service, will be administered through a comprehensive two-tier structure of regional and area health authorities, and the local authorities will cease tohave direct responsibility for any aspect of the service. The country will be divided into fourteen regions, similar to those of the present Regional hospital boards; in each region there will be a regional health authority responsible,on behalf of the Secretary of State, for general planning, for allocating resources to the area health authorities and for co-ordinating their activities and monitor-ing their performance to ensure that national and regional objectives are achieved and that the desired standard of service is maintained. The regional health authorities, the chairmen and members of which will be appointed bythe Secretary of State for Social Services after consultation with local authorities,universities, the main health professions and other interested bodies, will themselves provide some services and will be the building authorities for allmajor projects. The area authorities will have the main operational responsi-bility. Their boundaries will be the same as those of the new counties, ordistricts in the case of the metropolitan counties, and the county or district councils will appoint some of the members. But the chairmen of the areaauthorities will be appointed by the Secretary of State and most of the othermembers will be appointed by the regional health authorities.

Two reasons have been by given successive governments for notaccepting a suggestion of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission that the national health Service might be unified within the new system of local government.The first is that the professions believe that only a service administered by special bodies on which they are represented can provide a proper assurance ofclinical freedom; and the second is that the independent financial resources available to local authorities are not sufficient to enable them to take over responsibility for the whole service.882. National Health Service reorganisation following the same general principles is being undertaken in Scotland and Wales. In each case the Secretaryof State will himself assume the functions of resource allocation, co-ordinatingand monitoring which in England will be the responsibility of regional health authorities. The Secretary of State for Scotland will be advised by a ScottishHealth Service Planning Council and the Secretary of State for Wales by broadlycomparable internal arrangements, and in each country there will be a common services organisation for such functions as major building and central supplies.883. There has been criticism also of the proposed removal from the localauthorities of most of their responsibilities for the water and sewerage services.The Water Act 1973 provides for the establishment in England of nine regionalwater authorities to take over virtually all the functions of the existing public authorities responsible for river management, water supply, sewerage andsewage disposal. The main reason advanced for the transfer of services from local authorities in this case is that the efficient area of operation is larger thanthat of a single new county. The regional boundaries will be determined byhydrological considerations and will follow natural watersheds. The chairman and some members of each authority will be appointed by the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,but a majority of members will be appointed by the local authorities within thearea. At the centre there will be a National Water Council, which will includeamong its members the chairmen of the regional water authorities. This will be mainly an advisory and consultative body, but it will also be responsible for preparing and implementing training and education schemes throughout theUnited Kingdom.884. For Wales there is to be a Welsh National Water Development Autho-rity, which, in addition to exercising some other functions, will act as the regionalwater authority for Wales. Special arrangements will be made to ensure effectiveconsultation in the case of river basins straddling the border with England.The Government have stated that they do not propose to reach a final decisionon the composition of the Authority until this Commission has reported. It isintended that the chairman should be a member of the National Water Council.In Scotland the organisation of water and sewerage will be a responsibilityof the new local authorities at regional (or island) level; in this case hydrolo-psychological  and local authority boundaries closely correspond.885. This recent history of the health and water services illustrates thedifficulties, made up of a combination of technical, financial and geographicalfactors, which have led to the removal from the local authorities of services for which they have traditionally been responsible. Whether the establishmentof regional assemblies would permit the restoration of such services to direct
government administration would depend partly on the extent to which ineach individual case these difficulties could be overcome, and partly on the weight that was attached to securing greater democratic control. There would ofcourse be alternatives to direct administration by the assemblies. Functionscould be devolved to the assemblies but exercised in whole or in part by bodiesappointed by them and subject to their directions. A statutory requirementmight be imposed on the assemblies to appoint such bodies, and the centralgovernment Minister might be given the right to appoint some of the membershimself. Or the functions could remain with central government and be exercisedas now by bodies appointed by and subject to the direction of the Ministerbut with a requirement to report to and have regard to the views of the regional assemblies. There is a whole range of possibilities, with direct assumption of functions at one extreme and a complete absence of responsibility at theother. The determination of the role to be given to regional assemblies in anyparticular case would be part of the work that would have to be undertakenof reviewing all the executive functions of central government with a view todeciding which of them could appropriately be devolved to the regions.886. The outcome would depend very largely on the general form and thespirit in which executive devolution was applied. If the measure of devolutionwere to be relatively weak, with much detailed control over policy in all mattersremaining at the centre, it might be decided in relation to functions now devolvedto ad hoc bodies that the importance of keeping them in the hands of specialistbodies, and the need for strong central direction in the national interest, were such that any devolution to the regions would have to be on a very limited scale. But, if a more robust attitude were to be adopted, and the policy were tobe for Parliament to legislate only in broad outline, leaving the regions to fill in as much as possible of the detail, the assemblies might be given very much wider powers in relation to the functions of the ad hoc bodies. They mightthemselves assume the functions of virtually all such bodies, except those ofa commercial or industrial character, thus greatly increasing the element of democratic control. They might even have devolved to them powers in the relevant fields extending a good deal further than those now devolved to theexisting bodies.Agency functions887. Under the arrangements we have been considering, within the limits ofthe powers conferred upon them the assemblies and not Ministers of thecentral government would be responsible for the devolved functions. Forsome other functions, of a kind not suitable to be devolved in this way but nevertheless having to be administered from regional and local offices, the regions might be given responsibility on an agency basis. The services concerned would remain under central government control, with not only the generalpolicy but its detailed application and casework remaining the responsibilityof the appropriate department of central government; but the regional andlocal offices would be provided by and manned by officials of the regional governments, who would operate the services as agents of the department.The department would meet the costs, issue detailed rules and operatinginstructions and be responsible, perhaps through its own regional officials, forany policy questions which arose. The United Kingdom Minister would remain
responsible to Parliament for the operation of the service as well as for generalpolicy, and the responsibilities of the regional assemblies would be limitedto the provision of staff, premises and equipment.888. There are precedents for conferring agency functions on subordinateassemblies in this way. Local authorities perform certain functions now asagents of the government departments; examples are the building of someroads and the issue of some licences. The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agri-culture acts as agent of the Whitehall Ministry in the administration of agricul-tural price support measures; for this work officials of the Northern IrelandMinistry are responsible not to their own Minister but to the Minister of Agri-culture, Fisheries and Food in London, on whose Vote the cost of the services is borne. In West Germany also some federal laws are administered by theLander as agents of the federal government.889. There might not be many services for which an agency arrangement would be found appropriate. Since responsibility for the service would remain with the central department, for the purpose of bringing government nearer to the people directly affected the arrangement would have little advantage over the existing arrangement whereby departments of the central governmentoperate from their own regional and local offices, as, for example, in the admini-stration of the social security and employment services. The regional assembly and government would have only a limited responsibility for the efficientconduct of the services provided by their own officials, and there would be a risk of conflict and confusion about the precise extent of that responsibility.If the use of regional officials as agents of the departments of central govern-ment were to be recognised as a significant feature of a scheme of regionaldevolution, the central government might tend to favour it in preference to a real devolution of functions, and little impact would then be made on theproblem of over-centralisation.890. Nevertheless there may be services in which an agency arrangement would be useful. This could be particularly so when regional and local staffs of a government department were engaged on work closely related to matters which were the responsibility of the regional government, involving perhapscontacts with the same sections of the public and the application of a similarrange of knowledge and experience. The work of officials of the NorthernIreland Ministry of Agriculture provides a good example. In administeringagricultural price support measures on behalf of the Whitehall department theyare able to apply local knowledge and experience gained in the administrationof the services to agriculture for which their own Minister is responsible; theduplication of offices, staff and equipment that would be needed if the WhitehallMinistry were to operate its own services directly would obviously be wasteful.Supplementary functions891. Regional assemblies would have functions specifically conferred upon them in relation to individual matters, either directly by Act of Parliament or indirectly by statutory instrument or by Ministerial action. Those functionscould be added to or amended at any time by the same means. It would beopen to the regions to seek an extension or variation of their functions by making representations to the United Kingdom Government or to Members of
Parliament. The question arises whether there should be any more formalmethod by which they could seek to widen their functions. Under Section 111of the Local Government Act 1972 local authorities in England and wales will have power, subject to certain conditions, to do anything which is calculated to facilitate or is conducive or incidental to the discharge of any of their functions; and under Section 137 of the Act they may, again subject to certain conditions, incur any expenditure which in their opinion is in the interests oftheir area or any part of it or of all or some of its inhabitants. Local authoritiescan also seek to extend their functions by themselves promoting legislation inParliament. It would be appropriate for regional assemblies to have powers of asimilar kind.Finance892. From the point of view of finance executive devolution differs fromlegislative devolution in two important respects. The regional assemblies wouldbe less concerned with the making of policy, and their responsibilities wouldbe less precise and much more subject to change as functions were passeddown and taken up by the central government according to the political andadministrative dictates of the day.893. We have to consider whether these differences are such as to render the kind of financial arrangement envisaged for legislative devolution (somethingalong the lines of the maximum established in Chapter 15) inappropriate forexecutive devolution. Under the maximum arrangement a region&apos;s revenuecould be made up in several different ways, depending mainly on the relative importance attached to grants and taxes, and the total amount which it wouldbe free to spend would be fixed on the recommendation of an independentexchequer board and substantially assured for several years ahead; within thattotal it would be able to allocate funds between services and within servicesvirtually at will. But in a scheme of executive devolution the allocation of funds between and often within services would be subject to the policy decisionsof the central government. The scope for regional discretion would be restrictedand subject to frequent change. Since a new government might be returned to westminster at any time, intent perhaps on changing existing priorities in the devolved services, or even wishing to reassume control of some of them itself,it might not be possible to guarantee the regions an assured level of expenditure for several years ahead.894. Whether, for these reasons, an executive assembly would have to function with financial power less than the maximum would depend a greatdeal on how closely the central government chose to define national policy inthe regional services. If this were done in detail the region&apos;s income might be largely pre-empted, leaving it with little real financial discretion. If, on the otherhand, national policies were laid down only in general terms, allowing for considerable regional variations in content and timing, the assembly&apos;s respon-sibility for allocating expenditure could be a very important one. It is impossibleto be sure in advance how the system would work out in practice. If it were tobe operated by the central government in a spirit of apprehension about theeffects of regional discretion, the regional assemblies might be little more thanfinancial agents; but if the will for devolution were strong, and the centralgovernment were anxious to increase regional responsibilities to the maximum,
the regional assemblies might in practice acquire a substantial share in policymaking that would need to be accompanied by a wide measure of discretion inallocating expenditure.895. There are therefore two possible approaches to the question of thefinancial arrangements that would be appropriate for a system of executivedevolution, and which of these two approaches is adopted depends essentiallyon the view that is taken of how the system would work out in practice. on one view it would lead to a great deal of freedom for the regional assemblies,the central government concerning itself with the allocation of expenditure onlyin a very broad way. The assemblies might then need the maximum range offinancial powers already described. On the other view, with the central govern-ment still in control of legislation and politically accountable for the devolved services, the regional assemblies&apos; influence on policy would be limited andvariable and their powers of allocating expenditure, however unfettered in theory, would in practice be much circumscribed. It would then be inappropriate for them to have maximum financial powers, the possession of which mighttempt them to try to usurp the central governmenfs policy-making function.While they might still draw up their own budgets and work mainly on a block grant, it would be inadvisable for them to have independent regional taxes and it would have to be accepted that most of their money would be spent inways intended by the central government, with only a small margin of expendi-ture (say 5 per cent.) available for objects completely of their own choosing.This would be in line with the suggestion about marginal expenditure made inparagraph 614.regional institutions of governmentThe regional assembly896. We have so far been concerned with the powers that it would be appro-priate to devolve to regions under a system of executive devolution. We nowconsider the nature of the institutions of government which would exercisethose powers. For legislative devolution we envisaged the setting up in the regions of single-chamber assemblies of about a hundred members elected fora fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of propor-tional representation. The same arrangements would be appropriate for the lesser form of devolution we are now considering, though there might not bea requirement for so large an assembly.Executive authority897. For legislative devolution we suggested that executive authority in the regions would best remain vested, as in central government, with Your majesty and be exercised by Ministers appointed by or on behalf of Your Majesty.We noted that a possible alternative would be to place the executive powers ofgovernment directly in the hands of the assembly itself, but considered thatthis would not be appropriate for an assembly with legislative powers. There is,however, more to be said in its favour when the powers being devolved are ofan executive character.898. We have in mind an arrangement very similar to that which applies in local government. There, executive authority rests in the first place with thelocal council, and is delegated by the council to a series of committees, some of
which are required by statute. The comrnittees of the council reflect the composition of the council itself, and where there is a clear division into partiesthis may be reproduced in the committees, so that the party that has a majority in the council has a majority also in each committee and provides the chairmanof the committee. The chairman of an important committee of a large council may enjoy a significant degree of de facto authority, and may come in practice to be regarded by the chief officer of the service concerned as his immediatesuperior. But it is the committee, not the chairman, that carries the executive authority and responsibility delegated from the council, and even in the mostpolitically active councils the minority members of the committees are entitledto be given the fullest information and to have access to departmental officials.899. If this system were to be applied in the regions there might be inaddition to the functional committees a policy committee consisting of the chairmen of the main functional committees, with the leader of the assemblyas chairman. This committee would not have functions delegated to it by theassembly, but would provide a forum for the discussion and co-ordination of policies over the whole field of regional government. It would thus be in effect a regional Cabinet of members of the majority party.900. One of the criticisms most frequently made of our Parliamentary system is that the back-bench Member has little influence on policy. His role, however,in securing by his vote the acceptance or rejection of the governments policiesas reflected in the legislation placed before Parliament has an importance whichis sometimes underestimated. The member of a regional legislative assembly would play a similar part in the determination of regional policy. But if theassembly had only subordinate policy-making powers and executive authoritywere vested in regional Ministers, other members of the assembly would have little direct responsibility for and little influence on the way in which the regionalservices were being administered, and members of a party which was alwaysin a minority in the assembly would have no prospect of ever reaching a positionof authority. If, on the other hand, executive authority were to be vested in theassembly itself, all members, including members of the minority parties, wouldhave the opportunity, through their work in the assembly and its committees,to play a significant part in regional government.901. We are aware that the exercise of executive authority by committeeshas disadvantages. While it permits members of the minority parties to partici-pate in government, in a matter on which there is a division on party linesthe majority party will always get its own way, though often only at the expenseof some delay. Even routine departmental business which may not becontentious has to be conducted with a greater degree of formality, and someslowing down of the administrative processes is inevitable. These disadvantageshave to be weighed against the benefits to be expected from permitting allassembly members to take part in making decisions. In the case of legislative devolution we think the balance of advantage is against the committee system,and we prefer the Ministerial system as being likely to produce governmentsbetter able to act decisively and speedily when the occasion demands. with executive devolution, however, where the assembly had no responsibility for major policy or legislation, this factor would be of less importance. The com-mittee system would offer scope for genuine participation by all members ofthe assembly, and we believe that any consequential slowing down of the
administrative processes would be found acceptable. The alternative ofconferring executive authority on Ministers would leave all other members with little to do. We therefore regard the committee system as preferable.The civil service902. Each regional assembly, with its own power base, would require itsown separate civil service. But, as with local government, where there is nationaluniformity in grades and salaries, there should be opportunity to move fromone region to another, the onus being on the individual to shape his own careerby seeking different posts in different authorities at appropriate times. Indeed,we would see advantage in an arrangement which made it possible for officials to move in this way between the three main levels of government central,regional and local thus helping to provide more experienced and thereforemore responsive administration than might otherwise be possible. Even so,with executive devolution applied to the regions of England as well as to scotland and Wales, there would be several separate civil services in the placeof the present unified service, and some reduction in efficiency and in the standards of service provided could hardly be avoided.implications for central governmentParliament903. As in legislative devolution the implications for the centre would depend very much on whether devolution were to be extended to all or onlyselected regions of the United Kingdom. If the latter, there would be littlereduction in the demands on Parliamentary time. Indeed the task of parliament would be made more difficult, since Bills would have to be drafted in one wayto apply to regions which had devolved powers and in another way to thosewhich did not. If, on the other hand, all regions had devolved powers the saving on Parliamentary time would depend entirely on the extent of thediscretionary powers Parliament was prepared to confer.904. For those regions with devolved powers the burden on the individual member of Parliament would be greatly eased. For much of the case-workwhich now concerns him, his constituents would have to look instead to theirrepresentatives in the regional assembly for assistance. In a matter for whichexecutive responsibility had been transferred to the region, the United kingdom minister would have no responsibility for the regional administration and could not be questioned on it in Parliament. Individual Members would,therefore, as with legislative devolution, have more time to give to the develop-ment of policy, and they might indeed be expected to demand to be drawn more closely than at present into the policy-making processes.905. In the last chapter we examined the case for reducing the representationof Scotland and Wales in the House of Commons if they were given legislativeassemblies of their own and Parliament remained responsible for all Englishlegislation. This question does not arise under executive devolution, sinceParliament would continue to legislate for all regions.Ministers and their departments906. If executive devolution were to be applied to Scotland and Wales butnot the regions of England, the Whitehall departments would remain relatively
unaffected. But the Scottish and Welsh Offices would lose large blocks of executive work to the Scottish and Welsh assemblies. There would remain tobe performed at the centre the policy-making functions, the executive functionsnot devolved and the non-executive oversight functions of those departments.To these would be added the new function of maintaining relations with theassemblies and keeping a watch on the working of the devolution machinery.Would separate Scottish and Welsh Offices, each with its own Secretary ofState, be needed for these purposes ?907. In the case of legislative devolution we were of the opinion that, as there would be insufficient work for them to do and as their appointmentwould detract from the status of the heads of the Scottish and Welsh Govern-ments as spokesmen for their people, the retention of the separate Secretaries ofState would be difficult to justify. We noted as possible solutions the transferof the residual functions in each case to a Minister with other responsibilitiesor the transfer of the functions of both offices to a single Minister. With devolution-tion of executive powers only, there would be stronger grounds for the retentionof the separate offices of Secretary of State. This would be so particularly inScotland, because many of the functions devolved would continue to be thesubject of separate Scottish policies and legislation. It is difficult to judge whether the Secretary of State in either Scotland or Wales would be fully employed in the duties remaining to him, but it is possible that he would, atleast in the first instance and until the system had had time to settle down.If this proved not to be so, one of the possibilities noted for legislative devolutioncould be adopted. The office of Secretary of State could in each case be combined with some other office, thus allowing in effect retention of the separate scottish and Welsh Offices and individual representation of Scotland andWales in the Cabinet; or responsibility for both Scotland and Wales could beentrusted to the same Minister.908. If executive devolution were to be extended to the regions of Englandas well as to Scotland and Wales, there might, depending upon the extent ofthe powers devolved, be a great reduction in the volume of work in the depart-ments of central government responsible for the devolved subjects. Thedepartments might lose to the regions many of their administrative functions,including control over the local authorities, and the staffs, most of whom arealready stationed in the regions, engaged upon them. The functions remainingto the departments, which would relate mainly to the formulation of policy,would require relatively small staffs, nearly all of them at the departmentalheadquarters. We have already, in paragraphs 864 to 869, examined thedifficulties with which the departments might be confronted through lack of direct experience of the operation of existing policies. There would, however,be some compensating advantages. Ministers, both individually and collectively,would have more time for the consideration of policy questions, and would beable more effectively to control the work of their departments, thus allowing the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility to become more of a reality than it isat present.909. One Minister would have to be given a general responsibility for regionaldevolution, including relations with the regional institutions of government,
much as the Secretary of State for the Environment now has a general responsi-bility for local government in England, with other functional Ministers andtheir departments maintaining their own direct contacts with the localauthorities.910. Where would Scotland and Wales fit into this picture? In a situation ofgeneral devolution, which department would be responsible for Scottish and welsh policies on matters such as the organisation of local government,housing, town and country planning and education, for which executive powers had been devolved? One possibility would be for the Department of the environment and the Department of Education and Science, as the functionaldepartments concerned, to assume these responsibilities. But while there wouldbe some logic in this in a&quot; scheme of general devolution, it is difficult to believethat the Scots and the Welsh would not regard it as a retrograde step. Thealternative would be to retain the separate Scottish and Welsh Offices exercising their residual functions, with Ministerial arrangements similar to those suggestedin the case of devolution to Scotland and Wales only.The civil service911. We considered in paragraphs 806-807 the implications of legislative devolution for the central civil service. Similar considerations would apply with devolution of executive powers, though the changes would be much lessmarked. The service would be reduced in numbers and changed in character;as we have already noted, transfers between it and the regional services wouldbe desirable. There would inevitably be an increase in the total number of officials since losses at the centre would be more than made up by gains in the regions.combined legislative and executive devolution912. Legislative devolution as described in Chapter 17 and executivedevolution as described in this chapter could of course be combined, with a regional assembly having devolved to it full responsibility for policy and legislation in some matters and responsibility for subordinate policy and executive action only in others. We have given our reasons for thinking that under a scheme of legislative devolution Parliament should not use its supreme authority to legislate on a transferred matter without agreement other than inthe most exceptional circumstances; it would nevertheless be possible under such a scheme to devolve a limited range of functions on matters which werenot so transferred. Thus, for example, education might be a wholly transferredmatter, while in relation to agriculture Parliament continued to legislate forthe region, devolving to it prescribed functions only. There could be many different combinations. If the emphasis were to be placed on legislative devolution-tion, with many matters being wholly transferred, the regional assembly would act primarily as a legislative assembly, and there would be a good case for placing the executive authority in the hands of regional Ministers, as we havesuggested for legislative devolution. If, on the other hand, the wholly transferredmatters were to constitute a not very significant part of its functions, theassembly might more effectively operate under the committee system we havesuggested for executive devolution. The choice between the Ministerial and committee systems would depend on the balance of legislative and executive functions.
913. It has seemed to us that there are two different sets of circumstances in which combined legislative and executive devolution might be considered.The first would be where legislative devolution was being conferred on a fairlynarrow front, consisting of those matters only in which substantial differences in law and policy in the various regions could be expected. In all other matters,for which more or less uniform legislation would be required, Parliament would continue to legislate for the regions, devolving specific functions only wherethere appeared to be genuine scope for regional variations in policy and procedures and advantage in providing regional rather than central administra-tion. The arguments for confining legislative devolution in this way are that itwould be wasteful of time and effort, and likely to lead to frustration, to confer on a regional legislature powers in a long list of subjects where the result would almost inevitably be the passing of laws very similar to those in force elsewhere;and that it would be wrong to lead people to believe that they could enjoya large measure of freedom to adopt their own distinctive regional policies when in practice no such possibility existed.914. A combined scheme might also be considered in circumstances inwhich legislative and executive devolution were being applied in differentregions. Scotland and Wales, for example, might have legislative devolution,while the regions of England had executive devolution. Since the scope for thelatter may extend to matters not suitable for full legislative devolution, and since it would be out of the question to devolve functions to the English regionsbut not to Scotland and Wales, the maximum application of executive devolutionin England would require a mixture of legislative and executive devolution inScotland and Wales.summary915. In this chapter we have examined a form of devolution in which theUnited Kingdom Parliament and Government would in all matters retainresponsibility for the determination of major policy and for the general legisla-tion needed to give effect to it, and the regions would in selected matters beresponsible within the framework of that general legislation for devisingspecific policies for their regions and for their execution. We have seen that theline between functions which would be appropriate to the centre and thosewhich would be appropriate to the regions cannot be drawn with precision bythe application of any principles or rules. In each subject the extent of thepowers to be retained at the centre would be a matter for political decision.The individual statutes conferring on Ministers powers of subordinate legislation and executive powers of one kind or another would have to be reviewed andamended so as to transfer the powers to the regions instead where this wasconsidered to be appropriate. In the case of some statutes more extensiveamendment might be needed to effect the desired division of functions between ministers and the regions. The subjects which have been administrativelydevolved to the Scottish and Welsh Offices would offer the greatest scope forthe devolution of executive powers, but some more limited devolution wouldbe possible in other fields.916. We are satisfied that there would be no insuperable technical difficultiesin the way of prescribing the division of functions. The successful working ofsuch a scheme of devolution would depend upon the solution of two problems.
The first is that of preventing encroachment by the central government on thepreserves of the regions, and the second that of ensuring that the regions intheir executive actions did in fact give effect to central government policies.While we have suggested ways in which these problems might be tackled, theconclusion we have reached is that a scheme of executive devolution would beviable only so long as there continued to be, both at the centre and in the regions, a genuine desire to maintain a reasonable division of functions and a readiness on the part of each to co-operate with and respect the interests ofthe other.917. We have suggested that the regional institutions of government mightbe similar to those required for legislative devolution, with the importantexception that executive authority would appropriately be vested in the regionalassembly itself and be delegated to committees representative of the assemblyas a whole, as is done in local authorities. Co-ordination of regional policy might be the responsibility of a policy committee, consisting of the chairmen of the main functional committees, with the leader of the majority party inthe assembly as chairman.918. Devolution of executive powers would offer a number of advantagesover the present system, some of which we have already noted. It would transferadministration and executive decision, which many people believe to be of greater value to the regions than policy making, to persons having more detailed knowledge of the issues involved and able to devote more time and attention to them than Ministers and officials of departments in London.It would permit regional variation of policy, within broad limits laid down atthe centre, to be made in accordance with regional preferences. It would introduce a greater element of democratic accountability into the administra-tion of the devolved services. Many decisions of regional concern now takenby Ministers, to which effect is given by statutory instrument or by executive action receiving little Parliamentary attention, and others taken by bodiesappointed by Ministers, would instead be taken by persons directly answerable to the electorate in the region. Devolution of executive powers applied through-out Great Britain would also reduce the burden on Westminster and Whitehall,and so allow Ministers and Members of Parliament to devote more time to the formulation of policy, a matter of particular importance following entry intothe European Communities; though it should be noted that the relief to bothwould not be as great as would result from legislative devolution, and would in either case be marginal unless devolution were to be extended to all parts ofthe United Kingdom.919. On the other hand, there would be certain disadvantages. The divorceof policy making from execution would leave the central government withoutdirect experience of the practical working of existing policies and so less well-equipped to promote new policy. An immense amount of work would be invol-ved in the determination of functions suitable for transfer to the regions and In response-writing a large part of the statute law, though devolution could be a gradualprocess, spread perhaps over a period of years. There could be no assurance thatthe central government and Parliament would agree to accept and maintain a division of powers that would give the regions sufficient discretion to makea devolutionary scheme viable or that the regions would properly implement
the policies laid down at the centre. Since many of the matters suitable for devo-lution are those in which local authorities already have executive functions,there would almost certainly have to be some change in those functions;whatever change was made, there would be a risk of the regional assembliesbeing left, squeezed between central and local government and without controlover the main matters affecting the regions&apos; prosperity, with inadequate powersto make service with them attractive. In these circumstances the assemblies,which would still appear to people in most parts of the country to be remotebodies, might be tempted to try to usurp the functions of both central andlocal government, and might as a result have uneasy relations with both.
REGIONAL COUNCILS920. In the last two chapters we have discussed forms of devolution involving the creation in the regions of directly elected assemblies with legislative orexecutive powers derived from the centre. We now consider representativeregional bodies, perhaps differently constituted, which would have few if anysuch powers, but which would stand in a consultative and advisory relationship to the centre and might also exercise responsibilities, largely of a co-ordinatingcharacter, in the local government field. We shall refer to these bodies as&quot;regional councils&quot;, so distinguishing them from regional assemblies withlegislative and executive functions.921. Various proposals have been put forward for a body at regional level which would have the right to scrutinise, debate and make representationsabout central policy and administration. It would act as the voice of the region(or, in Scotland and Wales, the voice of the nation), its essential task being to persuade the central government to take such measures as were considered to be in the interests of the region. It might also have close connexions with local government; suggestions have been made that a regional body of thiskind might have limited powers to carry out development schemes, but its main task in relation to local authorities has been seen as one of co-ordination.922. There are already in existence bodies which perform some of these functions. It is part of the task of the regional economic planning councils to examine and to advise the central government on the economic and socialneeds of their regions. In the local government sphere there are standingconferences of local planning authorities and other bodies which exerciseco-ordinating functions. Nevertheless it is widely felt that the remits of such bodies are too restricted, and that a gap exists between central and local govern-ment which needs to be filled by a body constituted on a different basis andwith a wider range of functions.923. Proposals for the setting up of a Scottish assembly with consultativeand deliberative functions were contained in a report made in 1970 by aCommittee appointed by the Leader of the Conservative Party. The assembly would also be given some powers in relation to Parliamentary legislationaffecting Scotland; for this reason we have found it convenient to set out our views on the Committee&apos;s proposals separately, and we do this in the chapterwhich follows. We have, however, in this chapter taken into account the Commit-tee&apos;s observations on the need in Scotland for a body with functions of thekind we are here considering and of the particular proposals made.924. Much of the public discussion on schemes for a regional co-ordinatingcouncil has centred on proposals made in the report of the Redcliffe-MaudCommission2. In this chapter we start by summarising those proposals, the reaction of our witnesses to them and the variations that they proposed.1 Scotland^ Government: The Report of the Scottish Constitutional Committee, 1970(Chairman: Sir Alec Douglas-Home), Scottish Constitutional Committee, Edinburgh.2 Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England (Chairman:Lord Redcliffe-Maud) (Cmnd. 4040).
We then go on to examine more generally the functions which might be conferred on regional councils and how the councils might appropriately be constituted.the concept of a provincial council the Redcliffe-Maud proposals925. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission set out in Chapter X of its reportthe model of a provincial council which it considered should form part of the reorganised structure of local government in England. Describing the needfor such councils, the report had earlier stated (paragraph 283):&quot;We found persuasive the arguments in the evidence that favoured aprovincial planning body. Our own investigations convinced us that someof the problems now facing local government already run wider thanthe limits of any unit appropriate for the operation of services. As popu-lation, mobility and the involvement of local government in economic questions increase, there will be growing need for a representative bodycapable of devising a strategy for the future development of a very large area. Provincial councils are required which can settle the broad economicland use and investment framework for the planning and developmentpolicies of operational authorities. They should be rooted in local govern-ment and should work in closest touch with central government. Theywould replace the present regional economic planning council.&quot;926. As we noted in Chapter 7 the Commission considered that the eightregions into which England had been divided for the purposes of economic planning provided areas of suitable size for the functions of provincial councils and roughly reflected such sense of provincial identity as existed. For thepresent purpose we make no distinction between the terms regional and provin-cial. Though we have generally preferred the term regional, when discussing the proposals in the Redcliffe-Maud report we have retained the term provincialwhich is there used.927. Successive governments have decided that it would be premature toreach conclusions on the question of a regional tier until this commission has reported. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission also made the point (paragraph439) that: &quot;Whether provincial councils should be called upon to assumefunctions now concentrated in an overworked system of central government must be left to the Commission on the Constitution to consider&quot;. It has thereforefallen to us to examine the possibilities of a body of this kind within the wholeconstitutional context.928. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission saw it as the main function of theprovincial council &quot;to make and keep continually up to date a strategic plan for the future development of its province&quot;. The plan, once approved by theMinister, would be binding on local authorities, who would not submit theirown structure plans for Ministerial approval until they had been examined by the provincial council for consistency with each other and with the provincialplan.929. The provincial council would also have limited powers of physicaldevelopment. These would include a reserve power to undertake developmentnecessary for the success of the provincial plan in the event of a local authority&apos;s
failure to do so and, possibly, the power to carry out large projects, such as abarrage or an opera house, of benefit to the whole province or to a number of authorities within it. Otherwise the councils functions would be of a broadplanning, co-ordinating or advisory character, including the assessment of provincial priorities in further education, the broad planning of specialisteducation, cultural and recreational services and tourism, advice to the centralgovernment on provincial needs and aspirations and the co-ordination of statistical and economic information. The council would replace the existingregional economic planning council and might also, it was thought, make it unnecessary for the government to establish new nominated bodies in the region.930. The Commission proposed that the members of the provincial councils should be drawn mainly from local authority councillors, but that up to a quarter of them might be people co-opted from outside local government.The number of members would range from nineteen in the smallest council to108 in the largest. Additional members would be brought in to serve on com-mittees and panels. Each council would have its own staff, some of whom couldbe seconded from central and local government for tours of duty.931. In carrying out its functions the provincial council would work closely with local authorities and other bodies in the region and with central govern-ment. It would on the one hand consult local bodies about its provincialplanning tasks and on the other hand be consulted by the central government about planning and public investment in the province. It would be able toapply influence in both directions and keep under surveillance the amount and allocation of public expenditure in its area. It would fill an important role in debating such questions in a representative assembly in public.932. It was proposed that the (mainly administrative) costs of the provincialcouncil should be met from precepts on the local authorities, and that thecouncil might have power to give financial assistance to projects benefitingmore than one local authority, particularly where there was a need to getsuch projects started without delay.Reactions to the Redcliffe-Maud proposals933. The proposals were specifically related to England and to the system ofreorganised local government which the Redcliffe-Maud Commission recom-mended, and it was primarily in that context that they were commented upon by our witnesses. In the evidence we received from representatives of localauthorities and from the economic planning councils and other regional bodies,the clear balance of opinion was in favour of setting up councils at the regional level. There were widely differing views about the functions the councils should exercise. A large number of witnesses thought that such councils should belimited to an advisory and co-ordinating role, but almost as many consideredthat they should be armed with greater executive powers than had been proposedby the Commission. Others felt that the Commissions specifications were aboutright.934. Suggestions for conferring greater executive powers on the councilsthan the Redcliffe-Maud report proposed took four main forms. First, it was argued that a council should have authority to determine the priorities of
public expenditure within its region. This might be done in one of two ways.Within separate allocations made to the region by the central government forschools, roads and other services, the council might be left to decide the prioritieswithin each service. Thus, taking into account the needs of the region as awhole, the council might, for example, settle which schools or which roadsshould be built first, or whether priority should be given to the improvementof existing schools or to the construction of new ones. Alternatively, within atotal government allocation for a wide range of services, the council might begiven authority to determine also the total amounts to be spent on each service.On this basis the council would be able to decide not only the programmepriorities within each service but also, for example, whether more should be spent on schools and less on roads. Many of our witnesses considered that such powers of determination could appropriately be exercised by a regional council,which would be well-placed to understand and reflect the special needs and aspirations of its region.935. Secondly, it was suggested that a regional council should take over from local government the responsibility for some functions which could better be administered over the wider regional area. It was said that this would both make for greater economy and efficiency of operation and give the council a sub-stantial administrative role. It was strongly argued by other witnesses, however,that it would be intolerable to deprive local government of functions when for greater efficiency it was being reorganised into larger and more powerful units.This would amount, it was said, to a complete reversal of the stated policy of successive governments.936. Thirdly, it was suggested that, in relation to matters which transcendthe boundaries of individual local authorities, a regional council should notonly have co-ordinating and broad planning powers which were in essenceadvisory, but should also be given the statutory power to impose its will on local authorities. Thus the council, in addition to drawing up, in consultationwith local authorities, plans for the regional development of cultural and recreational facilities and certain forms of educational and social provision,would be able to give directions to the authorities and if necessary exercisedefault powers to secure the fulfilment of those plans. Similarly it was suggestedthat the power to give final approval to the structure plans and certain bye-laws and land transactions of local authorities might be transferred from the centralgovernment to regional councils.937. Fourthly, it was represented from many quarters, and particularly from Wales, that a regional council might take over or oversee the work of specialised government-appointed bodies operating within the region. Thegrounds on which this proposal was based have already been set out in thepreceding chapter. It was a widely held opinion that ad hoc bodies should bemade in some way accountable to people living in the regions.938. Those who considered that a regional council should have more extensiveexecutive powers than had been proposed by the Redcliffe-Maud commission were generally of the view that at least some of the members should be directly elected. Others preferred indirect election by the local authorities in the region,or a mixture of indirect election and nomination by the central government.
functions of the regional council939. In the remainder of this chapter we consider what functions might usefully be exercised by a representative regional council without legislative orexecutive powers devolved from central government, and how such a council might appropriately be constituted. We start with functions, and examine thisquestion in terms of the council&apos;s relationship with the central government,local government and other public bodies respectively. On the one hand, thecouncil is not to assume any substantial powers of the central government;on the other hand, reorganised local government cannot be expected to faceanother upheaval and a whittling down of its powers by the loss of importantresponsibilities to a regional authority, at least until it has been given a chance to show how well it can operate after reorganisation. One question to beconsidered, therefore, is whether enough middle ground exists to provide asatisfactory base for the operations of a council at the regional level.Relations with the central government940. The regional council would be responsible for advising and making representations to the central government about government policies and theexercise of government authority generally in the region. For this purpose itwould need to receive information about the operation of existing policies in the region and any proposals for new policies likely to have regional implications-tions. This would impose on central government a dual requirement, first, tohave greater regard to the needs of individual regions in formulating its policies and to work out the regional implications of those policies, and, secondly, tobring the regional councils into consultation at appropriate stages.941. The precise arrangements to be made for consultation between centralgovernment and the regional councils would depend on the nature of the regional machinery of central government itself, a matter which we consider in chapter 21. Consultation could be most simply and effectively undertakenif substantial government authority had been delegated to offices in the region and if the region had its own Minister. This is the position at present in Scotlandand Wales, where Secretaries of State with their own departments have wide-ranging powers exercised on a territorial basis. The Secretaries of State are directly responsible for some services, while for others, which remain theresponsibility of United Kingdom departments, they exercise an oversightfunction. If regional councils were to be set up in Scotland and Wales, therefore,it would be primarily, though perhaps not exclusively, to the Scottish and welsh Offices and their Ministers that the councils would look for information and make their representations. The councils, or perhaps committees of the council&apos;s, might be given some clearly defined powers to call for information from those departments and to question officials about the administration of current policies. Ministers of the departments might on invitation attend and take part in the councils&apos; debates; they would not be accountable to the councils,but attendance at meetings would provide them with an opportunity to explaintheir policies as well as to receive advice.942. Where, as at present in the English regions, administrative decentralisation-tion is less well-developed and there are no regional Ministers, some differentarrangements would be needed. While regional councils would look mainly
to the department with general responsibility for regional affairs, they would to a large extent have to deal directly with the other departments responsiblefor services of regional concern. They might have some limited powers to call for information from departments and to question officials, but there wouldprobably be less scope for this, and for the attendance of Ministers at their meetings, than in regions with a higher degree of delegated authority and ministers of their own.943. Regional councils would have little value if central government werenot in practice to consult them on all proper occasions. One of the principlesof constitutional reform which we stated in Chapter 11 was openness ofgovernment. There is a developing climate of opinion in favour of this, andin recent years successive governments have made some small but significantmoves in the direction of encouraging increased public participation in the processes of government. It has become, for instance, an established practice to issue Green Papers in which policy options are set out for public discussion.It is reasonable to expect further development along these lines. If regionalcouncils were to be established, it would be desirable for the central government,as a general practice, to ask itself at an early stage in policy making whether there were important implications for the regions and, if so, whether a documentshould be published setting out the issues for consideration by regional councils and other bodies before decisions were reached. There would need to be apresumption in favour of publication except where this would clearly be inappropriate, and it would be one of the responsibilities of Ministers concernedwith the regions to keep a close watch on the progress of consultation of thiskind.944. The value of the councils as sounding boards for their regions would depend largely on the willingness of the government to use them for thispurpose. We do not think, however, that it would be practicable to define thecircumstances in which regional councils ought to be brought into consultation in such a way as to confer upon the councils an enforceable right to be consulted.It would be for the government to decide whether a particular matter was onewhich ought properly to be referred to the councils and at What point in time this should be done.945. One of the factors which might inhibit consultation would be confidential -tiality of information. Open government, no matter how far it is carried, doesnot, as was pointed out by a committee1 which reported in September 1972,mean that all information in the possession of government and all the workingsof government should be laid bare. In certain circumstances information onwhich policies are based, and which is essential for a proper appreciation of the policies, cannot be disclosed, or at least cannot be disclosed until decisionsbased upon it have been taken.946. The problem of confidentiality has arisen in the governments dealings with the regional economic planning councils. A major function of thesecouncils is to give advice on questions referred to them by Ministers, and themembers are all appointed by Ministers. Some confidential information, relatingfor example to public expenditure programmes, impending industrial changes1 Departmental Committee on Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 (Chairman:Lord Franks) (Cmnd. 5104).
and other matters having a bearing on economic planning and employmentin the region, is given to the councils on the understanding that it will bediscussed in private with a view to making the advice of the councils known in confidence to the government.947. There could be some scope for the conduct of business on a confidentialbasis in regional councils or their committees. But this might not be an appro-priate function for the councils, since the whole basis on which they would be designed to operate would be one of open discussion. If private proceedings were to become the common practice in an important area of their responsi-bility, the councils would be given a different character from that which was intended and would be less likely to enjoy public confidence. Ministers wouldin any event be less ready to give confidential information to persons who werenot, like the members of the existing economic planning councils, their ownnominees, though it is worth noting in this connexion that many of theeconomic planning council members we consulted doubted whether much ofthe information given to them in confidence needed to be so classified, and someat least were inclined to think that little of value would be lost if they received no such information.948. We have considered whether, as was suggested to us by several witnesses,regional councils of the kind we are here considering might be given somepowers to determine the priorities of government expenditure within theirregion. This would add to their status, and they could be expected to bring tothe task a special knowledge of the region and its needs. But the determination of public expenditure priorities is an essential adjunct of policy making, andwe do not think that it could appropriately be devolved to bodies whoseprimary functions would be to debate, advise and co-ordinate. It would,however, be possible for regional councils to be brought into consultation onthe amount and distribution of public expenditure in their regions and for appropriate weight to be given in the ordering of that expenditure to the viewsthey expressed. We discuss in paragraphs 1070-1072 the preparation of regionalstatistics and forecasts.949. Differing views may be held on the likely value of a regional council with these limited functions in relation to central government. It can be dismissedas constituting little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot;, operating ineffectively on the side-lines while all the essential powers of decision remain at the centre. But,on another view, the right to probe and discuss the policies and actions of thecentral government and to act as a public pressure group for the region is notto be lightly discounted. The public airing of views is an essential feature of ourdemocratic processes. In Wales in particular, there is a strong demand for arepresentative national body which, whatever its other functions might be,would act as a voice for the aspirations and needs of the country. If government policies and actions could be submitted to constant and open surveillance inany region in which a sufficient demand existed, the central government wouldbe bound to take notice of the views expressed and to explain and justifyitself more fully, and its policies might increasingly take on a regional dimension.950. It can be argued that the representation of regional opinion is properlya function of Members of Parliament. With legislative and executive powersremaining at the centre, the establishment of regional councils would not relieve
Members of this responsibility and would do nothing to lighten the burden onParliament as a whole. On the other hand the debates and other exchanges inParliament and its committees are remote from and insufficiently noticed inthe regions, and there are only limited opportunities there for discussing andscrutinising regional matters. If regional councils were to be set up, Membersof Parliament might be expected and indeed ought to take an interest in their work. They might be given a right to attend and perhaps participate in some ofthe councils&apos; debates.Relations with local government951. In the local government field, as we have seen from the Redcliffe-Maudproposals and the reaction to them, there are many functions that regional councilsmight perform. Perhaps the main function would be to act in a co-ordinatingand promotional, one might almost say inspirational, role in matters which affected the whole or a substantial part of their regions. They would be well placed to take a broad view of the needs and problems of their regions and toencourage the responsible local authorities to work together in the search forsolutions. In their debates the councils could do much to foster a climate ofopinion in which those solutions could be the more easily found.952. Even after local government reorganisation, there will be many matters,for instance in cultural and recreational development and in social and educa-tional provision of certain kinds, in which effective action will requireco-operation over areas extending beyond those of any single new county.A simple example is the building of a regional arts centre or theatre. All toooften an initiative towards the creation of a much needed institution of thiskind fails because enthusiasm is limited or dispersed. It might be the task of the regional council, once it had got hold of a good idea, possibly suggested to it by a local authority or some other organisation, to bring together in discussion the local authorities serving areas which would benefit and to encourage theadoption of positive and co-operative policies in cases where the idea had beenfound to be feasible and desirable.953. The regional councils might also play a leading part in the formulation of the broad economic and land-use strategy which would be the regionalframework within which both central and local government services would beprovided. The structure plans of the local authorities, prepared within thiswider framework, might then be submitted for the Ministers approval through and with the comments of the council.954. Another possibility would be for the council, as recommended by the redcliffe-Maud Commission, to be given authority itself to undertake certain limited forms of physical development, either on its own initiative or in default of action by a local authority. This limited executive function might not,however, rest very comfortably on a body designed primarily to act as a stimulusand pressure group for its region. The regional council could be expected more readily to secure the co-operation of the local authorities if it had no powers,however limited, of direction and intervention in their affairs. There is much tobe said for the view that local government should be left to do the work thatit is being reorganised to do, without having interposed between it and centralgovernment a regional authority exercising functions which have hitherto been
within its province. We would certainly see no reason for the assumption by a regional council of the kind we are considering of full responsibility for anyservices now in the hands of local authorities. Indeed, we would think it right for the trend to be rather towards allowing local authorities increased indepen-dence and scope in carrying out functions of local significance.Relations with appointed bodies955. In our last chapter we discussed the nature and work of bodies appointedby the central government for specific tasks. These ad hoc bodies operatewithin a framework of central policy and direction. They may carry out tasks ofa commercial or executive character on behalf of the central government;they may provide the central government with a service of independent advice which is needed for the formulation or administration of policies; or they mayassume the burden of dealing with appeals or consumer complaints. From the analysis of their functions which we have made, it is clear that they are notdetachable from the central government, except possibly under schemes of legislative and executive devolution. As a general rule, ad hoc bodies must beresponsible to the Ministers or bodies appointing them and providing theirfunds. There can be no question, therefore, as certain witnesses thought mightbe possible, of bringing them under the absolute control of consultative regionalcouncils of the kind we are now considering.956. But this does not mean that their activities need be completely beyondthe influence of regional councils. It would be unfortunate if that were so,since government-appointed bodies play an important part in the economic,social and cultural life of the regions. They should therefore be responsive to,or at least fully aware of, the special needs and aspirations of the regions,which the regional councils would be well placed to represent. One possibility would be for regional councils to have the right to appoint a member or members to ad hoc bodies operating entirely within their regions and possibly, withindefined limits, to bodies operating on a wider basis. Regional councils could have the right to call for reports from these bodies and to examine and advise on their work in so far as it affected their region.constitution of the regional councilMembers of the council957. The members of a regional council could be directly elected, or indirectlyelected by the local authorities in the region, or nominated by Ministers ofthe central government; or the council could be constituted by a combination of these methods. We have seen that there are many different functions whichthe council might perform, and the constitution could be tailored to suit theparticular functions given to it. A membership best suited for one functionwould not necessarily be best for another. It would not be essential for all thefunctions we have mentioned to be performed by the same body. There could be two or more regional bodies, with separate functions and separate, though perhaps overlapping, membership. On the other hand one single body for all purposes would have greater authority and prestige, and would be more likelyto add to the weight of the regional voice.
958. For consultative and advisory functions in relation to central govern-ment, nomination would have advantages in that the government of the day,having selected the members it considered best qualified after consultationwith local authorities and other appropriate organisations in the regions,could be expected to repose a good deal of confidence in the councils and tobring them the more fully into consultation. But people in the regions would hardly regard councils so constituted as properly representative of or responsive to their interests. We have in the course of our enquiries encountered a gooddeal of feeling opposed to the general concept of government-appointed bodies and to their proliferation. Since it would be essential for regional councils to have the goodwill and respect of people in the regions, we think the choicemust lie between direct and indirect election, though this would not rule outthe addition of some nominated members if it were considered desirable to import people with particular qualifications.959. Indirect election would not be open to the same objections as nominationby the central government. If members of regional councils were chosen bylocal authorities from within their own ranks, they would have their roots in local government and would be accepted as representative of the region as awhole and of the districts within it. Indirect election would be particularlysuitable for functions derived from local government, whether they were solelyco-ordinating or included an executive element. A possible objection is that members so chosen might regard themselves primarily as delegates from their local authorities and might be handicapped in taking a wider view. On theother hand, if it were felt that there was such a thing as a regional identity and regional interests to be served, there seems no reason why it should not become the practice for members of local authorities to regard election to the council as the opportunity to promote members of vision and ability to the widersphere.960. Direct election would enhance the standing of the regional council and give the most effective assurance to people in the region that the council wastruly representative of their interests. A directly elected council would not,however, be an appropriate body for co-ordinating or in any way undertaking the functions of local authorities, who would want to make their own decisionseither individually or in concert with other local authorities. It is questionablealso how far the electorate would be inclined to exercise the right to vote for,and how far suitable persons would be prepared to stand for election to, a body which had few, if any, executive powers. Much would depend on the ability of a regional council to prove its value to the community. If it were seen to be exerting its influence effectively, it could be expected to attract theinterest of voters and candidates. The case for direct election, wholly or inpart, would be strongest in Scotland and Wales, since any councils so establishedwould be readily accepted as representing important national interests.Staff961. If the councils were given executive functions in planning or other fields, however limited, they would need to recruit suitably qualified admini-strative and professional staff. The provision of such staff would present difficulty if there were to be no regular and continuing volume of work. without such executive functions, the councils would need only small secretariats,
including perhaps some specialist officers. It would be important that thesestaffs should be employed by and responsible to the councils, though theymight with advantage be seconded from the central and local government services.Finance962. Unlike regional assemblies with legislative or wide executive powers,regional councils would not entail any great departure from existing financialprinciples. Their main functions would be to debate and make representationsabout central government policies and administration as they affected the region,and to co-ordinate the activities of local authorities within the region. Neitherfunction would involve much expenditure. One possibility would be to meetthe costs of establishing and running a regional council by precepting on localauthorities within the region. For more substantial systems of regional devolution-tion we do not favour precepting on local authorities; but for low-spendingregional councils, much concerned with the work of local government, precept-ing is not inappropriate. Another possibility would be to meet the whole ofthe small expenditure from central government grant.summary963. In this chapter we have considered proposals for the establishment of regional councils without legislative or executive functions devolved from thecentre. They would be concerned mainly to bring about closer consultation and co-operation between the regions and central government and governmentagencies operating in the regions. In the local government field they mightact as the co-ordinators and stimulators of local authority action. In thisrole they might play a leading part in the formulation of a regional economicand land-use strategy. We do not consider that the councils should have powerto impose their will on the local authorities in planning or other matters, or that they should themselves have executive powers in relation to local authoritymatters. The members might be either directly or indirectly elected, with thepossible addition of a small number of persons with special qualificationsnominated by Ministers. It would be possible to have two or more bodies inthe region, each with its own range of functions and appropriate membership.But a single body for all purposes would have greater authority and prestige andbe more likely to add to the weight of the regional voice.964. If the assumption of legislative and executive powers from centralgovernment is ruled out, and the illogicality of taking away powers fromreorganised and strengthened local government is recognised, there is littlescope for executive action left for a regional tier of government. The case for establishing regional councils in these circumstances has to stand or fall on thevalue attributed to the inquisitory, debating, advisory and co-ordinatingfunctions considered in this chapter. The councils would ordinarily meet in public, and by their debates they would help to keep people better informed about and more involved in the discussion of central government policies.Government would be brought more into the open. Since much of the evidence
we received suggested that what most people wanted was to feel that govern-ment was less remote and that they were being more fully informed and con-suited about what it was doing, this might be regarded by some as a usefuldevelopment.965. On the other hand, there are those to whom the appointment of suchcouncils would not seem a very marked advance on what exists at present.The councils would be unable to decide and take action on any matter of vital concern to the regions. They could do little to curb the centralising tenden-cies of government, and the government could not be compelled to consult them before determining its policies; like any other form of devolution it wouldbe effective only in so far as the various bodies at central, regional and locallevels were prepared to co-operate to make it work. Moreover, the councilscould not be used to lighten the burden on Parliament and the central govern-ment; they would be more likely to add to it.
A PROPOSAL OF THE SCOTTISH CONSTITUTIONALCOMMITTEEthe proposal966. In this chapter we examine a specific proposal contained in a report made in 1970 by the Scottish Constitutional Committee1, which had beenappointed two years earlier by the Leader of the Conservative Party to considera proposal for a Scottish assembly. The Committee rejected separatism aseconomically damaging to Scotland, federalism as legalistic, unbalanced andunreal, and what we have called legislative devolution as offering a degree of autonomy which would be a poor exchange for the weakening of Scotland&apos;svoice at Westminster. Its main recommendation was for the establishmentof an assembly of about 125 members, directly elected at the time of Parlia-mentary elections, which would sit in Edinburgh for about forty days each year.It would have an advisory, consultative and inquisitory function, and in thisrole it would co-ordinate the views of regions within Scotland, meet and question the Scottish Ministers, discuss government proposals at an early stage, comment on the Scottish estimates and debate matters of concern to Scotland.967. These functions would be very similar to those considered for regionalcouncils in our last chapter. But the Committee suggested that the assembly should also have a quite different function. It would be empowered to debatecertain stages of Scottish Bills referred to it by the House of Commons. It wassuggested that the assembly might take the Second Reading, Committee andReport stages of such Bills, leaving the Third Reading in the House of commons and all stages in the House of Lords to be taken at Westminster in order-to preserve the essential principle of the sovereignty of Parliament. The assemblymight also assist in the consideration of private legislation and statutory instruments.assessment of the proposalAdvantages968. The Committee pointed out that its members had been made aware of the existence of a widespread feeling that Parliament was too remote fromScottish problems; they had also often been told that Parliament itself wasoverburdened and that Scottish Members were being subjected to an unreason-able load of work. It is one of the merits of the Committee&apos;s proposal that itseeks to achieve its aims of requiring the government to take Scottish needs and opinions more fully into account in its policy making and administration and creating in Scotland a better understanding of what government is doing in a way which would do something to relieve congestion at Westminster andremove part of the burden from the Scottish Members of Parliament.969. The Committee claimed certain other advantages for the proposal.The assembly would fill a void in the framework of Scottish institutions anda gap between the Parliamentary and local government levels, permittingpublic discussion to take place on an all-Scotland basis. It would provide anopportunity for contact and partnership between local politics and national See footnote on page 281.
politics in ways which have not hitherto been possible; in this connexion theCommittee hoped that a number of members of the new local authorities would consider it advantageous to stand for election to the assembly itself.It would also enable persons of ability and experience to make a contributionto Scottish public life even though their commitments in Scotland made itimpossible for them to fulfil the duties of a Member of Parliament.Disadvantages970. The Committee drew attention to some difficulties and disadvantages ofits proposal, and others were brought out in notes of dissent by two members who did not feel able to support the recommmendation for the establishmentof an assembly. Most of these difficulties, including the taking away from members of Parliament of functions which they can reasonably regard asproperly their own, the possibility of a clash between the assembly and thecentral government, the risk of prolonged control of the assembly by one party, the proliferation of elections and the unsatisfactory nature of the role of assembly member, apply to a greater or lesser extent to other forms of devolution and have been considered in our earlier chapters.971. Other difficulties relate to the assembly&apos;s proposed legislative function.The Committee suggested that there were two ways in which Scottish Billsmight be devolved to the assembly. The first would be by automatic transferfor certain stages of all Bills certified as being exclusively Scottish. The second would be for Parliament, on a government motion, to decide whether or not aparticular Bill should be transferred. The Committee thought that parliament might well prefer the second of these alternatives. Even so, it acknowledgedthat the possibility of friction existed, since there would doubtless be occasions when a Bill would be rejected by the assembly on Second Reading or be amended in ways which were not acceptable to Parliament. The Committee considered,however, that a clash of this kind would be rare, since in the main Scottishlegislation is not unduly controversial, and the government could alwaysinsist on the passage of a Bill through Parliament in the terms desired. TheCommittee believed that should the members of an assembly try to be factiousand to block Scottish legislation, the electors would soon take steps to remedy the situation; it was reasonable to assume that Scotsmen were responsiblecitizens.972. The Committee was probably right in thinking that Parliament would wish to control the transfer to the assembly of individual Bills. No purpose would be served by transferring a contentious Bill which the assembly seemed likely either to reject or to amend drastically and then restoring it to its originalshape on return to Parliament. There would be no saving of parliamentary time, and a refusal to accept the decisions of Scotland&apos;s elected representatives in the assembly and the probable delay in securing the passage of the legislation would cause discontent.973. Much depends therefore on the validity of the underlying assumptionmade by the Committee that most Scottish Bills would not be contentious.If the assumption turned out to be false, the assembly&apos;s legislative role would beinsignificant, especially at times when the government in power at Westminsterdid not command a majority in the assembly. The government might then be
expected to advise Parliament not to transfer to the assembly any contentiousBill. It might also be tempted to adopt the generally unsatisfactory practiceof including special provisions for Scotland in United Kingdom or GreatBritain Bills instead of having separate Bills for Scotland.974. If, on the other hand, the bulk of the legislation turned out not to becontentious in party political terms, and in any event at times when the sameparty was in control in both Westminster and Edinburgh, the assembly couldperform a useful function in carrying out the detailed scrutiny of legislation which would otherwise have to be conducted in a House of Commons standingcommittee. But this function would be of limited value. The assembly would haveno real power, being very much at the mercy of the central government and theHouse of Commons, to be used by them when likely to be compliant and to beotherwise ignored. For the consideration of the Bills that were referred, theHouse of Commons would have to impose a timetable on the assembly, andthe problems of timing which already arise in securing the passage of Billsthrough both Houses of Parliament would be intensified.conclusion975. The recommendation of the Scottish Constitutional Committee applied only to Scotland and to no other part of the United Kingdom. The legislativefunction of the proposed assembly v/ould have little relevance outside Scotland,and there it would have only limited value. Conferment of this function does notin itself constitute a strong argument for the establishment of a separatelyelected assembly. The Committee&apos;s proposal would, therefore, have to bejustified mainly by the other, non-legislative, functions proposed for the assembly,and these are of a kind we have already considered for more general regionalapplication in Chapter 19. If a non-executive assembly were to be established inScotland, the power to play some part in the passage of Scottish legislation might be a useful addition to its other functions.
ADMINISTRATIVE DEVOLUTION976. We have so far in this Part of the Report dealt with forms of devolutioninvolving the creation at regional level of bodies which would have legislative,executive and consultative functions. We now turn to a different order of ideas and consider how the central government and Parliament might, without thecreation of new regional institutions of government, arrange for aspects oftheir work to be conducted on a regional framework or in a regional setting.The regionalisation of government administration is dealt with in this chapter.The regionalisation of Parliament itself is dealt with in Chapter 22.977. There is nothing novel in the idea of conducting the business of centralgovernment in Scotland, Wales or the English regions. The responsibility formany central government functions as they affect Scotland has been placed inthe hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Scottish Office in edinburgh, and the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office in Cardiffhave much the same kind of responsibility in relation to Wales, though with a somewhat smaller range of executive functions. In the English regions there areno government departments comparable to the Scottish and Welsh Offices,but many departments have arranged for some of their work to be undertaken by their own officials stationed in the regions.978. The system of government in Scotland and Wales is often referred toas administrative devolution and that in the English regions as decentralisation.We have found it convenient to use the term administrative devolution to coverall arrangements for the conduct of central government business in Scotland,Wales and the English regions.979. In this chapter we examine the various forms of administrative devolutionand their strengths and weaknesses, and we consider how they might be developedor modified and extended to functions and to parts of the country where theyhave not hitherto been applied. We start with the simplest form of administrative devolution, the decentralisation of functions by individual departments, andthen consider arrangements for interdepartmental co-ordination at the regional level. This leads to a discussion of the French prefect system. From there wego on to consider various possibilities for the appointment of Ministers withregional functions, in a progression which leads up to the Secretary of state system as it now operates in Scotland and Wales.decentralisation of government departmentsRecent developments980. In Chapter 7 we traced very briefly the history of the decentralisationof government departments, and in Appendix D we set out the present positionin each of the departments likely to offer scope for devolution. In the case of thedepartments serving the whole of Great Britain this decentralisation has included the setting up of offices in Scotland and Wales, not necessarily with precisely the same range of functions as has been given to regional offices in England.Although since the Second World War there has been a general trend towards
decentralisation, there has been no settled or consistent policy in its favourand there have indeed been periods during which regional responsibilities andstaffs have been contracted. But in the last decade or so decentralisation hasbeen stimulated by the growth in the volume and complexity of government business, and by the grouping together in large departments of related functionshitherto dealt with in a number of separate departments. An important contribu-tion to the smooth operation of these large departments has been maae byparcelling out blocks of executive work to regional and local units, leaving thedepartmental headquarters to concentrate mainly on policy and planning.981. One development of this kind which was of particular interest to us was the creation in October 1970 of the Department of the Environment outof the old Ministries of Housing and Local Government, Transport and public building and Works. The new department is responsible for the whole range of functions which affect people&apos;s living environment and has a leading responsi-bility for regional policy in England. When it was set up the departmentinherited thirteen separate regional organisations. Three of these, concerned withphysical and economic planning, highways and housing, have since been unitedin a common organisation under an officer of Under-Secretary grade in eachregion, who is both Regional Director of the department and chairman of the regional economic planning board; and substantial blocks of local casework inthe planning field have been decentralised to the regional offices for the first time. The other regional organisations of the department, which are concernedwith technical matters of one kind or another, remain separate, with distinctiveregional boundaries in many cases and with officials reporting direct to theirown senior officers at headquarters. The Regional Director, as the departmentssenior representative in the region, takes the lead in securing appropriateconsultation and mutual assistance.982. Another development of interest to us was the creation, also in October1970, of the Department of Trade and Industry out of the Board of Trade and ministry of Technology, taking in also some related functions of the Depart-ment of Employment and Productivity. This was followed by the setting up inMarch 1972 of an Industrial Development Executive under the Minister for industrial Development, one of the second-tier Ministers in the department,responsible for the industrial component of regional policy and for financialassistance to, and sponsorship of, industry. The Executive has a strong regional organisation exercising a considerable degree of devolved authority in the assisted areas Scotland, Wales, three regions in the north of England and theSouth West region. Each region has an industrial development office in thecharge of an Under-Secretary, working in close collaboration with an industrialdirector of similar status appointed from industry, and an industrial advisory board which maintains contact as appropriate with the corresponding economic planning council. In Scotland and Wales the industrial development officeswork in close consultation with the Scottish and Welsh Offices.The purposes of decentralisation983. What are the objects of decentralisation and in what circumstances is itappropriate? For the department itself among the most important purposes are the breaking up of executive work into more manageable units and theshortening of lines of communication with its clients. A department providing
services direct to the public has to maintain a network of local offices theDepartment of Employment, for example, has about a thousand such offices and then often requires, for the purposes of internal administration, regional offices to which the local offices can report. Decentralisation in these circum-stances is not designed solely to give a regional slant to administration. It maybe needed even where there is little if any regional or local interest in what thedepartment is doing. The Home Office, for example, although it has not pursueda policy of decentralisation for most of the services with which it is concerned,has found it necessary to establish four regional offices for the purpose of prisonadministration simply to reduce its lines of communication with the growing number of prison establishments.984. Decentralisation may also improve the standard of services providedby the department to its clients, whether they be local or other public authorities,industrial concerns or members of the public. There are several reasons for this.Regional offices are generally more accessible than the departments Londonoffice. Officials dealing with the affairs of a particular region become more readily known to the clients if they are located in the region. By living and work-ing in the region they are better able to understand the circumstances surroundingthe decisions that have to be taken and the probable consequences of those decisions. For these reasons the decisions are likely to be more sensitive tolocal feeling and to be given more speedily. We were told by a number of witnesses that, while all the relevant facts are generally known in Whitehall,the official working there often lacks the &quot;feel&quot; of the region. There is no doubtthat people working in local and other public authorities and in industry feel strongly that they gain something from the decentralisation of governmentadministration. They believe that the quality of the decisions taken in the regions is better. Whether it really is better is difficult to judge, though we thinkthat in some cases at least this is almost certainly so. But however that may be,the fact that people believe it to be better indicates that the feeling of remoteness,which leads to a loss of confidence in government, can be reduced bydecentralisation.985. Another advantage of decentralisation is that it facilitates the injectionof regional considerations into policy making. While the responsibilities of regional staffs relate mainly to the implementation of policy, they are generallybrought into discussion on policy as it is being formed, and are able to give advice from their experience of implementing existing policies on the defectswhich have come to notice and on the probable implications for the regions ofthe new policies being discussed.The limitations of decentralisation986. Decentralisation is not of course a cure for all the evils which are considered to flow from the remoteness of government and, except in a very limited way through such bodies as the regional economic planning councils,it makes no direct contribution to the strengthening of democratic control.However much a regional official may seek to identify himself with his region,and with whatever success, he remains and will be recognised as a representativeof the department in Whitehall, applying policies laid down there, and ableto act only within the limits of the discretion conferred upon him. If a clientis dissatisfied with a decision taken in the region, or if the matter is such as
to require a decision at a higher level in the department, he has to pursue it inLondon. Clearly the greater the delegated authority given to the region the morevalue decentralisation will have to the clients. If it is too restricted, or moreapparent than real, or if in effect it adds another stage to the process of decision,decentralisation will add to rather than remove regional frustration. On theother hand, limitations have to be placed on regional discretion both becauseultimate responsibility rests with the Minister, who is accountable to parliament for the actions of his officials, and because policies must be applied in a reason-ably uniform manner throughout the country, or at least with only such differ-ences as are consistent with government policy for the regions.Scope for further decentralisation987. Several witnesses commented in their evidence on the inconsistency ofthe arrangements made by government departments for their representation in the regions. It was suggested that, as a matter of principle, all the maindepartments should have regional offices, preferably in the same town, or eventhe same building, so that local authorities, industry, commerce and other interests in the region would have a local point of contact on most of thematters on which they are in communication with government. One particulardefect of the existing arrangements which was brought to our attention related to local authority building projects which concern several different departments.We were told that the number of such joint projects is increasing and that muchinconvenience is caused when parts of a scheme have to be discussed withdepartmental officials in the region and others with officials in London whosedepartments have no regional offices.988. We accept that there is substance in the complaint of inconsistencyand, since we believe that decentralisation has in general the advantages claimedfor it, we would think it right, whether or not more advanced systems of devolution are adopted, for departments to carry out regular and comprehensivereviews with a view to considering the desirability of transferring some additional functions to their regional offices.989. Decentralisation is not to be regarded as an end in itself transcendingall other considerations. For each function the advantages to be expected fromdecentralisation, in the shape of better understanding of regional problems and requirements and more speedy and sensitive decisions, have to be weighed against any administrative disadvantages. There will be circumstances inwhich full central control will be preferable, when, for example, the scale of operations and the staff employed are too small to make division into regionalunits practicable without substantial loss of efficiency, or uniformity ofadministration is essential. We believe, however, that decentralisation willoften be found on balance to have advantages. If full value is to be obtainedfrom it, regional offices must be staffed by competent officials, and we have much sympathy with a suggestion put to us by a number of witnesses that allofficials destined for high office should at some time during their careers havea spell of duty in a regional office.interdepartmental co-ordination at regional levelPresent arrangements990. What we were told about consultation between local authorities and government departments on joint building projects illustrates not only the
need for consistency between departments in their approach to decentralisationbut also the need for interdepartmental co-operation and co-ordination atregional level. This need exists in a great variety of matters, and because thescale of operations is so much smaller in the regions than in London co-ordination should be more easily and effectively achieved, particularly whenthe regional offices of the various departments are located together in the sameregional town.991. The present arrangements for interdepartmental co-ordination are in large part centred on the regional economic planning board, which consists of the senior official representatives in the region of the main departmentsconcerned with aspects of economic planning. In the English regions thechairman of the board, as we have already noted, is the Regional Director ofthe Department of the Environment. In addition to his direct departmental responsibilities he takes the lead in securing the consultation and mutual assistance needed to produce an integrated approach to environmental planning in the region. In this way a large measure of regional co-ordination has been achieved. We were told by representatives of the regional economic planning councils that before the boards were set up in 1965 each department in the region tended to work in isolation, but that there had since been a notableimprovement, with more informal contacts between departments on a whole range of matters of common concern. That view probably underestimated theextent of interdepartmental consultation that took place in the regions beforethe boards were established, but there is no doubt that the existence of formalmachinery has stimulated informal contact. Our witnesses felt neverthelessthat further steps needed to be taken to strengthen the machinery of governmentin the regions by bringing officers of the different departments closer together;and a suggestion was made that there should be appointed in each region a senior civil servant who would have executive authority over all departmentalofficials in the region.Limitations on interdepartmental co-ordination at regional level992. One obstacle to greater integration of departments in the regions isthe fact that they use different regional boundaries. Although attempts havebeen made from time to time to secure uniformity, and for many functionsdepartments are now organised in regions broadly conforming to those adopted for economic planning purposes, there remain substantial variations. regional organisations have been set up on functional lines, and the numbers andboundaries of regions selected for very different purposes naturally do notcoincide. Although it is right that some concession should be made in theinterests of uniformity where this may help to strengthen central governmentin the regions, and so assist in an understanding of regional needs, absoluteuniformity is neither practicable nor essential. The lack of uniformity does not prevent co-ordination, though it may make it more difficult.993. The suggestion that a senior civil servant should have executive responsibility over other departmental officials in the region runs counter tothe doctrine of Ministerial responsibility. The regional officials of each department are responsible for their actions, through senior officials, to theMinister in charge of the department. The executive powers which they exercise
in the region derive from authority vested in them by the department, to whichthey owe their primary loyalty. Thus, while the Regional Director of theDepartment of the Environment, as chairman of the regional economic planningboard, can bring both prestige and pressure to bear, he has no final authority over officials of other departments. A senior official with executive authority over all other regional civil servants would himself have to receive delegatedpowers from each of the departments concerned; he would in fact have to be&apos;a member not of one but of several different departments, and in this respectwould be in a position similar to that of the French prefect.The prefect system in France994. We have examined the working of the prefect system in France, and a paper on the subject prepared for us by Professor F. F. Ridley of the Departmentof Political Theory and Institutions in the University of Liverpool is being published in our series of research studies1. The prefect is the senior governmentofficial in each of the ninety-five territorial departments into which France is divided. His functions are numerous and wide-ranging and what follows is amuch-abbreviated statement of his main roles.995. The prefect formally represents the state in his department, in whichcapacity he has a status similar to that of the Lord Lieutenant of an Englishcounty. He is the repository of the authority of the state, with considerableprerogative and statutory powers for use in emergency. He is also the repre-sentative of central government, as distinct from the state, being both its political agent and its spokesman. He is the prime holder of powers delegated to government services in the department, and the superior officer of all centralgovernment officials, a co-coordinator with ultimate power. In particular, he is responsible for aspects of economic and land-use planning, which are exercisedthrough national agencies coming under the Prime Ministers office.996. As the representative of his own Ministry, the Ministry of the Interior,the prefect has a number of specific responsibilities. These include policefunctions, both administrative and operational in the larger towns he ishead of the police force and security functions. He is also responsible for the supervision of local authorities, and is himself the chief executive of the localauthority for the department, legally acting on its behalf, although he is appointed and can be removed only by the central government.997. An important development over the last decade has been the emergence of a system of regional prefects, these posts being held by the twenty-onedepartmental prefects in whose departments the regional capitals are situated.The main function of the regional prefect is in relation to economic and land-use planning and the stimulation of economic development. He has a specificpower to authorise public investment, but otherwise has few formal powers.The office is not intended to constitute a new level in the administrativehierarchy, and the department remains the basic unit of administration. the regional prefect is assisted by a regional administration committee, consistingof all prefects in the region, and by an advisory regional council, comparable tothe regional economic planning council in England.1 See Research Paper 4.
998. Whatever its merits in France, it is apparent that there are manyfeatures of the prefect system that could not be imported into this country,with its very different history and traditions. The prefects status as represen-tative of the state, with wide prerogative and political powers, his policefunction and his dual role as central government controller and chief executive of local government would all be unacceptable. What is of interest and relevant to our enquiry is his position of authority as the senior government official inhis department, exercising powers delegated to departmental staffs by all the ministries concerned. In practice officials of the individual Ministries exercisemost of these powers on his behalf. But the prefect&apos;s control is a very real one.He sees all important papers, all correspondence is channelled through his office and he has the power, which we understand is extensively exercised, to intervene at any time in day-to-day administration.999. The questions for us are whether, if no more extensive system of devolution-tion than those discussed in this chapter were to be adopted, this particularfeature of the prefect system would have value in the regions of this countryand whether it would be acceptable. We have concluded that, although itmight well be valuable, there is no way of overcoming the objection that a civil servant could not serve two or more departments and Ministers in circumstances in which there might be a clash of departmental interests; and as the appoint-ment of such an official would serve no purpose unless he were in a positionto adjudicate in such situations, we conclude that even this limited prefectoralrole could not be assumed by a civil servant. The fact is that the role of adminis-trative arbiter, though not so obviously political as some of the other rolesof the piefect, itself has an important political facet, and would in the circum-stances of this country have to be assumed by a political figure. This considera-tion leads us on to an examination of the various possibilities for theappointment of Ministers with responsibilities for particular regions.regional ministersDepartment of the Environment functions1000. A natural starting point for adding a political dimension to thedecentralisation of government would be the appointment in each region ofa Minister of the Department of the Environment. This might be regarded asa logical extension of a process which has brought together in this one depart-ment responsibility for a wide range of matters affecting the local environment and has strengthened the regional offices of the department to enable them todeal with as much as possible of its executive work, leaving the headquarters in London to concentrate on policy and planning.1001. The appointment of such Ministers might be expected to serve twopurposes. The first would be to facilitate the governments contact with localpoliticians and with representatives of industry and other interests. A minister with responsibilities confined to a particular region, spending a large part ofhis time working in and travelling around the region, would be in a far better position than a Minister in London with more general responsibilities to get to know the local people and to understand their problems and their views on matters of current political interest. His task would be very largely to interpret the government to the region and the region to the government, and in this
respect he would be assuming a political role of a kind we have noted as oneof the functions of the prefect in France. It would be consistent with this rolefor the Minister to appoint the members of the regional economic planning council.1002. The second purpose which the appointment of regional Ministers inthe Department of the Environment might serve would be the further strength-ening of the regional offices of the department. Within the range of functionsalready transferred it could improve the standard of service provided bypermitting the exercise in the region of a greater degree of discretion, making it unnecessary to refer cases of special difficulty to London for Ministerial decision and allowing appeals to the Minister against an official decision to be dealtwith on the spot. Perhaps more important would be the scope it would offer for the transfer of additional blocks of work to the regional offices. We have inmind such matters as the approval of local structure plans, the determination of appeals against the decisions of local planning authorities and the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders. In paragraphs 1016-1019 below we considerthe possibility of conferring upon the Ministers some specific powers in relationto finance. iFunctions of other departments1003. If the regional Minister were to be a member of the Ministerial teamin the Department of the Environment, his executive powers would, unlessspecial arrangements were made, be confined to those falling within the range of responsibilities of that department. The range is wide, but it excludes very many subjects outside the environmental field in which there is considerablelocal and regional interest. The questions arise whether the Minister couldreally be said to represent the government in the region if he had no powers in relation, for example, to the functions which are the responsibility of theDepartment of Education and Science, the Department of Health and social security, the Home Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, andwhether without the addition of some powers in those fields he would haveeither an adequate base on which to exercise political influence or a worthwhilejob to do.1004. The Ministers executive responsibilities would be enlarged if theDepartment of the Environment were itself to absorb some of the functionsof these other departments. But the department is already very large. although we recognise that there were good reasons for the creation of this and other large departments by amalgamation of smaller departments, it is obvious thattheir very size presents difficulties of its own, and it may be that the limit hasbeen reached.1005. Another theoretical possibility would be for the regional Minister toassume executive powers belonging to other departments, in addition to thoseof the Department of the Environment. He might, for example, have powers in relation to education in his region. Since there could be no blurring of departmental responsibilities at the centre, in the exercise of such powers hewould be responsible not to the Secretary of State for the Environment butdirect to the Secretary of State for Education and Science. He would in thisrespect be in much the same position as a civil servant in the region who was
given executive authority over officials of a number of different departments,and we believe that the arrangement would be as unworkable in the one case as it would in the other. For the regional Minister to serve any useful purposehe would need to be given, within his field of responsibility, a large measureof discretion in the exercise of powers affecting his region and this wouldrequire that he should enjoy the full confidence of the Secretary of State from whom the powers derived. We do not believe that the regional Minister couldserve two or more political masters in this way, especially in any clash of interests between their respective departments. This does not mean that, giventhe right personalities, a regional Minister answerable to a single Secretary ofState could not in practice establish satisfactory working relationships with ministers of other departments; there is indeed a precedent for this in theoffice of Minister of State for Welsh Affairs in the Ministry of Housing andLocal Government from 1957 until 1964, when the office of Secretary of Statefor Wales was created. But he would not stand in the same relationship tothem as to his own Secretary of State, exercising functions on their behalf.Oversight functions1006. In our view, therefore, a Minister appointed to represent the govern-ment in a region could in the normal course exercise executive powers belongingto only one department, which would be the department carrying the primary responsibility for regional policy. This would not preclude his being given some specific responsibilities in relation to other departments. But in theordinary course his function in relation to those other departments wouldbe representational. It would be similar to the oversight function which the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales exercise in relation to matters forwhich executive responsibilities have not been transferred to them. He wouldconcern himself with the whole range of regional interests and play a part inthe co-ordination of the work of the different departments. But he would haveno powers enabling him to override the decisions of officials outside his own department or to take decisions on behalf of their Ministers.1007. In Scotland and Wales the oversight function of the Secretaries ofState is regarded by many people as having no less importance than their executive functions. It ensures that Scotland and Wales at all times and in all matters have their own voices in the counsels of government. The regionalMinisters position would, however, be by no means as strong. The effectiveness of the oversight exercised by the Secretaries of State depends on the pressurethey are able to bring to bear on their Ministerial colleagues, ultimatelyoperating through the Cabinet. But the regional Minister would have no seatin the Cabinet this would scarcely be practicable or indeed appropriate inthe arrangement we are now considering and could not speak on equal terms with Ministers in charge of departments. He might, as we have suggested,be able to establish effective relations with them and with other Ministers intheir departments, and he could represent regional views to them. He couldseek to apply pressure on them through the Secretary of State for the Environ-ment; but the latter would not himself be in a strong position to assess the regional needs in respect of a service for which he had no direct responsibilityor to relate them to the competing claims of other services and other regions.
1008. Despite these limitations, the arrangement could, we think, be madeto work in such a way as to introduce a useful regional element into government,but only if there existed a genuine desire on the part of the central governmentto make it work and to extract the maximum value from it. Much would depend on the status and authority accorded to the regional Minister.The status of the regional Minister1009. Under the normal rules of Ministerial responsibility the Secretaryof State would remain responsible for all action taken in the region in his name, and would be accountable to Parliament for that action. The regionalMinister would have to work within the main lines of the Secretary of State&apos;policy, being permitted only such regional variations as the Secretary of state would be prepared to defend on the grounds that they met the special require-ments of the region. The amount of freedom he enjoyed to interpret policyand to adapt it to the circumstances of the region would depend very largely on the extent to which he enjoyed the confidence of the Secretary of State.If he were seen in the region to have some measure of discretion and to have in effect the power of final decision, there would be no reason why, with theright personal qualities, he should not enjoy also the confidence of the regionalpeople and considerable prestige. If, on the other hand, it became clear thatall the real power rested with the Secreary of State in Whitehall and theSecretary of State were to be prepared as a matter of course to consider appealsagainst his decisions, the regional Ministers position would be underminedand the appointment would serve little purpose. For the success of the schemeit would clearly be important to establish a proper working procedure at the outset.1010. We have accordingly considered the possibility of safeguarding the regional Ministers position by conferring statutory powers upon him. If this were done the Secretary of State would retain the general policy-making and planning powers and responsibility for the co-ordination of action in thedifferent regions, but responsibility for the implementation of his policies and for executive action in each region would be vested in the regional Minister.The problems involved in the division of powers between the Secretary of Stateand the regional Ministers would be similar to those we considered at some length in Chapter 18 in relation to the devolution of executive powers to regional assemblies. We have no hesitation in saying that for the purpose of administra-tive devolution a statutory division of powers would be undesirable and, in all probability, would also prove unworkable.1011. In reaching this conclusion we have taken note of past attempts toorganise central government on the basis of shared responsibility. Althoughthe analogy is not exact, the experience in the early 1950s of the use of political&quot;overlords&quot; provides a useful pointer to the difficulties of sharing powersbetween Ministers at different levels. In an attempt to secure better co-ordinationof policy, a number of Ministers in statutory charge of separate departmentsoperating in related fields were made responsible to one senior Minister foroverall policy control. It is generally agreed that this system proved unsuccessful,and that similar schemes have failed whenever they have been tried. such schemes suffer from the disadvantages of inflexibility, lack of clarity on where
the responsibility lies and a risk of confusion and disruption of the decision-making process and of friction and disunity within the government machine.We believe that all these disadvantages would attach to a system in which ministers in the regions were given statutory powers over the execution ofpolicy while responsibility for policy making remained with a Minister atthe centre.1012. In more recent years the re-organisation of central government hastaken the form of creating super-Ministries with all statutory responsibilityvested in the political head. The Department of the Environment is one ofthese, and in our view a system of administrative devolution of the kind wehave been discussing would have to be based on the appointment of ministers in that department receiving their powers by delegation from the Secretaryof State. While the extent of the delegation would be at risk if the Secretaryof State had strong centralising tendencies, or Parliament insisted on holdinghim personally responsible for everything that was done in his name in the region, or the regional Minister was himself of inadequate calibre, there is some reason to think that the system could be made to work successfully.The second-tier Ministers in the Department of the Environment at the presenttime the Minister for Local Government and Development, the Minister for transport Industries and the Minister for Housing and Construction takeimportant decisions without statutory responsibility within their respectivefields; they commonly reply to Parliamentary Questions addressed to theSecretary of State on their own subjects, and on all but the most important matters are accepted both by Members of Parliament and by outside interests as the Ministers effectively responsible. It should equally be possible for theSecretary of State to delegate functions to regional Ministers. Indeed, it couldbe seen as a natural extension of the system of second-tier Ministers in thelarge departments that such Ministers should be appointed for particular regionsin the department which bears the major responsibility for regional policy.Functional and regional Ministers1013. The question arises whether there could at the same time be bothfunctional and regional Ministers in the department. Functional Ministers,responsible primarily for policy on particular subjects, would have an interestin the way in which that policy was being applied in the regions, and would need to have their own contacts with persons operationally responsible for theservices with which they were concerned. Regional Ministers for their part,with their responsibilities for the execution of policy, would have an interestin the devising of new policies. There are now eight Ministers in the Departmentof the Environment with duties allocated on a functional basis under theSecretary of State. If regional Ministers, perhaps up to eight in number, wereto be added to them there would be a considerable problem in allocatingresponsibilities among the many Ministers. The administrative machinery required for keeping them informed, and for necessary consultation with them before decisions were taken, would be complex and probably unwieldy and time-consuming, and the Secretary of State would find it difficult to work with so large a Ministerial team.1014. Functional Ministers at present have responsibility for both policymaking and execution. If regional Ministers were to assume most of their
executive responsibilities, they would be left with only their policy-makingfunctions. Almost certainly some of the Ministers could then be dispensed with. The Secretary of State&apos;s need for support at headquarters would varyas between functions and at different times. In the transport sector there mightbe a continuing need, especially in view of moves towards European harmonisa-tion. But in housing the pressure would not be so great, except when majorlegislation was in the offing; most of the work of controlling and encouragingbuilding would be devolved to the regional Ministers. Similarly, when reorgarrisa-tion had been completed, there would not be the same need for a second-tierfunctional Minister for local government matters. With so wide a range of functions in the one department, however, the need for some Ministerialsupport for the Secretary of State at headquarters would remain, and theproblem of dovetailing the activities of the headquarters Ministers into thoseof the regional Ministers would arise. The problem could probably not be satisfactorily resolved if the total number of Ministers in the department were much to exceed the present figure. There might have to be fewer than eightregional Ministers. One possibility would be, while retaining the existingregional structure, to allocate a Minister to each pair of regions.1015. It is possible that the regional Ministers, even with their oversightfunctions in relation to the work of other departments, would not be very fully employed, and it is natural to enquire whether they, or some of their number,could not also have a functional role at headquarters, thus reducing the totalnumber of Ministers in the department. One man might, for example, double the role of Minister for Transport Industries with that of Minister for one ormore of the regions. There are, however, obvious objections to such an arrange-ment. Ministerial representation in the regions would be uneven, and theindividual Minister might find it difficult to reconcile the promotion of theinterests of his particular region with his wider functional responsibility.Finance1016. In some respects the considerations which would have to be takeninto account in deciding the financial powers of a regional Minister are similarto those which would affect the financing of regional assemblies under a systemof executive devolution. In both cases the apportionment of funds between theservices being administered would remain primarily a matter of national policy, and even within the individual services there would be financial prioritieslaid down at the centre which would have to be adhered to. It would be inappropriate for a regional Minister to have a block Vote and complete freedom of allocation within it. Whatever his financial powers were, they wouldhave to be consistent with the implementation of national policy, at least in broad terms, service by service.1017. In one important respect, however, the position of the regionalMinister would differ from that of an executive assembly. The assembly wouldbe an elected body with an independent constitutional role, no doubt concerned to exert its powers to the utmost and quite often controlled by a political party different from that in control at Westminster. The regional Minister would himself be a member of the central government, and in practice this might permitrather more flexibility in the financial arrangements. The government might
be more ready to confer discretion on one of its own Ministers than on an elected assembly; authority to modify national policy to suit regional circum-stances could be given to him in a more informal way, and could more easily be withdrawn should that become necessary.1018. As we have already indicated, we do not think that the regionalMinisters could have independent statutory powers. Everything they did wouldbe subject to the overriding authority of the Secretary of State for the environment and the Cabinet. But in practice the intention would be to give them a large measure of discretion. In relation to finance the estimates of theDepartment of the Environment might be drawn up on a regional as well as afunctional basis, with each regional Minister making the case for his particularregion. At this stage he would also be given an opportunity to comment on theestimates of expenditure of other departments in his region. A regional break-down of public expenditure would therefore be necessary for those departmentsalso. The Department of the Environment Vote for each region might include a small margin not allocated to particular services but available for allocationat the regional Ministers discretion. And even in relation to expenditure voted for specific purposes he might have a limited discretion to transfer fundsbetween or within services in the interests of the region.1019. Grants to local authorities, or to other government bodies withenvironmental responsibilities in the region, would appear as part of the regional Ministers Vote. It seems that the allocation of the rate support grantamong local authorities could in theory be divided into two stages a centralallocation to the regions followed by a regional allocation to the individual authorities. But the second stage would still involve considerations of national policy, affecting services outside the responsibility of the Department of the environment, and the regional Ministers role at such a stage would obviously be one of co-ordination rather than decision. In practice the system might be rather difficult to work, with the local authorities tending to make comparisons with the grants received by authorities in other regions, and other governmentdepartments tending to resent the influence of the Department of the Environ-ment at regional level in the allocation of nationally voted moneys intended for their services. Unless the circumstances justified different rate support grant formulae for different regions, the regional Minister would have no special role to play, and it would probably be better to leave the system as it is.1020. If regional Ministers were given the financial powers which we havesuggested in paragraph 1018, the essential fabric of the present financial system would not be disturbed, but the change would go a long way towards developing a regional view of public expenditure. The estimates for all regional services,whether within the regional Ministers responsibility or not, would be prepared on a geographical basis and looked at for each region as a whole. Inparagraphs 1070-1072 we consider in a little more detail what would be involved. The introduction of this new regional dimension would in itself be animportant development. It would acknowledge the relevance of the region notmerely as an area with particular problems which had to be solved as part ofnational policy, but as a unit of government whose financial administrationrequired to be viewed as a whole.
Conclusions on regional Ministers1021. An arrangement of the kind we have been considering would transfersome political power to the regions. The existence of regional Ministers would ensure that the government thought in regional as well as functional terms.The regional Minister would not, however, be in as strong a position as the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales to promote the interests of hisregion. By comparison with them, he would have executive responsibilities fora much smaller range of functions, his powers in relation to those functions would be more restricted and, being outside the Cabinet, he would be lesswell placed to press the claims of his region in respect of the functions for whichhe had no executive responsibilities. Any significant strengthening of hisposition would require him to be put in a position nearer to that of the secretaries of State. Accordingly, we now turn to an examination of theSecretary of State system as it has developed in Scotland and Wales, and consider the possibilities of extending it to the English regions and of developingit further in Scotland and Wales.the secretary of state systemExecutive functions1022. The main feature of the existing system of administrative devolution to Scotland and Wales is that in each country the Secretary of State has incertain subjects full responsibility both for the formulation of policy and forits execution, and in others a more general responsibility for representing his country&apos;s interests to departmental Ministers individually and to ministers collectively in the Cabinet.1023. In Chapters 4 and 5 we have given a brief account of the evolution ofthe system in Scotland and Wales respectively, and on page 42 we have listedthe functions, generally referred to as executive functions, for which the secretaries of State have powers over policy making and execution. In Scotlandthese include most of the functions which in England are the responsibilities of the Home Office, the Department of Education and Science, the Departmentof the Environment, the Department of Health and Social Security and theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. We have noted that the BalfourCommission in 1954 suggested that new functions should be transferred to theScottish Office only if distinctive Scottish interests would thereby be betterserved and interests which Scotland had in common with the rest of the UnitedKingdom or Great Britain would not suffer. With perhaps the exception ofelectricity, road passenger transport and sea transport, the few additions madeto the list of transferred functions in recent years, presumably by applicationof the Balfour criteria, have been of a relatively minor character. The welsh office is a recent creation, with fewer executive functions, but even so theyextend over a range which is considerably larger than that of any departmentwith responsibilities confined mainly to England.1024. The functions for which the Secretaries of State have executive responsibilities are therefore far more extensive than we have considered asbeing the maximum which could be given to regional Ministers in England solong as functional departments were retained at the centre. And in relation tothose functions the powers of the Secretaries of State are much greater. The
decisions they take on both policy and execution are final decisions, and thereis no question of an appeal to a Minister in Whitehall against them. Thedecisions are taken by the Scottish or Welsh Secretary of State, assisted by civilservants based in and oriented towards Scotland or Wales. Subject only to therequirements of national policy for the United Kingdom, administration is designed to suit Scottish or Welsh conditions.1025. A great deal of the comment which is critical of the present arrange-ments for the government of Scotland and Wales, with its references to mattersof a trivial nature having to be referred to London for decision, displays a remarkable ignorance of the powers of the Secretaries of State and sometimeseven of the existence of these Ministers and their offices in Edinburgh andCardiff. If the system is retained, we think that more should be done to informthe public of the way in which it operates and the results which are achieved.1026. It is true, as we have already noted, that the Whitehall departmentsinitiate much of the policy common to the United Kingdom, and that, as allthe Ministers concerned are members of the same Cabinet and of the sameparty pursuing a national policy, a wide measure of political agreement is both natural and necessary. Nevertheless, within a broad framework ofgenerally agreed policy, considerable divergences are possible and are practisedin the light of specifically Scottish and Welsh requirements. There are occasions when the policy lead is taken in Scotland or Wales. There is an example inScotland in the field of social work services, where the policy formulated andthe legislation promoted had at the time no counterpart south of the border.In Wales the initiative was taken which resulted in the passing and subsequentamendment of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which applied to both wales and England; in the implementation of other legislation, the Welsh Office hasplaced greater emphasis on measures for the clearance of derelict land than has the Department of the Environment in England.Oversight functions1027. The second feature of the Secretary of State system concerns whatthe Welsh Office evidence referred to as oversight functions and the scottish office evidence as the non-executive function of co-ordinating interdepart-mental action in Scotland. Through the exercise of these functions the secretaries of State are able to take an interest and have a say in the economicand other fields of government activity which fall outside their own executive responsibilities. Their oversight of the work of the economic departments isof particular significance; indeed, the performance of any Secretary of state is in large measure judged by his success in securing economic improvementfor his country. That being so, the Scottish and Welsh Offices are to a con-siderable extent pressure groups within the government system, designed toensure that maximum attention is paid to the Scottish or Welsh case, which istherefore never allowed to go by default. The pressure exerted depends on theimportance of the case to Scottish or Welsh interests. While the likelihood ofsuccess is no doubt related to the strength and persuasiveness of the case,political factors undoubtedly enter into the picture. One example of the effectiveness of these pressures was the decision to site the prototype nuclearfast reactor at Dounreay in the north of Scotland, and another the moving ofthe Royal Mint to Wales.
1028. In the exercise of these oversight functions the Secretaries of Stateowe much to their position as senior Ministers with seats in the Cabinet.They also doubtless derive some measure of political leverage from their position as Ministers in charge of departments with executive responsibilities and financial powers in respect of a wide range of services, including manywhich are closely related to economic development.Application to England1029. Many of our witnesses were critical of the Secretary of State system as providing an inadequate measure of devolution for Scotland and Wales;none, however, denied that it had conferred substantial benefits on thosecountries. Since, therefore, regional Ministers with a narrower range of functions and with no power bases of their own would inevitably be less well placedthan the Secretaries of State to promote the interests of their individual regions,it is natural to consider whether it would be possible to apply the systemgenerally throughout Great Britain so that all regions might share in thosebenefits.1030. Although this idea might at first sight appear to be attractive, it becomes clear after only brief examination that it is not really practicable.The fact is that the system works in Scotland and Wales because they are regarded as special cases, singled out for exceptional treatment. We have seenthat at present the Whitehall departments in many instances take the lead inthe formulation of new policies, with the Scottish and Welsh Offices beinggenerally content to follow, making any marginal adjustments to meet anyspecial Scottish or Welsh need. If every region of Great Britain had its ownSecretary of State, and its own regional office with responsibilities for policymaking and execution in prescribed subjects, there would no longer befunctional departments as we now know them taking the lead in producingnational policies. In Chapter 17 we examined the consequences of the dispersal of the policy-making functions in a system of legislative devolution and notedthat it might very quickly produce a requirement for an elaborate machineryof consultation and co-ordination, leading perhaps to the formulation of whatwould amount in effect to a national policy by clumsy and inefficient means.1031. In a system of administrative devolution, with Parliament and thecentral government responsible for overall policy and regional Ministers withfunctions comparable to those of the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales, there would be a compelling need for the co-ordination of regional policies. This might best be achieved through the appointment of a Secretaryof State for Regional Affairs. The regional Ministers would have their ownofficials, but if there were not to be a quite unacceptable multiplication of staff engaged on work of the same kind they would have to rely to a largeextent on the staff of the central department, which would provide a wide range of common services to the regional offices as well as assist in the co-ordination of regional policies and action and the working out of national policies.1032. Legislation would generally have to be of national application. even now Scotland is often, and Wales is almost invariably, covered by general legisla-tion. Parliament could not cope with Bills coming from many different regions
other than in the exceptional case, and government policy would seldom haveregional variations of such magnitude as to require different Bills. The minister in charge of the central department would therefore have to be responsible forpresenting to Parliament any legislation on a regionalised service. Which minister would then be responsible for subordinate legislation ? The logic of the system would require all statutory powers to be vested in the regional Ministers. But ifeach Minister were to make his own regulations Parliament would be confrontedon each occasion with many different sets of regulations. If they were to be inthe same or virtually the same terms, they could be debated together, as now oftenhappens with English and Scottish matching regulations; in that case littlepurpose would have been served by having separate regulations. If, on the otherhand, the regulations of the regional Ministers showed significant differences,they might have to be considered separately by Parliament. Whether or not this were done the burden thrown on Parliament would be greatly increased, and the already difficult problem of providing for adequate scrutiny of regulations would be aggravated.1033. We do not see any satisfactory way round these difficulties. We believethat any arrangement in which powers and responsibilities were divided betweenthe Minister at the centre and the regional Ministers would be open to consider-able objections. In Scotland and Wales, by contrast, there is no overlappingof responsibilities; co-ordination of Great Britain policies is easily effectedsince the number of independent departments is small and the lead is taken bythe large functional departments in Whitehall. Also, while Scotland and Walesarguably get their share and perhaps a little more, they are not big enough,on their own, unduly to influence the overall situation in the allocation of resources. The oversight function would lose some of its value if all regionswere to be competing on level terms; while there can be two, or even three,special cases, not all cases can be special.Criticisms of the Secretary of State system1034. The Secretary of State system has been criticised as giving an inadequatedegree of devolution to Scotland and Wales. The freedom it confers on theScottish and Welsh Offices is said to be largely illusory. The main complaintsare that the functions of the Secretaries of State are too restricted; that their policies must be such as are acceptable to other Ministers, so that a comprehensive-sive set of separate Scottish and Welsh policies is not likely to emerge; that although the system may give Scotland and Wales more funds, it does not enable best use to be made of those funds, the budgets being subject to detailedTreasury control; that the system gives too much power to officials; and thatpolitics and democratic influence remain concentrated in London, with Scotlandand Wales being political voids. In Scotland the system is criticised also asallowing inadequate attention to be paid to the distinctive Scottish system of law.1035. To the extent that these criticisms are valid, they may call for theadoption of some quite different form of devolution. Our concern in this chapteris with the possibility of meeting some part of the criticisms by a modificationof the Secretary of State system itself.
Possible changes in the system1036. The question we have to consider is whether the position of the secretaries of State could in any way be strengthened by adding to their responsibilities without producing unacceptable adverse effects on the generalsystem of government. In the case of Wales the obvious line of advance is toextend the responsibilities of the Secretary of State by making them morenearly coincide with those of the Secretary of State for Scotland.1037. The office of Secretary of State for Wales was created only in 1964.The functions initially taken over were those, such as housing, local governmentand roads, which were already operated largely through Welsh offices of the whithall departments. The transfer of further functions has been determinedby the need to ensure an orderly assimilation of work and by considerations ofpracticability and cost. Good progress has been made. In 1969 the Welsh Officetook over full responsibility for a new range of subjects, including the health services, and joint responsibility for agriculture and fisheries; in the following years primary and secondary education and child care were added. other functions will no doubt follow. The most likely candidates for early transfer areto be found in the fields of technical and further education, local museums,libraries and galleries, the youth and community services and some aspects of passenger transport.1038. We think it right that, if the Secretary of State system is continued, the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales should in due course have broadly the same range of responsibilities. There might, however, be some exceptions.These could be justified on two grounds. The first would be where, because of thesmaller scale of operations in Wales, the additional costs and practical dis-advantages, for example in relation to the deployment of specialist staffs,might be considered to outweigh any advantages to be expected from transfer.The present arrangement for certain agriculture and fisheries powers to beexercised jointly by the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food may involve considerations of this kind; but in our view,unless there can be shown to be very marked disadvantages, the arrangementsfor Wales in this field should generally be brought into line with those forScotland. The second, and clearer, ground for exception concerns the functionsof the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor in relation to the system oflaw and the preservation of law and order. Unlike Scotland, Wales has no separate legal system, and we see no reason to think that it would derive any advantage from the assumption by the Secretary of State of responsibilities in this field.1039. It was suggested to us in evidence that there was a need for improve-ment in the arrangements in Scotland for the administration of the separatesystem of Scottish law. We were told that some uncertainty existed about the division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate.In this connexion we have noted the transfer in February 1973 from theSecretary of State to the Lord Advocate of some functions which had previously been exercised by the former or by the two Ministers jointly1. A particular proposal put to us was for the creation in Scotland of a new department with responsibilities corresponding to those of the Lord Chancellors Office in1 The Transferj5f Functions (Secretary of State and Lord Advocate) Order 1972.
England and Wales. We have not thought it necessary to enquire closely into these matters, which are very much on the margin of our terms of reference,and we express no view on them.1040. We have next to consider whether any additional functions could usefully be transferred to the Scottish and Welsh Offices which are not already the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland. One view expressedin evidence was that the extent of administrative devolution to Scotland,although not adequately recognised by the Scottish people, was already sosubstantial that further devolution would have to lie along a quite differentroad. This view was reinforced by those who held that administrative devolutionhad already gone about as far as was technically possible within the limits ofthe criteria laid down in the Balfour Report.1041. We examined in Chapter 16 the possibilities for devolution and the factors which would have to be taken into account. Although we were thereconcerned primarily with devolution to regional bodies with a measure of independence from the central government, similar considerations apply todevolution to regional Ministers and departments within the central govern-ment. Outside the trade and industry field, there is probably little scope forfurther transfers of functions. The functions which have not been transferredto the Scottish Office have been deliberately withheld, even though in somecases closely associated functions have been transferred, presumably becausethe balance of advantage has been considered both by the Scottish Office andby outside interests to point to the retention of central control. functions which might nevertheless be considered for transfer are the provision of govern-ment accommodation and control over domestic airports and air services.Universities are another possibility, but we think that on balance it would bebetter to continue the present arrangements whereby the University GrantsCommittee acts for universities throughout Great Britain. Indeed, in all thesecases the arguments for retaining central control are probably at least as strongas those in favour of transfer.1042. The Secretary of State system is often criticised because in relation totrade and industry the Secretaries of State have oversight responsibilities butnot the ultimate power of decision. In the light of continuing high rates ofunemployment in Scotland and Wales, it is argued that no form of devolutionwill be satisfactory that leaves responsibility for industrial development policies in the hands of Ministers in Whitehall. For people whose primary concern is with economic prosperity, those are the policies that matter most. But the twofunctions of government which bear most closely on the economic situationin the regions, including their level of employment, are the general management of the economy as a whole and the policy of encouraging expansion of industrial and commercial output in places where resources are under-used and discour-aging it in the places where resources are overstrained. The latter, which is apolicy of redistribution, must, no less than the former, be a function of centralgovernment.1043. This is not to say that the detailed application of a policy of redistribution-bution need be centralised; and indeed it is largely decentralised at present,in England as well as in Scotland and Wales. A possible further development
would be for the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales to assume responsi-bility for the new industrial development offices in their countries; but as the offices would have to continue to work within the framework of central policy,this could be only a modest addition to the Secretary of State&apos;s powers.1044. Even as things are, the close consultation which takes place betweenthe Scottish and Welsh Offices and the regional offices of the Department ofTrade and Industry in Scotland and Wales ensures that the Secretaries of Stateare in a strong position to influence industrial development in their countries.The Scottish and Welsh Offices have responsibility for land-use planning andfor the provision of the infrastructure houses, roads and other public services needed for industrial development. Essential co-operation with the central departments responsible for trade and industry is secured through the machineryof the Scottish Economic Council, the Scottish Economic Planning department and the Scottish Economic Planning Board, and through comparable machinery in Wales. The Secretaries of State share with their Cabinet colleagues responsi-bility for major policy towards the geographical redistribution of economic activity, and are indeed in a privileged position in being the only ministers in the Cabinet whose specific responsibilities are related to one part of GreatBritain. There is no possibility of the implications for Scotland and Wales ofexisting or proposed new policies being overlooked.1045. In financial matters generally the two Secretaries of State already exerta substantial influence, both in compiling the Scottish and Welsh estimates and,to a lesser extent, in negotiating changes of allocation after the estimates havebeen approved. But in some respects notably in the discretionary allocation of marginal expenditure their powers are less than those proposed for regionalMinisters in paragraphs 1016-1020 above; where that is so they might beincreased accordingly.summary1046. We have considered in this chapter the various forms that adminis-trative devolution can take, their strengths and weaknesses, and the ways inwhich they might be developed and extended to new functions and to otherparts of the country. Starting with the simplest form of administrative devolution, the decentralisation to regional offices of the staffs of governmentdepartments, we examined recent developments, the purposes served bydecentralisation and the circumstances in which it is likely to be useful. Wethen looked at the existing arrangements for the co-ordination of the work ofgovernment departments in the regions of England, and noted the obstacles in the way of achieving closer co-ordination lack of uniformity in the regional organisation of the various departments and the need for officials to continueto be responsible to the departments and Ministers from whom their powers are derived. A brief look at the French prefect system showed that there were no features of the system which could appropriately be introduced to confergreater power on officials in the very different circumstances of tins country,and that any arrangements designed to present to government a comprehensiveregional viewpoint would have to be based on the appointment of ministers in Ihe individual regions of England.1047. One possibility would be to appoint to the Department of the environment regional Ministers of rank and status equivalent to those of the
second-tier functional Ministers now in that department, at the same timereducing the number of functional Ministers. Regional Ministers would beresponsible under the Secretary of State for the execution of the department^policies in their regions. If it were to be accepted that they exercised in practice the final power of decision in all but the most exceptional cases, and that thegovernment looked to them to represent the regional viewpoint on matters which were the concern of other departments, they might come to enjoyconsiderable prestige in their regions. But there could be no assurance that thiswould be so. Their position and authority could easily be undermined if theSecretary of State showed a readiness to override their decisions, and he wouldbe under pressure to do so, particularly from local authorities and otherpowerful interests in the regions. As representatives of their regions, theMinisters would be in a weak position by comparison with the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales with their power bases and seats in the Cabinet.1048. Since it is generally recognised that the Secretary of State system hasconferred substantial benefits on Scotland and Wales, we have considered thepossibility of applying it to the regions of England. In our view, however,this would not be practicable. The system works in Scotland and Wales because it is confined to those areas only. If it were to be applied more generally muchof the advantage which Scotland and Wales derive from it would be lostbecause they would cease to be in a special position. There would also nolonger be functional departments giving a national lead, and governmentadministration would be enormously complicated without conferring on the regions any substantial benefits.1049. Finally we have looked at the strengths and weaknesses of theSecretary of State system itself. Although some changes could be made, mostof its alleged defects could be removed only by adopting a very different formof devolution to Scotland and Wales. If the system is retained we see only very limited scope for adding to the executive functions of the Scottish Office.The Welsh Office might progressively assume additional functions, though these should not necessarily include all the functions transferred to Scotland.
REGIONAL ORGANISATION WITHIN PARLIAMENTintroduction1050. In this chapter we consider arrangements whereby Parliament wouldconduct part of its business on a regional basis. This idea is not a new one.The House of Commons has for long devolved selected business affectingScotland and Wales to suitably constituted committees. But this regionalisationof the work of Parliament has been on a restricted scale, limited both in relationto the kind of business devolved and geographically to Scotland and Wales,with no corresponding devolution to committees for England or the english regions. We are here concerned with the possibilities of making wider use of regional committees.1051. We start by describing briefly the existing Parliamentary arrangementsfor the conduct of business of special concern to Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions, and we note their limitations. We then consider what wouldbe the object of any new arrangements and the form that they might take.In this chapter, as in other chapters in this Part of our Report, we are concerned only to identify and to evaluate possible new arrangements, and not to reach conclusions or make recommendations on their adoption.1052. To assist in our enquiries we invited the Study of Parliament Group,in which officers of the Houses of Parliament and political scientists meet todiscuss common problems, to let us have their views. Papers by individual members of the Group on the separate topics raised, together with the comments on those papers by the Group, are being published in our research series1.the present arrangementsScotland1053. There are at present four Scottish committees of the House ofCommons the Scottish Grand Committee, two Scottish Standing Committeesand the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. The first three are concernedwith aspects of Scottish legislation.1054. The Grand Committee consists of all seventy-one Scottish Members,with the addition of between ten and fifteen other Members selected so that asfar as possible the Committee will reflect the balance of parties in the Houseas a whole (although divisions in the Committee are rare). Usually when a scottish Bill is introduced in the House, it is referred for consideration inprinciple to the Grand Committee. The debate associated with Second Readingtakes place there; when the Bill is referred back to the House for SecondReading, this is normally purely formal and the Bill is then remitted to oneof the Scottish Standing Committees for its Committee Stage. It may later bereferred back to the Grand Committee for its Report Stage, though it seems tohave been the invariable practice for Report as well as Third Reading to betaken on the floor of the House. The House may decide in relation to aparticular Bill not to refer any part of the proceedings to the Grand or standing committees.1 Research Paper 5.
1055. The Scottish Grand Committee has functions other than those relatingto legislation. On not more than eight days in each session it may debate scottish affairs. Up to six of those debates are devoted to the estimates for which theSecretary of State for Scotland is responsible, the particular subjects for debatebeing selected by the Opposition. The other two days may be devoted to debates on other matters of concern to Scotland, referred to the Committee on aGovernment motion following consultation with the Opposition.1056. The two Standing Committees exist only to take the Committee stages of Scottish Bills. The first takes the main Scottish Bills, while the second isintended principally for consideration of Private Members&apos; Bills relating topurely Scottish affairs. Each consists of not less than sixteen Scottish Members,to whom may be added not more than thirty-four other Members, selected withregard to the party composition of the whole House.1057. The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs was first appointed in February1969 and was reappointed in the three succeeding Parliamentary sessions.Under its terms of reference the Committee was empowered to consider any matter involving government activity in Scotland. All its members have beenfrom Scottish constituencies, with government supporters in a majority. the subjects selected by the Committee have been economic planning and landresource use, on which reports were made in 1970 and 1972 respectively. TheCommittee&apos;s examination of economic planning extended over two sessions.The Committee (or its sub-committees) met on fifty-five occasions, on thirty-four of which Ministers, civil servants and other witnesses were closely questioned.Some of the public sessions were held in Scotland. The Committee appointedan economist as its expert adviser, and at the end of the day produced a lengthyreport with recommendations.Wales1058. The House of Commons committee structure for Wales is less elaboratethan that for Scotland. The only committee regularly appointed is the WelshGrand Committee, which consists of all thirty-six Members for Wales and monmouthshire, together with not more than five other Members. Matters are referred to the Committee on a Government motion following consultation withthe Opposition. There is no limit to the number of matters that may be referred,nor to the number of occasions on which the Committee may sit. The Committee,unlike the Scottish Grand Committee, is not empowered to consider estimates.1059. There are very few Bills which relate exclusively to Wales. There isprovision for such Bills to be examined by a standing committee including all members sitting for constituencies in Wales and Monmouthshire. In practice,Government Bills for Wales have had their Committee Stage on the floor of theHouse, and only a few Private Members&apos; Bills have been referred to a standingcommittee. There is no Select Committee on Welsh Affairs.England1060. There are no formal committees of the House of Commons for Englandor the English regions comparable to the Scottish and Welsh committees.Members wishing to raise regional matters in the House of Commons have tomake what use they can of the opportunities for debate provided on the floor ofthe House.
Criticisms of the present arrangements1061. These arrangements for the conduct by the House of Commons ofbusiness of regional concern have come under criticism as providing inadequateopportunity for Parliament to inform itself of regional needs and to influencegovernment policy making and administration to meet those needs.1062. The Study of Parliament Group papers draw attention to some of thesecriticisms. A paper on the Scottish committees makes the following points.There is no provision in any of the committees for putting Questions to theSecretary of State for Scotland and other Ministers in his department, andinsufficient time is allowed for Questions on the floor of the House. Whilethe Secretary of State can in theory be called to account in the Scottish GrandCommittee on any aspect of his administration, the opportunities for this are inpractice severely limited. Except for its work on Scottish Bills, the Committeemeets on at most eight days a year for debates on selected topics. Each debateis limited to two and a half hours. The Committee does not vote, and some ofthe matters selected for discussion are said to be of no very great importance or public interest. The debates on the Scottish estimates are confined to selectedtopics, and so do not provide an opportunity either for critical examination ofthe Secretary of State&apos;s policies over a wide field or for a detailed examinationof the various heads and sub-heads of his Vote. There is no Scottish estimates committee or Public Accounts Committee, though the Scottish estimates andthe accounts of Scottish departments, like those of the Whitehall departments,are subject to scrutiny by the main committees. Nor is there any special machinery for probing projected government expenditure in Scotland. Theconclusion reached in the paper, which is supported by the Group, is that, whilethe Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has been a useful addition to theScottish committees, the present arrangements still do not provide adequatelyfor the proper performance by Parliament of its inquisitive, deliberative,redressive and controlling functions in relation to Scottish business viewed asa whole.1063. The Group also regards the arrangements made for the conduct of welsh business in Parliament as falling short of what is desirable. It is saidthat there exists a feeling that the Welsh Grand Committee, of which much was expected when it was established in 1960, has been a relatively ineffective body.1064. These findings of the Study of Parliament Group support with factualdetail and argument the views expressed in more general terms by those of our witnesses who considered the government of Scotland and Wales to be too little open to scrutiny by Parliament and that, perhaps as a consequence,there is little public awareness of what the Scottish and Welsh Offices are doing.The feeling exists that the system of administrative devolution to these depart-ments, unaccompanied by strong democratic checks, puts too much power inthe hands of civil servants. In the case of Scotland, the further criticism is made that the special arrangements for the consideration of Scottish legislation are inadequate, with the result that much of it is either unduly delayed or not properlyformulated and digested.1065. If the arrangements for Scotland and Wales are inadequate, for theEnglish regions, as we have already noted, there are no committees of the Houseof Commons at all and no formal arrangements for the conduct of regional
business. There has been no change in Parliamentary procedures to match the developments in regional organisation and planning machinery on the govern-ment side. Yet in recent years Members of Parliament have shown an increasinginterest in regional affairs, and more and more have come together for regionalpurposes in ad hoc groups, usually within the parties but sometimes on anall-party basis, a tendency that has been encouraged by the appointment of regional Whips. If a government proposal has significance for a particularregion, it is now common for Members from that region to band together as a means of more effectively lobbying Ministers; and there has been an increasein the number of debates on regional topics in both Houses of Parliament,with the Northern and South West regions attracting the most attention.possible changes1066. If it is accepted that the existing Parliamentary procedures fall short of what is needed for the proper discussion and despatch of business of regionalconcern, it does not follow that remedies must necessarily be sought throughthe reform of those procedures. The authors of the Study of Parliament Grouppaper on the Scottish committees, while they recommended some changes,expressed their own doubts whether Parliamentary remedies alone, unaccom-panied by some measure of devolution of power, would suffice.1067. On the other hand, if there is a widespread feeling that regionalinterests are being neglected, it does not necessarily follow that there is a needfor additional regional machinery. It is at least in principle possible that some change in the organisation of central government would give as great, orgreater, satisfaction. We have, therefore, approached this part of our worknot simply in a remedial spirit, that is, considering whether and how to fill ingaps in the present, rather tenuous, regional committee structure in Parliament.Accepting that discontents are best provided for in a democratic way wherever possible, we have asked ourselves whether there is some means by which Parlia-ment itself, the ultimate democratic authority, could be reorganised to give greater satisfaction to regional interests.A central government^ regional policy1068. It is sometimes said that successive governments have had no regional policy, with the implication that they should have had. There is some evidencethat since 1963, when the office of the President of the Board of Trade wasrenamed that of Secretary of State for Trade, Industry and Regional Develop-ment, governments have sensed the need for such a policy. It was, for instance,under the Labour Government of 1964 that new regional machinery was setup in the form of economic planning boards and councils. But if one examinesthe content of such a policy, it seems to be mainly a policy towards distributionof industry, which seeks to correct the imbalance between the industrial base of various parts of the country (and which, with frequent changes of direction and emphasis but with a steadily mounting proportion of national resourcesdevoted to it, has been in existence since the late 1930s), together with someimproved co-ordination between the regional offices of the various departments.1069. In the wider field of regional policy it is arguable that the govern-menfs chief function is to &quot;hold the ring&quot; between regions (and, for that matter,areas larger or smaller than regions in any accepted geographical sense), to
compensate for lack of resources and opportunities in some places by redistribution-buting a surplus of resources and opportunities which are to be found in other places, but always with an eye to the growth of both in the country as a whole.This policy of redistribution between areas is analogous to the policy of redistribution between individuals, which is the objective of a progressive tax system and of much social policy. It could be said that regional policy can beachieved by the instruments of national policy in, for example, education and health, and that, being essentially a matter of redistribution, the policy canbe implemented only from the centre. But to the extent that there is a feeling that the process is not being carried as far and effectively as it might be in termsof regional interests, some comparison between the aggregate effect on regions of the operation of various national policies should show whether there isscope for a greater degree of regional distribution than is at present being achieved under existing procedures. Even if the comparison showed the contrary,the demonstration would have value in proving that a feeling that a region was&quot;getting less than its share&quot; was fallacious.Regional statistics and forecasts1070. For a comparison of this kind a solid basis of detailed fact is indis-pensable. There is a lack of regional statistics which would have to be repaired;and in order to bring influence to bear on the distribution of resources inadvance of the event, regional forecasts would be necessary. It would take timeto provide the necessary figures in a fully satisfactory way. But there shouldbe no insuperable technical difficulty in providing regional figures, and inparticular in producing the public expenditure forecasts in a regional form; thelatter would be a useful start.1071. For some years now the government has carried out annually a detailed and comprehensive Public Expenditure Survey, concerned with the broadallocation of resources to the public sector and the detailed allocation to itscomponent parts. Each year figures are presented to Parliament in a white paper giving details of the expected out-turn of expenditure for the year inquestion and of the governments expenditure proposals for each of the next four years. These procedures are now being extended to provide both a detailed analysis of existing programmes and of major policy options on them andexplicit statements of the objectives of the proposed expenditure.1072. The White Papers have included some separate figures for Scotlandand Wales, but these have been incomplete in many respects. The figures havenot, for example, included expenditure in Scotland and Wales by departmentsother than the Scottish and Welsh Offices, or by the nationalised industries,and the Scottish and Welsh Office figures have not been broken down underthe main subject headings as have the figures of other departments. A singlefigure is, for example, given for education, whereas the Department of education and Sciences figures are set out in some detail. For the separate English regionsno figures at all have been given. It is not that useful information is being with-held from Parliament; regional figures are for the most part not known to thedepartments themselves. Since the regional implications of alternative policieshave not been worked out there are no overall regional figures. If it is thoughtimportant to consider these implications the figures could, with some expense of
resources, be produced. The expense would certainly be no more, probablyrather less, than that needed for any system of executive devolution applied tothe whole of Great Britain.A possible regional structure for Parliament: House of Lords or House ofCommons?1073. In our view it would be neither practicable nor desirable for a change inthe structure of Parliament to give effect to a regional policy to take the formof a change in the House of Lords. Reform of the House of Lords raises con-siderations extraneous to the question of regional government, and recenthistory shows that these considerations would prevent any change in the nearfuture; if a regional structure for Parliament were thought advantageous,therefore, it would be inadvisable to link it with the House of Lords. Moreover,Members of the House of Commons are, in the nature of the case, representa-tive of the interests of geographical units in the form of constituencies and these interests could readily be amalgamated into regional committees. If any element of regional structure were to be introduced into Parliament it would seemrational to build on a long-standing tradition and adapt the existing arrange-ments of the House of Commons, and irrational to introduce a novelgeographical factor into the House of Lords.1074. In what follows, therefore, we concentrate on the possibility of a regional committee structure for the House of Commons. Any scheme of thiskind would, we are aware, involve a new approach. In some respects these committees would approximate to select committees; in others they would betaking over functions of the Chamber and would have to adopt at least someof the conventions of the Chamber. This follows from the functions that weenvisage.Functions of regional committees of the House of Commons1075. We identify three functions for regional committees. They might, first,take Parliamentary Questions of local and regional interest. Secondly, theymight take adjournment debates of local and regional interest. And, thirdly,they might undertake an examination of government policy towards the regions.These three functions are considered in more detail below.Parliamentary Questions1076. Question time is fundamental to the House of Commons. But there seems no overriding reason why all Questions should be put in the Chamber.Many, in formulation as well as intent, are of purely local concern and are putbecause Members recognise their obligation to their constituencies and to theirconstituents. There could be a considerable saving of time if Questions of thiskind were referred to regional committees, since the committees could meetsimultaneously, with the various departmental Ministers attending on differentdays. It could be objected that Members will always prefer the Chamber becauseof the importance to them, especially in relation to their constituencies, ofpublic appearances. But if there were no mechanism except regional com-mittees for Questions of this kind, the publicity would be transferred to thecommittees, which for this purpose at least would be open to the public and thepress.
Adjournment and other general debates1077. Much the same considerations apply to adjournment and other general debates. As it is, debates in the Chamber on topics of this kind aresparsely or more fully attended according to the scope, and therefore interest,of the debate. Similar attendance could be expected in regional committeeswith the advantage, again, that many of these operations could take placesimultaneously.Examination of government policy towards the regions1078. This involves two functions. Each committee would naturally examine,first, whether the effect on its region of national policies in aggregate was&quot;fair&quot; and, secondly, whether the resources to be assigned within the regionwere appropriately assigned. The basis for both, as described in paragraphs 1070-1072 above, would be regional statistics and forecasts of public expenditure,both capital and current. The first function does not imply that each com-mittee would devote a great amount of time to examining the figures for other regions in detail, though the committees would no doubt pay considerable attention to comparative regional figures of significant totals (for example, onthe manpower side, activity rates and unemployment, and on the financial side,personal income, possibly taxation yield and certainly public expenditure).The second function would require much more detailed examination of thefigures. It is here that a frequently recurrent theme in the evidence of witnesses,especially those whom we saw in private, would be put to the test. It can becolloquially expressed as follows &quot;We, in the region, want above all thingsa new hospital, for which there is no provision in the national programme, andwant rather less the new technical college, for which the national programmedoes provide; we should like to be able to substitute the first for the second.&quot;Composition of Parliamentary regional committees1079. The functions described in paragraph 1075, as amplified in the succeeding paragraphs, are of a varied character. The first principle is that anyMember of Parliament representing a constituency in the region should be free to attend any meeting of his regional committee. This is particularlynecessary in relation to the first and second functions (Parliamentary questions and adjournment debates). But for the exercise of the third function (the examination of government policy towards the region) it seems desirable that,while all should be free to attend, there should be appointed a smaller numberof Members to undertake the responsibility of attending and producing areport to the House as a whole. In other words, the committee would assumein relation to the first two functions the conventions of the Chamber, and inrelation to the third the conventions of a select committee.Effect on Whitehall departments1080. To service the third function, government departments would have to devise machinery for the presentation to the House of Commons of the variousregional figures. Further, they would need to organise themselves in such a way as to make it possible for Ministers and officials to explain the regional applica-tions of national policy; we discussed in our last chapter ways in which this might be done.
Definition of regions1081. The introduction of any regional dimension into government intro-duces problems of geography in England. A system of executive devolution,for instance, would require precise regional boundaries to be drawn for all purposes since each region would be governed by a separate assembly. Nodrawing of the map would avoid artificiality and indeed, in relation to somefunctions, absurdity. Something of the same problem would arise in relationto regional committees of the House of Commons, though in that case theproblems might well prove less intractable in practice. The scope of eachcommittee would be drawn by grouping constituencies in a way which was generally thought convenient to the House. Since executive functions wouldnot be exercised it would not greatly matter if, for instance, there were not complete congruity between the regional statistics for all purposes.Objections to a system of regional committees of the House of Commons1082. We identify five possible objections as follows:(a) the system would produce committees of varying size;(b) not enough Members would be found to serve on them;(c) the consequential burdens on Parliamentary and departmental staff wouldbe too heavy;id) the committees would cut across the party system; and(e) there would be a break with Parliamentary tradition.We comment on these below.Size of committees1083. Although, as we have already said, the correspondence between thegeography of Parliamentary committees and the present administrative regionsneed not be exact there must clearly be a broad correspondence. It followsinevitably that the size of the committees must vary considerably from theextremes of, say, 188 Members in the South East to eighteen in East Anglia.But these figures represent only the number of Members who would havethe right to attend. Attendance for Parliamentary Questions and adjournmentdebates would be likely in practice to be much smaller, and in any case disparityin actual or potential size for the exercise of those functions would be of no great significance. The working groups appointed in each region to considergovernment policy for the region would for practical purposes need to be ofsize comparable to select committees, which according to present practicecan have as few as six and as many as fifty Members. Each regional committeewould decide for itself the size of the group appropriate to exercise its functions;the disparities in size of these working groups would in practice probably bemuch less than those of the main committees.The servicing of committees: Members1084. The problem of manning Parliamentary committees is already great.The availability of Members to serve on regional committees is likely to beaffected by two recent developments. The first arises out of the new demands made upon Members as a consequence of the United kingdom&apos;s  accession
to the European Communities. All Members have an interest in the activitiesof the Community institutions, while some are more directly concerned through their membership of the European Parliament. The other development is the increasing use being made by the House of Commons of select committees for more general or functional purposes. Regional committees would be in additionto them.1085. Clearly there must be a limit to the number of committees on which members can serve, and the House itself must determine its priorities. Witha new focus in Brussels it might, however, be thought that the danger of a feeling of remoteness in the regions was increased and that steps to prevent it by a reorganisation in Parliament were desirable and necessary, even at theexpense of some of the existing committee structure of the House.Meetings of the committees1086. Committee work not only imposes an additional burden on individual members; it creates a problem of finding suitable times for the committees tomeet. Committee meetings are generally held at times when the House is not itself sitting, but this is not always possible. When committees have to meetduring sittings of the House, their Members are prevented from attendingand playing a full part in debates there. Business has to be planned so as to minimise a clash of interests, and the possibility of such a clash increases if anumber of committees on disparate subjects meet at the same time. one possibility in the case of regional committees would be to provide for theHouse to adjourn at certain times to allow the committees to meet. This mightnot be too difficult since some of the business of the committees would be ofa kind which now takes up time on the floor of the House.Servicing of committees: staff1087. A covering note to the papers prepared for us by members of the study of Parliament Group describes briefly the assistance and services atpresent available to Members for their work on select and standing committees.This shows that there is already great pressure on staff of the House ofCommons. Although there has recently been an expansion in staff, pressure would increase again if additional regional committees were to be appointed.This difficulty should not, however, be insurmountable. The limiting factor in any desired development in this field ought to be the capacity of members to serve on the committees, and Ministers to attend them as necessary, andnot the facilities that can be made available to them.1088. So far as departments are concerned the reorganisation necessary toserve Parliamentary committees would be no different, in kind or degree, fromthat required in any system of devolution which affected the whole country.The conventions of the parties1089. On the face of it, a committee structure which did not reflect therelative strengths of the Government and the Opposition in the House would create difficulties and cut across the party structure. But regional committees would not be making decisions; their opinions and recommendations on theGovernments policy for the regions would be those of the Members directly
concerned, and we see no disadvantage in this even when the majority ofMembers are of a political party different from that of the Government.Moreover it has been the frequent practice of select committees to produceunanimous reports, irrespective of party interest. We see no need, therefore,for a committee to include Members other than those representing the regionconcerned merely in order to reflect the balance between Government and opposition in the House.A change in the procedure of the House of Commons1090. Any scheme on these lines would mean some change in the procedures of the House of Commons. But Members of Parliament are perhaps moresensitive than most people to public feeling. If there is thought to be anunsatisfied desire for regional expression and that this would better be met by changes in the arrangements of the House of Commons than by devolution of power from Parliament, we find it hard to believe that Members would stickto the old conventions of the House. Any system of devolution which requirestransfer of power to other institutions might be less palatable to Members than some rearrangement of the work of the House of Commons.1091. But would there be any advantages in rearrangement at Westminsterand Whitehall over devolution from the centre ? One, certainly. There could beno anxiety, as with some systems of devolution, about preserving the unity ofthe United Kingdom. An additional one might be this. The Members of theHouse of Commons, who have always been concerned with policy at national level and the effects of policy at local level, must in future also be concernedwith policy at the European level. It would strengthen their position if, in combination in regional groupings, they were able to assess the effects of national and European policy on areas of the country intermediate between national and local and so be in a position to contribute to the formulation of policy fromthis point of view. If there is any case for a regional dimension of policy, it is atleast arguable that the House of Commons is the best place for creating it, both from the point of view of effectiveness in relation to national and Europeanpolicy and because a democratically elected body rooted in but not confined to local interests is the best safeguard against decisions taken, whether in london or Brussels, in ignorance of their effects on the people.1092. The regional structure of the House of Commons could be consideredeither in substitution for or in combination with some form of devolution. Itcould not be combined with executive devolution for Great Britain as a whole;nor would it be compatible with legislative devolution in respect of any regionwhere such devolution applied. But it would be possible for regional committees of Parliament to operate for England, either alone or alongside some form ofconsultative machinery in the English regions, consistently with legislative devolution in Scotland and Wales.
PART VIIIOUR CONCLUSIONS ON DEVOLUTION
THE BACKGROUND TO OUR CONCLUSIONS1093. Having examined all the posibilities, we now record our conclusions on the forms of devolution that it would be appropriate to apply to the various parts of Great Britain. In this chapter, we first summarise our earlier findingson the defects in the present system of government and our views on theprinciples to be applied in considering measures of reform. We then examinethe scope for having systems of government which differ in the various partsof the country, and explain the basis on which our conclusions are presented.The chapter ends with a list of the schemes which have some measure of supportamong us. We describe these schemes more fully in Chapters 24 and 25, thefirst dealing with Scotland and Wales and the second with England. Chapter 26then draws together the proposals for the separate countries, and assesses the contribution they might make to the removal of existing defects and causes of complaint.the defects to be remediedThe general position1094. In Chapter 8 we briefly reviewed the changes that have taken place inthe government of this country over the last hundred years. We noted the immense increase in the scope, scale and complexity of government activity and the fact that, while the machinery of government has been substantiallychanged to enable it to meet the new demands made upon it, the changes have in the main involved the modification and adaptation of existing institutionsrather than the creation of new institutions. Our appointment appeared torecognise the existence of some dissatisfaction with government, and at the outset of our enquiry it seemed to us at least possible that a situation had beenreached in which some more fundamental reforms might be needed.1095. In Chapters 9 and 10 we sought to identify the defects in existing arrangements by examining the complaints brought to our attention and the remedies suggested to us. Our findings are briefly summarised in the paragraphswhich follow. Most of the complaints were seen to arise either from the centralisation-tion of government in London or from developments which have tended to weaken the democratic element in government. In Scotland and Wales thenature and extent of the dissatisfaction are influenced by the existence ofnational feeling.Centralisation1096. The main complaint under this heading is that too much governmentactivity is centred on London, which as a result has too dominating an influence on the life of the country. This centralisation of the ever increasing volume ofgovernment business is said to impose such strains on both Westminster andWhitehall that congestion and delay are caused and the quality of the decisions taken is adversely affected. Provincial leaders believe that more decisions shouldbe taken in the regions by people living and working there and possessing agreater knowledge of the regions&apos; needs and interests. They want, probably more than anything else, a fair share of public money for their regions and some means of ensuring that regional as well as national priorities are taken intoaccount in deciding how it is spent. It is argued that the dispersal of government
power to provincial capitals would provide opportunities for using politicaltalents which are now wasted, and would help to attract other centres of power,in the commercial, industrial and cultural fields.1097. Our enquiries suggest that as a counter to over-centralisation a majorityof people would probably favour a moderate degree of devolution. But the precise nature of devolution is not well understood, and few people have thought out its implications. It is not, for example, generally appreciated thatit could lead to variations in standards between different regions; and whetherpeople in fact want varying standards or uniform standards is by no meansclear.The weakening of democracy1098. Under this heading a number of specific complaints are made about theworking of the machinery of Parliament. They relate to the powers of thePrime Minister, the government and the party whips, and to the role of thebackbench Member of Parliament. The right to vote for a Parliamentarycandidate every five years or so is said to be no longer an adequate expression of the democratic will. And the drift towards government by nominated bodiesis regarded as having gone too far.1099. More generally, it is felt that government has developed a momentumof its own which seems to leave the people out of account. It is thought to beremote from them, insufficiently sensitive to their views and feelings and too much carried on behind closed doors, and to have enlarged its activities at theexpense of individual freedom without providing adequate machinery for appealsand for the redress of grievances and without giving the people effective guidance on how to deal with the multitude of government organisations. In relation tothese complaints, most people feel that government should do more to keep intouch with them and take their views into account. A significant minority of people, perhaps as many as a quarter, also feel that they are qualified to partici-pate in government in a more direct way, though there is no clear evidencethat they would do so if given the opportunity.National feeling1100. In both Scotland and Wales we have found that, while only smallminorities favour complete independence, there are larger numbers of people who wish their distinctive national identities to be recognised in the system ofgovernment in some way falling short of political separation.1101. In these two countries the centralisation of politics and government inLondon is resented more than it is in England. The present extent of adminis-trative devolution to the Scottish and Welsh Offices is not generally recognised;but even among people who are well informed about the activities of those offices and know that, largely through their endeavours, Scotland and Wales havefared better than most regions of England in the per capita allocation of public expenditure and in other ways, there is criticism that the present system doesnot permit the best use to be made of the funds provided and encourage thedevelopment of distinctive and coherent Scottish and Welsh policies. A particularcomplaint is that economic policies designed for the United Kingdom as a wholehave been inappropriate for Scotland and Wales. In Scotland another complaint
is that Scots law is not sufficiently understood in London or catered for inUnited Kingdom legislation. There is a substantial feeling also that the scottish office should be subject to closer democratic supervision. To some extent thereis a similar feeling in Wales about the Welsh Office, though pro-democraticsentiment there tends to be more often directed against the ad hoc appointedbodies.Our general assessment1102. These, very briefly, are the complaints that are made. Having regardto both their nature and their strength, the general impression we have formedis that, while the people of Great Britain as a whole cannot be said to be seriously dissatisfied with their system of government, they have less attachmentto it than in the past and there are some substantial and persistent causes of discontent which may contain the seeds of more serious trouble. We think thatdevolution could do much to reduce the discontent. It would counter over-centralisation and, to a lesser extent, strengthen democracy. It would be aresponse to national feeling in Scotland and Wales. In so far as the discontentis not regional in character, but arises from unsatisfactory aspects of the relationship between government and the people at large, devolution wouldprobably be of limited value; we comment on this at the end of Chapter 26 and again in Chapter 27.Constitutional principles1103. Having established the causes of dissatisfaction with the existing systemof government, we discussed in Chapter 11 the principles which in our viewought to be taken into account in judging the suitability of any proposed measures of reform. We give here a brief summary of the conclusions reached.1104. We believe that the essential political and economic unity of theUnited Kingdom should be preserved. Subject to that, diversity should berecognised. New arrangements should be such as will be regarded as a naturaldevelopment out of what has gone before. They should have regard to cost andworkability, and be likely to prove acceptable and produce the results desired.In the fluid conditions of the present day, with a good deal of change going on at home and with entry into the European Communities, there is much tobe said for reforms which can readily be adapted to suit changing circum-stances. Flexibility is desirable, too, in the actual working of any new system.Government as a whole, irrespective of the form of its institutions, should bedemocratic and human, should pay due regard to the preservation of the liberty of the individual and should wherever possible be carried out in the open.our approach to devolutionThe limits of devolution1105. To remove the causes of discontent, particularly those arising underthe heading of centralisation, most people look to the transfer of power to a level of government in the regions (a term which, for convenience, we have usedthroughout this Report to apply to Scotland and Wales as well as to the regions of England, while recognising that the separate national identities of Scotlandand Wales put them into a different category and that in Scotland the term is at
present used in a quite different sense to denote the top tier of local authorities).It was primarily for the purpose of examining the possibilities of such a transferof power that we were appointed.1106. In the application of our general principles we have, for the reasons give in Chapters 12 and 13 respectively, rejected both separatism, which wouldinvolve the breaking up of the United Kingdom into a number of separateindependent states with sovereignty in all matters, and federalism, which wouldinvolve the creation of states within the United Kingdom sharing sovereigntywith the centre. We have concentrated for the most part on forms of devolution,that is on arrangements which would provide for the exercise of governmentpowers at the regional level while preserving to the central authorities full sovereignty and ultimate power in all matters. Having examined all the possi-bilities, we now have to decide whether the adoption of any particular form of devolution, or of any combination of forms of devolution, would be desirable in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the people of England,Scotland and Wales.The case for and against uniformity1107. One important matter we have had to consider is the extent to whichsystems of government may be permitted to differ from one part of the UnitedKingdom to another. One of the main objects of devolution is to allow policies to be formulated and applied in such a way as to meet differing regional require-ments. But can recognition of the diversity of the United Kingdom and of theneed to have some policies. determined or applied regionally extend to theadoption of substantially different systems of government? Or does thepreservation of political and economic unity impose limitations in this respect?1108. We are not agreed on this. Two of us1, believing that all citizens ofthe United Kingdom should enjoy equality of political rights and obligations,think that all should have the same relationship with government in aninstitutional sense. They should have equal opportunity to participate in theirown government. The political unity of the United Kingdom depends upon this principle of equality of rights and treatment. On this view, if a representativeassembly is established in one region all other regions should have similarassemblies, with a range of functions which is comparable if not identical.Rights conferred on one component of the United Kingdom cannot be denied to another. If it is thought to be in the interest of good government under theCrown to have an elected assembly in Scotland or in Wales, it should not be denied to the regions of England. The grant of a measure of self-government to scotland or Wales alone, with nothing comparable in the English regions, would produce a situation of intolerable anomaly and injustice. If Scotland and Walescontinued to have representation at Westminster (as we unanimously recom-mend) Scottish and Welsh citizens would enjoy two votes one for a representa-tive in their national assembly and one for a representative in the UnitedKingdom Parliament to the Englishman&apos;s one, and the Scottish and Welshassemblies would enjoy complete autonomy in the domestic functions devolvedto them, while the English would be denied a similar autonomy in purely Englishaffairs, which would continue to be determined by a Parliament including alarge number of Scottish and Welsh Members. The very measure, therefore,
which conferred the good of domestic autonomy upon Scotland and wales would automatically deny the same good to England. This could lead, andwould be likely to lead in some cases, to decisions being arrived at in domesticEnglish affairs which did not command an English majority. In the view of thetwo of us who take the minority view, this is unacceptable, and would be unacceptable to the English people.1109. The rest of us do not take this view, and consider that neither on grounds of principle nor for any practical reason is it necessary for the samesystem of government to be applied to all parts of the country. The equality of democratic rights which is a necessary consequence of political unity is seen asrelating to the opportunity to vote for those responsible for operating govern-ment at the levels where power in fact resides, and not to the number of levels of government provided. There are already wide differences. Northern Ireland,under the new as well as the old constitution, has a form of legislative devolution.Scotland and Wales have administrative devolution, with the two Secretaries ofState possessing extensive but not identical powers. The English regions have afar less developed form of administrative devolution, with some central govern-ment powers being exercised by regional officials and, from time to time in thepast, by Ministers charged with special responsibilities for particular regions.Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, and sometimes even the separate regions of England, have thus been treated in accordance with their individual needs. These have differed in the past and may be expected to differ in the future.1110. The system of government that is best for one part of the country willnot necessarily be best for another. An important factor in deciding what is bestfor a particular region is the degree of support that the various possible systemsare likely to command there. Popular feeling differs greatly in the different partsof the United Kingdom, and in a country which depends on the contentedmembership of disparate groups provision is needed to satisfy the sense of community of each group. There is very little evidence of a demand for rep-resentative assemblies in the regions of England comparable to the demand forScottish and Welsh assemblies, and probably few people in England would consider that they had ground for complaint if assemblies were to be established in Scotland and Wales. If such assemblies were considered to be in the best interests of Scotland and Wales there would be no ground either for refusingthem because there was no similar requirement in the regions of England or for establishing them in England simply to match what was being done in Scotlandand Wales. If assemblies were to be established in Scotland and Wales and thislater led to a demand for similar assemblies in some or all of the english regions, that would be the time to consider establishing them. But that, in theview of the majority of us, is not so likely a consequence that it ought to beanticipated by laying down a uniform system of government at the outset.1111. If different systems of government are to coexist, they must be com-patible in the sense that any practical problems arising out of their interactionmust be capable of solution. We have, for example, noted the thorny problem ofthe representation of Scotland and Wales at Westminster if they alone were tohave legislative assemblies of their own; the difficulties are not, however, inthe view of most of us so great as to make legislative devolution to Scotlandand Wales impracticable unless it is extended to England.
The basis of our conclusions on devolution1112. One of the standards by which possible new systems of governmentshould be judged is the extent to which they are likely to be acceptable to thepeople concerned. Though the survey we commissioned has thrown some lighton people&apos;s attitudes to devolution, there is no clear evidence of what they want.This is not surprising since they do not know what the possibilities are, anymore than we did when our enquiries began. We have regarded our principalfunction as one of analysis, comprising the identification and presentation of thepossible solutions and of the arguments for and against them. We agree on this analysis. We would expect our Report to lead to public debate and the formula-tion of a more clearly defined public opinion. Only then will it be right for decisions to be taken. And since opinion is likely still to be divided, and this isa matter requiring the exercise of political judgement, the final decisions mustbe political.1113. We have nevertheless thought it right, for the full discharge of theduty imposed upon us by our terms of reference, that we should state thesolutions we ourselves prefer. While we are agreed on the analysis, we aredivided in our preferences. We should have been pleased to be able to recordagreement on all points, but we do not think that this lack of agreement shouldsignificantly diminish the value of the Report. These are, as we have said,matters of opinion and political judgement. Coming as we do from many different walks of life and from different parts of the country, it is natural thatwe should attach different weights to the various factors that have to be takeninto account. Compromise solutions would not be appropriate. Where we aredivided, we say so and state our reasons.the range of possible solutions1114. In the next two chapters we describe, first for Scotland and wales and then for England, the main features of the schemes of devolution whichhave some measure of support among us and the reasons for that support.The chapters are intended to be read in the light of the more detailed discussions in Parts VI and VII of the scope for devolution and the forms that it might take.1115. It will be helpful to indicate here in general terms, for each of the three countries, the schemes which have some measure of support. For Scotlandthere are three schemes, one based on the devolution to a directly elected assembly of full powers in prescribed subjects, including the power to determinepolicy and to make laws (legislative devolution), a second based on the devolution-tion to a directly elected assembly of responsibility for subordinate policymaking and administration (executive devolution), and a third involving theestablishment of a directly elected assembly or council with advisory anddeliberative functions and some powers in relation to Scottish legislationintroduced in the United Kingdom Parliament. For Wales there are the samethree schemes, though in the case of the third without functions in relation to legislation. For the English regions there is support first for executive devolution-tion, secondly for a scheme of regional councils, part indirectly elected by localauthorities and part nominated by the central government, with advisory andco-ordinating functions, and thirdly for maximum devolution to local authoritiestogether with a system of regional committees consisting entirely of repre-sentatives of local authorities and directed towards narrower functions.
SCOTLAND AND wales the need for a representative assembly1116. We have found it convenient to set out our proposals for both Scotlandand Wales in one chapter. Although some of us prefer one scheme for Scotlandand another for Wales, the range of schemes proposed, and many of thearguments advanced in their favour, are similar for the two countries. All theschemes provide for the establishment of a directly elected Scottish or welsh assembly, and we start by giving our reasons for favouring such an assembly.We then describe in turn the particular schemes proposed, first legislative devolution, then executive devolution, and lastly schemes in which the assembly would have mainly advisory functions.Scotland1117. Opinion in Scotland is divided on the need for a representativeassembly. On the one hand there is, especially among those who have acquiredknowledge and understanding of the working of the existing system of admini-strative devolution, a good deal of support for the continuance of that system onthe ground that Scotland derives from it benefits which are considerably greaterthan is generally recognised and which would be put at risk if some quite different arrangements were to be made for Scotland&apos;s government. On theother hand, there is widespread support for a representative assembly, which isthought to be needed both in recognition of Scottish national identity and as a means of giving the Scottish people greater control over their own affairs.1118. So far as we are able to judge, the support for a Scottish assembly is growing. It is possible that, in the light of our Report, when people may bebetter able to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the existing arrange-ments and of the possible alternatives, this trend will be halted or reversed.But we think it more likely that support for an assembly will continue to grow.On this assumption (and, in the case of those of us who believe in uniformity,subject to similar arrangements being made in all parts of Great Britain) thefirst preference of all of us involves the setting up in Scotland of a directly elected assembly, exercising in relation to Scotland some of the responsibilitiesthat now rest with the United Kingdom Parliament or Government.1119. We are not agreed on the nature and extent of the powers that shouldbe conferred on the assembly. But we all see the establishment of an assembly,and the conferment upon it of the particular functions proposed in our preferredschemes, as being an appropriate means of recognising Scotland&apos;s nationalidentity and of giving expression to its national consciousness. The assembly would have as its exclusive concern the welfare of Scotland as a whole, and itwould be in a position to speak authoritatively for the Scottish people. its deliberations, and the publicity given to them, would both help to create aninformed Scottish opinion and enable United Kingdom Ministers to be given a better understanding of Scottish needs and interests. It would be able to devote far more time and attention to Scottish affairs than Parliament possibly
can, and would have a greater understanding of them. To the extent that powersof decision were transferred to it, the degree of democratic accountability forthe administration of Scottish affairs would be enhanced.Wales1120. Wales has a system of administrative devolution which, while not soextensive as that in Scotland, has developed rapidly since the Welsh Office was established in 1964 and, if no different form of devolution is adopted, may beexpected to be further developed in the coming years. The appointment ofa Secretary of State for Wales with a seat in the Cabinet, which had been longdemanded by Welsh people, has brought substantial benefit to the Principality.Many of our witnesses, particularly among those representing local authorities,thought it important that Wales should continue to have a strong voice atthe centre to ensure that its economic, social and other interests were properlyrepresented and safeguarded.1121. At the same time there is strong support, not least among informedWelsh opinion, for the establishment of a representative Welsh assembly.Although, by comparison with Scotland, Wales is more closely associated with england in matters of law, administration and economics, the people of wales have no less strong a feeling than the Scottish people that their national identitymust be preserved, and this is reinforced by concern for the Welsh economy and the Welsh language and institutions. There is deep anxiety that the nationalidentity and interests are subject to a continuous process of erosion. This is seen to be the result not of deliberate policies, but rather of a lack of policiesor at least of policies which pay sufficient regard to particular Welsh needs.1122. Wales is a relatively small part of the United Kingdom, and itsproblems cannot be expected to figure disproportionately in the deliberationsof a Parliament and government which have responsibilities for the peopleof the United Kingdom as a whole. However sympathetic the administrationmay be, it cannot bring as much time, attention and understanding to the affairs of Wales as could the Welsh people themselves if the appropriatemachinery existed. While, therefore, as in the case of Scotland, we differ onthe functions it should exercise, we all see a need for a directly elected assembly which would have as its exclusive concern the welfare of Wales and be able to speak openly and authoritatively on matters of Welsh interest. Through suchan assembly the aspirations and needs of the Welsh people would be fully discussed and formulated and made known to the United Kingdom parliament and Government. Wales would be given the assurance it needs that its problemswere being examined in sufficient depth and with adequate understanding.Our preferred solutions1123. Eight1 of us favour a scheme of legislative devolution for Scotland.Of these, all but two2 favour legislative devolution for Wales also. those two favour for Wales an assembly with deliberative and advisory functions.One3 of us favours assemblies with deliberative and advisory functions for1 Lord Kilbrandon, Mr. Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr. Longmuir, Professor Newark,Professor Street, Sir Ben Bowen Thomas and Mrs. Trenaman.2 Professor Street and Mrs. Trenaman.3 Sir David Renton.
both Scotland and Wales, with the addition in the case of the Scottish assemblyof some powers in relation to Parliamentary legislation. two of us, whosupport the principle of uniformity, favour schemes of executive devolutionfor both Scotland and Wales (and for the regions of England).1124. We describe below each of these schemes in turn, and the grounds onwhich it is supported.a scheme of legislative devolutionGeneral description of the scheme1125. In this scheme responsibility for legislating on specifically definedmatters would be transferred to a Scottish or Welsh legislature consisting ofthe Sovereign and a directly elected assembly. Executive authority in relation tothe transferred matters would be exercised by Ministers appointed by theCrown from among the members of the assembly. The main features of schemesof this kind, and the questions which arise on them, have been discussed in chapter 17.1126. At the outset all existing legislation of the United Kingdom Parliamentapplying to Scotland and Wales would continue to apply. Thereafter anyamending or new legislation on transferred matters would ordinarily be enacted by the Scottish or Welsh legislature. Parliament and the central governmentwould continue to be responsible for matters not transferred, and for theinternational aspects of matters which were transferred. Parliament would retain ultimate legislative authority in all matters, but it would be a convention that in the ordinary course this power would not be used to legislate forScotland or Wales on a transferred matter without the agreement of theScottish or Welsh Government. The power would, however, be available foruse at any time without agreement in exceptional circumstances. The UnitedKingdom Government would also have power, for use in exceptional circum-stances, to determine, with the approval of Parliament, that a Bill passed by theassembly should not be submitted for the Royal Assent.1127. Although in essence the scheme is similar to that which was providedfor Northern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, there are anumber of important differences. The functions proposed for transfer are lessextensive, and only prescribed functions would be transferred. The assembly would be much larger than the old Northern Ireland House of Commons;it would be elected by proportional representation for a fixed term of fouryears, and there would be no second chamber. The financial arrangements would be very different.Transferred matters1128. Legislative responsibility would generally be transferred to the assemblyfor whole subject matters; exceptionally, responsibilityfor some subjects mightbe divided between Parliament and the assembly along lines laid down by statute.1129. The matters transferred to the Scottish assembly would be mainly,but not exclusively, those for which the Secretary of State for Scotland or theLord Advocate now has executive responsibility, either exclusively or together
with other Ministers. They are in the fields of the environment, education,health, social services, home affairs, legal matters, and agriculture, fisheries and food. Scottish Office matters which would not be transferred are electricity supply and some functions in the field of agriculture, fisheries and food, whereresponsibility for price support measures and other grants and subsidies would remain with Parliament, while responsibility for some other functions ofinternational concern, such as animal and plant health, would be divided.1130. Similarly, the matters transferred to the Welsh assembly would be mainly those for which the Secretary of State for Wales now has executive responsibility, either exclusively or together with other Ministers. They wouldbe broadly the same as those proposed for transfer to the Scottish assembly,except that most of the matters for which the responsibilities of the HomeSecretary and the Lord Chancellor now extend to Wales would not betransferred.1131. We have earlier pointed out that we are not in a position to reachfirm conclusions about the precise range of the matters to be transferred under any scheme of devolution, since this would require more detailed enquiry and consultation than it would have been appropriate for us to undertake. Withthis reservation, the matters suggested as being suitable for transfer to bothScottish and Welsh legislative assemblies are as follows:Local governmentTown and country planningNew townsHousingBuilding controlWater supply and sewerageAncient monuments and historic buildingsRoads (including the construction, use and licensing of vehicles)Road passenger transportHarboursOther environmental services (e.g. prevention of pollution, coast pro-tection and flood prevention)Education (probably excluding universities)Youth and community servicesSport and recreationArts and culture (including the Welsh and Gaelic languages)Social work services (including, for Scotland, probation and after-care)HealthMiscellaneous regulatory functions (including matters such as betting,gaming and lotteries, obscene publications, shop hours and liquorlicensing)Agriculture, fisheries and food (with the exceptions noted in para-graph 1129 above)ForestryCrown estatesTourism.
1132. The following additional matters might be transferred to the scottish assembly only:PoliceFire servicesCriminal policy and administrationPrisonsAdministration of justiceLegal matters, including law reformHighlands and Islands development (including crofting)Sea transport.1133. The assemblies would not have legislative or executive powers inother matters, except perhaps in some narrowly defined fields; they might, forexample, be given limited powers in relation to some aspects of consumer protection, railways, road freight, civil aviation and broadcasting. In theirdebates the assemblies would in no way be confined by the limitations on the range of matters transferred to them. As the voices of their respective nations,they would provide the means whereby the needs of Scotland or Wales could be viewed as a whole and expressed to the central government and its agencies.Financial arrangements1134. The assemblies would be allowed the greatest financial scope consistent with the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom. In our view this measure of financial autonomy is represented by the maximum arrangementestablished as practicable in Chapter 15. The application of that arrangement tolegislative assemblies has already been discussed in Chapter 17. The proposalsnow put forward are much condensed, and it is important that they should be read together with the detailed conclusions in the two earlier chapters. Theycould no doubt be modified in a number of ways, according to choice, and still remain workable. Whatever its final form, the chief object of any scheme wouldbe to give the Scottish and Welsh Governments maximum freedom in expendi-ture. Each would have its fair share of United Kingdom resources and freedom to allocate expenditure on the transferred services according to its own chosenpriorities.1135. The main features of the scheme proposed are set out in the following paragraphs in Scottish terms. The same arrangements would apply to Wales.1136. The scheme would require an exchequer board, acting in relation to both countries and independent of the Scottish, Welsh and United kingdom governments. The annual Scottish budget, which would be timed to fit in withthe central governmenfs Public Expenditure Survey, would be drawn up by theScottish Government in accordance with its own policies and standards of provision, and would be submitted to the exchequer board. Taking into account the representations of both the Scottish Government and the United KingdomTreasury, the board would recommend what Scotland&apos;s total expenditure should be. The Scottish Government could then in the ordinary course count on having revenues up to that amount. If its revenues consisted wholly of grants from United Kingdom funds, the total amount granted would be the
same as the total expenditure recommended by the board. If the ScottishGovernment was entitled to a share of United Kingdom taxes, the grant wouldequal the board&apos;s total less Scotland&apos;s share of the yield from those taxes. If itpossessed not only shared taxes but also devolved taxes, and was therefore ableto alter the level of taxation within Scotland, the grant would equal the board&apos;total less the Scottish yield from the shared taxes and less the yield which the devolved taxes would produce in Scotland if levied at the rates applying inother parts of the United Kingdom. In this case Scotland&apos;s total revenueswould be less than the board&apos;s total if it levied rates lower than elsewhere, andmore than the board&apos;s total if it levied rates higher than elsewhere. (this possible difference between approved total expenditure and actual revenue is discussed in paragraphs 686 to 691.)1137. The total expenditure recommended by the board might be rather more or rather less than the previous year&apos;s expenditure, allowing for normalincreases in costs, but in no circumstances would it be below a level adequate to finance all the transferred services.1138. In determining the Scottish Governments total expenditure the board would pay regard to the demand which that expenditure would make on realresources; subject to this its main object would be to furnish Scotland with sufficient money in total to finance United Kingdom standards in all the transferred services. These standards would be fixed by the board every fiveyears after an examination of the relevant services in all parts of the UnitedKingdom; the cost of providing them would be calculated in terms of totalexpenditure per head of population. The cost of providing them in scotland would allow for special Scottish conditions.1139. The sole purpose of the standards would be to calculate the totalmoney and resources to be allocated to Scotland; the Scottish Governmentwould not be obliged to adopt the individual standards in practice. It couldinstead choose to distribute its total expenditure in a different way, providinghigher standards in some services, offset by lower standards in others. At theend of five years the exchequer board would re-define United Kingdom standardsby reference to the standards actually being provided in the various parts of theUnited Kingdom (including Scotland) at that time; and, correspondingly, itwould re-compute their cost, thus arriving at a new figure of Scottish expenditureper head which, making due allowance for normal increases in costs, would serve as a yardstick for the next five years. The boards general policy, over thefive-year period, would be to move Scotland on to its proper standard ofexpenditure as quickly as current economic and financial circumstances allowed.The&quot;assembly1140. The Scottish or Welsh assembly would be a single-chamber body ofabout 100 members directly elected for a fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, using as far as possiblemulti-member constituencies obtained by grouping Parliamentary con-stituencies. Consideration might be given to the exceptional use of thealternative vote system in single-member constituencies in the sparsely populated areas of the Scottish Highlands and Islands, where geography would make
multi-member constituencies impracticable. All matters relating to the franchiseand elections to the assembly (but not elections to local authorities in Scotlandand Wales) would be reserved to Parliament.1141. It would be for the Scottish and Welsh people to decide on names fortheir assemblies. The term Convention seems to find some favour in Scotland,and Senate has been suggested for Wales.1142. Dual membership of Parliament and the assemblies would be per-missible, and indeed some common membership might be desirable. peers would not be debarred from membership of the assembly as they are from membership of the House of Commons; nor, in Scotland, would Ministeis ofthe Church of Scotland.The executive1143. There would be no Governor. The functions of the Crown wouldwhere necessary be performed by Royal Commissioners appointed for thatpurpose.1144. The devolved powers would be exercised by Ministers appointed bythe Crown and drawn from members of the assembly. A Cabinet system ofgovernment would operate, with the doctrines of Cabinet and ministerial responsibility applying in broadly the same way as at Westminster. It would follow that one of the Ministers, usually the leader of the majority party, wouldbe chief Minister. The specific designation would be a matter for the assembly to determine; we suggest &quot;the Scottish (or Welsh) Premier&quot; as a possibility.1145. While the Westminster legislation establishing the assembly wouldprovide for the initial appointment of Ministers and for the establishment oftheir departments, it would thereafter be for the assembly itself to decide what arrangements should be made.1146. There would be separate Scottish and Welsh civil services. In eachcase facilities for interchange would be desirable with both the United Kingdomand local government services.Representation in Parliament1147. Scotland and Wales would continue to be represented in Parliament.Their representation in proportion to population would be the same as that ofEngland, subject to any allowance which might be found appropriate for specialgeographical conditions. The probable effect would be to reduce Scotland&apos;srepresentation from 71 to about 57 and that of Wales from 36 to about 311.Representation in the central government1148. As most of the executive responsibilities of the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales would have been transferred to the new assemblies and governments, the offices of Secretary of State would disappear. But it would still be appropriate for Scotland and Wales each to have a Minister with the1 See footnote on page 31.
special responsibility of representing the interests of that country in the Cabinet,much as the Home Secretary for many years used to represent the interests ofNorthern Ireland. This representative role would be somewhat wider than itwas for Northern Ireland, since a wider range of functions would be retainedat Westminster. The Ministers would be available to discharge other duties,provided that they were not duties which might clash with their special responsi-bilities for looking after the interests of Scotland or Wales.The case for legislative devolution1149. Those of us1 who favour legislative devolution for both Scotland andWales do so mainly for the following reasons:(a) The conferment of wide powers of government on the assemblies would do much to counter the physical remoteness from government which is felt in Scotland and Wales.(b) It would provide in each country a new focus of political interest and power which would have a revitalising effect on Scottish and Welsh life,encouraging able persons, now attracted to wider prospects outsideScotland and Wales, to remain and work there.(c) If it is agreed that Scottish and Welsh assemblies should be something more than advisory bodies, the transfer to them of full responsibility forpolicy and legislation on prescribed matters is the only realistic course toadopt. Any more restricted transfer of power would leave the assembliesat all times at the mercy of the centralising tendencies of government.(d) Only in this way can it be made clear where democratic responsibilitieslie. In the transferred matters the assemblies would have full power and responsibility, and this would add greatly to their authority and prestige.(e) The Scots and the Welsh would not be likely to agree to forgo theadvantages which the present Secretary of State system confers for anything less.1150. In the case of Scotland the existence of the separate system of Scottishlaw is an added argument for legislative devolution. It produces a requirement for a considerable volume of separate Scottish legislation. Though in many instances the policies embodied in the legislation do not differ greatly fromthose for England and Wales, separate Bills or parts of Bills may be required and take up a good deal of Parliamentary time. Whether influenced by political considerations, or with a view to saving Parliamentary time, the governmentsometimes includes Scottish provisions in a general Bill when Scottish interests would be better served by having a separate Bill. The Scottish assembly wouldhave more time than Parliament now has to devote to Scottish legislation, andwould probably by its membership, which could be expected to include a numberof Scottish lawyers, be better equipped to deal with it. Moreover, some Scottishlegislation differs in substance from that for England and Wales, and there isprobably scope for greater differences. Scotland would benefit from havingmore of its domestic policies designed to meet its special interests.1 Lord Kilbrandon, Mr. Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr. Longmuir, Professor Newark andSir Ben Bowen Thomas.
1151. Wales, on the other hand, has no separate system of law, hardly anyseparate legislation and a geographically less well denned border. Two of us1who favour legislative devolution for Scotland regard these and other differences between Scotland and Wales, and the strong desirability of retaining a Secretaryof State for Wales^as sufficing to preclude its extension to Wales.1152. The others among us who favour legislative devolution consider thatthe arguments in paragraph 1150 amply justify its application to Wales as wellas to Scotland. While Wales has no separate legal system, it is a distinctivecommunity with its own heeds and interests and with a culture and languageto preserve and foster, and there is scope for a substantial volume of separate legislation devised by the Welsh people to meet those special needs. Those of us who take this view believe that a generous measure of devolution, in recog-nition of the national identity of Wales and as a counter to the growing scale of government and spread of uniformity, would be more likely to strengthenthan to weaken the unity of the United Kingdom.1153. The main arguments against legislative devolution, seen by those of us who do not support it for either Scotland or Wales, are as follows: (a) The scope for the adoption of distinctive policies consistent with themaintenance of political and economic unity is not large, and is likelyto be progressively diminished by the increasing restriction on freedomof action imposed by membership of the European Communities. Itwould be misleading, and make for bad relations between Parliament anda Scottish or Welsh assembly, to purport to confer on the assembly widelegislative powers which were not capable of being extensively used inan independent way.In the view of the supporters of legislative devolution the possibilities for independent action would still be substantial. Other member countries have regional problems, and there is no reason to think that Communitylegislation will not leave enough scope for regional differences. Evenif the assembly were to make little use of its legislative powers to adoptdistinctive policies, the fact that in the transferred subjects it exercisedall powers of decision would be of immense value.(b) The assembly might sometimes use its powers to adopt policies which,while not unreasonable in themselves, would be incompatible withpolicies adopted in other parts of the United Kingdom; and the risk ofthe adoption of incompatible policies, or of policies which were incon-sistent with the maintenance of political and economic unity, would be particularly acute in a situation, such as would be likely to obtain in both Scotland and Wales, in which one political party dominated theassembly for long periods.The supporters of legislative devolution consider that the assembliescould be relied upon to use their powers responsibly for the benefit oftheir people and with due regard to the interests of other parts of theUnited Kingdom and of the United Kingdom as a whole; and that thiswould be so even if, as is by no means certain, the assemblies were toremain for long periods under the control of a single political party.1 Professor Street and Mrs. Trenaman, who favour the scheme for a Welsh Councildescribed in paragraphs 1174-1180.
would be that Acts of Parliament should lay down policy in broad terms,authorising the assembly to fill in much of the detail. The assembly would thus have considerable power over policy as well as responsibility for its execu-tion. It would acquire many of the powers which arc now by statute vested inMinisters of the central government, including some of their powers to makesubordinate legislation by means of statutory instruments.1157. There would be scope in almost every field of government for somedevolution. Most of the existing executive functions of the Scottish and welsh offices would be devolved. The assembly would also assume many of the func-tions of the offices in Scotland or Wales of other government departments,including those concerned with trade and industry, but not the revenue depart-ments. It would administer on an agency basis on behalf of departments services in which detailed instructions had to be laid down at the centre and there was little scope for the exercise of regional discretion; the payment of social security benefits is an example.1158. The relationship between the assembly and the local authorities in itsarea would depend on the way in which it was decided to apply the scheme.In paragraphs 831 to 833 we considered three possibilities. Under the mostradical of these, whereby local government would be subordinate to regional government, the assembly would become responsible for almost all dealings with the local authorities in its area. Under the least radical method of applica-tion, whereby local and regional authorities would each be autonomous inthe functions allotted to them from the centre and would work &quot;in parallel&quot;,local authorities would remain accountable for the proper performance of their functions to the central government. Under the third possibility the relationship between regional and local government would depend upon what Parliamentconsidered to be appropriate in each separate field of legislation. In any event,if, as we foresee, the setting up of a scheme of executive devolution were to bea gradual and developing process, the pattern of the division of powers betweenregional and local authorities might be expected to emerge as time went by andas experience suggested.1159. The assembly would be closely concerned with the work of the ad hocbodies operating in its area. Its precise relationship to each of these bodieswould be determined in the course of the review of existing law undertaken forthe purpose of determining what its functions should be. As we noted in chapter 18, there would be a wide range of possibilities, including in somecases the conferment on the assembly itself of all the functions now vested inthe ad hoc body.1160. The examination of existing statutes and their amendment so as toconfer functions on regional assemblies would be a lengthy process, spreadover many years. At the outset the assembly might have few but importantfunctions, and these could be added to gradually. At all times the scheme wouldbe a flexible one, with the devolved functions being varied from time to time tomeet changing policy requirements. The assembly would itself be able tosponsor changes in its functions by promoting legislation in Parliament. Itwould have some general powers, along the lines of those conferred by recent
legislation on local authorities, to take any action required to assist in thedischarge of its statutory functions and to incur expenditure in the interests ofits people.11(51. As in the scheme of legislative devolution, the assembly would beable to debate and make representations to the central government and itsagencies on any matter of Scottish or Welsh concern, whether or not functions in relation to that matter had been conferred upon it.1162. The Scottish and Welsh assemblies (and the corresponding assembliesfor the English regions) would be represented on a statutory council whichwould have a right to be consulted on proposals for new legislation affectingtheir responsibilities and which would act as a bridge between central and regional government.Financial arrangements1163. The assembly would be financed out of United Kingdom fundsnegotiated direct with the central government. In those negotiations theassembly&apos;s total expenditure would ultimately be for the United kingdom to decide. The government would also need to be satisfied that the assembly&apos;proposed allocation of expenditure was broadly consistent with the pursuit of central policies. With these reservations, all decisions on expenditure wouldbe a matter for the assembly itself. In the early years, before the range ofdevolved services had settled into a long-term pattern, a block grant system would probably not be practicable, but the aim would be to have that systemeventually. In any event the approved total expenditure would include anamount, not allocated to any particular service, for use by the assembly at itsdiscretion.The assembly1164. As in the scheme of legislative devolution, there would be a singlechamber of about a hundred members, directly elected for a fixed term of fouryears by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation(or, exceptionally, the alternative vote system in the Scottish Highlands and islands).The executive1165. Executive authority would be vested in the assembly itself, whichwould conduct much of its business through functional committees by pro-procedures similar to those operated by local authorities. Members of thecommittees would be drawn exclusively from the assembly. How far the partycomposition of each committee would reflect that in the assembly as a whole would be for the assembly itself to decide, but given something like the presentparty system it might be expected that the chairman of each committee wouldbe nominated by the majority party and the vice-chairman by the largestminority party. The leader of the majority party would be the chairman of theexecutive.1 Sections 111 and 137 of the Local Government Act 1972-similar provisions are con-tained in Clauses 69 and 83 of the Local Government (Scotland) Bill now before Parliament.
1166. The chairman of the executive and the chairmen of the main functionalcommittees would together form a policy or executive committee in effect, a scottish or Welsh Cabinet which would not have specific delegated functionsbut which would have a recognised formal status. It would be a forum for thediscussion of policy alternatives and, like other committees of the assembly,would be able to call on the advice and expertise of officials.1167. There would be separate Scottish and Welsh civil services. In each casetransfers between the service and the United Kingdom and local government services would be desirable.Representation in Parliament1168. This scheme would not require any change in Scottish or Welshrepresentation at Westminster.Representation in the central government1169. Most of the existing executive functions of the Scottish and welsh offices would be devolved to the assembly. Any remaining executive functions,together with responsibilities for policy making and the preparation of legisla-tion, would be transferred to the appropriate United Kingdom departments.The offices of Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear.A Minister of the central government would have general responsibility for regional affairs and relations with the regional assemblies. Functional ministers and their departments would maintain their own direct contacts with the regions, as they do now with the individual local authorities.The case for executive devolution1170. Those of us1 who favour a scheme of executive devolution for Scotlandand Wales do so for the following reasons:(a) It would permit the maximum transfer of power consistent with themaintenance of political and economic unity in a small densely populatedcountry such as the United Kingdom. For the reasons given inparagraph 1153, legislative devolution is believed to go too far and tobe open to a number of serious objections.(b) Within the framework of policies which have to be centrally determined in the interests of maintaining political and economic unity, it would permit a large measure of discretion in determining how those policiesshould be applied. Decisions affecting the Scottish and Welsh people would be taken by their own representatives in Scotland and Wales, whowould have greater knowledge of their needs and far more time to devoteto their affairs than Parliament and the central government now have.Government would be less centralised and more democratic, and scottish and Welsh participation in it would be increased.(c) A more or less uniform system of government throughout Great britain is considered to be desirable for the reasons given in paragraph 1108.Executive devolution is suitable for application to all parts of GreatBritain, and legislative devolution is not.id) Uniformly applied throughout Great Britain, it is the only schemewhich would make a significant contribution to the reduction of
centralisation and of the burden on Members of Parliament, ministers and their departments. With the removal of responsibility from ministers for most executive action, greater reality would be given to the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility.1171. The main case against executive devolution rests on doubts aboutthe viability of a system of government based on the separation of powersbetween two levels of government in the way proposed. There is no principle on which the separation could be made. There is in practice no easily recognis-able dividing line between policy and execution. Policy does not equate with legislation; many important policy decisions require no legislation and,conversely, some rather minor administrative changes need legislation if theoriginal Act has been drawn narrowly. Secondly, to divorce the experiencesof administration from the formulation of policy would lead to the impoverish-ment of policy and produce government far more remote and rarefied than that provided by the present system. The concept of separation of powers between&quot;policy&quot; at Westminster and &quot;execution&quot; at regional level leaves out of account the functions of local authorities which are an amalgam of policy and executionat a subordinate level.1172. In all matters power would be divided in a way that would not readily be understood between central and regional government and in most caseslocal government also and the dividing line would be continually changing.Democratic responsibility would be blurred. Moreover, no adequate constitu-tional mechanism can be devised either to safeguard the regional assembly&apos;slegitimate field of interest or to ensure the implementation by the assembly of central government policies. There would be difficulties also over finance.The central governments continued responsibility for legislation would ineffect leave it politically accountable for the devolved services, so that theassembly&apos;s freedom of expenditure, however unfettered in theory, wouldrequire to be circumscribed in practice. The assembly might soon find itself,with powers severely restricted, squeezed between central government and thelarge new local authorities. The restriction would be a potential source ofirritation, leading to conflict between London and Edinburgh and Cardiff,capable of being resolved only by the grant of legislative power or by the resumption of something like full control at the centre.1173. Those of us who support executive devolution consider that thesepractical difficulties in the way of introducing and maintaining it can easily be exaggerated, and that they might not prove so formidable if, as proposed,the range of functions devolved were to be extended gradually. No less than any other scheme of devolution, it could be made to work well if, and only if, the political will existed.a scheme for a welsh advisory council general description of the scheme1174. In this scheme there would be no devolution of legislative or executive powers, but a directly elected Welsh Council would be set up with powers to scrutinise central government policies and to advise the Secretary of State for
Wales and other Ministers on their application to Wales. It would take theplace of the existing Welsh Council but would have wider functions. questions arising on schemes of this kind have been discussed in Chapter 19.Functions of the council1175. The council would have responsibility for scrutinising, debating and making representations to the Secretary of State about government policies and the exercise of government authority generally in relation to Wales,including the activities of nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodiesoperating there. Its examination of policies appropriate for consideration atthe all-Wales level would also inevitably embrace in a general way the activitiesof local authorities.1176. The council would be given all reasonable facilities to enable it to perform these functions. It would operate in part through standing committees,covering among them all aspects of the work of the Secretary of State. Itwould be given clearly defined powers to call for information from the welsh office and to question officials of that department about the administrationof current policies. The reports of the committees would be debated by thecouncil in plenary session and advice would be tendered to the Secretary ofState. It would be open to the council to discuss and advise the governmenton such matters as the economic and employment problems of Wales or particular parts of Wales, important changes proposed in the nationalised industries, the priorities of major road and other development, importantland-use proposals, for instance in connexion with mineral prospecting or the siting of defence establishments, the organisation and administration of public services and measures needed to foster the Welsh language. The council wouldalso hold debates of a more general nature, including an annual debate on thegovernments expenditure proposals for Wales.1177. Welsh Ministers would on invitation attend and take part in the council&apos;s debates, and on the more important occasions the Secretary of Statehimself would attend. The attendance of Ministers would be for the purposeof explaining policy, answering criticisms and receiving advice; they would notbe accountable to the council. Members of Parliament from Welsh con-stituencies might be given freedom to attend and speak, though not to vote,at the councils plenary sessions.1178. The council would have the right to nominate some members of thead hoc bodies operating in Wales, to call for reports from those bodies and to invite their representatives to attend meetings of the council or its committeesand answer questions on their activities. Although in its debates and repre-sentations to the Secretary of State the council would necessarily deal withsome matters such as education and road building which are primarily theresponsibility of local authorities, it would be concerned solely with theSecretary of StateS policies in these matters and in no sense would it supervise the work of the authorities.Financial arrangements1179. The administrative expenses of the council would be met out of theUnited Kingdom Exchequer.
Composition of the council1180. The council would consist of about sixty members directly elected bythe single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixedterm of four years.The case for a Welsh advisory council1181. Those of us1 who favour the scheme for a Welsh council withdeliberative and advisory functions only, while supporting different solutionsfor Scotland, do so for the following reasons:(a) Recognition of the separate national identities of Scotland and Walesdoes not make it necessary to apply the same system of government tothe two countries.(b) Administrative devolution is more recent and less well developed in wales than in Scotland. Wales has no separate system of law and needslittle separate legislation. It has derived great benefit from the appoint-ment of a Secretary of State, and economic problems still facing the principality can best be dealt with through the retention and developmentof that office. The scheme for an advisory council would reconcile thecontinued existence of the office with the need, represented to us by manywitnesses, for a directly elected assembly to act as the voice of Wales,and is the only scheme which does so.(c) The scheme would provide a means of informing Welsh people muchmore fully of the policies, and the reasons for policies, which were being adopted in Wales, and would give an opportunity for considerablepublic debate in Wales itself, in the course of which complaints could beconsidered and misunderstandings removed.1182. The main arguments against the scheme seen by those of us whosupport more advanced forms of devolution to Wales are as follows:(a) It would not devolve any real power or provide an opportunity for the welsh people to undertake and discharge responsibilities in respect of matters affecting their country. In particular, there is no provision inthe scheme for the council to have a sphere of financial responsibility,without which no assembly can fulfil any worthwhile functions.(b) It would do nothing to provide for effective accountability by therapidly growing Welsh departments to the elected representatives of wales. The time allowed in Parliament for consideration of welsh affairs is minimal and cannot be effectively expanded.(c) The council, as a talking shop without any effective powers, would be unlikely to attract members of the right calibre.(d) The scheme would be likely to increase and exacerbate the dissatisfactionsand frustrations of the Welsh nation. It would leave those responsiblefor administration in Wales answerable solely to the Secretary of Stateand through him accountable only to Parliament, but liable at the sametime to be questioned and criticised by the Welsh Council, to whom theywould be neither answerable nor accountable. Discharging this latterfunction might, and in many instances would, involve them in possible1 Sir David Renton, Professor Street and Mrs. Trenaman.
breaches of their duty of confidentiality. Also the provision for ministers to attend meetings of the council and take part in debates in which cabinet policies would be subjected to criticism is unrealistic. It would place Ministers in an embarrassing, if not impossible, position. It wouldbe a source of acute frustration to many, and a direct encouragement toirresponsibility.(e) In so far as the scheme differentiated between Wales and Scotland, givingthe latter a greater degree of devolution, it would in all probability be unacceptable to the main body of Welsh opinion.1183. Those of us who support the scheme consider that, for the reasonsalready stated, more advanced forms of devolution are not needed or demanded,and would not suit the particular circumstances of Wales or be in the best interests of the Welsh people. The retention of the Secretary of State is of first importance for Wales, and an advisory council would derive strength from thefact that it gave recognition to a separate national identity.a scheme for a scottish council with advisory and legislative functionsDescription of the scheme1184. In this scheme there would be a directly elected Scottish council withdeliberative and advisory functions of the kind proposed in the scheme for aWelsh council which we have just described and, in addition, some powers inrelation to Scottish legislation.1185. The legislative function would be broadly along the lines of theproposals (discussed in Chapter 20) of the Scottish Constitutional Committeeof the Conservative Party, which were to take the Second Reading, Committeeand Report stages of Scottish Bills referred to it by the House of Commons,and to assist in the consideration of private legislation and statutory instruments.The council would also be empowered, unless within twenty-one days of itscompleting the Report Stage of a Bill referred to it the Leader of the House ofCommons requested that the Bill be sent back to Westminster for Third reading in the Commons and passage through the Lords, itself to give a Third Readingto the Bill, which would then without further Parliamentary proceedings besubmitted for the Royal Assent. This arrangement, which was not part of theScottish Constitutional Committee&apos;s proposal, would have the advantage of retaining Parliamentary sovereignty while enabling the council to deal entirely with some Bills which were essentially Scottish in content, were not contraryto the policies favoured by Parliament and did not require further revision.The case for a Scottish council with advisory and legislative functions1186. One of us1 favours this scheme, for the following reasons:(a) In Scotland, as in Wales, the demand for a bigger say in the country&apos;saffairs can be met more effectively by retaining the office of Secretary ofState, possibly with extended powers, and making the holder accessible to a directly elected national assembly, than by interposing anothertier of government between central and local government. The presentsystem of economic unity, which is of great material benefit to Scotland,1 Sir David Renton.
means that the really important decisions, including those relating to theprovision of funds for future development, are inevitably taken by theCabinet or one of its committees. It is therefore vital that the Secretaryof State and the office over which he presides should be retained at thecentre.(b) Entry into the European Communities means in effect two-tier centralgovernment when dealing with a wide range of economic and agricul-tural matters and some social matters. There will be two tiers of localgovernment in Scotland, at the &quot;regional&quot; and district levels, and thelarge size of the districts may lead to a demand for a considerable measureof self-government by community councils at the more local level. In sofar as this demand is met, there will one day be in effect three-tier localgovernment. If a Scottish council (or any similar bodies in Wales orthe English regions) were to acquire executive functions, there might therefore one day be a six-tier system of government, with a plethoraof direct elections. This would be too much of a good thing and would both damage democracy and lead to confusing government.(c) A Scottish council, as a deliberative body, advising central government,considering in general how local government functions were beingcarried out and assisting in the passage of Parliamentary legislation,would have a worthwhile function to perform and would enjoy con-siderable prestige. The extent to which the General Assembly of theChurch of Scotland has over many years devoted attention to secular aswell as to religious matters indicates that there is a political vacuum inScotland which such a council would fill.1187. The rest of us, who favour forms of devolution to Scotland involving an assembly with powers of government, do not consider that the addition to theadvisory function of some powers over legislation capable of being used only with the approval of Parliament would add significantly to the status of thecouncil or make it more likely to be acceptable to the Scottish people.
ENGLAND1188. We are unanimously of the opinion that legislative devolution, even ifit is applied to Scotland and Wales, as in each case a majority of us suggest,should not be applied to England or to the regions of England. The Englishpeople would generally regard it as inappropriate to have a separate legislaturefor England; and there is no public demand for English regional assemblieswith legislative powers, whether under a federal system or otherwise.1189. While we are all agreed that regional devolution in England shouldnot involve the transfer of any major powers over legislation, we hold differingviews on what is needed. Two of us1 favour executive devolution to directly elected regional assemblies. Eight of us2 favour the setting up of non-executiveco-ordinating and advisory councils, with some members indirectly elected bythe local authorities in the regions and others nominated by the central govern-ment. One of us3 favours maximum devolution to local authorities, togetherwith a system of regional committees consisting entirely of representatives oflocal authorities and directed towards narrower functions. We describe these three schemes below, and state the grounds on which they are supported.a scheme of executive devolution1190. Executive devolution to the regions of England is seen by those of uswho support it as part of a wider scheme of executive devolution on a more orless uniform pattern to all parts of Great Britain. In all essentials, therefore, itwould take the same form as the scheme of executive devolution to Scotland andWales described in the last chapter.The regions1191. The regions would be those which have been established for economic planning purposes, modified as necessary to make the regional boundariesconform to those of the new counties defined by the Local Government Act1972. As we noted in paragraph 209, the Redcliffe-Maud Commission^ investi-gations suggested that the eight regions, while differing greatly in population and the extent of territory covered, not only provided areas of suitable sizefor the functions of provincial councils, but also roughly reflected such sense of regional identity as existed in various parts of England. We see no reason totake a different view. The boundaries of the eight regions as modified are shownin the map on page 574, and their areas and populations are given in Table 7.1on page 66. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission did in fact suggest two sub-stantial changes, the first involving the transfer of Cumberland and Westmorland(the new county of Cumbria) from the Northern to the North West region, andthe second the transfer of Northamptonshire from the East Midlands to theSouth East region. We have not ourselves investigated the case for these changes and we make no recommendations.1 Lord Foot and Sir James Steel.2 Lord Kilbrandon, Mr. Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr. Longmuir, Professor Newark,Sir David Renton, Professor Street and Sir Ben Bowen Thomas.3 Mrs. Trenaman.
The case for executive devolution1192. The arguments set out in paragraph 1170 in support of the devolution of executive powers to Scottish and Welsh assemblies and those in paragraph1171 against such devolution, are considered to apply equally in England. Inthe view of those of us1 who favour executive devolution there is no less ademand in the English regions for greater opportunity to participate in govern-ment and for greater democratic accountability in the administration of govern-ment, even though the demand, because it is not associated with strong feelingsabout a separate national identity or language, may not be so vocal or so clearly defined. Any arrangement which fell short of the devolution of executive powers would do nothing to lighten the load on Parliament and the central government.Those of us who hold these views believe also that the system of governmentshould be uniform throughout Great Britain and that executive devolutionwould work best if it were to be applied to all regions.1193. The rest of us consider that the extension of executive devolution to theEnglish regions would present special difficulty. It would involve substantial changes in the role of Parliament and the central government. The practicaldifficulties of drawing and maintaining a satisfactory line of demarcationbetween the legitimate interests of the central government and those of the regional authorities, noted in paragraphs 1171 and 1172 in the case of Scotlandand Wales, would be magnified since the central governments need to retainpowers over policy and control over public expenditure and taxation in theinterests of economic management would inevitably lead it to adopt a more restrictive attitude to devolution than would be necessary if devolution werebeing applied to selected regions only. If the English regions were given broadly the same scope for independent action as that which could be allowed to scotland and Wales alone, it would become much more difficult to establish and maintain any clear direction in United Kingdom policies. We were advised that each regional assembly would need its own separate civil service. Some of us believe that, even with the fullest opportunity for interchange on a voluntary basis, this division would impoverish recruitment and lower the standard ofservice provided, especially at the centre.1194. Those of us who favour executive devolution in the English regions donot accept that these considerations would prevent a substantial and valuablemeasure of devolution.a scheme for regional co-ordinating and advisory councilsGeneral description of the scheme1195. This scheme assumes that as many functions as possible would be devolved direct to local authorities, which would be subjected to a minimum of control in the exercise of those functions. In each of the eight regions into which England would be divided a regional council, with some membersindirectly elected by the local authorities and others nominated by the centralgovernment, would be set up under statute to exercise co-ordinating and advisory functions. Questions arising on schemes of this kind have been discussed in Chapter 19.
The regions1196. As in the scheme of executive devolution, the eight regions would be those which have been established for economic planning purposes, modified as necessary to make the regional boundaries conform to those of the new countiesdefined by the Local Government Act 1972.Functions of the regional council1197. The council, which would ordinarily meet in public, would provide a means whereby the needs of the region could be viewed as a whole and expressed, through its debates and in other ways, to all levels and agencies ofgovernment.1198. It would be responsible for advising and making representations to thecentral government about government policies and the exercise of government authority generally in relation to the region, including the proposals and activities of the nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies operating there.It would take over the functions of the present nominated regional economic planning council.1199. The council would be given all reasonable facilities to enable it toexercise its advisory functions. As there would be no Minister and departmentcomparable to the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales and the scottish and Welsh Offices with a wide range of policy-making and executive functionsrelating to the region alone, the procedures suggested in the last chapter as appropriate to advisory councils in Scotland and Wales for obtaining information and for questioning officials could not be applied. But the council would keepin close touch with departments of the central government responsible for localauthority and other services in the region and with other agencies of government,both on the administration of existing policies and on any proposals for change.These contacts would be facilitated if departments and agencies were as far aspossible to decentralise their activities to offices in regions coinciding with thoseof the councils.1200. The council would have a right to nominate some members of thead hoc bodies operating in the region and to receive and debate annual reports from them.1201. It would be open to the council to invite Ministers to attend and take part in its debates, though there could be no understanding, as in thecase of the Scottish and Welsh councils, that Ministers would ordinarily attendsuch debates.1202. To assist in its economic planning work, departments, local authorities,nationalised industries and other government agencies would be required,subject only to exceptions on the grounds of national security, to inform thecouncil of their capital investment programmes within the region and toexplain major component projects. This explanation would include not onlythe financial and economic factors but the anticipated effects on environment,including pollution and noise factors and effects on natural amenity andhuman habitation.1203. One of the most important functions of the council would be toadvise on government spending in the region. There would be an annual debate
based on full particulars of all capital expenditure in the region proposed to be financed by central government. In this way the government would be made aware of any desire for an adjustment in priorities and of any pressing needswhich were not being met.1204. In the local government field the council would have a mainly co-ordinating function. It would play an important part in the formulation of the broad economic and land-use strategy which would be the regional framework within which central and local government services would be provided. the structure plans of the local authorities would have to fit into this generalstrategy and would be submitted for Ministerial approval through the regionalcouncil and with its comments. The council would by agreement promote and co-ordinate action by local government in the region. It would have no power of direction over the local authorities and would not itself administerservices or undertake works.Financial arrangements1205. The expenses of the council would be met by precept on the localauthorities in the region.Constitution of the council1206. The councils would consist on average of about sixty members, thenumbers varying with the population and number of local authorities in the regions. The majority of members would be members of local authorities inthe region, elected by the authorities themselves under a scheme providing forthe representation of both county and district authorities. The remainingmembers, about one-fifth of the total, would be nominated by the minister responsible for regional affairs so as to secure representation from industryand commerce, including the nationalised industries and agriculture, thetrade unions, education, and statutory and promotional bodies operating inthe region.1207. Members would be appointed to the council for a period of four years,in the case of the local authority representatives immediately following thecounty or district elections. The council would elect its own chairman. Itwould have power to appoint committees and to co-opt additional members to the committees. It would employ its own staff, seconded from central andlocal government.The case for regional councils1208. Those of us1 who favour the scheme for regional co-ordinating and advisory councils in England do so for the following reasons (a) The councils would meet the need, as represented to us by manywitnesses, for machinery at the regional level for the co-ordination oflocal authority action and for the expression of regional views.(b) No more advanced scheme of devolution is considered to be desirable or practicable in England. The reorganisation of local governmentoutside London in two tiers, with only forty-five authorities six1 Lord Kilbrandon, Mr. Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr. Longmuir, Professor Newark,Sir David Renton, Professor Street and Sir Ben Bowen Thomas.
metropolitan counties and thirty-nine non-metropolitan counties-inthe top tier, has left no room for directly elected regional authorities.Such authorities could not be endowed with the power and authority or enjoy the support of both electorate and local authorities that theywould need if they were to play an effective part in government. while a directly elected Scottish or Welsh assembly, even one without executive powers, would derive some strength from the fact that it gave recognition to national identity, regional assemblies in England would enjoy nocomparable advantage. To most people they would be remote andsomewhat artificial bodies. Although it is arguable that they would attract their own loyalties, it cannot be taken for granted that thiswould be so. In these circumstances the division of government betweenfour levels central, regional, county and district would be littleunderstood by many electors. It would probably be confusing even tothose who were reasonably well informed.(c) The maintenance of a healthy system of local government requires thatas many as possible of the functions of government which have to becarried out locally should be devolved to the local authorities, andthat in the exercise of those functions the authorities should be subjected to a minimum of control. Where controls have to be retained they shouldbe exercised by the central government itself, which will have responsi-bility for policy and legislation. Local authorities will naturally not wish to see a new tier of government interposed between them and thecentral government. They will wish to deal directly with central govern-ment. While central government will often be able to act most expedi-tiously and with the greatest understanding of the local situation fromits regional offices, and decentralisation is therefore to be encouraged,the appointment of regional Ministers as discussed in Chapter 21would probably not be helpful, since local authorities will always wishto have a right of approach to Ministers in charge of departments.(d) Although with maximum devolution to local authorities there willremain some executive functions of government needing to be exercised over wider areas, these do not by their nature or volume suffice to justify an additional tier of elected government. They are functions which ithas been found suitable to place in the hands of nominated bodies.There have usually been grounds other than the inadequate size of localauthority areas for employing such bodies. Thus in the case of the health service one consideration has been the belief of the professionthat only a service administered by special bodies on which they were represented could provide a proper assurance of clinical freedom; withthe nationalised industries technical and commercial considerations havebeen regarded as paramount. While it is arguable that the public interestwould be better served if the functions of nominated bodies were to beplaced in the hands of democratically elected bodies, other factors point to the retention of nominated bodies. There is the further consideration that technical requirements have led to the adoption of operational areasdiffering from service to service. The regions proposed for the newhealth service, for example, depend on the location of the existinghospitals, while the proposed new regional water authorities haveboundaries determined by hydrological considerations. The areas might
be made to coincide with those of elected regional councils, but probably not without considerable loss of efficiency. Or separate elections to the specialist authorities responsible for the different services could be held,but this would have many drawbacks. The balance of advantage appearsto lie in leaving services which cannot be devolved direct to the localauthorities in the hands of specially appointed bodies, and giving the regional council appropriate representation on such bodies and powerto investigate and debate their activities,(e) The few non-executive functions of government which remain to beexercised by a representative body at regional level will be such as canappropriately be put in the hands of an assembly of representatives ofthe local authorities. A body of this kind is needed for the co-ordinationof local authority functions, and would probably still be required evenif there were to be a separately elected regional authority. It would alsobe well suited by its constitution to formulate regional views and torepresent those views to the central government and to any bodiesappointed by the central government to exercise functions in the regions.The granting of this wider role to a council consisting mainly of localauthority representatives would enhance the status and prestige of localauthorities as a whole and set a regional seal on local government reform.The inclusion in the council of nominated members and the ability toco-opt additional persons to committees of the council would ensure thatit had access to all necessary expert advice.1209. A disadvantage of the scheme of regional councils with only a limitedrange of non-executive functions is that it would do little to reduce the centralisation-tion of government and the burden on Parliament and the central government.Those of us who support the scheme, however, consider that the reorganisation of local government has left no practical alternative to basing new regionalmachinery on the local authorities in the way proposed and that the establish-ment of the regional councils, together with greater decentralisation of govern-ment administration and the reduction of controls over local authorities, wouldmake a useful contribution to these objectives.a scheme of co-ordinating committees of local authorities1210. One of us1 considers that in England the best way of devolving fromthe centre is to concentrate on strengthening the power of the new larger localauthorities. In the view of this member the strong trend towards centralisationthat we have noted is not the result of rapacity for power in Westminster andWhitehall. The main reasons are, on the one hand, the desire of people forequality of treatment irrespective of the part of the country in which they live and, on the other, some dissatisfaction with local government under the systemnow being superseded. How deepseated and widespread the desire is for exactequality of treatment in particular services is, as the Report makes clear, not known; to the extent that it prevails over the wish for local choice it inevitablyleads, and must continue to lead, to centralisation. But in so far as the centralgovernment has taken over power from the local authorities because the latterhave been thought by the people they serve to be inadequate, the reorganisation1 Mrs. Trenaman.
of the authorities into larger units, expected to be more effective in moderncircumstances, should provide scope for decentralisation in future. If so, it isto the reorganised local authorities in England, and not to regional bodiesintermediate between them and central government, that powers should be devolved.1211. The new, larger, units of local government must inevitably begeographically more remote from the majority of their constituents than theold units. Regional government would be remoter still. Nor is there the slightestlikelihood of regional units which make administrative sense coinciding withgenuinelocal feeling. The concept of &quot;the voice of the region&quot; is highly artificialin England. Local feeling and sense of identity are as strong in parts of England(for instance, Cornwall, the north-east coast, parts of Yorkshire and many others) as in Scotland or Wales, but these feelings are not likely to find expressionin regional groupings of the kind contemplated by the majority. Feeling inCornwall, for example, which to some extent is &quot;nationalist&quot; in the same way as in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man, is not likely to be satisfied in a south West region centred on Bristol.1212. Moreover, additional machinery always slows down business, and a fairly common complaint about all levels of government is that decisions are too slow. It seems to follow that regional machinery can be justified only in sofar as it is necessary for some specific function not at present satisfactorilyprovided for. The only such function appears to be the co-ordination of the planning activities of local authorities, which are of great importance for their neighbours. The proposal is to substitute for the present voluntary co-operationbetween local authorities, already well established in some areas, a formalsystem of regional committees, and to make it mandatory on the authorities concerned in each region to submit their plans to these committees and obtain their comments before seeking Ministerial approval. The committees wouldhave no other obligatory functions but they would provide, in a more formaland systematic way than at present, a mechanism for consultation betweenneighbouring authorities for matters on which they chose to consult. Thecommittees would consist entirely of indirectly elected representatives of localauthorities and there would be no provision for nominated members.1213. The supporter of this proposal recommends the abolition of thepresent economic planning councils. Although they have done some good work(as any body of well-intentioned public spirited persons always will) they have suffered from the outset from being nominated bodies with ill-defined terms ofreference; they were, in fact, a classic example of the tendency in governmentto suppose that new machinery is a substitute for policy. If there is a feeling inlocalities in England that they are receiving less than their fair share of national resources and attention, it should be voiced through Members of Parliament,who by definition are elected to represent localities. Where there is a com-munity of feeling between adjacent localities, their Members can combine,as they are beginning to do informally, to represent their joint interests inParliament.1214. It would be possible to combine a system of co-ordinating committees of local authorities, of the kind and for the limited purpose here described,with a reorganisation of the House of Commons, in the manner described in
Chapter 22. On such a plan the House would set up regional committees of itsown Members which would consider plans for the regions and would takebusiness in the form of Parliamentary Questions and some kinds of adjourn-ment debate now taken in the Chamber. Only Parliament itself could decide whether this significant change in its own procedure was feasible, and since itwould undoubtedly raise problems, particularly of manning and staffing thecommittees, it is not positively advocated, though it is an idea worth considering.But any change in Parliament designed to place a greater weight on regionalaffairs as such would be better considered in relation to the House of Commonsthan the House of Lords.
SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT OF CONCLUSIONS ON DEVOLUTION1215. In the last two chapters we have set out our conclusions on devolution to Scotland and Wales and to the regions of England. We now bring these conclusions together so that they may be seen in the context of Great britain as a whole, and consider how far the reforms proposed could be expected toremove defects in the existing system of government.1216. There are certain matters on which we are agreed. These are that theexecutive functions of government should, where practicable, be devolveddirect to the newly constituted local authorities, which in the exercise of thosefunctions should be subjected to a minimum of control; that executive functions which are retained by the central government should where practicable be exer-cised in the regions, with the various departments and agencies of governmentoperating in the same regions and from the same regional centres unless in aparticular case there are compelling reasons for adopting a different organisa-tion; that Scotland and Wales should each have a directly elected assembly orcouncil; and that in England there should be no assembly for the country as awhole separate from Parliament, no transfer of legislative power to assembliesin the regions and no appointment of regional Ministers or officials of thecentral government with executive responsibilities drawn from a number ofdifferent departments. We are also agreed that if the Scottish Office and the welsh Office are retained as departments of the central government, the twoSecretaries of State should exercise broadly the same range of responsibilities,except that the Secretary of State for Wales should not take over the existingfunctions in Wales of the Home Secretary and Lord Chancellor. In our view there are no substantial additional functions which could usefully be transferredto the Scottish Office.1217. Where we differ in our conclusions we are in the main divided into two distinct groups. A majority of us1 consider that it is not necessary to havea uniform system of government in all parts of Great Britain; that a systembased on a division of responsibilities between two levels of government, thecentre being concerned with major policy and legislation and the regions withsubordinate policy and administration, would not be practicable; and that where substantive powers are to be devolved the only satisfactory course willbe to devolve full responsibility for prescribed subjects, including the power to legislate. Those of us who hold these views favour for Scotland an elected assembly with independent legislative functions, or, in the case of one member,deliberative and advisory functions and some powers in relation to Scottishlegislation introduced in Parliament. For Wales, an elected assembly is alsofavoured; some members would give it legislative functions and othersdeliberative and advisory functions. For England, regional councils with co-ordinating and advisory functions, part elected by the local authorities and partnominated, are favoured by most members; but one member would have bodiescomposed entirely of local authority representatives and concerned only withplanning.1 Lord Kilbrandon, Mr. Davies, Sir Mark Henig, Dr. Longmuir, Professor Newark,Sir David Renton, Professor Street, Sir Ben Bowen Thomas and Mrs. Trenaman.
1218. A minority of us1 believe that systems of government in GreatBritain should as far as possible be uniform; that legislative devolution wouldnot be consistent with the maintenance of essential political and economic unity; and that executive devolution would be practicable and should extend to all parts of Great Britain, including the English regions.1219. We have set out in the earlier chapters the considerations which have led us as individuals to support one form of devolution rather than another.We all believe that our preferred solutions go as far as is reasonably practicable to meet the demands for change in the various parts of GreatBritain, and that they would in their own ways make a useful contribution to reducing centralisation, increasing democratic accountability and, in Scotlandand Wales, satisfying national aspirations.1220. It is not to be expected, however, that any of the forms of devolutionwe have devised, or any conceivable variants of them, would remove all thegrounds for complaint against government. Devolution is directed mainlytowards removing the disadvantages of centralisation. But whatever methodof devolution may be chosen a good deal of government is bound to remain under central control. It is inevitable in a modern industrial society that astrong central authority should exist. It is needed for purposes of economiccontrol and, whatever may be the complaints of over-centralisation, to satisfy the demand throughout the state for reasonable equality in rights, benefits and opportunities. For such reasons as these power in federations now tends toflow to the centre, often in direct contradiction of the terms and obviousintention of the constitution. And international agreements, extending moreand more to matters hitherto regarded as purely domestic, limit still further thescope for regional discretion.1221. None of this destroys the case for devolution. On the contrary, theunavoidable increase in central power makes it all the more necessary to enlarge democratic accountability and to increase opportunities for participa-tion in government. Devolution can make a valuable contribution to theseends.1222. Our schemes provide in one way or another for new representative bodies in all regions. Some would be directly elected and others wholly or mainlyindirectly elected by the local authorities. Large areas of government would either become the direct responsibility of those bodies or be subject to theirsurveillance and criticism. In this way government would be made geographic-ally less remote. In those regions which had directly elected assemblies therewould be increased opportunities for direct participation in government; inthe others government would at least be made more open and accessible.1223. The fact remains, however, that the scope and scale of central govern-ment would continue to be large and might well continue to grow. Though inthe exercise of its non-devolved functions it would be subjected to regionalinfluences and pressures to a greater extent than at present, it might still attractall the criticisms that are now directed against it of remoteness, of unnecessarysecrecy, of enlarging its activities at the expense of individual freedom, ofproviding inadequate remedies for the redress of grievances and generally of
maintaining a wide gulf between government and the people. The remedy forthese defects would not simply be more devolution, even if that were practicable.To the extent that powers were devolved, they would be exercised by regionalinstead of by central institutions of government. The areas and populationsover which those powers would be exercised would be smaller, and governmentwould be physically less remote. But in all other respects the gulf between government and the governed, and the grounds for complaint which we havegrouped under the heading of the weakening of democracy, might be just as great. There is no inherent reason why regional government should be moredemocratic or more sensitive to public opinion than central government.Indeed the view is often expressed that regional government is more likelythan central government to adopt extreme policies and to be intolerant towardsminorities, particularly if one party remains in power for long periods oftime.1224. Devolution, therefore, is not a cure for all the faults of government.But we think it could do a great deal to cure the particular faults with which wehave been mainly concerned, those which are essentially regional in character.
PART IX The RELATIONSHIP between government AND PEOPLE
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE1225. Our primary task has been to examine the possibilities for regionaldevolution. Our efforts have very largely been devoted to that task, and theimportance we have attached to it is reflected in the form and content of thisReport. But regional devolution cannot sensibly be looked at in isolation, as though the particular defects in government which it is intended to correctare unrelated to others. For this reason our analysis of defects and discussionof general principles in Parts III and IV embrace aspects of the relationship between government and people which are not regional in character. Theyraise many issues which are not disposed of by our conclusions on devolution,including radical ideas for reforming the institutions of Parliament and government and for protecting the rights of the individual. It would have been quite impracticable for us to tackle all those issues as well as devolution.They would be sufficient to provide work for several Royal Commissions.All we have been able to do is to draw attention to them at the points in thediscussion where they naturally arose. We must leave others to reflect on their importance and to consider whether they call for action or further enquiry.The problem of communication1226. There is, however, one particular matter which we wish to mentionagain, not with any idea of making positive proposals but in the hope that what we have to say will encourage further study and appropriate action.That is the question of communication between government and people, andthe way in which its quality can be affected by the form and behaviour ofgovernment institutions and by the attitude of the people themselves. We give this attention to communication because our enquiries have brought home tous how important it is. In so far as the remoteness of government is not simplya matter of geography, but rather a psychological gap between governmentand people between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; it will not be much reduced bydevolution. The main counter to it must be better communication.The essential requirements of communication1227. Good communication calls for a background of mutual trust and arelationship in which each side is responding to the other. To the extent that people do not trust government they will make less effort to understand itand to identify themselves with it. They will be slow to believe what it tellsthem, even if the news is good; and they may not take the trouble to express their own views to government, by voting or in other ways, believing that thiswould make no difference. To the extent that government does not trust thepublic it will be less inclined to seek their views or tell them what it is doing,fearing that closer contact may expose it to ill-informed and ill-judged pressureswhich would make the already difficult task of government even more difficult and the results less satisfactory. And without mutual response there can be no real meeting of minds. Government may issue a flood of information but dolittle to encourage any response, or leave the impression that it is not reallyinterested in the response;.and the public for their part may press their wisheson government and be unprepared to receive anything back except the answersthey want, choosing to disregard factors which government cannot ignore.
1228. The communication that is required, therefore, is not simply the mechanical passing of information between government and people. It ismore a question of mutual trust and understanding. If government is nottrusted by the people, no amount of mechanical communication will bring it into real contact with them or prevent them from regarding it as remote.Whatever they hear from it will be fitted into the pattern of their existingsuspicions. But if government is trusted, the difficult problem of communicationis eased; government itself will tend to act more openly and responsively, andthe people will have greater confidence that matters of which they know littleare at least in good hands.1229. It may be questioned whether a huge organisation such as moderngovernment, wielding great authority and with many diverse and unpopulartasks to perform, can possibly earn such trust in the eyes of the people or,except for strictly limited purposes, can expose itself to close and responsivecontact with them. The most pertinent answer is that if these things are notpossible we face a future in which government and people will grow further and further apart as the scope and complexity of government increases.The present situation1230. For reasons already discussed people have tended to become dis-enchanted with government. Their trust in it has been weakened. They arebewildered by it and are not confident that it is operating in a truly democraticway, responding properly to their own views and feelings.1231. There may be little justification for this attitude to government.Probably most of those engaged in it can justly claim that all their work isconditioned by a respect for what the public thinks. Their lack of responsivenessmay be more apparent than real. It is interesting that in dealing with this problem the attitude survey concludes that there is on the part of the people&quot;a felt lack of communication&quot;1. The implication seems to be not that government does not wish to communicate, but that whatever effort it may have made hasnot been successful, since people still feel it is out of touch with them. Thereport says:&quot;There are two aspects to this problem; not only a feeling of lack ofcommunication from local and central government about what they are doing but also a feeling that those in government are not aware of theviews of the ordinary person, that they ought to be more aware of themand react to them. What people seem to be feeling a need for is not simplymore opportunity to make their views known to those in government(important though this is); the man in the street considers that his rulersshould be more positively concerned to know what his problems and his views are.&quot;If, as we believe, this conclusion is right, the general disenchantment with government may be largely attributable to a failure in communication.Government must demonstrate more clearly to the people that it is willing toput itself in their shoes and to listen as well as inform.1 Research Paper 7, page 22.
1232. Who exactly is it who is required to demonstrate this willingness andto show more positive concern for the people? When people say that &quot;govern-ment&quot; is remote and out of touch with them, against whom is the complaintdirected? Is it Ministers? Is it politicians generally? Or is it officials working inthe departments and agencies of government? The roles of politicians and officials are very different and must be considered separately.Politicians1233. We include under this general heading Ministers of the Crown whoare in control of government. In the eyes of the general public they arepoliticians first and Ministers second. Their role in government is paramountbut temporary. Next year they may be in opposition. It seems that in thepublic mind politicians, in and out of office and regardless of party, have acquired a corporate image.1234. Politicians are legitimately concerned with communication for party political purposes, and in their party role they do not expect a very sympathetichearing from that portion of the electorate which supports their opponents.It is part of our democratic system that it should be so. Nevertheless, as a body and irrespective of their political views, they ought to be generally and con-tinuously respected for the value of the work they do and the way they go about it. It is important that they should be looked upon, in this sense, as trustworthycustodians of government. If they are, people will be encouraged to developconfidence in the institutions of democracy, and will more readily identifythemselves with government and feel less remote from it.1235. We are not here concerned with whether all the complaints made about our system of Parliamentary democracy are well founded. For our present purpose the relevant fact is that they exist. In varying degrees they indicate amistrust of the present system. And in the minds of the complainants this mistrustcan hardly fail to be associated with the elected representatives who both work  the system and have power to change it for the better. If, for example, people have indeed gained the impression that the procedures of Parliament areantiquated, ritualistic and inappropriate for the present day, that Members ofParliament are required to engage in criticism for its own sake, lack realinfluence and have little positive function except to vote for their party, thatthe will of the majority in Parliament may be frustrated by the need to preserveparty alignments, and that, more generally, the Parliamentary franchise gives the people inadequate control, then, whether or not their impressions are a true and fair reflection of the facts, they will tend to hold politicians responsiblefor what they believe to be wrong, and politicians will find it difficult to gaintheir trust. It is for politicians themselves to judge the volume and validity ofthe complaints and where necessary to correct false impressions or considerremedial action. We are concerned only to make the point that if people believe the system to be faulty they will lack trust in those who are running it, andcommunication on day-to-day matters of government will be made all the moredifficult.1236. It is sometimes the duty of politicians not to respond to popular feeling,but to go against it. They are elected to use their own judgement on behalf ofthe people. The only sanction which governs them is the risk of not being
re-elected. But it seems that Parliamentary elections may no longer be sufficientto satisfy people that government is accountable to them. Elections are heldinfrequently. In many constituencies the outcome is usually a foregone con-clusion, and whatever the result it is hardly likely to indicate where voterswill stand on the multitude of issues which will be dealt with by governmentin the ensuing years. People therefore have a need for their elected representatives to keep in continuous touch with them, so that government, though for the timebeing in full control, may at least be exposed to the force of democratic opinion and be required to explain the reasons for its decisions.1237. It might be argued that government is already exposed in just that way through press and radio, and through the now overwhelming influence of television. These media do undoubtedly provide one of the most importantlinks between government and the people. If people nevertheless feel thatgovernment is out of touch with them and lacks understanding of their prob-lems, it may be that some part of the remedy is to be found in a changedapproach by the media. It could be that they now put out information about government in such volume or in such a way that most people are unable to absorb it and abandon the attempt to do so. Or their particular selection of news and comment may not be such as to reflect adequately either the feelingsabout government which are uppermost in people&apos;s minds or the concern andefforts of government to take those feelings into account. The media do not ofcourse exist simply to act as a forum for democracy. They have other roles,such as the provision of entertainment, which are not in any sense political.But in view of their enormous influence, the effects which they have on the relationship between government and people may need to be better understood.Public officials1238. Although politicians are responsible for government and play a prominent part in controlling it, the great bulk of its work is dealt with solely by officials. For many people it is the great mass of departmental, machinery which is largely responsible for conveying an impression of remoteness and lackof concern. Indeed it has been suggested to us from within the civil serviceitself that much might be done to reduce alienation from government by improving communication between the citizen and the various departments andagencies of government.1239. In the past this has been seen as presenting a number of difficulties with constitutional implications. Departmental officials are responsible to theirMinister and for the most part act only in his name. They have no separateauthority of their own which would enable them to respond to the public in aless inhibited way. Officials working on policy are not usually authorised todiscuss it with the public or with the news media, since this might causeembarrassment to Ministers or be considered discourteous to Parliament. Insome cases secrecy is maintained also to avoid commercial speculation or tosafeguard national security. Such restrictions on publicity have made it difficult for officials to open their minds to people outside government and revealthemselves as fair and trustworthy people with a genuine concern for theinterests of the public. If they cannot somehow be revealed in this light people will tend to assume that they are remote and insensitive planners, maintainingsecrecy for their own purposes.
1240. In the executive offices of government departments, where mostcontacts with the public take place, much of the work is governed by national policies and by the desire to ensure that citizens in the various parts of thecountry are treated alike. Scope for the individual approach may be limited,and officials for the most part have to apply and defend laws and rules forwhich they are not responsible and which in fact they may not like. The moreable among them are therefore handicapped in their efforts to respond to thepublic in a helpful way. The less able may retreat into formality, or displayimpatience which can do lasting harm. And in practical terms the situation ismuch the same in local government offices. For reasons such as these a good many people have come to expect from officials the kind of response which is adequate but unsatisfying; and when they receive a more encouraging responseit does not seem to alter their expectations for the future. They know little ofthe effort that officials put into government or of the attention given behind thescenes to individual needs.1241. It is desirable therefore that communication between officials and thepublic should be improved. But is it realistic to hope that officials performingoften unpopular tasks on the authority of someone unseen can be viewed bythe general public in an appreciative way? We think it is. The departments and agencies of government have a continuous and long-term function. Eachis in touch with the public for limited purposes requiring a certain kind of relationship which can be built up over a period of time. With greater attentionto the impression that government is creating, with less formality and morepersonal contact, officials might appear in a more true and sympathetic light and in practice might become more openly and personally responsible for whatthey do. Such an improvement could only be brought about from within theservice itself. Admittedly it might in some fields add to the cost of government.It could not be achieved without staff adequate in numbers and calibre, since aresponsive attitude can hardly be expected from an official who is continuallyunder pressure or one not fully qualified to accept the responsibilities of his office. Much might, however, be accomplished simply by devoting greaterattention to communication skills in the recruitment, training and deployment of staff.The attitude of the people1242. We have emphasised that communication is a two-way process. Thegulf between government and people cannot be bridged by the actions ofgovernment alone; the people themselves have an important part to play. Theyhave a duty to exercise their franchise and other democratic rights and to knowbroadly how government works, appreciating its difficulties and the limitations on what it can do. Their pressures on government should be founded in a responsible attitude and a sense of obligation towards the community. If it istrue that higher educational standards have made people more critical anddemanding, they should also have made them more understanding and responsible. Complaints about the gap between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; tend to overlook that the people classified as &quot;them&quot; are for the most part ordinarycitizens doing their jobs to the best of their ability. Except in relation to the specific work they do they also belong to &quot;us&quot;.
1243. A greater knowledge and understanding of government may well be akey requirement. We have noted the apparently widespread ignorance inScotland and Wales of the existence and functions of the Scottish and welsh offices. We have no reason to suppose that the knowledge of similar matters in England is any greater. It may be that the practical workings of governmentshould be taught as a necessary part of secondary and higher education. Perhapstelevision and radio could be used more effectively to show people how govern-ment is run and give them a chance to comment on it. Education about government is a delicate matter, fraught with political difficulties. But politicsoften intrude when they are not wanted or necessary. For example, new measurestend to be explained on radio and television by Ministers, who are inevitablyconcerned with political advocacy. This task might on some occasions be per-formed in a more useful and acceptable way by the neutral officials whose jobit will be to administer the new measures.Conclusion1244. The difficulties of communication between government and people have long been recognised, but in recent times two new factors have emerged. Theseare the enormous growth in the scope and complexity of government and the almost continuous introduction of change. These factors have caused govern-ment to acquire the image of a huge insensitive machine with an ever-increasingmomentum of its own. There is therefore a growing desire for it to be in someway humanised and brought back into closer contact with the people.1245. It is possible to take the view that people have come to expect too muchof government, that since it is they who have pressed government to do moreand more they must leave government to get on with the job and accept theconsequences, one of which is the remoteness of government from the individual;and that in any case communication is bound to be imperfect in humaninstitutions and it is unwise to encourage expectations of any real improvement.But neither people nor government seem to take this view. There is evidencethat both would like a closer relationship and believe it to be possible. If thatis so the future can be approached in a more optimistic spirit. Although agood deal of what government has to do will never be popular, it should bepossible to increase the general understanding and trust between government and people to an extent which is well worth striving for. We ourselves have made no proposals, except by way of illustration. We have offered only an initialappraisal of a difficult and intricate problem which requires further and more detailed study.
PART XNORTHERN IRELAND
THE OLD SYSTEM OF HOME RULE1246. As explained in Chapter 1, we gave priority to the consideration ofNorthern Ireland matters immediately after our visits to Belfast to take evidence in the early part of 1970. Before very long, however, there were developments in the province which meant that that part of the evidence which containedproposals for constitutional change could no longer be relied upon as accuratelyreflecting the state of public opinion there. The United Kingdom Governmentwas keeping in close touch with changing opinion and was striving to workout acceptable new arrangements for Northern Ireland&apos;s government. In thesecircumstances we decided that our best course would be to suspend work on northern Ireland, to complete our enquiries into the possibilities of devolution to other parts of the United Kingdom and formulate our conclusions on them,and then to seek to relate those conclusions to Northern Ireland in the lightof the situation existing at the time.1247. This does not mean that our enquiries into the working of the constitu-tion of Northern Ireland and the evidence we took there were of no value.Apart from their relevance to the need for possible change in Northern Irelanditself, they enabled us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the particular form of devolution in operation there and its suitability for adoption, with any changes found to be desirable, in other parts of the United Kingdom. in chapter 16 we have given our reasons for rejecting the view that the failureof devolved government to solve the problems of Northern Ireland should suffice to rule out all consideration of its possible extension to other parts of theUnited Kingdom. In preparing this Report we have drawn extensively on theNorthern Ireland experience, particularly in Part VI, where we examine thescope for the devolution of government functions and the financial arrange-ments that might be made, and in Part VII, where in Chapter 17 we lookclosely into the problems of legislative devolution. The conclusions we reached in our study of Northern Ireland are also reflected both in our individualpreferences for the schemes for devolution in Great Britain put forward inPart VIII and in the detailed provisions of those schemes.1248. In the present chapter we give a brief general account of the working in Northern Ireland of the constitution provided by the Government of ireland act 1920 and an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of publicattitudes to it. We then record the conclusions we reached after taking evidence on the principal defects in the Act and on the objectives of any scheme of reform. In Chapter 29 we describe and assess the financial arrangements asthey existed up to 1972. Finally, in Chapter 30, we note the main features ofthe new constitution approved by Parliament for Northern Ireland, andcompare them with the proposals in the scheme of legislative devolution which some of us favour for Scotland and Wales. Except on the question of repre-sentation at Westminster, we make no recommendations of our own for northern Ireland.home rule in practiceDifference between theory and practice1249. Rarely can there have been a country with a more curious constitu-tional history than Northern Ireland. The Act of 1920, though passed by a
predominantly Unionist Parliament, is best regarded as the last of the stringof home rule measures on which the British Liberal Party, in its heyday fromGladstone to Asquith, expended so much of its energies. It was the only one that ever came into effect, and then in the one part of Ireland that had said itwould fight rather than accept home rule. Northern Ireland, by one of history&apos;schoicest ironies, is the one place where Liberal home rule ideas were ever putinto practice and by a solidly Unionist government. It can truly be said tohave been given a constitution that it did not want and that was designed for another place.1250. Moreover, as we have already noted, the practice of home rule wasvery different from the theory. There were three main reasons for this. Thefirst was that, because of the many close ties with Great Britain, NorthernIreland was at no time able or willing to exercise anything like the freedom to pursue independent policies that the 1920 Act envisaged. The second and thiswas one of the major factors in limiting that freedom was the total breakdown,soon after the Act came into effect, of the financial arrangements which it provided and the substitution, though ostensibly within the framework of theAct, of some very different arrangements. In our next chapter we describe how the change took place and why it was necessary.1251. The third reason for the difference between theory and practice wasthat the Act applied to Northern Ireland the system of Parliamentary democracyin use at Westminster, which depends for its smooth working on an alternationbetween Government and Opposition. The rule that the &quot;winner takes all&quot; that the Government is formed exclusively from the party that has a majority,be it large or small, in the legislature, and that the Opposition is totally excluded is far easier to accept when electoral victory passes from party to party.Balance and equity are achieved by alternation. But in Northern Ireland thewinner was always the Unionist Party. There was nothing contrived or improperabout this; whatever may have been true, from time to time and from place toplace, about local government elections, there is no room for doubt that at every general election for the Northern Ireland House of Commons a clear majority of the electors deliberately intended the Unionist Party to form thegovernment. The permanent majority was a permanent and cohesive majority in the electorate. But such a result, so often repeated, and apparently so likelyto continue, inevitably produced great dissatisfaction in the minority and raised the question of the suitability of that particular form of government in the specialcircumstances of Northern Ireland.Support for home rule1252. It is perhaps surprising in these circumstances that home rule shouldhave been so successful in many fields and that it should have attracted suchstrong support. When we took evidence in Northern Ireland in the spring of1970, it was strongly supported by witnesses of widely differing politicalviews, and no organised body of opinion suggested to us that it should be abolished.1253. Representatives of the Ulster Unionist Party told us that, althoughhome rule had been imposed upon the people of Northern Ireland against theirwishes, they now appreciated its advantages, both for adapting legislation to
the needs of the province and for giving people more ready access to their parliamentary representatives, and they wished to retain it. The Ulster liberal party commented that, within the limits imposed by the deep political andreligious divisions in the community, the experiment in devolution had workedremarkably well. The Northern Ireland Labour Party referred to advantages in the economic field and the benefits of closer Parliamentary accountability.The Nationalist Party, which was then the main opposition party, while making it clear that it sought the reunification of Ireland as an independent andsovereign state, recognised that our terms of reference precluded us fromconsidering this possibility and put forward proposals directed to improving the existing home rule constitution rather than its replacement by direct rulefrom Westminster. The Northern Ireland Council of the Confederation ofBritish Industry saw advantages to industry in the existing arrangements,particularly in having Ministers and civil servants readily accessible; whilethe Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, though they emphasised Westminsters ultimate responsibility for Northern Ireland,did not propose direct assumption of that responsibility by the ending of devolution, but only changes in the home rule provisions.1254. A factor of major importance in the attitude of people in Ulster tothe continuance of home rule at that time was its relationship to the widerquestion of Northern Ireland&apos;s position within the United Kingdom. Severalwitnesses told us that the ending of home rule would be seen as a threat totheir own positions by both sides in the dispute which had been at the heart of Northern Ireland politics during the whole period of its existence. Since thenNorthern Ireland has had a period of more than twelve months of direct rule.Throughout this time, however, it has been apparent that the leaders of publicopinion, with few exceptions, and the overwhelming majority of the NorthernIreland people have wished to see direct rule continue no longer than is necessaryto work out new arrangements for the government of the province involvingsome form of home rule which will be generally acceptable.The devolution of executive power1255. We endeavoured to assess the value of home rule in practical terms byconsidering whether it provided machinery for the institution of laws and practices best suited to the special circumstances and needs of the people ofNorthern Ireland. We found it helpful to distinguish administrative fromlegislative aspects.1256. Several witnesses pointed to the advantages derived from havinggovernment departments in Belfast with power to take decisions over a wide range of executive matters. One example often quoted was the scheme of aidsto industry. Another was industrial training, where the policy was the same asthat in Great Britain but the administrative chain of authority had beenshortened. Even the most severe critic of home rule among our witnesses, whodescribed the devolution of legislative and policy-making powers as an unhappyfailure, considered the devolution of administrative and executive powers tohave been an outstanding success. He argued that there was an optimumgeographical size for every administrative unit, and that &quot;in the ideally-sizedunit a dissatisfied farmer anywhere within its boundaries ought to be able to
travel by public transport to the administrative capital, horse-whip the responsible official, and get home again by public transport, all in the same day&quot;;and he suggested that Northern Ireland was of exactly that size.1257. Many witnesses commented on the close and intimate relationship which existed between Ministers and their officials on the one hand and members and officials of local authorities, businessmen and the general public on theother. Because the former were more accessible and more aware of local needs and of local difficulties, and perhaps less heavily pressed, than their counterpartsin London, and were in a position to take decisions on matters arising day by day, business could be dealt with more promptly and smoothly and grievancescould be redressed more readily. We were interested to note that this view was shared by Sir Edmund Compton, who was for some time parliamentary commissioner for Administration in both the United Kingdom and NorthernIreland. In his report on Northern Ireland for 1970 he wrote that &quot;the individualcitizen frequently gets a better service from a Northern Ireland Ministry than hewould get from a United Kingdom Department in similar circumstances, owingto the easier access to central government that is both feasible and customaryin a territory the size of Northern Ireland&quot;.1258. There was some recognition in our evidence that the greater intimacyof the political and administrative processes could result in a loss of objectivityand impartiality. It was not, however, represented to us that this was in practicea serious defect in the Northern Ireland administration at the departmentallevel, whatever might be the position at the local authority level. A numberof witnesses paid tribute to the high standards of courtesy, efficiency andimpartiality maintained by the Northern Ireland civil servants.1259. We were left in no doubt that at the time of our visit the people ofNorthern Ireland believed that they derived substantial advantages fromadministrative devolution, and we accepted that this belief was well founded.The devolution of legislative power1260. The value of legislative devolution was more open to question. Muchof the Stormont legislation followed closely that passed at Westminster forGreat Britain, with only minor modifications, including those necessary totake account of the fact that it would have to be administered by differentauthorities and enforced in different courts against a background of a differentsystem of law. It is not difficult to see why this should have been so. Uniformpolicies were sometimes dictated by the pressure of public opinion. NorthernIreland could not lag far behind reforms in Great Britain when there was popularsupport for them. In many other matters, particularly those which concerned the regulation of trade and industry, there were manifest advantages to be gained from uniformity of law and practice throughout the United Kingdom. another important factor tending towards the adoption of common policies was theprinciple of parity in taxation and social services which governed the financialrelationship between Belfast and London. As we shall see in our next chapter,successive Governments of Northern Ireland set great store by the principleof parity; but one effect of its adoption was that Northern Ireland could notin practice, despite the considerable degree of legislative autonomy which it
possessed, adopt policies in the social services field which differed very greatlyfrom those applied in Great Britain where any considerable expenditure ofmoney was involved.1261. The preparation and passage of legislation in Northern Ireland togive effect to policies similar to those adopted in Great Britain inevitably involvedsome duplication of effort. But this was kept to a minimum by the sensible use of westminster statutes as a basis for drafting Northern Ireland Bills, thus reducingthe demands on the smaller staffs of the Northern Ireland Ministries. The valueof having a separate legislature would be called in question if nearly all itslegislation was of a kind which duplicated that at Westminster. But this was not so. At our request information was provided which showed that, of the 190Acts of Parliament passed in the period from the beginning of 1965 up to5th February 1970, thirty-six were of a type which could be described as closely following earlier Westminster statutes, seventy-six were peculiar to northern Ireland, and sixty-two fell somewhere between the two extremes; the re-maining sixteen were technical statutes suchas the Appropriation and consolidate fund Acts. The corresponding figures for Statutory Rules and Orders were,out of a total of 1,602, 400 duplicating those at Westminster, 613 peculiar to northern Ireland, 549 in between and fortytechnical. This is a purely quantitativeaccount, making no distinction between large and small statutes and statutory instruments, and having no regard to their relative importance. It does, however,suggest that a substantial part of Stormonfs legislation was not of a kind which followed very closely that previously enacted at Westminster. In termsof Parliamentary time the significance of the remaining legislation was further reduced by the readiness of the Northern Ireland Parliament to pass it without giving it such close scrutiny as was given to measures which did not to so great an extent rest on Westminster statutes. It was estimated that the propor-tion of Parliamentary time spent on re-enactment of Westminster statuteswas something less than a third of the total time spent on legislation, and amuch smaller part of the total Parliamentary time, a good deal of which wastaken up with debates, questions and other non-legislative business of specialNorthern Ireland concern.1262. The Northern Ireland government departments gave many examples of the use made of the powers granted to the Northern Ireland parliament in the 1920 Act. Statutes which showed substantial departures from, or had noclose parallel with, Westminster legislation were broadly of three kinds. First,there were those which adapted Westminster measures, sometimes after someyears, and improved upon them. One of our witnesses has written that &quot;thepractice of foraging in the Westminster statute book, selecting the best and improving on it in the light of some years&apos; administration over the channelhas become well-established&quot;. The Ministry of Home Affairs gave as an examplelegislation dealing with the treatment of offenders. Secondly, there were measureswhere Northern Ireland had taken the lead, and been followed some time laterby Westminster; examples were the parole of offenders and the protection ofwildlife. Thirdly, there were those which were designed to meet circumstancespeculiar to Northern Ireland, including geographical factors such as the separa-tion from Great Britain and the existence of a land border; safeguarding ofemployment was one example and agricultural marketing another. The Northern
Ireland Parliament also exercised its discretion in another way, by deliberatelynot legislating in some matters, such as abortion and homosexuality, whichhad been the subject of legislation at Westminster.1263. A separate Northern Ireland legislature would not of course be essential to meet the provinces special legislative needs. After March 1972Northern Ireland laws were made by Order in Council subject to the controlof the United Kingdom Parliament. This method of legislation was adopted asa temporary expedient, and is acknowledged to be unsatisfactory in that itdoes not permit legislation to be fully debated and amended in accordancewith the ordinary Parliamentary procedures. It would be theoretically possiblefor the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for Northern Ireland on all matters in the conventional manner. Acts applying to Northern Ireland onlycould be passed, or special provisions could be included in United KingdomActs, as is now done for Scotland. But the volume of such legislation would necessarily be large, even if variations of policy were kept to a minimum,since the law in Northern Ireland is largely the product of a distinct organicdevelopment over a period of several centuries and this fact would in many instances make common legislation impossible. If other business were not to suffer to an unacceptable extent. Northern Ireland affairs would be bound toreceive considerably less attention at Westminster than they would in a separatelegislature. When attempts are being made to reduce the burden on West-minster, the return to it as a permanent measure of full responsibility for northern Ireland would be a retrograde step and a highly unwelcome one.our conclusions on home ruleIts value1264. We have no doubt at all that home rule was of considerable advantage to Northern Ireland. Particularly in the large areas of government which wereunaffected, or at least were not dominated, by the community problem, conspi-cuous progress was made under it. Perhaps the most impressive of these wasin the field of health, where Northern Ireland, which used to be well belowthe standards of Great Britain, caught up with and in some respects surpassedthem. The other social services were steadily built up. Education was greatly improved and, though it still continues, below university level, in two almostentirely different systems, both are supported by the state. Economic policy was flexible and imaginative, and, though the level of unemployment continuedto be higher than the average for Great Britain, the gap had been significantlynarrowed at the time of the outbreak of the disturbances. Considerable progress was made in attracting new industry and in diversifying the economy of theprovince. It must be questioned whether so much would have been accomplishedin all these fields without a separate administration to watch over the affairs ofNorthern Ireland.1265. The conclusion we reached after taking evidence, therefore, was that northern Ireland should continue to have a separate subordinate legislatureand a government of its own, and that constitutional change should take theform of the modification of the home rule provisions and not their abrogation.Its defects1266. Experience has shown that the home rule provisions of 1920 had certain defects. These were of two kinds. Some were of a general character, not
specially related to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, while others arose directly out of the community problem which is peculiar to theprovince.1267. The defects of a general kind concerned both the institutions ofdevolved government and the functions conferred upon them. The institutionswere modelled very closely on those at Westminster. There was a Parliament oftwo chambers, a Privy Council and a Government which in their outwardforms, nomenclature and procedures with few exceptions mirrored theirWestminster counterparts. This made for unnecessary elaboration in relationto the nature and extent of the functions to be performed, and tended to maskthe subordinate status of the provincial institutions of government. The devolvedfunctions included some in which little, if any, independence of action was practicable. At the same time, the financial arrangements, which of necessitywere very different from those which the 1920 Act provided, were such thatindependent action that might have been desirable and practicable on other grounds was precluded or at least severely limited by the nature of the UnitedKingdom Treasury control.1268. The defects which related to the particular circumstances of NorthernIreland also concerned both the institutions of government and their functions.The institutions were of a kind which left a large section of the communityalways in a minority, without any share in government or any prospect ofsecuring a share in government, and the restrictions placed on the exercise ofthe devolved functions did not suffice to safeguard the interests of that minority.The objectives of reform1269. The existence in any country of two distinct and mutually distrustfulcommunities presents special problems in constitution-making. Communitydivisions and the political problems that go with them cannot be fully solved byconstitutional devices. The most that can be expected of constitutional change is that it should remove any features in the constitution that may have played apart in perpetuating discord, and that the new provisions should be such aswill contribute to the easing of tensions and the improvement of relationships.For any new constitution to succeed statesmanship of a high order on bothsides, exercised over a long period, is required.1270. Recognising these limitations, we decided after our visits to NorthernIreland that the objectives of any constitutional change we might wish torecommend should be to simplify the institutions and procedures of government,to provide within them some means of permitting the more effective participation of the minority, to make a more realistic division of functions betweenWestminster and Northern Ireland, to provide new financial arrangements which would allow a greater measure of independence in the exercise of the devolved functions, and to give greater protection to minority interests.1271. In March 1973 the United Kingdom Government presented its own proposals for constitutional reform. In the period that had elapsed since we took evidence in Northern Ireland much had happened within the province.Although at the time of our visits the disorders had begun, representatives ofthe minority parties were still taking a full part in the work of the Northern
Ireland Parliament and it was possible for a leading member of the minority community to say that the age of abstention was past. Shortly afterwards,escalating violence and government reaction to it led to the withdrawal ofminority representatives from the Northern Ireland Parliament and a chain ofevents which culminated in the suspension of that Parliament and the impositionof direct rule. It is not surprising that the objectives of the United KingdomGovernment, as stated in the White Paper putting forward new constitutionalproposals1, while broadly the same as those we had ourselves formulated atan earlier date, differed in some important respects. They included, for example,a statement that due provision must be made for the United Kingdom Govern-ment to have an effective and continuing voice in Northern Ireland&apos;s affairs,commensurate with the commitment of financial, economic and military resources in the province ; and emphasis was placed on the importance of ensuring that future arrangements for security and public order were such as would command public confidence both in Northern Ireland itself and in theUnited Kingdom as a whole.Northern Ireland Constitutional Proposals (Cmnd. 5259).
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTSoutline of home rule finance1272. In this chapter we describe and assess the financial relationship between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments as it existedup to 1972, when the old system of home rule came to an end.1273. The true nature of that relationship was obscured by an artificialadherence to outdated conventions laid down in the 1920 Act. The intentionof the Act was that Northern Ireland should be provided with a comfortableincome and left to its own devices. Its revenue would be sufficient both to finance the transferred services and to furnish a substantial contribution towards the cost of the services still operated by the United Kingdom Govern-ment. Very soon, however, the income provided by the Act proved insufficient to finance even the transferred services. Ways and means had to be found of allocating a greater proportion of United Kingdom funds to Northern Ireland,and it had to be accepted that the province would not be able to contribute towards the cost of United Kingdom services. In this new situation the composition of Northern Ireland&apos;s expenditure became an immediate concern of the United Kingdom Government, since a substantial part had to be met out of United Kingdom resources. Close working relations between the NorthernIreland Government and the United Kingdom Treasury eventually led to a situation in which the United Kingdom Government agreed to underwritewhatever Northern Ireland expenditure was approved by the Treasury.1274. This represented a complete reversal of what the Act intended. Themethod of financing provided in the Act was what we have described in chapter 15 as the revenue basis, in which a subordinate government is givencertain predetermined sources of revenue and has to finance the devolved services out of the proceeds. The method actually operated was the expenditurebasis, in which expenditure requirements are measured first and the subordinategovernment is furnished with the income necessary to meet them.1275. notwithstanding this fundamental change, the forms of the Actwere still observed. Revenues were still apportioned to Northern Ireland inthe way laid down in the Act, and a figure was included in the Northern Irelandbudget representing a contribution towards United Kingdom services. except to the few people who were sufficiently interested to study all the figures andlisten to Ministerial speeches, it was not apparent that the Northern ireland government was able to balance its budget only because, in addition to the revenues allocated to it under the Act, substantial payments for specific services were made direct to it by the United Kingdom Government. These further payments greatly exceeded Northern Ireland&apos;s nominal contribution to UnitedKingdom services.1276. For a proper understanding of this situation it is necessary to tracethe course of events in rather more detail. We start by outlining the financial provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, and go on to show how laterdevelopments led to the system in operation when the Northern Ireland
Parliament was suspended in 1972. We then assess that system, pointing tosome defects but not forgetting its achievements. It will be evident throughoutthis discussion that Northern Ireland finance raises in a concrete way all thequestions of principle dealt with in Chapter 15.financial provisions of the government of ireland act 1920Northern Ireland&apos;s financial responsibilities1277. The financial provisions of the old Northern Ireland constitution were set out in Sections 20 to 34 of the 1920 Act. The Northern Ireland parliament was given responsibility for financing the services transferred to it, and at thesame time was required to make a contribution towards the &quot;imperial liabilitiesand expenditure&quot; incurred by the United Kingdom Government. This payment,which came to be known as the &quot;imperial contribution&quot;, was intended to helpmeet the United Kingdom expenditure specified in the Sixth Schedule to theAct. The main items listed were national debt charges, defence expenditure andthe cost of United Kingdom representation overseas.Northern Ireland&apos;s statutory sources of revenue1278. To meet its financial responsibilities the Northern Ireland parliament was given two sources of revenue. It was empowered to raise taxes in NorthernIreland (transferred taxes), and it was allocated a share of the taxes levied bythe United Kingdom Government on the people of the United Kingdom as awhole (reserved taxes).1279. The power to levy transferred taxes extended to all forms of taxationexcept those specifically excluded by Section 21. The excluded taxes were,however, the biggest revenue-raisers customs duties, excise duties on manu-factured articles and taxes on business profits and personal income. A generaltax on capital was also precluded. In practice the transferred taxes were confined to estate duty, stamp duties, motor vehicle duties, pool betting duty, generalbetting duty, certain small excise duties, mineral rights duty and, from 1966onwards, the selective employment tax. The Northern Ireland Parliament had power to raise or lower the rates of the transferred taxes, and under Section 25it also had power to grant relief from United Kingdom income tax to residentsof Northern Ireland by way of repayment out of Northern Ireland funds. Outsidethe reserved field the Act left the Government of Northern Ireland free to levynew taxes, different from those in the United Kingdom, but except to a verysmall extent, for example in the betting field, this freedom was never used.Nor was the right to grant relief from United Kingdom income tax everexercised.1280. Northern Ireland&apos;s second and main source of revenue was itsallocated share of the reserved taxes. This amount represented the proportionof United Kingdom taxes mainly income tax, corporation tax and customs and excise duties which was estimated to have been raised from the taxpayersof Northern Ireland. Section 24 provided that before paying this amount overto the Northern Ireland Government, the United Kingdom Government should retain out of it the imperial contribution and also the net cost to the UnitedKingdom Government of operating, within Northern Ireland, certain reserved
services such as revenue collection and the maintenance of the Supreme Court.The sum actually paid over to the Northern Ireland Government was knownas the &quot;residuary share of reserved taxes&quot;.The Joint Exchequer Board1281. Presiding over all these operations was the Joint Exchequer Boardset up by Section 32 of the Act. It consisted of one member appointed by theTreasury, one appointed by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance and anindependent chairman appointed by the Crown. Members nominated by theTreasury and the Ministry of Finance were invariably officials of those depart-ments. The main duties of the Joint Exchequer Board were to determine eachyear Northern Ireland&apos;s share of the reserved taxes and the amount of theimperial contribution. Under Section 23(3) the imperial contribution was tobe such amount as the Board determined to be just, having regard to the relativetaxable capacities of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Apart froma number of other less important apportionments which the Board had tomake, it was also given the general duty of determining any other matterreferred to it jointly by the Treasury and the Northern Ireland Ministry ofFinance which was connected with Northern Ireland&apos;s residuary share of reserved taxes, or Northern Ireland&apos;s revenue or expenditure, or the cost ofany reserved service.Summary of Northern Ireland&apos;s statutory financial position under the old system1282. It can be seen from this outline that the Act of 1920 was intendedto confer on Northern Ireland a very considerable measure of financial responsi-bility and independence. The ultimate supreme power of the United kingdom parliament under Section 75 must not be overlooked, but with that reservationthe measure of financial freedom accorded to Northern Ireland was comparable to that which might be enjoyed by a province in a federation. There was noquestion of its relying on negotiable grants from the central government,or of central control over its expenditure. Either by outright transfer or byattribution Northern Ireland was awarded its full share of the whole range of taxes, and there was an independent body which could determine any disputes.The imperial contribution and the cost of certain reserved services operated inNorthern Ireland were a first charge on Northern Ireland&apos;s income, and the transferred services were to be wholly financed out of what was left. The level of services was not to be specifically related to standards in Great Britain. It wasto depend on the net income available to Northern Ireland from its predeter-mined revenues, and those revenues could be increased or reduced at will by raising or lowering the rates of the transferred taxes.1283. An indication of the financial pattern expected to flow from the Govern-ment of Ireland Act can be obtained by looking at the figures of revenue andexpenditure when the Act was passed. At that time the revenue of the wholeof Ireland was estimated to be about  41 million and expenditure on non-imperial services about  23 million. Accordingly, on the assumption that theAct was to apply to all Ireland, the imperial contribution was fixed initiallyat  18 million. These figures show what a large margin of income Irelandappeared to have, based on current levels of revenue and expenditure. NorthernIreland&apos;s share of the imperial contribution was expected to be about 8 million.
developments after 19201284. The financial plan laid down in 1920 by the Government of ireland act was defeated almost as soon as the Act was passed. With the onset ofeconomic depression, incomes in Northern Ireland fell and unemployment rose.There was a corresponding reduction in Northern Ireland&apos;s revenues from taxation, and a corresponding increase in its expenditure on unemploymentrelief. The imperial contribution was threatened, and in 1923 a committee was set up under Lord Colwyn to consider what a &quot;just&quot; contribution should be.This committee, which included a Northern Ireland representative, started achain of developments which by 1954 had completely transformed the basisof Northern Ireland finance.The Colwyn Committee of 19231285. As a result of the findings of the Colwyn Committee, it was accepted that if the levels of both the reserved and transferred taxes in Northern Irelandwere on a par with the levels of the corresponding taxes in Great Britain, thenper capita expenditure on Northern Ireland services should, from 1924 onwards,increase at the same rate as in Great Britain. In effect this meant that theimperial contribution was no longer a first charge on Northern Ireland&apos;revenue. Instead the first charge was to be the Northern Ireland Governmenfsown expenditure, increasing in line with expenditure in Great Britain. Theimperial contribution became the residual element in Northern Ireland&apos;budget. The Colwyn Committee therefore went a long way towards under-mining two of the major principles of the Government of Ireland Act: it pro-vided a strong disincentive to the exercise of Northern Ireland&apos;s power to varyits own taxes, and it envisaged that the imperial contribution might be reducedto vanishing point. At that stage there was no question of ensuring completeparity of services with Great Britain. Where Northern Ireland&apos;s standardswere historically lower than corresponding standards in Great Britain, theimperial contribution could not be reduced in order to make up the leeway.;it was only the rate of increase that was to match that of Great Britain.The Unemployment Insurance Agreement of 19261286. In 1926 came the forerunner of a number of agreements under which united Kingdom funds were transferred to Northern Ireland for specificpurposes, supplementing the revenue from taxation due under the 1920 Act.Some of these agreements were reciprocal in form, but actual payments byNorthern Ireland to the United Kingdom were very small or non-existent.The first agreement was the Unemployment Insurance Agreement, made in recognition of the exceptionally high level of unemployment in NorthernIreland. The agreement provided that if in any year the payment by the NorthernIreland Exchequer to its Unemployment Fund exceeded,per head of population,the corresponding payment by the United Kingdom Government to the GreatBritain Fund, then the United Kingdom Exchequer would meet three-quarters of the excess.The financial agreement of 1938: the emergence of &quot;parity&quot;1287. In the 1930s the imperial contribution fell to a very low level in1934/35 it was  24,000 and Northern Ireland was still having difficulty in
financing the transferred services. In 1938 this situation led to a new financial agreement between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments.The agreement provided that if there were a deficit on the Northern Irelandbudget which was not the result of a standard of social expenditure higher thanthat of Great Britain, nor the result of a standard of taxation lower than thatof Great Britain, then the United Kingdom Government would find means tomake good the deficit in such a way as to ensure that Northern Ireland could have the same social services and the same standards as Great Britain. Thisagreement therefore laid down the guiding principle of parity in both taxation and services on which financial relations between the two Governments continuedto rest thereafter. It also recognised formally that in order to finance parityservices it might be necessary for the United Kingdom not merely to do without an imperial contribution but to transfer to Northern Ireland additional UnitedKingdom funds; and except for the years during and immediately following theSecond World War that was normally the position. The imperial contributionwas, in effect, usually a minus.1288. The emergence of parity in 1938 was neither sudden nor complete. Theagreement then reached was merely the main formal step in a process of negotiation which started well before 1938 and extended continuously thereafter.As we explain in paragraph 1304, in practice parity was a vague and flexibleconcept, and it was being developed all the time.Agreements in the post-war years1289. After the war the general expansion in social services created further financial difficulties for Northern Ireland. In 1946 an interim agreement wasreached, providing for special transfers of United Kingdom funds to meet expenditure in Northern Ireland on unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance and family allowances. It was agreed that parity of taxation and services between Northern Ireland and Great Britain would continue to be themain guiding principle, and that there would be close consultation betweenthe Treasury and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance about the operationof this principle and any departure from it. The close working relationship ofthese two departments became an essential feature of the arrangements.1290. With the completion of the framework for post-war social services in1948, the interim agreement of 1946 was superseded by new arrangements which,in general form, continued for the remaining life of the Northern ireland parliament. In addition to its transferred taxes and its share of the reservedtaxes, Northern Ireland was granted special payments to meet national insurance and other social benefits. For national insurance and industrial injuries, it was arranged that the Northern Ireland and Great Britain funds should be main-tained in the same proportionate relationship to each other as that of theircontributing populations by transfers from the richer to the poorer fund.In practice this meant substantial Great Britain payments to Northern ireland for national insurance, and small payments by Northern Ireland to GreatBritain in respect of industrial injuries. The other social services initiallynational assistance, family allowances, non-contributory pensions, the health service and temporary unemployment benefit were covered by the social services Agreement. This provided that if the cost of those services in NorthernIreland exceeded 2\ per cent, of the total United Kingdom cost, then the
United Kingdom Exchequer would pay 80 per cent, of the excess to the NorthernIreland Exchequer. The Social Services Agreement was subsequently amended in the light of structural changes, and the services covered became family allowances, supplementary benefits and the health services.&quot;Leeway&quot;1291. The next main development was provision for additional expenditure to make up leeway. After being a talking point for some years, this principle was endorsed by the Joint Exchequer Board in 1954. The Board decided that in determining the imperial contribution it was relevant to consider not onlyparity of current standards, but also the necessity to incur special expenditurein Northern Ireland to make up a substantial leeway on services such as housing,schools and hospitals, and to offset the economic disadvantage which NorthernIreland suffered through its geographical separation from the rest of the UnitedKingdom. At the same time the Board reaffirmed the principle that the level ofboth reserved and transferred taxes in Northern Ireland should be similar tothe general level of taxation in Great Britain.Developments in the last years1292. After 1954 there were several less fundamental but neverthelessimportant developments. In 1965 arrangements along the lines of those betweenthe two national insurance funds were instituted for the Redundancy Funds ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. In 1966 the amount paid over to NorthernIreland as the residuary share of reserved taxes was increased by allocating to northern Ireland a population proportion 2-7 per cent. of the reservedcustoms and excise duties. This method of allocation superseded one less favourable to Northern Ireland which attempted a more precise attribution.In 1967 it was recognised that the cost in Northern Ireland of the newly intro-duced regional employment premium could not be borne by the NorthernIreland Exchequer, and the Finance Act 1967 provided that the Treasurymight pay the Northern Ireland Exchequer up to the whole cost of thepremiums in the province.1293. In 1971 new arrangements replaced the existing Social ServicesAgreement. In the first place a new agreement was made on the lines of the old,but covering only the health service and providing for calculation of thepayment to Northern Ireland on more generous lines. Instead of 80 per cent,of the excess cost over a 2  per cent, proportion, Northern Ireland was toreceive 90 per cent, of the excess over a 2 per cent, proportion. Secondly,family allowances and supplementary benefits, which previously came underthe Social Services Agreement, were made subject to an arrangement similarto that which applied to the regional employment premiums: that is to say,the Treasury was authorised to pay up to the whole cost of the service in NorthernIreland. Thirdly, the arrangement for payment up to the whole cost was appliedalso to three new cash social services family income supplements, constantattendance allowances and pensions for people over the age of eighty.Agricultural payments1294. Finally, it should be mentioned that the United Kingdom Exchequerbore the cost of Northern Ireland&apos;s agricultural support and guarantee system.
Agriculture was technically a transferred service, but when the United KingdomGovernment introduced price support measures in the early 1930s it wasagreed that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London wouldbe responsible for such measures in Northern Ireland, with the Northern IrelandMinistry of Agriculture administering the arrangements locally as agent forthe United Kingdom department. Agricultural payments from the UnitedKingdom to Northern Ireland farmers were substantial. In money terms theyaccounted for more than two-thirds of the Northern Ireland Ministry&apos;s work.the financial arrangements as operated in 1971/721295. The following is a simplified version1 of the Northern Ireland budgetestimate for 1971/72, the last year of the old system of home rule:Revenue mShare   of  United   KingdomReserved TaxesLess: Imperial contributionCost of reserved services in Northern IrelandExpenditureCost of Northern Ireland m269services418Residuary share of reservedtaxes 264Revenue    from    transferredtaxes 45Total revenue accruing to northern Ireland under theGovernment of Ireland Act1920 309Receipts   from   the   UnitedKingdom Government:Health Service Agreement  20Social Services Payments  37Remoteness grant payable under Agriculture Act1957     &quot; 2Additional Selective Em-ployment Premiumspayable under finance act 1967 11-     70Other revenue (mainly interestfrom local authorities) 39418 4181 Based on the financial statement for 1971/72 laid before the Northern Ireland parliament by the Minister of Finance on 4th May 1971 (H.C. 2111).
It can be seen that the imperial contribution was purely a nominal book-keepingentry, and that Northern Ireland was only able to balance its budget for 1971/72because in addition to its revenue under the Government of Ireland Act itexpected to receive  70 million from the United Kingdom Government to helpout with specific services. Also, quite outside these budget figures, it was expected that  30 million would be paid by the United Kingdom Governmentto Northern Ireland farmers in agricultural subsidies, and that  15 million wouldbe transferred to the Northern Ireland National Insurance Fund. In total,therefore, in addition to the revenue of  309 million due to Northern Irelandfrom reserved and transferred taxation under the Government of Ireland Act,it was to receive  115 million from the United Kingdom Government; andif account were taken of the full cost of the imperial services, valued nominallyat  1 million, the deficit would have been very much greater. The extent towhich Northern Ireland is &quot;subsidised&quot; by the rest of the United Kingdom is discussed in paragraphs 1309 to 1311.The transferred taxes1296. The  45 million received from transferred taxes in 1971/72 representedabout 15 per cent, of Northern Ireland&apos;s revenue from taxation, and included 29 million for selective employment tax. In the previous year, before the rate was halved, SET amounted to  44 million. Before the introduction of SET in1966 the transferred taxes represented only about 6 per cent, of taxation revenue.Owing to SET this proportion had by 1970/71 increased to 20 per cent. Onthe face of it, therefore, SET was a big boost for Northern Ireland&apos;s independentrevenues. In truth, however, the fundamental relationship between the twoGovernments was not affected, and there seems to have been no intention on either side that it should. There was some pressure in Northern Ireland againstthe introduction of SET, and this might have been regarded as a suitable occasion for the province to exercise its independence and opt out of the tax.But in order to maintain parity of taxation with Great Britain it would havebeen necessary instead to raise the level of the existing transferred taxes. in practical terms that would have involved a very steep increase in motor vehicleduty, which would not have been acceptable. Furthermore, SET was collectedthrough the national insurance stamp, and to have stamps of a lower valuecirculating in Northern Ireland would have presented a loophole for evasion.SET was therefore adopted in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain.Its separate administration as a transferred tax permitted some temporaryvariations from Great Britain in the amount of refund, designed to cushionNorthern Ireland from the immediate effects of increases in the rate. Thiswas in recognition of the high unemployment there, particularly in theconstruction industry. The variations were, however, all worked out inconjunction with the United Kingdom Treasury beforehand.1297. Of the other transferred taxes, by far the most important were motor vehicle duties, which accounted for  10 million. Estate duties totalled  3 million,excise duties  2 million, and stamp duties less than  1 million. In recognitionof the greater reliance on road transport in Northern Ireland, the rates for commercial vehicles were rather lower there than in Great Britain. Similarly,1 This general financial situation was not materially affected by subsequent changes inthe figures.
for many years the scale of estate duty in Northern Ireland had special regardto the relatively large number of small private companies. This concession wasremoved in 1971, when the scale was brought into line with that in Great Britain.1298. It is broadly true to say that where the rates of the transferred taxesdiffered from those in Great Britain, the variations were on a fairly modest scale and were designed to provide selective treatment for special social conditions. They were not designed to raise additional revenue to meet NorthernIreland&apos;s expenditure, nor to give Northern Ireland taxpayers generally thebenefit of lower taxation than existed in Great Britain. It has been made clear to us that manipulation of the transferred taxes for those more general purposeswould not have been practicable. Incomes in Northern Ireland were too lowto bear above-standard rates of taxation, and there was nothing in the financial arrangements which might have encouraged the Northern Ireland Governmentto levy such rates; since full Great Britain standards, including provision for making up leeway, could be obtained by parity rates of taxation, there was no necessity to levy above-standard rates. Equally the arrangements discouragedsub-standard rates. If taxes in Northern Ireland had been fixed at a level below that of Great Britain, Northern Ireland would have lost its automatic claim to services at the Great Britain standard, a standard which the Northern Irelandelectorate had come to expect. (Similar pressures in Australia have tended to eliminate differences in the levels of taxation between the various states,notwithstanding their constitutional power to impose different rates of taxationif they wish to do so.)Borrowing powers1299. Mention should be made of the arrangements which existed forborrowing by the Northern Ireland Government. Such borrowing was usedalmost entirely to finance loans to local authorities and other public corpora-tions within the province, though there was some scope for using borrowed money for the Northern Ireland Governmenfs own expenditure. Borrowingwas a useful device for meeting short-term deficiencies in revenue. It was not regarded as a way of financing expenditure not agreed by the Treasury; all expenditure had a potential effect on the total demand for real resources,and for this reason remained subject to Treasury oversight, however it wasfinanced.1300. The Northern Ireland Government borrowed from its own smallsavers, through Ulster Savings Certificates and Development Bonds, and issued Northern Ireland Exchequer Stock on the London Market. But its main source of borrowing was the United Kingdom National Loans Fund.Sums were borrowed from this Fund within limits fixed from time to time bythe United Kingdom Parliament, on terms in line with those applying to localauthorities in Great Britain.Expenditure1301. In matters of expenditure the co-operation between $tormOnt and london was close and amicable. Northern Ireland expenditure came within theUnited Kingdom system of Public Expenditure Survey control, and all expendi-ture that was novel or above parity standard, or which might have established
an unwelcome precedent for other parts of the United Kingdom, had to beagreed with the Treasury. Following the annual United Kingdom budget inMarch or April the Northern Ireland Government worked out its estimates ofrevenue and expenditure, discussed them with the Treasury and framed its ownbudget in the light of that discussion. Just before the Northern Ireland budget inMay there would be a meeting of the Joint Exchequer Board to fix NorthernIreland&apos;s residuary share of reserved taxation and to determine the imperial contribution. This operation put Northern Ireland in funds to the desiredextent. In practice the role of the Joint Exchequer Board was purely formal.The two sides reached agreement in advance, and the Board gave formalauthority to what had been decided.1302. The position of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance in relationto the Treasury was very similar to that of a United Kingdom governmentdepartment. All policies with substantial spending implications were ultimatelydependent upon a favourable response from the Treasury. Leaving aside thelegal forms of the 1920 Act, the only real difference was that in the case ofNorthern Ireland the response was more likely to be favourable. There were several reasons for this. In the first place the attitude of the Treasury was condi-tioned by the fact that Northern Ireland had its own Parliament set up by united Kingdom statute. This implied some responsibility on the part of theUnited Kingdom Government for making the system work and a moral obligation to facilitate the exercise of Northern Ireland independence whenever possible. Secondly, conditions in Northern Ireland were undeniably difficult,even before the recent period of violence, and any proposals put forward bythe provincial administration to meet the difficulties commanded sympatheticattention. It appears to us that the co-operative and responsible attitude shown by officials of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance must have been anencouragement to the Treasury in taking this sympathetic view.1303. Thirdly and this was a factor which ran through the whole range of inter-governmental relationships right up to the introduction of direct rule in 1972 the intractability of the &quot;Irish problem&quot; and the uncomfortablelessons of history provided every inducement to the Government in london to keep Northern Ireland out of United Kingdom politics. The view developedthat the best people to solve the problems of Northern Ireland were the peopleof Northern Ireland themselves. In assessing Northern Ireland&apos;s financial proposals, therefore, the Treasury knew that it would get little thanks in whitehall or Westminster for a zealous approach which led to an open dispute.In those circumstances there was much to be said for the quiet adoption of administrative devices which, within reason, would allow Northern ireland to solve its problems in the way it thought best. Finally, there was the importantpractical consideration that, whatever Northern Ireland proposed, it couldnot cost much in relation to the size of the United Kingdom budget as a whole.A little unorthodox spending in a geographically separated province of one and a half million people would not usually have widespread repercussions in other parts of the United Kingdom. In practice, therefore, the Treasurytended to look at Northern Ireland&apos;s proposals on broad lines, paying due regard to general policy considerations and total expenditure, but withoutthat detailed &quot;value for money&quot; scrutiny that it applied to United kingdon departments.
1304. It must be emphasised, in connexion with Northern Ireland expendi-ture generally, that &quot;parity&quot; with Great Britain was not a cut-and-dried concept.As the Treasury has told us, its working-out in practice depended on a multitudeof individual decisions with give and take on both sides. Conditions in NorthernIreland differed from those in Great Britain, and in some fields differentsolutions were required. It was often not easy to say whether the standard of aparticular service was higher or lower than in Great Britain, and as in all matters of Northern Ireland finance there was a continuing need for flexibility in reaching agreement. It is tempting to conclude that &quot;parity&quot; was simplywhat could be secured by negotiation.Parliamentary control of Northern Ireland&apos;s expenditure1305. Until the suspension of the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1972,control by the Westminster Parliament over Northern Ireland&apos;s expenditure was minimal. Payments to Northern Ireland under the 1920 Act and the varioussupplementary agreements were covered by permanent statutory authority.They were made out of the Consolidated Fund, and the annual approval ofParliament was not required. The only exceptions to this were agriculturalpayments. Remoteness grants were paid by the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food into the Northern Ireland Exchequer under the authority of anOrder laid before Parliament at approximately five-yearly intervals. This order was subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. An account was laid beforeParliament annually of the way in which the money was spent. The much larger sums for agricultural subsidies were paid to Northern Ireland farmers bythe Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, acting as agent of the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In this case there was no payment to theNorthern Ireland Exchequer; but there was a separate item in the estimates ofthe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for payments under theguarantee arrangements to Northern Ireland farmers. It was possible, therefore,for Westminster to debate Northern Ireland&apos;s agricultural expenditure, and thiswas sometimes done; but Parliamentary discussion of other Northern Irelandexpenditure was rare. Because of Northern Ireland&apos;s dependence on UnitedKingdom funds this situation occasionally gave rise to criticism.assessment of home rule finance1306. The defects in the financial arrangements operated under the old system of home rule can be determined only in the light of what those arrange-ments were trying to achieve. The original objectives of putting Northern ireland in a self-financing position and at the same time ensuring an adequate imperial contribution were very quickly frustrated. They were superseded by ad hoctreatment which recognised, without formal constitutional change, that northern Ireland was financially dependent on the rest of the United Kingdom.Yet it seemed to be understood that Northern Ireland was still to be allowedsuch independence in the domestic allocation of resources as was consistent with both the provision of Great Britain standards and the economic unity ofthe United Kingdom.1307. Measured against that later objective, were the financial arrangementsdefective? The short answer is that in some respects they were, but there was more success in them than failure, and if nothing else they are a monument to
British pragmatism. The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governmentsmanaged to modify the arrangements to suit every twist and turn of eventswithout falling out, and while the spirit of the governing statute was con-veniently relegated to obscurity by both sides, its forms continued to bescrupulously observed. It must be remembered that the main aim of the NorthernIreland Government was to preserve the union, so that there was a predispositionto agree rather than disagree; even so, the flexibility and co-operation achievedwere remarkable. Nevertheless, some features of the arrangements were opento criticism.Complexity of the financial arrangements1308. The first and most obvious criticism of the arrangements is that few people understood them. They were complicated and did not offer a firm basis for public discussion. Formal adherence to the financial provisions of the 1920Act and the annual presentation of a separate budget in the Northern ireland parliament conjured up in the minds of the public a picture of an independentcountry deciding its own revenue and expenditure and paying its way as amember of the United Kingdom. Those with responsibility in governmentknew that this picture was a false one, but in attempting to explain the true position they were faced with a presentational difficulty. It might appear thatthey had failed in their efforts to run the country in accordance with the financial provisions of the constitution and were being rescued by Westminster. The fact was of course that in what they conceived to be the best interests of NorthernIreland they were no longer trying to operate the financial provisions of theconstitution. Those provisions stipulated a degree of independence which themajority of people in Northern Ireland never wanted, and which could only have been maintained at great economic sacrifice. New objectives, involvingless independence, had long since superseded the original purposes of theGovernment of Ireland Act. But because the constitution had never been changed, Stormont was still being judged by the old objectives, and was accused of being &quot;subsidised&quot; by the United Kingdom Government.The &quot;subsidy&quot; allegation1309. Much argument centred around this allegation that Northern ireland was &quot;subsidised&quot; by the rest of the United Kingdom. Those who made the allegation were usually concerned either to discredit the Stormont regime the implication being that the Northern Ireland Government was inefficient and could not manage on its allotted income or to substantiate the argument that the people of Northern Ireland stayed in the United Kingdom only becauseof the subsidy they received from the United Kingdom Government.1310. In the sense that the amount contributed by the people of NorthernIreland in taxation was not sufficient to pay for their share of imperial and domestic services, it was obviously true to say that they were &quot;subsidised&quot;. Thisis apparent from what we have already said in paragraph 12951. But the samewas and is true of several other regions of the United Kingdom. The practicaldifference is that in these other regions the figures have not regularly been made1 See also the discussion of &quot; A Northern Ireland Budget&quot; in Appendix 3 of ResearchPaper 10.
available. If they had been, Northern Ireland might have felt more comfortable.It naturally did not want to be stigmatised as the only poor relation when therewere several others in the family.1311. In any event the &quot;subsidy&quot; was nothing to be ashamed of. It was a proper consequence of common citizenship. In any state, some regions are bound to be poorer than others. In modern democratic states it is accepted thatthese poorer regions should share in the greater wealth produced by the moreprosperous regions. In essence, Northern Ireland&apos;s financial position was nodifferent from that of a local authority which receives rate support grant incompensation for its low rateable value and above-average needs. Only to theextent unquantifiable, but certainly very small that the province receivedmore favourable treatment than another region with similar needs can NorthernIreland be said to have been subsidised because it was Northern Ireland or forthe specific purpose of buttressing the regime in force there. Most of the moneyflowed to it simply because it was a relatively poor and disadvantaged part of aprosperous state.The true financial relationship obscured1312. Adherence to the forms laid down in 1920 not only made for complica-tions; it also meant using a working basis which did not reflect the true financialrelationship between Stormont and London. It entailed the maintenance of afagade for which intelligent Ulstermen felt obliged to make excuses. The basisof the arrangements was at best a legal fiction; the annual presentation of theNorthern Ireland budget was regarded by some as a farce. Whilst credit is dueto those concerned for the administrative diplomacy with which they managed to overcome the worst difficulties of the system, the atmosphere of obscurityand unreality could not have made it any easier to tackle Northern Ireland&apos;sdifficult problems.1313. In practice the immediate financial object year by year was to allocateto Northern Ireland, within the United Kingdom system of Public expenditure survey control, sufficient United Kingdom funds to enable Stormont to providethe people of Northern Ireland with Great Britain standards. This process was complicated by a whole series of different operations, all more or less dependenton what was happening in London. Not only did these operations complicate the financial process but, taken in conjunction with the application of theparity doctrine, they also had the effect of inhibiting local choice and initiative.With 85 per cent, of its taxation revenue depending on decisions of the UnitedKingdom Government, Northern Ireland could not plan properly. Not untilbudget day in London could it work out its own revenue from taxation.Moreover, a shift in United Kingdom expenditure policies could quite suddenlyalter the view which Northern Ireland had to take of its own expenditure plans.With Northern Ireland&apos;s share of the reserved taxes and the cost of reservedservices in Northern Ireland to be determined, and all the supplementarypayments to be negotiated, there were many unknowns in the balance. To meet this uncertainty Stormont seems to have worked on the assumption that if itkept as closely as possible to what was being done in Great Britain, the treasury would see it right in the end. If the rules applied in the past did not providethe money needed, new rules could be made.
conclusion1314. Our study of the financial arrangements in Northern Ireland as theydeveloped over the period 1920 to 1972 has given us a valuable insight into the financing of devolution. It has increased our appreciation of what is financiallypossible within the United Kingdom and what is not. Allowance must bemade for the special conditions of Northern Ireland; what is possible there will never exactly coincide with what is possible in other parts of the UnitedKingdom. But looked at purely from a financial point of view, most of these other regions are similar to Northern Ireland in that under a system of devolutionthey would not be able to pay their own way and at the same time enjoy presentstandards. Some kind of financial partnership with the central governmentwould be necessary. Experience in Northern Ireland suggests that in thesecircumstances:(a) the financial arrangements should as far as possible be clear and simple,openly reflecting the true situation;(b) many technical difficulties can be overcome in practice by flexibility and close co-operation at the administrative level;(c) an expenditure basis is preferable to a revenue basis;(d) independent powers of taxation will not necessarily lead to different levels of taxation in practice;(e) there is likely to be pressure for standards of public service comparable to those which obtain in other parts of the United Kingdom;(/) enforced parity with the rest of the United Kingdom, service by service,and direct influence on expenditure plans by the United KingdomGovernment, are inconsistent with the role of an independent legislature;(g) independent legislative powers need not, however, be a barrier to financial co-operation with the central government in the economic interest of the United Kingdom as a whole.These and similar matters have been dealt with more fully in Chapter 15.
THE NEW CONSTITUTIONcomparison with scotland and wales1315. The new Northern Ireland constitution provided by the NorthernIreland Assembly Act 1973 and the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973has much in common with the scheme of legislative devolution, described inPart VIII, which a majority of us advocate for Scotland and Wales (and earliertentative proposals we ourselves devised for the province). Both involve theestablishment of a single-chamber assembly of about 80 to 100 members,elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of four years, with full power to determine policy and to legislate on a prescribed range of matters, the appointment of persons, mainly from among the members of the assembly, to exercise executive power inrelation to the devolved matters and the maintenance of a separate civil service.The two schemes differ, however, in some important respects.1316. In devising our scheme for Scotland and Wales we have drawnextensively on the Northern Ireland experience, and this has led us to suggest anumber of substantial modifications to the old home rule provisions. It doesnot follow that we would necessarily think it right that a scheme for Scotlandand Wales ought in all respects to be identical with one devised for NorthernIreland. Quite apart from the community division, Northern Ireland is to be distinguished from those other parts of the United Kingdom in ways whichhave an important bearing on constitution making. Its smaller size and itsgeographical position affect the scope for devolution. For a long period it had a parliament and Government of its own with extensive powers, and there maybe features of those earlier arrangements which can be retained in NorthernIreland even though it would not now be thought desirable to include them in ascheme of devolution to another part of the United Kingdom.1317. In the paragraphs which follow, we note the main features of the newNorthern Ireland constitution and compare them with the proposals in purscheme of legislative devolution for Scotland and Wales.main features of the new constitution the devolved functions1318. For the purposes of Northern Ireland legislation there will be three categories of matters as follows:(a) transferred matters, on which the Northern Ireland assembly will beable to legislate. They will be prescribed by Order in Council, subject to parliamentary approval, and may be varied from time to time;(b) excepted matters, on which the assembly will not be able to legislate(unless the provision made is merely ancillary to other provisions dealingwith matters which are not excepted, and the consent of the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland has been given). These matters are listed inthe Northern Ireland Constitution Act. They include matters, such asthe Crown, the armed forces, international relations and immigration,which were not transferred to the old Northern Ireland Parliament
because they were central to the sovereignty and constitution of theUnited Kingdom. Some matters which were so transferred, includingthe Northern Ireland taxes, elections and the franchise in respect of boththe assembly and local authorities, special powers for dealing withterrorism and subversion and the appointment of magistrates andjudges, are also excepted;(c) reserved matters, on which the assembly will be able to legislate only with the consent of the Secretary of State. They will be all matters notexcepted and not for the time being transferred. The matters which willas a minimum be reserved initially are listed in the Act. They includematters within the field of law and order (including criminal law, theprevention and detection of crime, prosecutions, the courts, the treatmentof offenders and the establishment and organisation of the police) aswell as many matters, such as civil aviation, wireless telegraphy andpostal services, which were reserved matters under the old constitution.Any reserved matter may later be made the subject of a transfer order.1319. Laws may be made for Northern Ireland by Measures of the assembly,which will have the force of law when approved by Your Majesty in Council.The channel for submission to the Privy Council will be the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State will be required to lay beforeParliament before submission to the Council any Measure dealing, other thanby way of ancillary provision, with excepted or reserved matters, so that parliament may have an opportunity to decide whether or not the Measureshould be allowed to go forward. There are special provisions for dealing withMeasures considered to be urgent. A Measure relating solely to a transferredmatter will be submitted by the Secretary of State directy to the Council.1320. The right of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for NorthernIreland on any matter whatever will remain, but it is intended that, when thescheme is working smoothly, Parliament should in practice legislate for NorthernIreland on transferred matters without the agreement of the Northern IrelandExecutive only in rare and exceptional circumstances.1321. These provisions for Northern Ireland differ from those in our schemeof legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales both in the method of prescribingthe devolved functions and in the extent of those functions.1322. In our scheme the matters to be transferred to the assembly would be specifically listed in the statute creating it, and the assembly could not begiven legislative powers in relation to matters not so prescribed withoutamending legislation.1323. By contrast, the Northern Ireland scheme introduces an element of flexibility in the legislative powers of the assembly by providing for the listof transferred matters to be varied by Order in Council and by permittingthe assembly with the Secretary of State&apos;s consent to legislate on a reservedmatter or, in respect of ancillary provisions, an excepted matter. When royal assent has been given to an assembly Measure, it will have the force of a united Kingdom statute; the courts will be able to interpret it, but will haveno power to consider whether it is ultra vires, save in the special case of aMeasure alleged to be of a discriminatory character. It has seemed to us that
it would be right, in the context of Scotland and Wales, to define the legislativecompetence of the assemblies with as much precision as possible, leaving any changes to be made by the ordinary statutory processes. We have suggested,however, that it should be placed beyond doubt that the United kingdom authorities would have, for use in exceptional circumstances, power to vetoan assembly Measure considered to be objectionable on policy grounds aswell as on grounds of validity, and that this power should be exercised by theappropriate United Kingdom Minister determining, with the approval ofParliament, not to submit the measure for the Royal Assent.1324. As we draw a firm fine between transferred and other matters we haveno category comparable to the category of reserved matters in the NorthernIreland scheme. Apart from the matters relating to the maintenance of lawand order, most of those listed in the Act as reserved matters would not in ourscheme be devolved. We place all public order matters in the category oftransferred matters for Scotland, which has a separate system of law, but not for Wales, which has not.1325. Outside the law and order field the matters proposed for transferunder our scheme differ from those which are neither excepted nor reservedunder the Northern Ireland scheme principally in omitting matters relating totrade and industry, social security, and price support measures and othergrants and subsidies for agriculture and fisheries. Whereas it is possible for northern Ireland, because of its small size and detached position, to exercisefunctions in trade and industry, the transfer of legislative powers in this fieldto assemblies in Scotland and Wales with the degree of independence we proposewould not in our view be practicable. We have omitted social security and assistance to agriculture and fisheries from our list of transferred matters onthe ground that, as was recognised in the White paper presenting the UnitedKingdom Governmenfs proposals for Northern Ireland, any regional differences in these services must be such as are consistent with basic United Kingdompolicies.        ;1326. Another significant difference between the Northern Ireland schemeand our own concerns responsibility for elections and the franchise. we propose the transfer to a Scottish or Welsh assembly of matters relating toelections to local authorities as part of the general transfer of responsibility for local government, but not matters relating to elections to the assembly itself.In the different circumstances of Northern Ireland all matters concerningelections, to the local authorities as well as to the assembly, will be exceptedmatters.Restrictions on the exercise of devolved powers1327. In Northern Ireland the exercise of the devolved legislative and executive powers will be subject to compliance with certain statutory provisionsdesigned for the protection of the individual. They include the arrangementsfor the investigation of complaints of maladministration by the NorthernIreland Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and by the Com-missioner for Complaints under enactments of the old Northern ireland parliament, and provisions in new Westminster legislation applying to Northern1 Northern Ireland Constitutional Proposals (Cmnd. 5259).
Ireland. Among those provisions are prohibitions on discrimination on grounds of religious or political belief in the exercise of legislative and executive powersand, with certain exceptions, on the administration of oaths or declarations as acondition of public employment. A Standing Advisory Commission on human rights appointed by the Secretary of State will advise on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law, and the practice of certain persons and bodies, in preventing discrimination.1328. The requirement in Northern Ireland for provisions against discrimina-tion arises out of the existence of a community problem which is peculiar to theprovince. Our scheme for Scotland and Wales places no comparable restrictionson the exercise by the assemblies of their devolved powers. In Chapter 17 wegive our reasons for thinking that there would be no need to include in the westminster legislation establishing the assemblies statutory provisions designedto secure the preservation of basic human rights of a kind which in someoverseas countries are enshrined in Bills of Rights. Within the scope of theirdevolved powers it would be for the assemblies themselves to enact such provisions as they considered desirable for the protection of the individual and for the investigation of complaints and the redress of grievances. If therewere to be any infringement of or failure to protect essential human rightsthrough actions of the assemblies, Parliament could use its paramount powersto provide the remedy.Financial arrangements1329. We have seen that one of the main reasons for the difference betweenthe theory and practice of home rule in Northern Ireland was that the financial arrangements provided in the 1920 Act very soon proved to be unworkable.The new arrangements will be much simpler. There will be no imperial contribution and no Joint Exchequer Board. The Northern Ireland assembly&apos;spowers over taxation will probably be confined in practice to the levyingof rates and some licence fees. The revenue required to meet the cost of the devolved services will be derived from those local taxes, from the shareattributable to Northern Ireland of taxes levied centrally and from grants-in-aidmade by the Secretary of State. There will be an annual assessment of theassembly&apos;s needs, based on the broad objectives of accomplishing as rapidly aspossible the task of physical reconstruction and rehabilitation, of creating a sound base for the economy and the encouragement of external industrial investment, and of working progressively towards the achievement of the standards of living, employment and social conditions which prevail in GreatBritain.1330. The White Paper states that when the new institutions of governmentin Northern Ireland have been formed, the United Kingdom Governmentwill discuss with them how the financial arrangements should be operated in detail so as to enable Northern Ireland to enjoy a large measure of freedom in the choice of priorities and policies in advancing towards the agreed objec-tives. It is intended that expenditure should be divided into two categories. Inthe first, local freedom of decision will be limited. The services concerned will bethe cash social services and assistance to industry and employment and to agriculture and fisheries. It is because of the inevitable restriction on localfreedom in these services that in our scheme of legislative devolution to Scotland
and Wales we have proposed that they should not be included in the matters to be devolved. In the second category, which will by and large embrace the range of services which we have proposed for devolution to Scottish and Welshassemblies, a high degree of freedom and discretion is proposed. The precisemanner in which Northern Ireland&apos;s annual total of expenditure on those services is to be calculated, and the degree of control which is to be exercised by the Secretary of State over its allocation to individual services, have still to be worked out. The proposals so far made do not contain provisions,including those for a block grant giving an assured income over a periodof years and for an independent assessment of needs by an outside body,of a kind which we have built into our scheme for Scotland and Wales with theintention of enhancing the independence of the assemblies.The institutions of devolved government1331. The Northern Ireland assembly will be left to work out its owndetailed methods and procedures, subject to minimum statutory provisions.These will include a requirement to establish consultative committees of theassembly, with a membership reflecting so far as is possible the balance of parties in the assembly, to advise and assist the head of each of the NorthernIreland departments in the formulation of policy.1332. The office of Governor of Northern Ireland has been abolished.Executive powers of the kind formerly exercised by the Governor will in future be exercised by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Secretaryof State will appoint, generally from among the members of the assembly,persons to be heads of the Northern Ireland government departments, who willtogether constitute the Northern Ireland Executive. Among those so appointedwill be the chief executive member, who will be the political head of the centralsecretariat and will both lead the assembly and preside over the executive. Inmaking these appointments the Secretary of State must be satisfied that theexecutive is likely to be widely accepted throughout the community.1333. The head of each department will be the chairman of the appropriateconsultative committee of the assembly, and there will be provision for effec-tive consultation by him with the committee on new policy proposals and onlegislative proposals before they are laid before the assembly. The committeewill have power to call for information from the department, but will not have access to papers of the department. It will not be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the department. Executive power will rest with the head of department. The system of government will therefore be more like the Mini-sterial system we have proposed in our scheme of legislative devolution thanthe committee system proposed in our scheme of executive devolution.1334. In our scheme for Scotland and Wales legislative powers would be conferred on a legislature consisting of Your Majesty and the assembly. Thiswould have the consequence that assembly Bills would need to secure theRoyal Assent before being given the force of law. Northern Ireland assemblyMeasures will require the approval of Your Majesty in Council. In practice theremay be no great difference between these two arrangements. The one we propose,combined with the appointment of members of the executive by the Crown,serves to emphasise regional autonomy in the devolved matters. The Northern
Ireland arrangement, combined with the appointment of members of theexecutive by the Secretary of State, gives greater emphasis to the subordinatestatus of the provincial government. In the circumstances of Scotland and Wales,where the smooth working of the ordinary processes of Parliamentary govern-ment would not be prevented as they have been in Northern Ireland by com-munity division, we have seen no need either for United Kingdom government control over the appointment of the executive or for the imposition on theassembly of a particular committee structure designed to give members ofminority parties greater opportunity to participate in government.Representation in the United Kingdom Government1335. There will continue to be a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.His main functions will be to seek an acceptable basis for the devolution ofpowers, to exercise direct Ministerial responsibility in relation to certain reservedand excepted services and to represent Northern Ireland&apos;s interests in the UnitedKingdom Government, both generally and in relation to the allocation offinancial resources.1336. In our scheme of legislative devolution the offices of Secretary ofState for Scotland and Wales would disappear. The few functions of these offices which would remain to be exercised at the centre would not suffice tojustify the retention of the separate offices.Representation at Westminster1337. Northern Ireland&apos;s representation in the United Kingdom Houseof Commons is not to be changed. The province will continue to be represented by fewer members than it would be entitled to on a population basis.1338. We saw in Chapter 17 that there is no fully satisfactory solution to theproblem of the representation in the House of Commons of a part of theUnited Kingdom to which legislative powers have been devolved. Those of uswho favour legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales have proposed that,in the event of its implementation, the level of representation for all parts ofGreat Britain should be determined by the same rules, with representation beingrelated mainly to population, but taking into account also geographical con-siderations. We recommend and this is our only recommendation for northern Ireland that the same rules should be applied there also. The effectof this would be to increase Northern Ireland&apos;s representation at Westminsterfrom twelve to seventeen or thereabouts.conclusions1339. We have given our reasons for thinking that it would have beenneither appropriate nor practicable for us to make recommendations for a newconstitution for Northern Ireland. A constitution devised for another part ofthe United Kingdom is unlikely to be suitable for application to the province,and a constitution tailored to meet its special needs could be expected torequire very considerable modification before it could be applied to any otherregion. Indeed, although some of us believe uniformity of political institutionsto be generally desirable, we are agreed that the fact that Northern ireland is now being given a new constitution involving the devolution of legislative
powers is not itself an argument for applying this particular form of devolution to the regions of Great Britain. And even if it is accepted that Scotland and ,Wales should have legislative devolution, this does not mean that the schemeof devolution should be the same as that being applied in very different circumstances to Northern Ireland.1340. Nevertheless, the two schemes need not be radically different in all respects. We have drawn from our study of the working of the provisionsof the 1920 Act in Northern Ireland many conclusions which are equallyapplicable to the province and to other parts of the United Kingdom. It is not surprising, therefore, that the United Kingdom Governments scheme for northern Ireland and our own scheme of legislative devolution for Scotlandand Wales, although devised quite independently, have much in common.If legislative devolution is to be applied to Scotland and Wales as well as to northern Ireland it will clearly be desirable to confine the differences to thosenecessary to meet the differing requirements and to ensure that the schemes are not in other respects inconsistent or incompatible.1341. We have pointed to the main differences between the Northern Irelandscheme and our own scheme of legislative devolution. They relate to the methodof prescribing and the extent of the devolved matters, the restrictions on theexercise of the devolved powers, the financial arrangements, the responsibilities of United Kingdom Ministers, the method of appointment of the executive,relations between the assembly and the executive and representation at westminster. It appears to us that, with one exception, they arise out of thevery different circumstances in which the schemes are intended to be applied,and that there is no inconsistency or incompatibility; while it is possible thatsome adjustments to bring the two schemes more nearly into line could usefully be made, they would be bound to differ in several important respects. Theexception relates to representation at Westminster; we recommend that northern Ireland&apos;s representation should be determined by the rules appliedto other parts of the United Kingdom.
PART XITHE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND the isle OF MAN
THE BACKGROUND TO OUR ENQUDTY1342. We were required by the last part of our terms of reference to considerwhether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relation-ships between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan. The existing relationships had at the time of our appointment been giving rise to difficulties, particularly over the application to the Islands ofinternational treaties, and suggestions for change had been made.1343. We received evidence from the authorities in the Islands and fromorganisations and individuals who responded to an open invitation we issuedthrough the local press. We visited each of the Islands Jersey, Guernsey,Alderney, Sark and the Isle of Man and took oral evidence in public therefrom official representatives and from other witnesses. These hearings, andthe many informal discussions we had in the Islands, contributed greatly toour understanding of their problems. We received the fullest co-operation and assistance from the authorities and we should like to express our gratitude to them.1344. The Home Office, which is the United Kingdom department mainly responsible for relations with the Islands, put forward no proposals of its ownfor any formal change in constitutional and economic relationships. Togetherwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, it submitted a memorandum ofevidence, which is being published along with other evidence, commenting onthe proposals made by other witnesses and suggesting a modified procedure for consultation with the Islands on the application to them of international agreements. We were also much assisted by informal discussions with officials of the two departments. We should perhaps explain why we did not take evidence from them in public. As we have already noted, the principal andmost difficult issue before us related to the application to the Islands ofinternational treaties. At the time we were taking evidence, negotiations forthe United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the European Economic Community were taking place and were causing much concern in the Islands. The departments were able to speak more freely on this and other international matters in private discussion with us than would have been possible at a public hearing,and we have no doubt that the best interests of the Islands were served by ourproceeding in this way.how the islands are governedGeneral1345. The memoranda of evidence submitted by the authorities in the islands contain information about their constitutional history, the present arrangements for their government and their relationships with the UnitedKingdom. We note here those features which relate most closely to our task.Having regard to our terms of reference we have not been concerned with theinternal arrangements for the government of the Islands or with relationsbetween the Islands, except to the extent that this has been necessary for an understanding of their constitutional and economic relationships with theUnited Kingdom.

The memoranda of evidence submitted by the authorities in the islands contain information about their constitutional history, the present arrangements for their government and their relationships with the UnitedKingdom. We note here those features which relate most closely to our task.Having regard to our terms of reference we have not been concerned with theinternal arrangements for the government of the Islands or with relationsbetween the Islands, except to the extent that this has been necessary for an understanding of their constitutional and economic relationships with theUnited Kingdom.
1346. The relationships which the Channel Islands on the one hand and the isle of Man on the other have with the United Kingdom, and the problems which arise from those relationships, are similar, though the historical back-grounds are very different. It is convenient to consider all the Islands togetherso far as their situations are comparable. Where there are significant differenceswe note them as we go along.1347. The Islands are dependencies of the Crown; they are neither part ofthe United Kingdom nor colonies. They differ from other overseas dependenciesin their proximity to Great Britain and in the antiquity of their connexionwith the Crown. Their special position is acknowledged by a provision in theBritish Nationality Act 1948 permitting a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies, if on the ground of his connexion with the Channel Islands or the isle of Man he so desires, to be known as a citizen of the United Kingdom,Islands and Colonies.1348. The Islands have their own legislative assemblies, systems of local administration, fiscal and legal systems and courts of law. Appointments tosome of the chief posts in the local administrations rest with the Crown; and,with some minor exceptions, legislative measures passed by the insular assem-blies depend for their validity on Orders made by Your Majesty in Council.Subject to these prerogative powers the Islands have general responsibilityfor the regulation of their own affairs. Most of the laws by which they aregoverned emanate from their representative assemblies, and most of theirpublic services are administered by committees of those assemblies.The Channel Islands1349. The Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy before theNorman Conquest, but remained in allegiance to the King of England whencontinental Normandy was lost in the year 1204. According to the evidence ofthe States of Guernsey, when later the ducal title was surrendered &quot;the King ofEngland continued to rule the Islands as though he were Duke of Normandy,observing their laws and customs and liberties; and these were later confirmed by the charters of successive sovereigns which secured for them their ownjudiciaries and freedom from process of English courts and other importantprivileges of which the Islands are justly proud and which have always beenrespected. Although expressed in somewhat different terms in different ages,this has remained the essence of the relationship between the Islands and theCrown to the present day. After the separation of the Islands from Normandyand its administration the local institutions were gradually moulded from timeto time very largely on local initiative to meet changing circumstances until their present constitutions evolved. The evolution, however, did not at anytime involve amalgamation with, or subjection to, the government of theUnited Kingdom and even today the Islands&apos; link with the United Kingdomand the remainder of the Commonwealth is through the Sovereign as latter-daysuccessor of the Dukes of Normandy&quot;.1350. The Channel Islands consist of two separate Bailiwicks, the Bailiwickof Jersey, which is the largest Island, with a population of about 70,000 and theBailiwick of Guernsey, which comprises the Islands of Guernsey (with Hermand Jethou), Alderney and Sark, with a total population of about 52,000.There are no formal links between the two Bailiwicks.
1351. In each Bailiwick the Lieutenant Governor is Your Majesty&apos;s personal representative and the official channel of communication between the crown and the United Kingdom Government and the insular authorities. The mostimportant of the other offices held under the Crown are those of Bailiff and deputy Bailiff, who share the duties of presiding over the legislative assembly(the States) and the Royal Court, and Attorney General and Solicitor General(known in Guernsey as Procureur and Comptroller), who are the legal advisersboth of the Crown and of the States.1352. The States of Jersey have fifty-two elected members and five non-elected members. The elected members are twelve Senators, who are elected bythe electorate of the whole Island for a period of six years, six of them retiringevery third year; twelve Constables, who are members by virtue of beingheads of their parish assemblies, to which office they are elected by the parishelectors for a period of three years; and twenty-eight Deputies, elected on a constituency basis for three years. The non-elected members are the Bailiff(or Deputy Bailiff), the Lieutenant Governor, the Dean of Jersey, the attorney general and the Solicitor General; they all have a right to speak but not to vote, except that the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff as President has a casting vote.1353. The States of Guernsey include, in addition to the Bailiff or DeputyBailiff, twelve Conseillers elected by an electoral college known as the States of election for a term of six years, six of them retiring every third year, thirty-threePeople&apos;s Deputies elected in ten electoral districts which correspond to the tenparishes, ten Douzaine Representatives elected annually by the Douzaines(or Councils) of the parishes and two representatives of the people of Aldemeyappointed by the States of Alderney. The Attorney General and the solicitor general are also members of the States, with a right to speak but not to vote.1354. In both Islands it has long been the practice of the States to delegateadministration to committees of members of the States or to charge such committees with specific functions. Most of the Islands&apos; public services are accordingly provided and administered by these committees of the States, in which the same way as local government services in the United Kingdom are provided and administered by committees of the local authorities. The chairmen of the committees constitute the nearest thing there is to a government, though they have no collective responsibility.1355. Alderney and Sark both have a large measure of independence withinthe Bailiwick of Guernsey see paragraphs 1448 to 1454 below and legislativeassemblies of their own, the States of Alderney and the Chief Pleas of Sark.Through the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey each has an independentrelationship with the United Kingdom.The Isle of Man1356. The Isle of Man has a population of about 56,000. It first came underthe English Crown in the fourteenth century following periods under thesuzerainty of the Kings of Norway and Scotland. In 1405 the Island, with its&quot;regalities&quot;, was granted to Sir John Stanley and his heirs. From then up to1765 it was ruled by the Earls of Derby, and later the Dukes of Atholl, as
Kings or Lords of Man. By Acts of Parliament passed in that year and in 1825,the rights of the Lords of Man were revested in the Crown, and for a time the island was very largely governed from London.1357. The modern constitutional relationship dates from 1866, when an act of Parliament was passed separating Manx revenues from those of theUnited Kingdom and giving the Island a limited measure of control overinsular expenditure. Since then a series of measures, culminating in the Isle ofMan Act 1958, has transferred control more and more into local hands.1358. The Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, in addition to beingYour Majesty&apos;s personal representative and the channel of communication between the Crown and the Island Government, is the head of the executive,with ultimate control over the Island&apos;s finances and over services such as thepolice. Other offices held under the Crown include those of Deemster (Judge)and Attorney General; the latter, like the Law Officers in the Channel Islands,is the legal adviser of both the Crown and the Island authorities.1359. The Court of Tynwald, which has both legislative and executive functions, comprises the Lieutenant Governor, the Legislative Council and theHouse of Keys. The Legislative Council consists of the Bishop of Sodor andMan, the First Deemster and the Attorney General (who has no vote) and seven members elected by the House of Keys; it is presided over by the LieutenantGovernor. The House of Keys has twenty-four members elected on a constituency basis for a period of five years; it elects its own Speaker. In theexercise of his executive functions the Lieutenant Governor is advised by an executive Council, a standing body of members of Tynwald, most of whom arechairmen of the boards of Tynwald responsible for administering the variouspublic services in much the same way as in the Channel Islands public services are administered by committees of the States.relationships with the united kingdomExisting constitutional relationships1360. The constitutional position of the Islands is thus unique. In some respects they are like miniature states with wide powers of self-government,while their method of functioning through committees is much more akinto that of United Kingdom local authorities.1361. The main features of the existing constitutional relationships betweenthe United Kingdom and the Islands, as set out in the evidence of the. HomeOffice and the authorities in the Islands, are as follows. The Crown has ultimate responsibility for the good government of the Islands. The Crown acts throughthe Privy Council on the recommendations of Ministers of Your Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom in their capacity as Privy Counsellors.It is the practice at the beginning of each reign to appoint Committees of the privy Council to entertain petitions from the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan respectively. The Council&apos;s main business in connection with the Islandsis to deal with legislative measures submitted for ratification by Order inCouncil. The Home Secretary is the member of the Council primarily concernedwith the affairs of the Islands and is the channel of communication between
them and the Crown and the United Kingdom Government. He has the duty to see that the Islands&apos; legislative measures are scrutinised and that there isconsultation with any other Ministers who may be concerned, including, ifnecessary, the Law Officers of the Crown, before the measures receive theRoyal Assent.1362. The Islands are not represented in Parliament. Acts of Parliament donot extend to them automatically, but only if they expressly apply to the islands or to all your Majesty&apos;s dominions or do so by necessary implication.When it is intended that an Act of Parliament shall apply to the Islands themethod that has become usual is not to apply the Act directly but to include init a section providing for its extension to the Islands by subsequent Order inCouncil, with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations, if any, as maybe specified in the Order. This procedure permits changes to be made to meetthe special needs of the Islands and to ensure that the provisions of the Actare applied in a manner consonant with the insular administrative systems and with the methods of dealing with offences in the insular courts. By con-vention Parliament does not legislate for the Islands without their consent in matters of taxation or other matters of purely domestic concern. The evidenceof the authorities in the Islands gives examples of the matters in which Parlia-ment does legislate for the Islands; they are described in the Tynwald evidence as matters which &quot;transcend the frontiers of the Island&quot;.1363. In international law the United Kingdom Government is responsiblefor the Islands&apos; international relations. It is the practice for the insular authoritiesto be consulted before an international agreement is reached which would apply to them. This is particularly necessary in any case in which applicationof the agreement to the Islands would require legislation of a kind which wouldordinarily be enacted in the Island legislatures. The United Kingdom Govern-ment is also responsible for the defence of the Islands.Existing economic relationships1364. Each Bailiwick of the Channel Islands is administered as a separatecustoms area levying its own customs and excise duties. Customs duty is notordinarily charged on goods flowing in either direction which have been grown,produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom or the Islands. The customsexamination to which the traveller from the Islands is subjected on arrival in England is concerned with articles which may have attracted lower customsor excise duty in the Islands than would be payable in the United Kingdom.The Isle of Man, on the other hand, though entitled to levy its own customsduties, is by agreement treated as part of the customs area of the UnitedKingdom, and the customs of the Island are administered by Your Majesty&apos;sCommissioners of Customs and Excise, the receipts going into a commonpurse. Net customs revenue is shared between the United Kingdom and the isle of Man in proportion to population, the population of the Island for thispurpose being taken to include a variable &quot;fiscal equivalent&quot; in respect oftourists.1365. Under another agreement, the Isle of Man makes an annual contribu-tion to the United Kingdom for defence and common services, including suchmatters as overseas representation, of an amount decided by Tynwald after
consultation with the United Kingdom Government. In recent years this contri-bution has been of the order of  250,000*. The Channel Islands make no contribution.1366. In other respects the Islands are entirely self-financing (except thatthe breakwater in Alderney, built by the Admiralty in 1864 as part of a navalharbour that was never completed and enclosing the only harbour on the Island,is maintained by the United Kingdom at a cost to the Exchequer of approximately-tely  59,000 a year). They neither receive grants from nor pay contributions tothe United Kingdom, nor do their inhabitants pay United Kingdom taxes.They pay for their needs out of their own revenues, the rates of which aredecided by the Island assemblies; and in general they pay for or reciprocatebenefits in education and other social services received from the United Kingdom.1367. The Islands are all taxed at a much lower level than the United Kingdom.The standard rates of income tax, for example, are little more than half theUnited Kingdom rate, and there is no surtax or capital gains tax and no estateduty. The approximate per capita revenue for 1972 was  312 in Jersey,  183 inGuernsey,  201 in Alderney and  52 in Sark. Per capita revenue in the isle of Man for the financial year 1972/73 was  213. By way of general comparison,current receipts of the United Kingdom central government in the year 1972amounted to  357 per capita. Public expenditure in the Islands is of course at a correspondingly lower level than in the United Kingdom.1368. In recent years the Islands have gained a reputation as tax havens.United Kingdom residents have moved there with their assets, or withoutmigrating have set up companies there to own their assets, or have resorted toother devices to reduce their tax liability. In addition, financial institutionshave taken advantage of the lower taxation to establish so-called off-shorefunds, whose clients include both residents and non-residents of the UnitedKingdom.1369. For exchange control purposes the Islands are subject to the sameregulations as the United Kingdom.Areas of doubt in existing relationships1370. This statement, in very broad terms, conceals a number of blurrededges ,to the constitutional relationships between the United Kingdom andthe Islands. These were brought out in the memoranda of evidence. That ofthe Home Office indicated that the department accepted as correct the state-ments of the existing relationships included in the evidence of the States ofGuernsey and Tynwald. The evidence of Tynwald, however, indicated thatcertain matters were the subject of some doubt. The doubts related to theextent to which the exercise by the Crown of its power of control over legislation and executive authority in the Island, and by Parliament of its power to legislate for the Island, was restricted by constitutional convention.1371. The Home Office was unable to concur fully in the statement of theexisting constitutional relationship in the evidence of the States of Jersey,and attached to its evidence a statement which in 1968 had been agreed with1 This represents about  4-50 per head of the population. For defence and overseas representation the comparable figure for the United Kingdom is  57.
the insular authorities. The States&apos; evidence departed from this earlier documentin its references both to the prerogative power of the Crown to alter thelaw of Jersey (presumed to have been derived from the supreme legislative powers possessed originally by the Dukes of Normandy) and to Parliamentarysovereignty. On the first point the earlier document had stated that, following the development of the English constitution, legislation by prerogative Orderin Council had been almost entirely superseded by the application or extension to Jersey of Acts of Parliament; the evidence presented to us went further instating that the power, other than by way of assenting by Orders in Councilto Acts of the States, had long fallen into disuse and appeared to have beensuper-superseded. As regards Parliamentary sovereignty, whereas the earlier documentacknowledged that the right of Parliament to legislate for Jersey extendedas a matter of strict law to every field of legislation, though that right was limited byconstitutional usage in respect of taxation and other domestic matters, theevidence asserted that it would be unconstitutional for Parliament, otherwise than with the concurrence of the States, to legislate for the Island on suchmatters.1372. The Home Office stated that in general the principles of the relation-ship between Jersey and the United Kingdom were for historical and other reasons similar to those of the relationship between Guernsey and the UnitedKingdom, and that they were as described in the evidence submitted by theStates of Guernsey. On the use of prerogative Orders in Council to legislate for the Island, the States of Guernsey stated only that the last instance of suchan Order was the Court of Appeal (Channel Islands) Order 1949, which was based on a scheme which had the prior approval of the States. On the powersof Parliament, they said that by constitutional convention Parliament did notlegislate for Guernsey in matters of taxation and other matters which had long been accepted as the responsibility and concern of the insular authorities, andif that were not so the whole basis of independent government of the Islands,which had been built up over the centuries, would be destroyed. They drew attention also to an assurance given in 1968 by the Minister of State at the HomeOffice that the United Kingdom Government had no intention of seekingany alteration in the existing constitutional relationship or in that convention;though they added that the Ministers statement must be read in conjunctionwith what was said later on in their memorandum of evidence on the subjectof international agreements.The need for review1373. The differences of opinion which existed between the United Kingdomand the Islands related not so much to anything that had happened in the past though there had been difficulties in the Isle of Man, to which we refer later as to whether there were restrictions on what the Crown or Parliament might do in circumstances that might arise in the future. The main reason for appre-hension, and therefore the main need for a review of the constitutional relation-ships, arose out of two recent developments in the international field.1374. The first is that in this field the division between matters that are purelydomestic and those that are not, which was once fairly clear, is no longer so.There is an increasing tendency for international agreements to deal with matters hitherto regarded as purely domestic and requiring domestic legislation
for their implementation. The second development is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure the inclusion in international agreements ofoptional territorial application clauses; a party to a treaty without such a clause must sign on behalf of all the territories for whose international relationsit is responsible. This means that if the United Kingdom Government is a partyto such a treaty requiring for its implementation legislation on a &quot;domestic&quot;matter with which one of the Islands is not in agreement, then one of threethings has to happen. Either the Island must pass legislation which it does not want and may consider not to be in its interests; or Parliament must legislate for the Island in breach of the convention that it does not legislate for the islands on matters of domestic concern; or the United Kingdom Governmentwill be in breach of its international undertaking.1375. The response of the Islands to these developments varies. Representativesof the States of Jersey told us that difficulties arose solely out of this question ofinternational agreements; and, except in relation to Crown appointments, theproposals for change in the constitutional relations which they put forwardwere directed to overcoming those difficulties.1376. The proposals submitted by Tynwald were also directed primarily to this problem; but Tynwald wished also to see a clearer division between the domestic matters on which it legislated and the wider matters on which parliament legislated for the Isle of Man, since difficulties had arisen even inthe absence of complications caused by the existence of international agreements.Tynwald described as its general objective the promotion and continuation ofthe evolution of the constitutional relationship between the Isle of Man and theUnited Kingdom towards more complete self-government, in accordance withthe declared and accepted policy of the United Kingdom for the self-determina-tion of the peoples of dependent territories. It saw this objective as includingnot only the right and the principle of self-determination but also, in their application, assured autonomy in respect of the Island&apos;s internal affairs.1377. Aspects of the constitutional relationship between the Isle of Man andthe United Kingdom Governments were considered by a Joint Working party of Home Office and Isle of Man representatives set up in 1967. The working party reported in 19691. Some of the recommendations made were acceptedby the two Governments and it was agreed that others should be the subject offurther consultation. Many references to this body, of which Lord Stonham,then Minister of State, Home Office, was Chairman, were made in the evidence we received. We refer to it in this Report as the Stonham Working Party.1378. The States of Guernsey made no proposals for change. They recognised the difficulties that had arisen, and that might well arise in more acute form infuture, over the application of international agreements to Guernsey; but they believed that the difficulties could as well be dealt with under the existingconstitutional relationship as under any new relationship which might beestablished. The Chief Pleas of Sark took the same line. The States of Alderney,however, were not in agreement with them, thinking that some constitutional change was needed to safeguard Alderney&apos;s position in relation to international agreements.1 Report of the Joint Working Party on the Constitutional Relationship between the isle of Man and the United Kingdom. H.M.S.O. 1969.
1379. We found that there was no dispute between the United Kingdomand Island Governments on the main objective, which was the preservation ofthe Islands&apos; present degree of autonomy. The Home Office and the Foreign and commonwealth Office said that they were aware of the gravity of the real and continuing problems presented to the Islands by developments in the inter-national field and were anxious to find means of resolving them. In their view,however, the existing constitutional relationships were capable of surmountingeven the most considerable obstacles, and modifications to those relationshipscould have the effect of making them less advantageous, in the long term,to the Islands.
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE1380. We described in our last chapter how the Islands are governed and what their relationships are with the United Kingdom, and we indicated briefly the nature of the difficulties which had arisen or which were apprehended at thetime of our appointment. In this chapter we summarise the evidence we received. This can conveniently be grouped under a number of headings.First comes evidence relating to the application to the Islands of international agreements. Next, as a consequence of the problems arising under this head,come suggestions for clarifying the respective responsibilities of the UnitedKingdom and Island authorities, particularly in the field of legislation. This isfollowed by the related matter of the machinery for the resolution of differencesand disputes. Then comes a quite separate group of proposals concerning theappointment of Crown Officers. Some account is given of the special problemsof Alderney and Sark. Finally, we refer to some miscellaneous proposals on other matters.INTERNATIONAL agreements the 1950 declaration13,81. In international law, as we have already noted, the United KingdomGovernment is responsible for the external relations of the Islands. For thepurposes of international agreements the Islands were regarded up to 1950 aspart of the metropolitan territory of the United Kingdom. It was then recognisedthat this was inconsistent with their constitutional position, and all foreign government and international organisations were informed that in futureany treaty or international agreement to which the United Kingdom Governmentbecame a party would not be considered as applying to the Islands by reasononly of the fact that it applied to the United Kingdom, and that any signature,ratification, acceptance or accession on behalf of the United Kingdom wouldnot extend to the Islands unless they were expressly included. The Islands would,unless the contrary were expressly stated in each case, be included among the territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom Governmentwas responsible. The Islands were told by the Home Office that the objects ofthis declaration were to secure that they would not be bound by treaties onwhich they had not been consulted or which, when they were consulted, theydid not wish to have applied to the Islands; that adequate time for consultationwould be available; and that the inability or reluctance of any of the Islandsto adhere to a particular agreement would not prevent the participation of theUnited Kingdom Government.1382. In 1966, when difficulties had arisen over the application to the islands of certain types of international agreement, the Home Office sent a letter toGuernsey in which it was maintained that the effect of the 1950 declaration was as follows. It did not change, and could not have changed, the rule ofinternational law under which the signature, ratification or accession of any state to an international agreement was presumed to be in respect not only ofthe state itself, but of all the territories for whose international relations it was responsible, unless this presumption was displaced by the wording of theagreement itself or by necessary implication. Such a presumption would be
displaced, for example, by the inclusion of an article enabling contractingparties to apply the agreement to dependent territories, which would show thatin the absence of such application the initial acceptance was confined to themetropolitan territory of contracting parties. In the absence of any express orimplied limitation of territorial extent, however, a state&apos;s acceptance of obligations in an agreement would be held to include acceptance on behalfof all its dependent territories. The position then was that the United Kingdom&apos;acceptance of agreements containing no indication of limited territorial applica-tion bound all its dependent territories, including the Channel Islands andIsle of Man. The Home Office letter stated that, before concluding such agree-ments, the United Kingdom Government would always endeavour to discussthe implications as fully as possible with the insular authorities.1383. The protection given to the Islands by the 1950 declaration was therefore not nearly so complete as its wording, and the Home Office statement of itsobjects, implied. Whereas the declaration appeared to reserve the position ofthe Islands in relation to all treaties to which the United Kingdom became a party, and it was not unreasonably so understood in the Islands, the letter of1966 gave it a more restricted interpretation. In their discussions with us theHome Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office acknowledged that agood deal of misunderstanding would have been avoided if the subject had been dealt with at greater length in 1950 and if, in particular, it had been explained to the Islands in terms what would be the position in relation to treaties that were silent on the subject of territorial application. But such treaties were ararity in those days. It was customary for most treaties to contain either anexpress provision that they applied to the United Kingdom alone, or a clausepermitting the United Kingdom by declaration to extend their provisions toterritories for whose international relations it was responsible. But between1950 and 1966 international practice changed. It became increasingly difficult for United Kingdom negotiators, when seeking to draft the text of generalmultilateral conventions, particularly those concluded under the auspices ofthe united Nations or its specialised agencies, to secure the insertion of anoptional territorial application clause. This led to an increase in the numberof general multilateral conventions that were either silent in respect of territorialapplication or, less frequently, contained a clause applying the treaty, withoutany option, to territories for whose international relations the contracting parties were responsible.Sources of difficulty1384. The departments, in their evidence to us, said that, of the vast corpusof treaties to which the United Kingdom was a party, only a small minoritypresented problems for the Islands. There could be excluded from consideration,for example, all those treaties that contained clauses providing for optionalextension to non-metropolitan territories. Such clauses could almost always be included in bilateral treaties between the United Kingdom and one foreign country, where the text was a matter for the two governments only. As formultilateral treaties it was still customary for such clauses to be included intreaties concluded within the framework of such European regional organisationsas the Council of Europe; and it remained possible to secure the insertion ofsuch clauses in multilateral treaties within the framework of certain other organisations of a technical nature such as the Hague Conference.on Private
International Law. The category of treaty that was of major concern to the islands comprised general multilateral treaties, particularly those dealing withhumanitarian matters, which were negotiated within, or under the auspices of,the United Nations or its specialised agencies. Even within that limited category,there was only a proportion of such treaties that required for their implement a-tion new or amending legislation in the Islands and therefore presented serious difficulties of application. Difficulties arose where such a treaty contained nooptional territorial application clause (because the United Kingdom delgation had been unable to secure the insertion of such a clause at the negotiatingstage) but nevertheless required domestic legislation for its implementation.1385. The departments said that the making of a unilateral reservation to exclude the Islands would also not be permissible in the case of a restrictedmultilateral treaty which did not contain a territorial application clause. Theyexplained that, in general terms, a restricted multilateral treaty was one with alimited number of contracting parties whose object was such that the applicationof the treaty in its entirety between all the parties was an essential conditionof the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty. Article 20 (2) of the vienna Convention of 1969 on the Law of Treaties provided that a reservationto such a treaty required acceptance by all the parties and so had to benegotiated1. But, according to the departments, instances of such treatieswhich did not contain specific provisions concerning territorial applicationwould be rare; and normally when the United Kingdom Government participatedin the negotiation of a treaty it would expect to be able to secure satisfactoryterritorial provisions.1386. The Home Office told us that in 1970 the department was concernedwith seventy-nine treaties, conventions and agreements, on all of which therewas consultation with the Islands. It was acknowledged that there had been oneor two cases in the past of failure to consult through oversight, but in theordinary course there was as full consultation as time would permit. Where itwas agreed that a treaty should be applied to the Islands, the Home Officediscussed the legislative method with them, and either advised them if necessary on the drafting of the appropriate insular Bills or consulted them on the drafting of the Orders in Council applying the United Kingdom Act.1387. From the evidence we received it appeared that no great difficulty had so far been experienced over the application of international agreements tothe Islands or the arrangements for consultation. In 1967 the Isle of Manobjected to the extension to the Island by Order in Council, without their consent, of the Marine, etc., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, which gaveeffect to a European agreement to ban private broadcasting ships, because they considered that the objective could be achieved by different means. But thiswas an isolated instance (which we examine more fully in paragraphs 1427-1429below), and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were concerned ratherwith the difficulties that might be expected in the future.1388. From what has been said above, it will be apparent that these difficulties are likely to arise with only two kinds of multilateral treaties first, treaties or conventions in whose drafting the United Kingdom has been1 The Convention has been ratified by the United Kingdom, but has not yet come intoforce.
concerned without securing the inclusion of an optional application clause, andwhich the United Kingdom is desirous for its own reasons to sign and ratify;and secondly, treaties already in force between other countries and containingno optional application clause, in the drafting of which the United kingdom has played no part, but to which it wishes for its own reasons to accede.Numerically, treaties of these two kinds are a small minority of the total andthose that could be thought to impose unwelcome obligations on the Islandsare even fewer. But unfortunately they may include some of the most importantinternational instruments. The former class is increasingly exemplified byconventions originating from the United Nations and its organisations, wherethere is a positive and deliberate unwillingness on the part of many of thenational delegations, on what may be generally described as &quot;anti-colonialist&quot;grounds, to allow optional application clauses whereby metropolitan countries can accept conventions for themselves but exclude their application to theirdependencies. It is not the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man that the delegations are thinking of; but these dependencies of the United kingdom are caught by the argument, and it cannot be assumed that no awkward cases will arise where the United Kingdom is willing to accept such a convention for itself, but one or more of the Islands are not. The second class that of already existing treaties to which the United Kingdom may wish to accede included atreaty whose possible application to the Islands was the subject of muchanxious concern at the time of our visits. That was the Treaty of Rome, theconstituent instrument of the European Economic Community.The Treaty of Rome1389. Article 227 (4) specifically applies the Treaty to all European territoriesfor whose external relations member states are responsible. The situation when we visited the Islands, therefore, was that if the United Kingdom went into theEuropean Economic Community the Islands would automatically go in on thesame terms unless either the Article were amended or some modification of its application to the Islands were negotiated. The Islands had been told by theHome Office in 1967 that the chances of. securing such a modification must beconsidered remote, and that there were good grounds for thinking that if theUnited Kingdom acceded to the Treaty their best interests would be served byparticipation in the Community; it was, however, recognised that membership would involve special problems for them, differing in kind, in scale and inrelative importance from those which would confront the United Kingdom.1390. In their evidence to us all the Islands said that they had represented to the United Kingdom their desire to have special terms negotiated for them.If this were not done, and the United Kingdom were to join the Communitywithout obtaining some dispensation for them, it would incur an internationalobligation to give effect to the terms of the Treaty of Rome in the laws of the islands. This would require legislation on taxation and other domestic matters to implement policies which the Islands would have no part in determiningand which would often be contrary to their interests, and which, if the constitu-tional conventions were observed, Parliament could not impose on them without their consent. The extension of the necessary United kingdom legislation to the Islands without their consent would be a substantial encroach-ment on their domestic autonomy.
1391. Quite apart from these objections of principle, the Islands were concerned that entry into the Community would be likely to do grave harm totheir economies. We discuss this part of their evidence later on, in dealing witheconomic relationships between the United Kingdom and the Islands.1392. Our own concern was not of course with the merits of the adherenceof the United Kingdom or of the Islands to the Treaty of Rome, but with thegeneral constitutional problem which the Treaty presented in its most acuteform.The Islands&apos; proposals for removing the difficulties1393. The States of Jersey said that apprehensions would be allayed if theUnited Kingdom Government were in a position to give an assurance that itwould not ratify, except with their concurrence, any international agreementrequiring legislative implementation in Jersey. While they did not for a momentthink that by any deliberate act of the United Kingdom they would be deprived of the degree of autonomy they had long enjoyed, they saw that pressure on theUnited Kingdom Government brought about by international conventionscould, against the best intentions of the United Kingdom, lead to that result.The problem, they said, was one for the United Kingdom Government, whichhad an obligation to find a solution which preserved the Island&apos;s autonomy.It was the United Kingdom Government and not Jersey which incurred inter-national obligations when it entered into international agreements covering the island; and it ought not to enter into a relationship with another country which was contrary to its long-standing relationship with the Island. Tynwaldalso took the view that it was for the United Kingdom Government to finda way out of the dilemma. Nevertheless, both the States of Jersey and Tynwaldput forward some suggestions for consideration.A new declaration1394. The first suggestion was that a new declaration should be maderestoring to the Islands the full right to decide, after leisurely deliberation,whether or not to be bound by an international agreement relating to domesticmatters to which the United Kingdom became a party. The 1950 declarationstill stood but was ineffective in relation to certain categories of treaties. Theyhad been led to believe that the defect might be removed by a fresh declaration made when the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties came into effect.Article 29 of the Convention, dealing with the territorial scope of treaties, hadbeen drafted with the object of allowing some flexibility in the application of treaties to autonomous or semi-autonomous communities. It provided that atreaty was binding upon each party in respect ot its entire territory unless adifferent intention appeared from the treaty or was otherwise established. the islands hoped that a general declaration might be made which would, for thepurposes of the Article, establish that ratification by the United Kingdom of atreaty containing no provisions regarding territorial application would not cover the Islands unless they were expressly named. They drew attention to adeclaration made in 1967 in respect of the Associated States in the West Indies,which appeared to have the desired effect.
The West Indies Associated States1395. There were many references in the evidence to the Associated Statesand their status in international law. At our request the Foreign and Common-wealth Office furnished a note on this matter. The essential points are as follows.The six Associated States (Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts-Nevis,St. Lucia and St. Vincent), which were formerly colonies, were brought into existence in pursuance of the West Indies Act 1967. The Act defines the relation-ship between the United Kingdom and an Associated State in terms of the divi-sion of responsibility and power between the United Kingdom on the onehand and the Government and legislature of an Associated State on the other.The United Kingdom Government retains responsibility in respect of any matter which in its opinion relates to defence or external affairs and any matter relatingto nationality or citizenship or to the Succession to the Throne or to the RoyalStyle and Titles. An Act of the United Kingdom Parliament does not extend to an Associated State unless it is expressly declared in the Act in question that the State has requested and consented to its being enacted; but this general rule is subject to certain exceptions corresponding to the responsibilitiesretained by the United Kingdom Government. Similar provisions relate to legislation by Your Majesty in Council. Where the United Kingdom has notretained responsibility, control of the affairs of an Associated State is vestedexclusively in the legislative and executive organs of the State. Either the UnitedKingdom or the Associated State may by unilateral action terminate the associated -ation, in which case the State would become completely independent of theUnited Kingdom.1396. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the AssociatedStates, in so far as this is a matter of law, is defined by the Act. The relationshiphas, however, been elaborated and refined by agreements which the UnitedKingdom has made with each of the States. These agreements provide for consultation and collaboration in matters affecting United Kingdom responsi-bilities for defence and external affairs. In particular, the United KingdomGovernment undertakes to consult the Government of an Associated Statebefore entering into international obligations with respect to it. If it considersthat legislation is required in the interests of its responsibilities for defence orexternal affairs, it will request the Government of the State either to signifyagreement to its enactment in the United Kingdom (such an agreement is not necessary as a matter of law) or to take steps to secure its enactment in theState itself. If the State sees difficulty in acceding to such a request, there will bethe fullest practicable consultation between the two Governments; and ifthis fails to produce agreement and the United Kingdom Government stillrequires the legislation, it will give the State Government as much notice aspossible of its intention to secure enactment of the legislation in the UnitedKingdom.1397. Under these arrangements, ratification of a treaty by the UnitedKingdom requiring for its implementation legislation applying to the AssociatedStates could lead to a State opting out of its association with the UnitedKingdom as an alternative to the acceptance of legislation with which it wasnot in agreement. It was in order to minimise the possibilities of this situation arising, and to reflect the degree of independence implicit in the new status of
the territories, that the United Kingdom Government in 1967 made an inter-national declaration which sought to restrict the application of treaties to them.The declaration stated that in future any treaty ratified by the United kingdom without a particular Associated State being named would not apply to that state. The United Kingdom Government has also delegated to the States,under conditions, a limited and closely defined authority in external affairs.1398. Neither Jersey nor the Isle of Man was seeking the status of the associated States. But they represented to us that there was no reason in lawwhy the United Kingdom Government should not make in relation to theman international declaration similar to that made in 1967 in relation to the associated States. The Home Office and the Foreign and commonwealth office told us, however, that they had concluded that it would not be practicable to exclude the Islands from the application of international agreements inthis way. It was true that for the purpose of Article 29 of the Vienna convention a &quot;different intention&quot; had been established in relation to the Associated states by the 1967 declaration. But a declaration of this kind to be effective must haveinternational acceptance and, having regard to the very different circumstancesof the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man by comparison with the West Indies their geographical position, history and relationships with the United Kingdom the departments were of the opinion that a similar declaration in relation tothem would not be accepted. It would be contrary to the spirit of Article 29.Unlike the Associated States the Islands were not far-distant territories, withthe continuing option of independence, and they were unlikely to be regardedinternationally as sufficiently different from the United Kingdom to justifywholly separate treatment. Even if the Islands themselves were to becomeAssociated States, with a right to terminate the association with the UnitedKingdom at any time, the departments considered that acceptance could notbe relied upon. In any event, they said, a declaration, even if it were to beinternationally accepted, would not provide a solution to the most crucialproblem. It would have no effect in relation to a treaty, such as the Treaty of rome, which contained specific provisions on territorial application.Division of responsibility for external relations1399. The Islands had recognised in earlier discussions with the Home office that a general declaration would not help with the Treaty of Rome, since theTreaty applies in terms to all European territories for whose external relationsmember states are responsible. This had led Tynwald to consider the possibilityof a different kind of association with the United Kingdom, in which there wouldbe a division between the United Kingdom and Isle of Man Governmentsof responsibility for the Island&apos;s international relations. In certain fields the isle of Man would have full responsibility as of right, and not merely bydelegation from the United Kingdom, as would be the case if the pattern of the associated States in the West Indies were to be followed. The division ofresponsibility would, broadly speaking, follow the existing practice in relationto legislation, whereby Tynwald legislates on matters of purely domestic concern and Parliament on wider matters. If the division were made it woulddemonstrate in international circles the Isle of Man&apos;s autonomy in the matters for which it had been given international responsibility and the incapacity ofthe United Kingdom Government to negotiate for the Island and to acceptcommitments on its behalf without its consent on such matters.
1400. In discussions with the Home Office before our appointment, the isle of Man had been told that the United Kingdom Government could not agree to an arrangement of this kind. The department believed that divisionor delegation of responsibility for the conduct of international relations offeredno advantage in relation to the Treaty of Rome and was of doubtful feasibilityin terms of international law and international acceptance; it would in any event be totally unacceptable to the United Kingdom Government. Tynwaldaccordingly did not include the proposal in its written evidence to us. In givingoral evidence, however, the representatives of Tynwald said that they would wish to have it considered if no other method regarded as more appropriatecould be suggested for ensuring that international agreements were not imposed on the Isle of Man against its will. They recognised that a limited divisionof responsibility for international affairs might not suffice to exclude the Islandfrom the operation of Article 227 (4) of the Treaty of Rome, but they would regard it as giving at least a promising start to negotiations for its exclusion.Consultation on international agreements1401. The Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office told us that, in an attempt to meet the difficulties of the Islands, they would be preparedto set up machinery to notify them, at a very early stage, of proposals likelyto lead to the conclusion of any multilateral treaty raising problems in relationto the Islands&apos; domestic legislation, so as to enable the Islands to have the oppor-tunity at the negotiation stage to express any views they might have regardingthe application of the treaty to them. They thought that the Island authorities would not wish to be consulted in every instance, since such a procederecould impose an extremely heavy burden on the Island administrations, butthat it ought to be possible to devise arrangements whereby the United KingdomGovernment would identify those international agreements on which the islands would be likely to wish to be consulted. An essential prerequisite of such arrangements would be the establishment of machinery in the Islands to enable a prompt response to be given, since the Government would be unable to delay negotiations.1402. The departments proposal represented a formal strengthening ofprocedures that they now try to follow. They recognised that it would notresolve all the difficulties. While the United Kingdom Government would naturally take the views of the Islands fully into account, those views wouldhave to be weighed carefully with other considerations relevant to the Govern-menfs negotiating position. There would no doubt remain many instances where the United Kingdom delegation were unable within the negotiations toensure that effect was given to the wishes expressed by the insular authoritieseither in terms of the insertion of an optional territorial application clause orin terms of a modification to the substance of the convention. The Islands wouldthen be confronted with a convention silent on territorial application but con-taining provisions whose application presented serious difficulties for them.In such circumstances the Government would be prepared, in circumstances where it could be regarded as being justified by international law, to considerthe possibility of making a reservation so as to exclude the Islands from theterritorial application of a part or the whole of the convention. The islands would no doubt appreciate that it would be undesirable to enter reservations
on their behalf unless the reasons for so doing were compelling, and that it mightnot be practicable to meet their particular requirements in every instance,especially if they chanced to conflict with essential interests of the UnitedKingdom Government.1403. The departments explained what was meant by &quot;circumstances whereit could be regarded as being justified by international law&quot;. Article 19 of the vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that a state may, whensigning, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, formulate a reservation unless the reservation is prohibited by the treaty, or the treatyprovides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservationin question, may be made, or the reservation is incompatible with the objectand purpose of the treaty. Thus, a reservation could not be made in respect of ageneral multilateral treaty of a humanitarian nature that was silent on territorialapplication if the treaty itself contained a clause prohibiting all reservations orpermitting only specified reservations which did not include the reservation inquestion. Such instances were, however, said to be rare. Of the eight treatiessilent on territorial application that the United Kingdom had ratified in the pastfour years only one, the Tokyo Convention on Offences and certain other Actscommitted on board Aircraft, had contained provisions prohibiting reservationsrelating to territorial application. In respect of general multilateral treaties of ahumanitarian nature that are silent on territorial application, a reservationexcluding the Islands from the application of specific provisions or even fromthe whole treaty would not necessarily be incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty; but there might be the rare instance (although it would not normally involve the passage of new or amending domestic legislation) where anyreservation on territorial application could objectively be regarded as beingincompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, whether because of thenature of the treaty or otherwise. An example might be the Non-ProliferationTreaty; or the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties itself.proposed act of parliament1404. The main proposal of both the States of Jersey and Tynwald forovercoming the difficulties arising out of international agreements was for the enactment at Westminster of legislation defining the responsibilities with respectto the Islands of Parliament.and the United Kingdom Government.The Jersey Bill1405. The States of Jersey, in their written evidence, said that they were not seeking any fundamental change of substance in the constitutional relationship between Jersey and the United Kingdom, but wished to have aspects of thatrelationship asserted, crystallised and fortified by being firmly embodied in an act of Parliament. The main purposes of the Act would be to give the con-stitutional convention (that Parliament does not legislate for Jersey on a domesticmatter without the consent of the States) the overt effect of strict law, and so toensure that, subject to certain exceptions, the implementation of international agreements entered into by the United Kingdom and extending to Jersey couldbe effected in Jersey only by the States or by Parliament acting at the requestand with the consent of the States.

The States of Jersey, in their written evidence, said that they were not seeking any fundamental change of substance in the constitutional relationship between Jersey and the United Kingdom, but wished to have aspects of thatrelationship asserted, crystallised and fortified by being firmly embodied in an act of Parliament. The main purposes of the Act would be to give the con-stitutional convention (that Parliament does not legislate for Jersey on a domesticmatter without the consent of the States) the overt effect of strict law, and so toensure that, subject to certain exceptions, the implementation of international agreements entered into by the United Kingdom and extending to Jersey couldbe effected in Jersey only by the States or by Parliament acting at the requestand with the consent of the States.
1406. An outline of the proposed statutory provisions was included in the written evidence and, when we visited Jersey to take oral evidence, representativesof the States submitted the draft of a Bill and an explanatory memorandum which they had prepared to indicate the kind of measure they had in mind.They stressed that the draft was incomplete and that the States were not com-mitted to its detailed provisions. While in large measure it reproduced what they considered to be the existing constitutional relationship, it went further in seeking to remove uncertainties by substituting strict rules of law for constitu-tional usages and in making changes needed to fortify the Island&apos;s domesticautonomy. At the same time it endeavoured to give reasonable weight to theinterests of the United Kingdom. Although the draft had something in common with the West Indies Act 1967, which brought the Associated States into existence, it departed from it in a number of ways.1407. Under the States&apos; proposals the United Kingdom Government wouldhave executive responsibility for the government of Jersey only in relation to mat-ters on which uniformity of legislation between the United Kingdom and Jersey was of paramount importance or matters in which the vital interests of the UnitedKingdom were likely to be affected, given the geographical proximity of theUnited Kingdom and Jersey. In relation to these matters the United KingdomGovernment would not simply impose its will on Jersey, but would normallyhold consultations in advance and act with the concurrence of the insularauthorities.1408. The matters for which the United Kingdom Government would have a continuing responsibility would be specified in the Act. In the draft Bill theyare stated to be Commonwealth relations, relations with foreign countries(except such matters as may by agreement be transferred to Jersey), succession to the Throne and the Royal Style and Titles, trading with the enemy, exchange control, extradition and fugitive offenders, copyright, wireless telegraphy, airsafety, any matter which in the opinion of the United Kingdom Governmentrelates to defence and any other matter in which powers are conferred on your majesty or on a Secretary of State under a law made by the States.1409. The draft Bill provides that the United Kingdom Parliament would havea paramount power to legislate for Jersey on these matters, with the exceptionthat if a matter fell only within the general category of relations with foreigncountries the paramount power to legislate would not be exercisable save withrespect to exclusively political matters or the conferment of diplomatic and similarimmunities. On all other matters, including the imposition of taxation and the repeal or amendment of the proposed new Act, Parliament would be able to legislate for Jersey only at the request and with the consent of the States.The power to alter the law of Jersey by Order in Council, other than for thepurpose of ratifying insular legislation, would be abolished. The States wouldacquire full legislative powers, including power to make laws with extra-territorial effect, subject to the provision that they would not be able to legislateinconsistently with United Kingdom legislation on the matters over which parliament retained paramount power. Legislation of the States would continueto require the Royal Assent, which would as now be given or withheld on theadvice of Your Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the United Kingdom following consulta-tion with the insular authorities.
1410. Under these proposals the powers of the United Kingdom parliament in external matters affecting Jersey would not be coextensive with those of theUnited Kingdom Government. The latter would have full powers, except inrelation to any matters for which responsibility had by agreement been trans-ferred to Jersey; and it was no part of the case made by the States that any such powers would necessarily be transferred. But the powers of Parliament wouldbe restricted; legislation needed to implement international agreements coveringdomestic matters would normally be enacted by the States of Jersey and onlyexceptionally by Parliament with the consent of the States. The representativesof the States pointed out that, though this situation might be unusual, it wouldbe by no means unprecedented; in Canada, for example, the federal govern-ment had plenary powers to enter into international obligations, but thefederal Parliament could not implement such obligations by legislation whenthe matter fell within the exclusive competence of the provinces. The proposals were not intended to impede the United Kingdom Government in the conductof international relations, and might indeed help by enabling the Governmentto point to an authoritative text demonstrating its incapacity to implementcertain types of obligations in the law of Jersey.An agreement as an alternative to a Bill1411. The Jersey Constitutional Association, a private body, said that itwas making separate representations to us because of the difficult position ofthe Law Officers in advising the States of Jersey in the matter of the clarifi-cation of Jersey&apos;s constitutional position when, in the event of a dispute betweenJersey and the Crown, the Law Officers would appear on behalf of the Crown.The Association differed from the States in maintaining that it had not beenestablished that the United Kingdom Parliament was entitled to legislate forJersey on any matter without the consent of the States, and submitted evidence in support of this contention. Similarly it argued that the Island had a right toadopt or reject treaties and international agreements entered into by the UnitedKingdom. In the view of the Association, it would be inappropriate to set outJersey&apos;s constitutional position in an Act of Parliament, as the States proposed,since that would imply that Parliament had power to legislate for Jersey, and parliament would then be entitled to alter or repeal the Act without theconcurrence of the States. It was proposed instead that the Island&apos;s constitu-tional position should be defined in an agreement, to be negotiated betweenthe United Kingdom and Jersey Governments and ratified by an Act ofParliament at the request of the States and by an Act of the States. Theagreement would provide that no Act of Parliament or Order in Council shouldhave the force of law in Jersey without the consent of the States; it wouldalso provide for the abolition of the prerogative power of the Crown to legislate for Jersey. Jersey would be given full legislative power, subject to the royal assent, which would be given by the Lieutenant Governor on the advice of anewly constituted Committee of the Privy Council, which would include amajority of members nominated by the States or be so composed as to be independent of the United Kingdom Government of the day. The UnitedKingdom Government would continue to be responsible for Jersey&apos;s inter-national relations, but Jersey would retain the right to adopt or reject anytreaty or international agreement entered into by the United Kingdom.
1412. In commenting on the Association^ proposals, the States did not agree that if Jersey&apos;s constitutional position were to be defined in an Act ofParliament, Parliament would be able to repeal or amend the Act without their consent. Such action would be specifically precluded by the terms ofthe Act. They acknowledged, however, that there was disagreement amongconstitutional lawyers about the capacity of Parliament to bind its successorsin a matter of this kind, and that the Act would not indisputably have theeffect they desired. While they considered that an Act would be more appropriatethan an agreement, their sole objective was to create by one legal instrument or another a state of affairs in which it would be impossible, without the consentof the States, for Parliament to legislate for Jersey on domestic matters andfor the United Kingdom Government to make treaties having application toJersey on such matters.Opposition to constitutional change in Jersey1413. Evidence was submitted by the Jersey Democratic Movement, theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union in Jersey and the Jersey Trades Council,and representatives of these three bodies appeared before us together. Theyobjected to the proposals of both the States of Jersey and the Jersey Constitu-tional Association, which they regarded as weakening the constitutional links with the United Kingdom. They placed great value on the maintenance ofthose links, particularly in so far as they enable the United Kingdom Govern-ment to exercise some restraint over Jersey&apos;s use of its independent powers oflegislation. They argued that removal of the restraint would have an adverse effect on the members of the working class which they represented, in viewof the unrepresentative nature of the States, and that its maintenance wouldbe a safeguard against arbitrary action by a privileged group. Representativesof the States in their evidence stressed that it was in fact no part of their proposals to remove the power of the Crown to withhold Assent to insularlegislation.The views of Guernsey1414. The States of Guernsey were opposed to an Act of Parliament orformal agreement giving statutory effect to the present constitutional conventions,saying that it was beyond question that the inhabitants of the Island would not wish to replace centuries of mutual trust and respect by such an instrument.The Guernsey Labour Group supported this view. Representatives of the States,in their evidence, said that it would be difficult to draft an Act which placed the constitutional relationship beyond argument. There was not at present a clear-cut division of functions between the United Kingdom and Guernsey.The unwritten relationship gave a flexibility which would be lost if it had to beput into statutory form, and this flexibility enabled adjustments and innovationsto be made to meet new developments. The States were content to rest on the assurance they had received in 1968 that there was no question of the UnitedKingdom Government seeking to legislate for the Island in any taxationmatter or in any other matter which had long been accepted as the responsibility and concern of the insular authorities.The Isle of Man Bill1415. For the Isle of Man Tynwald wished to have an Act of Parliamentmaking a formal division of legislative competence between Parliament and
Tynwald. Parliament would legislate on matters which transcended the frontiers of the Island and Tynwald on domestic matters. It was suggested that matterstranscending the frontiers of the Island could be divided into two categories.The first was made up of those matters which affect other states, which weredefined as states other than the United Kingdom and the British Islands for whose international relations it is responsible. The second category consisted of those matters which are common to British people throughout the world.Tynwald recognised that there might be difficulty in reaching agreement withthe United Kingdom Government on lists of subjects falling in one or other of these two categories; and although it would prefer to see lists embodied inthe statute, it would regard an Act defining the legislative competence ofParliament and Tynwald respectively in general terms as being better than noAct at all.1416. Tynwald, like the States of Jersey, embodied its proposals in a draftBill. The two drafts had much in common, but there were differences in the lists of matters in which Parliament and the United Kingdom Governmentwould retain paramount powers. The most significant of these concernednationality and citizenship, which the Isle of Man included in their list butJersey did not, and wireless telegraphy (broadcasting), which Jersey includedbut the Isle of Man did not. The Isle of Man also omitted exchange control,extradition, fugitive offenders and copyright, which were on the Jersey list,saying that subjects such as these, on which uniformity of legislation as betweenthe United Kingdom and the Isle of Man would continue to be necessary, or at least desirable, need not be listed since current practice was for Tynwaldto request the extension of United Kingdom legislation on them.1417. The Isle of Man Bill included a provision to the effect that no subse-quent Act of Parliament could amend or repeal it without the consent ofTynwald. The representatives of Tynwald, however, unlike those of the Statesof Jersey, whose Bill contained a similar provision, acknowledged that Parlia-ment could not bind its successors in this way and that enactment of the Billin the terms suggested would not and could not deprive Parliament of itsultimate legislative sovereignty in respect of the Isle of Man as a dependencyof the Crown. They maintained that its enactment would nevertheless havevalue in giving greater certainty to the constitutional conventions by conferringstatutory recognition upon them. Parliamentary sovereignty would remainunimpaired in legal theory and be available for exercise in extraordinarycircumstances, such as the need to intervene to ensure the preservation ofpublic order in the Island; but it was almost impossible to contemplate such circumstances arising, and in practice the exercise of Parliamentary sovereigntywould be restricted in the manner prescribed in the statute.1418. An important difference between the two draft Bills was the inclusion in the Isle of Man Bill of a provision permitting Tynwald to amend or repeal in relation to the Isle of Man any existing Act of Parliament which had been extended to the Island at the request of Tynwald. The Stonham Working party had agreed that revocation of extensions of Acts of Parliament to the Islandshould rest on the same basis as extensions; if it were ever to be accepted thatActs of Parliament could be extended to the Island only with the consent of
Tynwald, then it would follow that Tynwald should be able to secure the repealor amendment of the legislation so extended. There was no comparable provision in the Jersey Bill.1419. Under Tynwald&apos;s proposals the procedure for legislation requiredin the interest of the United Kingdom&apos;s responsibility for defence or for theinternational relations of the Isle of Man, within the limits prescribed by statute, would be similar to that agreed with the Associated States of the west indies. Tynwald would be invited either to take steps to secure its enactmentin the Isle of Man or to consent to its enactment by Parliament. In the latter case,the legislation would contain a provision expressly declaring that it was requiredto extend to the Isle of Man as part of its law in the interest of the particularresponsibility of the United Kingdom to which it related. If Tynwald sawdifficulty in acceding to such a request made by the United Kingdom Govern-ment, there would be full consultation with a view to resolving the difficulty.In the event of failure to reach agreement, if the United Kingdom Governmentremained of the opinion that it was nevertheless necessary for the legislation tobe enacted, it would give as much notice as possible to Tynwald of its insistence on the enactment of the legislation, which would again contain a provisionexpressly declaring that it was being enacted in the interests of the particularresponsibility of the United Kingdom to which it related.Royal Assent to insular legislation1420. Tynwald in its evidence also proposed that the Royal Assent to acts of Tynwald should be given by the Lieutenant Governor under delegatedpowers. The Lieutenant Governor would be able to reserve the Royal assent to the Privy Council in any case in which he was doubtful about the validity of the exercise of his delegated powers. This proposal was largely promptedby experience in recent years in the field of broadcasting, where differenceshave arisen between the United Kingdom and Isle of Man Governments whichare not wholly related to international agreements. These led Tynwald to seek a new procedure for signification of the Royal Assent to Manx legislation in order to ensure that the United Kingdom Government would not be ina position arbitrarily to set the dividing line between domestic affairs and thosewhich transcend the frontiers of the Island by the mechanism of grantingor withholding Assent. The States of Jersey did not see this as a problem, andhad no proposals for changing the procedure for giving Royal Assent to theirlegislation.Broadcasting in the Isle of Man(0 Manx Radio1421. The history of the disputes over broadcasting is recorded in Appendix b of the evidence submitted to us by Tynwald, and memoranda on the subject by the Isle of Man Government and by the General Post Office (as it then was)are included as appendices to the Report of the Stonham Working Party.Because of the important part which the broadcasting issue has played in discussions between the United Kingdom and Isle of Man Governments on constitutional matters, and the way in which it illustrates the working outin practice of the existing constitutional relationship, we summarise here thecourse of events and the arguments used by the two sides.
1422. Until the early 1960s it seems not to have been in dispute that the con-trol of broadcasting in the Isle of Man was a matter for the United KingdomGovernment and Parliament. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904, which firstconferred power on the Postmaster General to license and control broadcasting,applied in terms to the Island, and the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, whichreplaced the Act of 1904, was extended to the Island by Order in Council withthe agreement of Tynwald. The Television Act 1954 was similarly extendedat Tynwald&apos;s express request.1423. In 1961 Manx Radio, a company sponsored by the Isle of Man Govern-ment, applied to the Postmaster General for a sound-transmitting licence andfor the allocation of a frequency. It was intended to establish a service, similarto that provided by Radio Luxembourg, for transmission to the whole of theUnited Kingdom and to parts of Europe. The application was refused. Tynwaldthen requested the revocation of the Order in Council extending the 1949 Actto the Island, and enacted legislation conferring powers to license broadcastingin the Island on the Lieutenant Governor (who would have powers in parallel with those of the Postmaster General). The requests for revocation of the Orderin Council and for Royal Assent to the Bill were both refused, on the grounds,first, that there had to be one final authority to control the use of scarce fre-quencies in the United Kingdom and the Islands in order that the UnitedKingdom Government could honour its international obligations, and, secondly,that under international agreement no station could be permitted to employ a power beyond that necessary to maintain economically an effective service ofgood quality within the frontiers of the country in which it was located.1424. In 1962 the Isle of Man Government proposed that it should be given power to license a television and radio station to transmit to the British Islandsonly. It was told that, while the new proposal did not raise the same difficultyas regards international obligations, it conflicted with United Kingdom broad-casting policy. It then submitted proposals for a radio station to broadcast tothe Island alone. These were approved, and the Postmaster General offered toprovide all the technical assistance he could for such a project; the power atwhich the station operated would have to be restricted so as to ensure that its programmes could not be received on a regular basis anywhere in the UnitedKingdom. A licence was issued in 1965 and a commercial broadcasting station was established in the Island. The station is still operating, but the Isle of ManGovernment has repeatedly represented that, with the restricted power per-mitted, satisfactory service cannot be given in some parts of the Island.1425. In their evidence to us the Tynwald representatives complained thatthe United Kingdom Government had used false arguments and shifted itsground to deny the Island&apos;s requests. It first rested its refusal on the inter-national agreement, though its attention was drawn to the facts that RadioLuxembourg and other stations were not called upon to conform to it and theBritish Broadcasting Corporation itself operated extensive overseas services.The United Kingdom Government later sought to justify its refusal to license a service confined to the British Islands by reference to the agreement despite thefact that for purposes of international control the British Islands are regarded asa single country. A further ground of refusal was that, if a service were to bereceived on a regular footing in the United Kingdom, the United KingdomGovernment would be bound to concern itself with its objectives and policies
and with the constitution of the body to which the day-to-day control of theservice was entrusted. The Isle of Man Government had put forward proposals to meet this objection. If adopted they would have given the United KingdomGovernment a close link with the body in day-to-day control of Manx broad-casting. The proposals were rejected on the ground that they involved a funda-mental departure from the principle that the provision and conduct of broad-casting to the United Kingdom in consequence of a licence granted by thePostmaster General should rest in charge of public authorities answerable toParliament. This ignored the proposal for the licence to be granted by the lieutenant Governor, as would have been possible under the 1962 Bill to whichRoyal Assent was refused. The Isle of Man Government had enquired whetherthe United Kingdom Governments attitude would be different if Manx Radiowere to become non-commercial, but it received no favourable response. Theattitude of the United Kingdom Government to broadcasting was contrasted with its attitude to postal services and other telecommunications services, which,by the Post Office Act 1969, could be transferred to the Island. The Isle of ManGovernment contended that the policy control and administration of broad-casting in the Island, and from it to any other part of the British Islands, shouldequally be regarded as being within the sole province of Tynwald, except for those aspects which concerned the fulfilment of the United kingdom&apos;s  inter-national obligations, which the Isle of Man would agree to observe.1426. The United Kingdom Government, for its part, contended that the isle of Man had no right to demand better treatment from the United kingdom under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 than it would obtain if it were a sovereign state and a member of the International Telecommunications Union,when it would be less well served as regards the right to use medium frequenciesthan at present. If, by virtue of a licence granted by the Minister of Posts and telecommunications, Isle of Man programmes were received normally andregularly in a part of the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament representingconstituencies in which the programmes were received would have a right toraise questions about them, and the Minister would be bound to answer them.If, on the other hand, the Island were given its own licensing power the minister would still be responsible for maintaining frequency discipline in the area,including the Isle of Man, covered by the United Kingdom&apos;s adherence to theInternational Telecommunications Union Convention; even if no breach wereto occur it would be an impossible situation for him to have this responsibilitywithout the power of ensuring that international conditions were met. RadioLuxembourg&apos;s international broadcasts were an anomaly, tolerated inter-nationally for historical reasons; and the external services of the British Broad-casting Corporation existed, like the external broadcasts of other major powers,as a projection of foreign policy, and were thus differentiated in kind from a normal broadcasting service and irrelevant to a territory that does not conductits own foreign policy. It had never been part of the United Kingdom case thatthe Isle of Man should not take steps to improve the service within the territoriallimits of the Island, and it was believed that for a very small expenditure coverageon the Island could be improved without extending overspill.(ii) Pirate broadcasting1427. Another dispute in the field of broadcasting arose over action to dealwith pirate broadcasting stations at sea. The Council of Europe drew up an
and with the constitution of the body to which the day-to-day control of theservice was entrusted. The Isle of Man Government had put forward proposals to meet this objection. If adopted they would have given the United KingdomGovernment a close link with the body in day-to-day control of Manx broad-casting. The proposals were rejected on the ground that they involved a funda-mental departure from the principle that the provision and conduct of broad-casting to the United Kingdom in consequence of a licence granted by thePostmaster General should rest in charge of public authorities answerable toParliament. This ignored the proposal for the licence to be granted by the lieutenant Governor, as would have been possible under the 1962 Bill to whichRoyal Assent was refused. The Isle of Man Government had enquired whetherthe United Kingdom Governments attitude would be different if Manx Radiowere to become non-commercial, but it received no favourable response. Theattitude of the United Kingdom Government to broadcasting was contrasted with its attitude to postal services and other telecommunications services, which,by the Post Office Act 1969, could be transferred to the Island. The Isle of ManGovernment contended that the policy control and administration of broad-casting in the Island, and from it to any other part of the British Islands, shouldequally be regarded as being within the sole province of Tynwald, except for those aspects which concerned the fulfilment of the United Kingdoms inter-national obligations, which the Isle of Man would agree to observe.1426. The United Kingdom Government, for its part, contended that the isle of Man had no right to demand better treatment from the United kingdom under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 than it would obtain if it were a sovereign state and a member of the International Telecommunications Union,when it would be less well served as regards the right to use medium frequenciesthan at present. If, by virtue of a licence granted by the Minister of Posts and telecommunications, Isle of Man programmes were received normally andregularly in a part of the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament representingconstituencies in which the programmes were received would have a right toraise questions about them, and the Minister would be bound to answer them.If, on the other hand, the Island were given its own licensing power the minister would still be responsible for maintaining frequency discipline in the area,including the Isle of Man, covered by the United Kingdoms adherence to theInternational Telecommunications Union Convention; even if no breach wereto occur it would be an impossible situation for him to have this responsibilitywithout the power of ensuring that international conditions were met. RadioLuxembourgS international broadcasts were an anomaly, tolerated inter-nationally for historical reasons; and the external services of the British Broad-casting Corporation existed, like the external broadcasts of other major powers,as a projection of foreign policy, and were thus differentiated in kind from a normal broadcasting service and irrelevant to a territory that does not conductits own foreign policy. It had never been part of the United Kingdom case thatthe Isle of Man should not take steps to improve the service within the territoriallimits of the Island, and it was believed that for a very small expenditure coverageon the Island could be improved without extending overspill.(ii) Pirate broadcasting1427. Another dispute in the field of broadcasting arose over action to dealwith pirate broadcasting stations at sea. The Council of Europe drew up an
agreement in 1963 which provided a system of interlocking measures by national governments to suppress such stations. In 1967 Parliament enacted the Marineetc. Broadcasting (Offences) Act, making it an offence to supply certain goods and services to persons operating pirate stations. One of those stations, RadioCaroline North, anchored off the coast of the Isle of Man, had begun trans-missions in July 1964. At first there was some hostility in the Isle of Man tothe new station, which was seen as a rival to Manx Radio, possessing the unfairadvantage of being able to operate with unrestricted power; but it came later to be regarded as a source of popular entertainment and of free publicity forthe Island&apos;s tourist industry.1428. When the Marine etc. Broadcasting (Offences) Bill was introduced into Parliament it contained a clause permitting it to be extended by Order inCouncil to the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man Government indicated its preference for legislating in Tynwald for as much of the subject matter as was within itsconstitutional competence. A Bill was accordingly introduced in Tynwald; but,after being passed by the Legislative Council, it was defeated on Second reading in the House of Keys. The United Kingdom Government thereupon indicatedits intention to secure the extension of the United Kingdom Act to the Isle ofMan, and this was done after an appeal by Tynwald to Your Majesty in Councilagainst the extension had been rejected. Tynwald complained that the Act,in being extended to the Island, effected a change in Manx criminal law, a branch of law in which Parliament had rarely legislated for the Isle of man and then only with the acquiescence of Tynwald, that extension to the Isle ofMan was unnecessary and that pirate broadcasting stations could have been dealt with by other means. The United Kingdom Government for its partargued that Tynwald&apos;s failure to legislate opened up a breach in the concertedfront which the countries of Europe had agreed to present against a seriousthreat to broadcasting throughout the continent, and that to fill the breach itwas bound to act as it did.1429. In evidence to us Tynwald instanced the extension of the 1967 Act tothe Isle of Man contrary to its wishes as an example of the difficulty that could arise if Parliament, in fulfilment of an international obligation of the UnitedKingdom, legislated for the Island on matters such as the criminal law of the island that were normally left to Tynwald.The views of the United Kingdom government departments1430. In their memorandum commenting generally on the evidence receivedfrom the Islands, the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Officementioned four considerations having a particular bearing on any proposals for change in the constitutional relationships between the UnitedKingdom and the Islands the ultimate responsibility of the Crown for thegood government of the Islands, their geographical proximity, the economicrelationships and the need to avoid submerging such small communities underadministrative burdens.1431. The departments said that the ultimate responsibility of the Crownfor the good government of the Islands was not unique to the Islands, but thattheir propinquity to the United Kingdom and the antiquity of their association with the Crown placed the Islands in a category apart from all other British
dependencies. The fact that the United Kingdom and the Islands were all partsof the British Islands, while certainly not making uniformity essential, made itnevertheless highly desirable that the institutions and the practices of the islands should not differ beyond recognition from those of the United Kingdom.The Islands succeeded in maintaining a way of life that was distinctive from thatof the United Kingdom and, in general, the United Kingdom Government fullyendorsed the desirability of their being free to express their individuality. Butthe British Islands were an entity in the eyes of the world, and the UnitedKingdom Government would be held responsible internationally if practices inthe Islands were to overstep the limits of acceptability. The present links withthe Islands, while giving them a great deal of liberty to order their internal affairs, nevertheless enabled the Government to ensure that the British Islandsas a whole adhered in their policies to certain broad principles that enabled the international image of the group, however varied in its features, to be seennevertheless to follow a coherent pattern.1432. The departments made the further point that the economies of the islands were closely interrelated with those of the United Kingdom and that without some measure of compatibility of legislation it would be easy forpractices to develop in the Islands, particularly in the commercial field, thatwould be detrimental to the economic well-being of the British Islands as awhole.1433. In the view of the departments there could be only limited room for manoeuvre if the amount of autonomy enjoyed by the Islands were not to be diminished and if the United Kingdom Government were not to be placed inthe impossible position of having responsibility without power, as would result from acceptance of the Jersey and Isle of Man proposals to allocate spheres of legislative competence to the United Kingdom and the Islands. In theinternational field, the proposals would produce a situation in which the UnitedKingdom would continue to be responsible for the external relations of the islands but would have no legislative power to ensure that international obliga-tions entered into on their behalf were implemented. That was a situation thatthe United Kingdom Government could not accept. So long as the Governmentretained executive responsibilities for the conduct of the Islands&apos; relations withforeign countries, Parliament must retain a reserve power to legislate in the last resort to ensure that effect was given to any international obligations contractedon their behalf. Precisely similar considerations applied in relation to domesticmatters. So long as the United Kingdom Government had a responsibility forthe good government of the Islands, it was essential for the United kingdom to retain its residual power to legislate, if need be, on matters that were domesticto the Islands.1434. The Isle of Man&apos;s proposal that the Lieutenant Governor should beempowered to grant Royal Assent to certain categories of Bill passed by Tynwaldwas considered to be unacceptable for much the same reason. It would removeone of the means whereby institutions and practices in the Islands could bekept in reasonably close harmony with those in the United Kingdom. TheHome Office said that before Royal Assent was given to an Island Bill therewas extensive consultation between the Home Office and relevant governmentdepartments. Such consultation could and did take place at the drafting stageif the Bills were submitted in draft, but it seemed desirable that it should also
be available when the Bill emerged from the legislative process. In the light ofthe general considerations expressed in the departmental evidence, the HomeOffice considered that the delegation advocated by Tynwald would be undesirable.the settlement of disputesMachinery for consultation1435. We received proposals for changes in the machinery for consultation between the United Kingdom and Island Governments and for the settlement of disputes. At present there is day-to-day informal consultation between the islands and the United Kingdom government departments on a wide variety of topics. The department principally concerned is the Home Office, and wewere told that the department maintained a staff of fifteen engaged almostentirely on work relating to the Islands. Some of this work arises from theUnited Kingdom Governments responsibilities for the external relations of the islands and some from the requirement that their legislation should be subjectto the Royal Assent; but a good deal of it arises quite independently through theUnited Kingdom Governments concern for the well-being of the Islands.There was acknowledgment in the evidence of all the Islands of the advice and assistance readily given to them by the United Kingdom Government.1436. In the case of the Isle of Man there has recently been established,on a recommendation of the Stonham Working Party, more formal machineryfor consultation in the Standing Committee on the Common Interests of the isle of Man and the United Kingdom. The States of Jersey proposed theestablishment of a similar committee for Jersey. The Isle of Man Committeeconsists of three members elected by Tynwald to represent the Island andthree representatives of the United Kingdom Government, with a joint Secre-tariat. The functions of the Committee are to consider any matter of mutualconcern that may be referred to it by either Government; to keep under review the practical working of the relationship between the two Governments so that difficulties may be resolved either as they arise or, if possible, in advance;and to keep under review those areas of government where it may be desirablethat the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man should pursue similar policies.The meetings are not held in public. When the Committee was first set up itwas intended that it should meet normally at half-yearly intervals, in Londonand Douglas alternately, with a representative from each side acting as chair-man at alternate meetings. In practice meetings at half-yearly intervals havenot been found necessary. The first three meetings were in April 1970, February1971 and July 1972; the third meeting was adjourned and resumed in February1973. For the convenience of the United Kingdom representatives the first two were held in London, but the third was held in Douglas.Judicial Committee of the Privy Council1437. As part of the new arrangements proposed for the division of legislativeresponsibilities between the United Kingdom and the Islands, the States ofJersey and Tynwald suggested that disputes about jurisdictional competence,if not resolved in the Standing Committeees, should be referred to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council for an advisory opinion on a question of lawunder the provisions of Section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833. there could also be judicial review of legislative and administrative action in the course
or ordinary legal proceedings. For example, it would be open to an Islandcourt and, on appeal, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, or a UnitedKingdom court in a matter arising in the United Kingdom, to hold that legisla-tion passed or administrative action taken in the Island was inoperative asbeing repugnant to United Kingdom legislation extending to the Island or was ultra vires on any other ground mentioned in the proposed new Act ofParliament. It would also be open to the courts to hold that legislation or admini-strative action by the United Kingdom was inoperative in relation to the Islandbecause it fell within a class of matter on which the United Kingdom was empowered to act only with the express concurrence of the Island.Other Privy Council Committees1438. A further proposal was that petitions by Tynwald or the branches ofTynwald to Your Majesty in Council should be considered, not as now by theCommittee of the Privy Council charged with Manx affairs, but by a separateCommittee on which neither the Home Secretary nor any of the United kingdom ministers directly concerned with the subject matter of the petition would serve or be represented. In oral evidence representatives of Tynwald made itclear that they would prefer the Committee to include no representatives of theUnited Kingdom Government. The proposal was prompted by recent experienceof the working of the existing procedure. In 1967, when Tynwald petitionedagainst the extension to the Isle of Man of the Marine, etc. Broadcasting(Offences) Act, the petition was considered and rejected by a Committee ofMinisters the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of State, HomeOffice, the Postmaster General and the Attorney General some of whom hadbeen principally concerned in taking the decision against which they wereappealing.1439. Another suggestion, put to us by the Jersey Constitutional Association,was that a majority of the members of the Committee of the Privy council for the affairs of Jersey should be nominated by the States or that the Committeeshould be so composed as to be independent of the United Kingdom Govern-ment of the day.1440. The Home Office, in its evidence, recognised that in putting forwardits proposal for a differently constituted Committee of the Privy Council,Tynwald was expressing its discontent with the situation whereby the same bodymay act both as court of initial judgement and court of appeal, as occurred inthe broadcasting dispute. In the view of the department, however, to circum-scribe the power of Your Majesty to appoint freely to Committees of the privy council would raise constitutional issues of such gravity that they wouldprobably require consultation with all independent Commonwealth countries.Apart from that consideration, it seemed unlikely that the device would achieve the objectives sought by Tynwald; it would be intolerable for differing advice to be tendered to Your Majesty on a single subject, and inevitable thereforeboth that the Privy Counsellors appointed to the Committee to hear a petitionfrom the Islands should be members of the United Kingdom Government andthat they should seek guidance from the Home Secretary and the ministers directly concerned with the matter. The proposal of the Jersey ConstitutionalAssociation was considered to be open to even greater objection.
crown appointmentsSelection of persons for appointment1441. We received proposals for changes in the method of selection of persons to be appointed as Lieutenant Governor and to other Crown offices. The Statesof Jersey, in their written evidence, stated that they believed that it would beconsonant both with the present constitutional relationship and that which they proposed for the future that the Lieutenant Governor should be appointedafter consultation with the insular authorities, and that the Bailiff, DeputyBailiff, Attorney General and Solicitor General should be appointed on theadvice of the appropriate insular authorities; these arrangements should be formally agreed, though not necessarily in the text of an Act of Parliament.Tynwald proposed that the advice of the Executive Council of the Isle of Manshould be sought in confidence before appointments were made to the offices of lieutenant Governor, Deemster, Attorney General and Judge of Appeal, andthat the power to appoint the Attorney General should be delegated to the lieutenant Governor.1442. Representatives of the States of Jersey and Tynwald when they appeared before us explained more fully what they had in mind. Both made clear thatthe proposals were not prompted by any sense of grievance. It was already the practice for the Island authorities to be consulted before appointments weremade, and it was not thought likely that under any new procedures differentpeople would be appointed. The changes were suggested to ensure that con-sultation is not overlooked and to demonstrate to the world at large the Islands&apos;degree of independence.1443. Both Jersey and the Isle of Man would leave the final choice of theperson to be recommended to Your Majesty for appointment as LieutenantGovernor to the Home Secretary, Jersey after consultation with the insularauthorities and no-one else, and the Isle of Man after consultation with theExecutive Council and anyone else the Home Secretary chose. For other Crownoffices Jersey would leave the final choice to be made by the insular authorities,by a majority vote if there were no agreement, with the Home Secretary under an obligation to act on their advice. The representatives of the States agreedthat as the term &quot;insular authorities&quot;, though frequently used, has at present no precise meaning, it would have to be defined for this purpose; they had inmind the Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff, Jurats of the Royal Court and the chairmen ofthe most important committees of the States. The Isle of Man would leave the -final choice to the Lieutenant Governor after consultation with the ExecutiveCouncil in the case of the Attorney General, and to the Home Secretary in thecase of the other Crown offices.1444. The Home Office representatives told us that it had been the practice for many years to consult the Island authorities in confidence before makingappointments to any Crown office. They saw no objection to such consultationbeing on a wide basis provided that confidentiality could be guaranteed. Theydoubted the wisdom of prescribing formally the extent of consultation to beundertaken, since circumstances change and the Islands might wish at somesubsequent date to vary or widen the practice. The department considered thatit would not be consistent with the responsibility of the Crown for the good government of Jersey for the insular authorities to be able to dictate in the
matter of appointment to Crown offices. As the Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff, attorney general and Solicitor General all had responsibility for good government, andthe Law Officers in particular were frequently called upon to tender advice tothe Crown, the holders of all these offices had to be acceptable to the Crown.The Home Office would, however, expect Island advice to continue in thefuture, as it had in the past, to weigh heavily in the selection of persons for appointment, particularly to those offices which had administrative as well asjudicial functions.1445. The Home Office said that, as recommended by the Stonham working party, it had given further consideration to the Isle of Man proposal that the attorney General should be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Thedifficulties which had been stated in the Working Party, consequent on the attorney Generafs duties including not only those of principal legal adviser tothe Isle of Man Government but also that of acting as the Crown&apos;s agent in enforcing the law, did not appear any less and the department saw no prospectof meeting the wishes of Tynwald in this matter.The office of Bailiff in the Channel Islands1446. We received from the Guernsey Labour Group a suggestion that theoffice of Bailiff should be split. There would be an official appointed by theCrown as Head of the Judiciary, and another elected by the people or by theirrepresentatives to preside over the States. The Group considered it wrong inprinciple that one person should have these dual functions. They were notdissatisfied with the present Bailiff, but thought that at some future time thearrangement might be against the interests of the Guernsey people. A similarsuggestion was put to us in Jersey by the Jersey Communist Party.1447. The suggestion was opposed by representatives of both the States ofGuernsey and the States of Jersey when we put it to them. They drew attentionto the fact that in 1947 a Privy Council Committee looked at the matter and recommended no change. The Committee considered that the objection to the combination of the dual functions of the Bailiff would be justified only if itwere established that in the States the Bailiff exercised undue influence in thecourse of deliberations or that in the court he allowed his political position to influence his decisions. No evidence had been tendered to the Committee insupport of such contention. The Committee also considered that the Bailiff as president of the States exercised important functions in advising the assembly on constitutional procedure, which, from the nature of the constitution, requiredan intimate knowledge of the privileges, rights and customs of the Islands.We were told in both Islands that the States considered these arguments to be equally applicable today, that the arrangement whereby their President is appointed by the Crown is acceptable to the members of the States, and thatimportance is attached to the maintenance of the status of the office of Bailiffas the Island&apos;s chief citizen and representative.alderney and sark1448. Alderney, with a population of about 1700, and Sark, with a populationof about 590, are parts of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and the States of Guernseylegislate for them in certain matters. But each has a large measure of autonomy,
including an independent relationship with the United Kingdom throughthe Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey. We therefore considered it appropriate that we should take evidence from the authorities in the two Islands. In their evidence both the States of Alderney and the Chief Pleas of Sark stated thatthe constitutional relationships between the Islands and the United kingdom were, broadly speaking, the same as those between Guernsey and the UnitedKingdom, as set out in the evidence of the States of Guernsey; and this was accepted by the States of Guernsey and by the Home Office.Alderney1449. Though not strictly relevant to our enquiries, we found it helpful toour understanding of the problems of the smaller Islands to look at theirrelationships with Guernsey. Before the war the constitutional links betweenGuernsey and Alderney were slender. The States of Guernsey legislated forAlderney on criminal matters; but in most other matters, including finance,Alderney made its own laws, which, like other insular legislation, required the Royal Assent, and administered its own services. During the war the island was evacuated and considerable damage was done by the German occupyingforces. When the civilian population returned, it was apparent that the Islandwould not for some time be able to stand on its own feet. A Committee of the privy Council made proposals which resulted, with the agreement of Alderney,in a curtailment of the Island&apos;s independence and a reform of the organisationof government. Guernsey took over responsibility for the main services inAlderney, including the airport, education, health, immigration and police,on the basis that Alderney would be taxed on the Guernsey scale. The existingGuernsey laws on these matters were applied to Alderney and it fell thereafter to Guernsey to legislate on them. The States of Alderney retained some legisla-tive powers, but legislation involving additional expenditure became subjectto the control of Guernsey.1450. At the time of our visit, the States of Alderney consisted of the President,elected by direct vote for a term of three years, and nine members (sinceincreased to twelve), all elected by the electorate of the whole Island for a termof three years, three (now four) retiring each year. The States nominate twoof their members to represent Alderney in the States of Guernsey.1451. The arrangements made after the war are not considered to have affected Alderney&apos;s general constitutional position as a largely autonomousdependency of the Crown. They are regarded in Alderney as temporary ones,made for the convenience of the Island, with the intention that Alderneyshould one day regain a measure of independence similar to that which itenjoyed before the war. We were told that the Island is financially independentin that all the services provided for it by both the States of Guernsey andthe States of Alderney are paid for out of the proceeds of taxes collected inAlderney.1452. In their evidence the States of Alderney proposed that the constitu-tional relationship between the United Kingdom and Alderney should beso altered that Alderney&apos;s inclusion in international treaties which affect herfinancial and domestic affairs should be dependent upon the concurrence ofthe States of Alderney. The proposal was prompted by the view that if the
Island were to be incorporated in the European Economic Community withoutsafeguards, the prosperity of the inhabitants and indeed its self-governmentwould be jeopardised.Sark1453. Ownership of the Island of Sark was granted to the first Seigneurby Queen Elizabeth I in 1565. One of the conditions of the grant was thatthe Island should be continually inhabited by forty men, and Letters Patent ofJames I in 1612 provided thai the forty tenements should remain undivided.The Chief Pleas, the Island&apos;s legislative body, consist of the Seigneur, theSeneschal, who is appointed for a three-year term of office by the Seigneurwith the approval of the Lieutenant Governor and is ex-officio President of theChief Pleas, the forty Tenants and twelve Deputies of the People, electedtriennially. The Chief Pleas may not be held unless the Seigneur, or the Seigneur&apos;sDeputy, is present. The States of Guernsey may legislate for Sark on criminalmatters without the consent of the Chief Pleas, and on any other matter withtheir consent. The Chief Pleas may legislate for Sark on any matter by Projetcle Loi, which requires the Royal Assent, and on a limited range of local affairsby Ordinance. The Seigneur has power to veto an Ordinance, but the ChiefPleas may then resolve that it should nevertheless have effect. The Royal Courtof Guernsey may annul an Ordinance on the ground that it is unreasonableor ultra vires the Chief Pleas; but the Chief Pleas may then appeal to your majesty in Council against the annulment; we were told that there had been norecent case of the exercise of the power of annulment.1454. In their evidence the Chief Pleas sought no change in the present constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom. Their representativestold us that they had a real fear of the consequences of entry into the european economic Community and had asked to be excluded from any provisionsresulting from entry by the United Kingdom. Sark had managed its own affairs for over 400 years and had always remained solvent. It had at no time receivedgrants from any outside source, not even by way of compensation for war damage.other evidence1455. In addition to that of the Island authorities and the other organisationsalready mentioned, we received evidence from a small number of individuals and organisations in each of the Islands. Some of this evidence related to theinternal affairs of the Islands or to particular problems arising out of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s application to join the European Economic Community,and therefore fell largely outside our terms of reference. We refer here to theremaining evidence in so far as it included proposals of a kind substantiallydifferent from those we have already mentioned.1456. Although we received a few complaints against the administrativeactions of the insular authorities, only one witness in Jersey and one in Guernseyproposed the incorporation of the Islands in the United Kingdom. At the otherextreme, Mec Vannin, a nationalist organisation in the Isle of Man, sought inde-pendence for the Island within the Commonwealth. It argued that the Isle ofMan should have complete freedom to manage its own affairs, on the grounds that Manx people believe in freedom, that limitations of freedom are handicaps
to national integrity and efficient administration, that self-determinationis the accepted right of all free peoples and that the Manx are essentiallydifferent in character and have a language and culture different from the Anglo-Saxons in the dominant south-east part of the United Kingdom. Representa-tives of Mec Vannin when they appeared before us admitted that there was little support in the Island for their views, and that very few people spoke theManx language, including probably only one for whom it was the mothertongue.1457. One witness in Guernsey stressed the importance of Jersey andGuernsey continuing to have similar relationships with the United Kingdom,saying that it would be a matter of the greatest regret if the Islands were to betreated differently. Two witnesses argued that the Channel Islands would be stronger and better able to deal with external pressures if they had a federalform of government. One suggested that Alderney and Sark should become independent Bailiwicks and that there should be changes in the status of theSeigneur of Sark; also that the offices of Lieutenant Governor of Jersey andGuernsey should be abolished and that there should be appointed insteada Warden of the Isles (an office said to have existed in earlier days), who would assume some of the functions of the Lieutenant Governors and preside overa federal committee, which would be a co-ordinating and negotiating body forthe Islands as a whole but have no power of government.1458. Eight witnesses in Alderney submitted a joint memorandum in whichthey stressed the importance of viewing the relationship between the UnitedKingdom and the Channel Islands in its historic perspective. They said thatthe supreme legislative power over the Islands remained vested exclusivelyin the Sovereign and that the legal effectiveness of Acts of Parliament derivednot from their enactment by Westminster but from their application to the islands by the Sovereign as successor to the Dukes of Normandy. they recommended that a Royal Charter should be published declaring that channel islands citizens are personal subjects of the Sovereign and that the imperial parliament has no power to legislate for the Islands. Access by the Islandersto the Sovereign would be through a Committee of the Privy Council consistingof persons nominated by the legislatures of the Islands. This Committee wouldalso be able to advise the Sovereign on internal legislation. Advice on external affairs would be given as now by United Kingdom Ministers after consultationwith the Islands. The memorandum dealt also with the question of membership of the European Economic Community, arguing that as the Channel Islandsare the personal responsibility of the Sovereign and not that of the UnitedKingdom Government, the admission of the United Kingdom would not automatically include the Islands.
CONCLUSIONSintroductionOur approach to the Islands1459. Before we record our conclusions on all these matters, it will be aswell for us to try to express the spirit in which we have approached the channel islands and the Isle of Man. We have been conscious of the fact that, whereas in dealing with the United Kingdom we are all citizens of the country for whoseconstitutional relationships we are prescribing, this is not so in the case of the islands though we would add that we have had opportunities not oftengiven to external bodies of understanding the true nature and actual workingof their systems of government. That system, as we have said, is unique andnot capable of description by any of the usual categories of political science.It is full of anomalies, peculiarities and anachronisms, which even those who work  the system find it hard to define precisely. We do not doubt that more logicaland orderly races than the British would have swept all these away long ago and incorporated the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man into the UnitedKingdom as fully as the Orkney and Shetland Islands (whose position, if theaccidents of history had fallen out differently, might so easily have been thesame as the Isle of Man&apos;s) were incorporated first in the Kingdom ofScotland and then in the United Kingdom.1460. In saying this, we do not mean to begrudge the Islands their indepen-dence. On the contrary, anomalies seem to us to be things that should be,if not encouraged, at least accepted so long so they are cherished by those most directly affected and do no harm to others. We have not approached the Islands in any spirit of reforming zeal. We have found no signs that thiswas the desire of the Government of the United Kingdom, nor did anyonein the Islands accuse the Government of it. There are few grievances of anysubstance. Indeed, if only the constitutional relationships between the UnitedKingdom and the Islands could remain as they have been in recent years(with the possible exception of some small adjustments) everybody would behappy and our task would disappear. If there are difficult problems, thisis solely because of the impact of external events and the rapidly changingnature of the relationships between sovereign states.Relevance of the Treaty of Rome1461. A preliminary word also needs to be said about the Treaty of Rome.Its shadow, cast before, created the arguments we were called upon to consider,and dominated virtually all the evidence we heard in the Islands, at leaston the question of the applicability of treaties, which by common consentwas the most important part of our agenda. Every proposal bearing on theapplication of international agreements to the Islands was tested by the contri-bution it made to the solution of the problems raised by the Treaty. The problem has since been resolved by the successful negotiation by the United Kingdomof special arrangements for the Islands within the European economic community; these arrangements are summarised in paragraph 1532 below.
But that does not mean that we can proceed with our conclusions in disregard of the Treaty. It stands as an example of the grave difficulties that can arise outof the application to the Islands of international treaties accepted by the UnitedKingdom. It may be difficult at present to imagine another such case. But then the Treaty of Rome itself could hardly have been imagined a generation ago.No settlement of the constitutional relationships between the United Kingdomand the Islands can afford to be based on the assumption that what has happenedonce will not happen again.Existing constitutional relationships1462. In considering, as required by our terms of reference, whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships betweenthe United Kingdom and the Islands, it is natural that we should start by attempting to establish what those relationships are. We have noted that thereare areas of uncertainty. The authorities in all the Islands, but not some otherwitnesses, agreed that the United Kingdom Parliament has power to legislate for the Islands, but that the exercise of the power is limited by the convention that Parliament does not legislate without the Islands&apos; consent in respect of purely domestic matters. But what are purely domestic matters ? How bindingis the convention? In what circumstances is it proper for the Royal Assent tobe refused to insular legislation? And what is the scope of the prerogativepower of the Crown to legislate for the Islands by Order in Council ? All thesematters are in doubt or dispute.1463. The first question we had to ask ourselves was whether we should seek to determine these issues and to draw up an authoritative statement of thepresent relationships. The evidence we received on the constitutional historiesof the Islands shows that the issues are complex, and that earlier commissionsor committees of enquiry into Channel Islands constitutional matters expressedviews which were not entirely consistent. The issues could be conclusivelydetermined only by a court of law. It seemed to us in any case that our propertask was not to attempt to adjudicate on the matters in dispute in the existingrelationships, but to consider what in the changed international situation thefuture relationships should be.1464. This did not of course mean that we could ignore the existing relation-ships. Unless there is to be a radical change, any new relationships must growout of the old. With the very few exceptions noted at the end of the last chapter,our witnesses did not propose any radical change. They did not want the Islandsto lose the independence they now enjoy and they were not asking for anygreater measure of independence, except in so far as this might be an incidentalconsequence of formal constitutional change designed only to preserve the islands&apos; existing autonomy in domestic matters. Had there been any substantial body of opinion, within the Islands or outside, discontented with the existing arrangements for their government, we are confident that this would have beenbrought to our notice. As it was, although organisations in both Jersey andGuernsey referred in their evidence to dissatisfaction with some of the policiesadopted in the Islands and attributed this to the undemocratic nature of thelegislative assemblies, they argued only for the retention of the existing links with the United Kingdom as being needed to place some restraint on the exerciseof legislative powers in the Islands and not for any diminution of those powers.
It has been made quite clear to us that all sections of the population of the islands have a great pride in their independence and value it immensely.Incorporation in the United Kingdom, or any other form of close associationinvolving representation in the Parliament at Westminster, is specificallyrejected; and unless at some future date there is a substantial reversal of opinion in the Islands, which at present seems inconceivable, there will be no grounds for considering any such solution.1465. At the same time, the Islanders value no less their link with the crown and have no desire to loosen it; and although we were told in all the Islandsthat the loyalty of the people is to Your Majesty and not to any UnitedKingdom Government, the practical links, both official and unofficial, with theUnited Kingdom are strong, and are tending to increase with the growingcomplexity of affairs and the improved means of communication. Only MecVannin in the Isle of Man, which admitted to having little support for its views,advocated complete independence. But Tynwald, in its evidence, said that its general objective was the evolution of the constitutional relationships betweenthe Isle of Man and the United Kingdom towards more complete self-government; it wished to see established indisputably for the Manx people the right and the principle of self-determination, which it saw as a right, in thelast analysis, to be independent or at least a right to negotiate for independence.Tynwald wished us to endorse its view that this right exists as much for the dependencies which form part of the British Isles as for those further afieldwhich come under the control of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Therepresentatives of Tynwald stressed that the Isle of Man was not seekingcomplete independence at the present time; but they wished it to be recognisedthat the Island had a right at any time to move further in this direction if thatappeared to Tynwald to be necessary in order to preserve its autonomy in domestic matters.1466. We believe that the United Kingdom and Island Governments will always wish, for reasons of sentiment as well as on practical grounds to goto very great lengths to avoid a situation in which any Island would feelimpelled to seek independence. If the Islands were to sever their connexionswith the United Kingdom we have little doubt that they would be presented,in the long term if not immediately, with grave problems. Nor, in spite ofv/ords that are sometimes uttered in the heat of debate, do we believe that thevast majority of the inhabitants of any of the Islands would be prepared,except as a last resort, seriously to contemplate cutting themselves off from that community with the people of the United Kingdom which their present statusenables them to enjoy.1467. Independence was a possibility that the Islands did indeed have toconsider when it became apparent that this was the only alternative to inclusion in the European Economic Community on the terms that had been negotiatedfor them. They were told that in view of the peculiar nature of the Treaty of rome the United Kingdom Government did not wish to impose accessionon them. The only means by which an Island could have been freed of allTreaty obligations would have been by its assumption of independence. Nodoubt some special relationship with the United Kingdom would have been
maintained, but this could have been brought about only by agreement betweensovereign states and, on the United Kingdom&apos;s side, in conformity with itsTreaty obligations.1468. Faced with these alternatives, all the Islands decided in favour of entry into the Community on the special terms, and we have no doubt that they were much relieved that the problem had been resolved in a way which allowed their constitutional relationships with the United Kingdom to continue largely un-disturbed. It was clear from what we were told in the Islands that no substantial change in those relationships is desired. Most people would indeed be happy tosee the old relationships continue if that were possible. It is not dissatisfaction with them, but changes in circumstances in the world outside in which theymust operate, that have necessitated a review. The sensible course, and onewhich will be generally acceptable, will be to preserve as much as possible ofthe existing relationships, adapting them only so far as this is necessary to meetthe new circumstances. Given then that our task was to examine the need foradaptation, it became important, in order to establish the starting point, to formulate our own views on the areas of the existing relationships which werein doubt, even though those views could not be authoritative in the sense thatthey would be binding on anyone else.1469. All our official witnesses accepted that Parliament has power to legislate for the Islands and that, in some matters at least, the exercise of this power is not dependent upon the Islands&apos; consent being given. It has, however,been the practice not to legislate for the Islands without their consent on matters which are of purely domestic concern to them. There has been strict adherence to the practice over a very long period, and it is in this sense that it can be saidthat a constitutional convention has been established whereby Parliament doesnot legislate for the Islands without their consent on domestic matters.1470. It seems worth asking why the convention was established in the firstplace and why it has lasted so long. The answer is surely that it was convenient to both sides that as much as possible of the law governing the Islands shouldbe made in the Islands; the Islands&apos; legislatures were fully competent to dealwith domestic matters and it satisfied the self-reliant spirit in the Islands thatthey should; with few exceptions it was easy to identify domestic matters; andit was sufficient for the United Kingdom&apos;s interest to ensure that, by frequentconsultation and discussion, the Islands&apos; policy did not get seriously out of line with that of the United Kingdom so far as the interests of third countries were concerned. So long as third countries were not concerned in the subject matterof Island government, there was no reason for intervention by the UnitedKingdom.1471. In these circumstances there was until recently no occasion to enquire whether the convention would have the effect in all circumstances of precludingParliament from legislating for the Islands on a domestic matter without their consent. The question of the extent of Parliaments powers hardly arose. when a few years ago it did arise, over the broadcasting issue in the Isle of Man,technical considerations of a novel kind were present, and it was possible to regard the issue as one of determining on which side of a more or less staticborderline the subject fell. But the borderline is now moving as the tendencygrows for international agreements to relate to matters which in the past were
regarded as domestic. It is arguable that any matter which becomes the subjectof international agreement can no longer be regarded as of purely domestic concern and is therefore not covered by the constitutional convention whichlimits the scope of Parliaments action. But whether or not one adopts thissimple view, it is apparent that, with growing international co-operation and mutual dependence, any rule which depends on drawing a distinction betweenmatters which are domestic and those which are not becomes increasingly difficult to apply, if indeed it is not largely meaningless.1472. The conclusion we draw is that despite the existence of the convention,Parliament does have power to legislate for the Islands without their consenton any matter in order to give effect to an international agreement. There appear,in any event, to be good grounds for accepting the more extreme view that if parliament has power to legislate for the Islands at all, which we believe not tobe in doubt, there are no circumstances in which it would be precluded fromexercising this power. Lord Reid, giving judgment in a Southern Rhodesiacase1 before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1968, said: &quot;The learned judges&quot; (in Southern Rhodesia) &quot;refer to the statement ofthe United Kingdom Government in 1961 . . . setting out the convention that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not legislate without theconsent of the Government of Southern Rhodesia on matters within thecompetence of the Legislative Assembly. That was a very importantconvention but it had no legal effect in limiting the legal power ofParliament.It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United kingdom parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliamentchose to do any of them the courts could not hold the Act of Parliamentinvalid. It may be that it would have been thought, before 1965, that itwould be unconstitutional to disregard this convention. But it may alsobe that the unilateral Declaration of Independence released the UnitedKingdom from any obligation to observe the convention. Their lordshipsin declaring the law are not concerned with these matters. They are onlyconcerned with the legal powers of Parliament.&quot;This passage was quoted by the Jersey Constitutional Association in its supple-mentary evidence to us. The Association was drawing attention to theconsequences of conceding that Parliament has any power to legislate forJersey. In none of the Islands do the authorities deny that this power exists in some form, and we were not persuaded by the evidence of the Associationthat it does not.1473. Our own conclusion therefore is that in the eyes of the courts parliament has a paramount power to legislate for the Islands in any circumstances, andwe have proceeded on this assumption. This does not, of course, mean that parliament should be any more ready than in the past to interfere in the Islands&apos;domestic affairs and any less mindful of the need to preserve their autonomy.On the contrary, in the changed international situation greater vigilance may1 Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke (1969 1 Appeal Cases at pp. 722-3).
be needed. But if, exceptionally, circumstances should demand the applicationto the Islands without their consent of measures of a kind hitherto regarded asdomestic, then Parliament would, in our view, have the power to enact thenecessary legislation.international agreements1474. Looking to the future our main concern has been to see if means canbe found of reconciling the Islands&apos; autonomy in domestic matters with theUnited Kingdom&apos;s responsibility for their external relations. We have fully considered the proposals put forward by the Island Governments and otherwitnesses, and have tested the proposals by examination of the witnesses in the islands. We have received from the Home Office and the Foreign and Common-wealth Office comments on the proposals and their own proposals for reducingto a minimum the area of potential conflict, and we have had full discussions with officials of the departments.A new declaration1475. The first proposal put to us in Jersey and the Isle of Man was that theUnited Kingdom Government should make a new international declaration,perhaps similar to the declaration made in 1967 in respect of the West IndiesAssociated States, to the effect that in future any international treaty ratified by the United Kingdom Government without a particular Island being namedwould not apply to that Island. This would restore to the Islands the position which the declaration made in 1950 was intended to secure for them, that theywould not be bound by treaties on which they had not been consulted or which,when they were consulted, they did not wish to have applied to them. the islands told us that they had been led to believe during the course of discussions with the Home Office while the Vienna Convention of 1969 on the Law of treaties was being negotiated that a declaration which would be helpful tothem might be made when the Convention came into operation. When we discussed the matter with them, however, the view of the Home Office andthe Foreign and Commonwealth Office was quite firmly that the difficultiescould not be resolved in that way since they could see no prospect of theproposed new declaration securing international acceptance, without which itwould be of no effect.1476. We have no means of testing this view of the departments. It is certainlytrue that the Islands around the British shores are very different, in terms ofgeography, history and relationships with the United Kingdom, from theWest Indies Associated States. Even if a declaration were to be made and accepted internationally, it would have only limited value. International agree-ment to the exclusion of the Islands from a particular treaty which the UnitedKingdom wished to ratify would not necessarily follow. It should be borne inmind that the inclusion of an Associated State in an international treaty is notdependent on its consent being given, though the State may as an alternative to inclusion terminate its association with the United Kingdom. Moreover thedeclaration would have no effect in relation to a treaty, such as the Treaty of rome, applying in terms to all territories for whose international relations asignatory state has responsibility. For these reasons we do not consider that anew declaration offers a solution to the problem.
Division of responsibility for international relations1477. The next proposal was one put forward by Tynwald that there shouldbe a formal division of responsibility between the United Kingdom and the isle of Man Governments for the Isle of Man&apos;s external relations. On mattersof domestic concern the Isle of Man Government would have responsibility,though it might ask the United Kingdom Government to act on its behalf.While we have some sympathy with the reasoning which prompted the proposal that such an arrangement would demonstrate the United Kingdom&apos;s inability to commit the Isle of Man without its consent to any agreement on a transferredmatter we regard it as wholly impracticable. It attempts to give the Islandwhat we believe would be a novel status in international law, that of a statefully independent for some purposes but not for others. We believe that thearrangement would have no chance of being internationally accepted. It wouldbe seen to be simply a device to permit avoidance of treaty obligations in territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom had at leastpartial responsibility. In any event, because of the difficulty of dividing matters which may become the subject of international agreement into those which areof purely domestic concern and those which are not, it would in our view prove to be unworkable.International opinion1478. There is one basic difficulty about suggestions for general declarations,divisions of responsibility and other devices for enabling the Islands to continueto enjoy a special status in international law which we do not think that theinhabitants of the Islands, including many of those who carry the responsibilityof government, sufficiently appreciate. All would require general acceptance bythe community of nations, and there has been a sharp movement in that community in recent years against all kinds of special status. This has had two distinct impulses. One, to which we have already referred, is the dislike amongthe newly emergent nations of any sort of dependency. The other is illustrated by the main purpose of the Treaty of Rome itself, which is precisely to work towards uniformity of law and administration throughout the territories of itsmember states. The preservation of their special position, which seems sonatural to the people of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and whichthe British people regard with the sympathy born of their long historicalassociation, is not a cause that can always count on support in the internationalarena.responsibility for legislation the Jersey and Isle of Man Bills1479. The proposals for setting formal limits on the power of Parliament to legislate for the Islands also derive principally from the apprehension ofunwelcome obligations being imposed in relation to the Islands as the resultof their being included in a treaty signed by the United Kingdom Government.If there is no legal means of excluding the Islands from the treaty, the argumentgoes, let it at least be for them to decide its legislative implementation.1480. The principal proposal of both the States of Jersey and Tynwald isthat there should be an Act of Parliament making a formal division of legislative and executive responsibilities between the United Kingdom and the Islands.
Each submitted the draft of a Bill to show the kind of measure it had in mind.The broad effect of the proposal is that the United Kingdom Government wouldhave a continuing responsibility for the Islands, and Parliament would havea paramount power to legislate for the Islands, on specified matters only, beingmatters considered to affect the vital interests of the United Kingdom or totranscend the Islands&apos; domestic concerns. The United Kingdom Governmentwould continue to be responsible for the Islands&apos; external relations; butParliament would not be able to legislate to give effect to an international agreement in the Islands without their consent unless the subject matter of theagreement was one for which it possessed paramount powers. The Home Officeand the Foreign and Commonwealth Office found the proposals unacceptablebecause they would leave the United Kingdom Government with responsibilityboth for the good government of the Islands and for their external relations, but without the power needed to exercise that responsibility.Difficulties of principle1481. There would be difficulties both of principle and of detail. The repre-sentatives of the States of Jersey told us that their object in proposing such a statute was not so much to change the existing state of affairs as to crystalliseit in law. But, as we have seen, there is a difference of opinion between theStates of Jersey and the Home Office on what the present position is, and thedifference goes to the heart of the matter. The States of Jersey maintain thatthe right of Parliament, and of the Crown by use of the prerogative, to legislate for Jersey in domestic matters without the consent of the States has, by virtueof centuries of non-use, ceased to exist. The Home Office contends that it isstill there, unused but still usable, and this is the view we have ourselves taken.The draft Bill proposed by the States, though it might not alter the present state of affairs as they see it, would certainly run counter to this view. That,indeed, may be thought to be its main purpose. Clearly, therefore, it would be,to say the least, very difficult to secure agreement on such a Bill, and withoutthe agreement of the United Kingdom Government it would stand no chanceof acceptance by Parliament.Difficulties of detail1482. If this major hurdle could be overcome, there would remain the diffi-culties of detail. The greatest of these would concern the selection and definition of subjects for which the United Kingdom Parliament and Government would retain paramount power. The lists of subjects specified in the Jersey and Isle ofMan Bills are, as we have noted, by no means identical. Though it is possiblethat a case might be made for treating the individual Islands differently in respectof some particular matter, this would be exceptional, and generally one would expect the subjects of continuing concern to the United Kingdom to be thesame in all the Islands.1483. If a decision in principle to have an Act had been taken, it would no doubt be possible to secure agreement on many of the debatable issues.Others would almost certainly cause difficulty. Broadcasting, which Jerseywould leave with the United Kingdom but the Isle of Man would not, is an obvious example in the light of the history of disputes between the UnitedKingdom and Isle of Man Governments over the last few years. A solution
might be found by providing in the Act that the United Kingdom&apos;s paramountpowers should extend only to certain prescribed aspects of broadcasting;similarly in relation to other subjects the areas of the reserved powers wouldbe carefully defined. The departments, however, expressed the view that thepractical difficulties of distinguishing such areas with any degree of precisionfor the purpose of drafting were awesome. Our own enquiries suggest that thiswas by no means an over-statement.1484. A further difficulty arises out of the impossibility of knowing whatnew subjects may have to be legislated for in the future. Earlier legislatorscould not possibly have foreseen the problems that have arisen in the field of broadcasting. From time to time, therefore, the need might arise for additions to the list of reserved matters. But under the arrangements proposed the Actwould include a provision permitting it to be amended only by agreement, andthis could well give rise to difficulty. A possible alternative to the comprehensivelisting of subjects would be to include in the Act a provision in general terms,if appropriate wording could be devised, reserving to the United Kingdompowers over matters transcending the frontiers of the Islands. The extent ofthose powers in relation to a subject not specifically dealt with in the Actwould then in the absence of agreement have to be determined by the courtsor by some other tribunal. The issues that would be likely to arise do not,however, seem to be of a kind which it would be appropriate, even if it were practicable, to have settled purely as a matter of law. And much of the valueof the statute would be lost if it could not be counted upon to provide a certainanswer to any question which might arise.1485. The problem here is very different from the one we have earlierconsidered of drafting a statute conferring powers on a subordinate legislatureand government in part of the United Kingdom. In that case the precise scopeof the powers conferred would be of less importance, since the statutewould itself provide a mechanism for adjustment. Parliament would retainparamount power in all matters and could at any time, by unilateral action if necessary, alter the definition of transferred matters. But in the case of the islands the whole essence of the problem is to define the matters in which parliament would be left without powers in relation to the Islands and toremove from Parliament the ability to alter that definition without the Islands&apos;consent.The position of Parliament1486. Despite these formidable difficulties, if there were to be an agreement on the desirability of having the constitutional relationships enshrined in an act of Parliament, and a readiness on all sides to compromise in order tosecure an agreed draft, a Bill might be prepared. Its enactment would thendepend on the willingness of Parliament to restrict its own powers in relationto the Islands in the way proposed. It might be prepared to do so if advised by the government of the day, but there could be no certainty of this.1487. Another question which arises is whether Parliament could bind itssuccessors not to legislate for the Islands without their consent except in certainprescribed fields. On this Jersey and the Isle of Man, each advised by an eminentconstitutional lawyer, took different views. Jersey thought that it could, though
acknowledged that the matter was not beyond doubt. The Isle of Man accepted that it could not and that enactment of its Bill would in legal theory leaveParliamentary sovereignty unimpaired in all fields. The representatives ofTynwald said that, adapting the language of Section 75 of the Government ofIreland Act 1920, notwithstanding anything contained in the proposed Act, thesupreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom would remainunaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things in the Isle ofMan. But they would not include in the Act a section comparable to Section 75,and they saw the Act as binding future Parliaments, in practice if not in legaltheory, in a way that Parliament has not been bound in relation to NorthernIreland by the provisions of the 1920 Act.1488. Both Jersey and the Isle of Man assume therefore that, whatever theposition might be in law, the proposed enactment would have the desired effectof preventing Parliament from legislating in future in breach of its provisions.We understand that it is one of the most disputed questions in constitutionallaw whether there are any circumstances in which Parliament can restrict thefreedom of its successors to legislate. The legal effect of the enactment oflegislation proposed by the Islands would therefore be uncertain. FutureParliaments might well be tempted, in the face of international pressures or forsome other reason, to legislate for the Islands where the Act purported to preclude their doing so, and the Act might not be so effective an instrument forthe defence of the Islands&apos; interests as they would wish.Effectiveness of proposed legislation1489. The Act could nevertheless be expected, despite its limitations-of doubtful legal effect, with provisions based on compromise and with an element of uncertainty in respect of future developments to give the Islands at least some of the protection they seek for their autonomy in domestic affairs. Itwould introduce an element of rigidity into relations between the UnitedKingdom and the Islands. That would indeed be its purpose. There is at thesame time much to be said for the contrary view, which was put to us by theStates of Guernsey, that the present unwritten relationships have the advantageof flexibility, enabling adjustments and innovations to be made to meet new developments. The loss of this flexibility, and the replacement of a largelyinformal relationship by a more formal one would, we think, to be worthwhilehave to bring some very solid advantages to the Islands.1490. How effective would the new formal constitutional relationships be in achieving their primary object of permitting the Islands to decide whether ornot to become parties to international agreements ratified by the UnitedKingdom? This would depend on the acceptance by other countries of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s inability to incur international obligations in some fields inrespect of territories for whose international relations it was responsible.Probably in relation to most international agreements there would be nodifficulty. But there is no difficulty now in the great majority of agreementsentered into by the United Kingdom, with the Islands choosing whether or notto become parties to them. It would be only in relation to the relatively small number of agreements where difficulty may arise under the existing relationshipsthat the effectiveness of the new formal relationships would be tested. In such
cases the United Kingdom Government would presumably have to attempt, by securing the inclusion in the treaty of an optional territorial application clause,or by making reservations at the stage of ratification, to give effect to the islands&apos; wishes.1491. The following questions then arise. Should the United KingdomGovernment be placed in the position of being obliged to press for internationalacceptance of terms which it regards as unreasonable? Would the Islands&apos;legislative independence strengthen the hands of the United Kingdom Govern-ment in negotiating international agreements on their behalf? And what would happen if the United Kingdom Government failed to secure acceptance of the islands&apos; wishes and the Islands remained adamant?1492. To the first question we think the answer is undoubtedly that theUnited Kingdom Government should not be placed in such a position. To give an extreme example, it would be intolerable for it to be obliged to press onbehalf of one of the Islands for exclusion from an international agreement on human rights if it were not satisfied that there were good grounds for the exclusion. It must be doubted also whether much reliance could be placed onthe Islands&apos; changed status to secure international compliance with theirwishes. Other countries would be under no compulsion to agree to the;r exclusion from a treaty or to make special provision for them. If there appeared to be no good case for not applying to the Islands a treaty to which the United Kingdomwished to adhere, the United Kingdom Government would be under pressure tobring the Islands in with it. The alternatives for the United Kingdom might,as now, be to remain outside the agreement or to bring the Islands in on thesame terms or with such differences as were regarded as internationally accept-able. If the United Kingdom Government considered it to be in the UnitedKingdonfs interests to go in, it would again be intolerable that this should be prevented by the inability to secure the agreement of the Islands.1493. It was represented to us that there were many precedents, in countries with a federal type of constitution, for the situation in which powers of theUnited Kingdom Government in external matters affecting the Islands wouldnot be coextensive with those of the United Kingdom Parliament, and that therewas no reason to think that difficulties would arise in practice no matter howanomalous the situation might appear in theory. In our view, however, thecircumstances are by no means comparable. The range of independent powersenjoyed by the provinces in a federation is less (for example, in respect oftaxation and customs) than those enjoyed by the Islands; so therefore, is thescope for disagreement on a matter which is to become the subject of aninternational agreement. Within a federation, too, internal pressures to produceagreement can more easily be brought to bear. In the case of the United Statesof America the constitution specifically provides that all treaties made underthe authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, over-riding anything in the constitution or laws of any state. The Islands are not seeking a federal relationship with the United Kingdom. They have a wish toretain a very much greater degree of independence and the ability to adoptdifferent policies to an extent that would not be practicable within a federation.The risk of conflict is potentially greater.
Our conclusion on the proposed legislation1494. Our firm conclusion is that the formal division of legislative and executive responsibilities between the United Kingdom and Island authoritiesdoes not provide a solution to the problem of maintaining the Islands&apos; autonomyin domestic affairs while preserving the essential domestic and internationalinterests of the United Kingdom. Even if the formidable difficulties of draftingcould be overcome to the satisfaction of the United Kingdom and IslandGovernments so far as concerned their own domestic relationships, it wouldnot overcome the potential difficulties in the international field. So long as theUnited Kingdom remains responsible for the international relations of the islands it must have powers in the last resort to secure compliance in the Islandswith international agreements. We see no possibility of circumventing this by making a division of responsibility for international relations; the UnitedKingdom&apos;s ultimate responsibility, if it is to be retained, must extend over thewhole field of government.1495. It is perhaps worth noting that even if the United Kingdom ceased tobe responsible for the international relations of the Islands and they were tobecome independent, their freedom of action would still be constrained by their membership of the international community and the need to adapt their policies to political and economic circumstances outside the Islands, including the policies of their very much more powerful neighbours. In the particular case ofthe Treaty of Rome, by which, as we have said, all arguments had to be tested,the total exclusion of the Islands from the Community, with its consequences of tariff and possibly migration and other barriers between them and the UnitedKingdom, would have set them problems different from those posed by totalinclusion, but hardly less severe.1496. It follows from our conclusion on the proposed legislation that we regard as unacceptable Tynwald&apos;s suggestion that it should have the power to revoke extensions of United Kingdom legislation to the Isle of Man and, inso far as it relates to the proposal for a division of legislative competence, thesuggestion that there should be a division of Island legislation into that forwhich Royal Assent would be given as now by submission to Your Majesty inCouncil and that for which Royal Assent would be given by the LieutenantGovernor under delegated powers. Provision for the grant of Royal Assent bythe Lieutenant Governor would not be open to objection in principle if machinerywere to be devised, as was done in the case of Northern Ireland under the 1920constitution, for reserving a Bill for the signification of Your Majesty&apos;s pleasurewhen this was desired. We doubt, however, whether such an arrangement wouldmake a significant contribution to the efficient despatch of business.the relationships in practice1497. Although we have thus felt constrained to return a negative answer tothe main proposals put before us by Jersey, Alderney and the Isle of Man, andin doing so to agree with the views of Guernsey and Sark, it does not in theleast follow that we are lacking in sympathy with the Islands in the positionin which they find themselves. It is not from any lack of willingness to help thatwe reach our conclusion, but from the facts of the international situation as wellas from the inherent difficulties of providing a legislative solution. Nor, within
the firm lines of the conclusion in principle, must it be assumed that there is noscope for practical measures to lubricate the relationships and to amelioratethe consequences for the Islands. To these we now turn.Rights and obligations1498. The first point we would make is that both the United Kingdom andthe Islands have not only rights but also obligations towards each other. the islands have a right to respect for their autonomy in domestic affairs and to the observance by Parliament of the convention that it does not in the ordinary course legislate for the Islands without their consent on such matters. Butcoupled with this is an obligation to give all reasonable assistance and co-operation to the United Kingdom authorities in the exercise of their domestic and international responsibilities. The United Kingdom authorities, for their part, have a right to expect this co-operation and in the last resort to interveneif it is not given and intervention is necessary to safeguard their own essential interests. In turn they have the obligation to give all reasonable assistance to the islands, to respect their autonomy and to work for its preservation.Circumstances justifying the exercise of the United Kingdom&apos;s paramount powers1499. This statement, in the most general terms, will probably not be dis-puted except by those who believe, which we do not, that it is practicable to define an area of domestic affairs in which the Islands&apos; autonomy should beabsolute. One can give a little more precision to it by examining rather more closely the circumstances in which the United Kingdom should be free inpractice to exercise its paramount powers. We suggest that they may be con-sidered under five headings (i) defence, (ii) matters of common concern toBritish people throughout the world, (iii) the interests of the Islands, (iv) theinternational responsibilities of the United Kingdom and (v) the domesticinterests of the United Kingdom. We would stress our view that an element ofopinion and of political judgement may sometimes enter into a decision whetheror not the exercise of paramount powers is justified, and that the question isnot one that can be properly determined by a court of law or by any other independent tribunal by the application of a body of established principles.Our five headings are not intended to be definitive and they are not mutuallyexclusive; they are suggested merely for convenience.(j) Defence1500. Both the Jersey and Isle of Man draft Bills make provision for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s paramount powers to be exercised in relation to defence, and,following the terms of the West Indies Act 1967, avoid the difficulty of definitionby leaving it to the United Kingdom to decide whether or not a particularmatter relates to defence.(ii) Matters common to British people throughout the world1501. The Islands accept also that there is a category of matters, which inthe Tynwald evidence are referred to as matters common to British peoplethroughout the world, to which the United kingdom&apos;s  paramount powers should extend. Both the Jersey and Isle of Man draft Bills include Succession to the throne and the Royal Style and Titles; the Isle of Man draft includes also
nationality and citizenship. Although there is room for differences of opinionabout the range of matters to be included in this category, its general scope is fairly clear; it embraces all matters in which uniformity of policy is essentialthroughout Your Majesty&apos;s territories. In the Stonham Working Party theSouthern Rhodesia Act 1965 was cited as an example. The Act, which declaredSouthern Rhodesia to be part of Your Majesty&apos;s dominions and empowered the privy Council to make orders for various purposes connected with SouthernRhodesia, had been applied to the Islands not by virtue of an Order in Councilbut by express provision applying it to all Your MajestyS possessions. The isle of Man, while conceding that uniformity of legislation was desirable, had represented that Tynwald should instead have been given the opportunity topass legislation of its own. Although the difference between the United Kingdomand Isle of Man Governments in this instance was one of means rather thanends, the case does serve to illustrate the difficulties that would attend anyattempt to make a statutory division of legislative responsibilities. We do notbelieve that in practice, however, given goodwill on both sides, any seriousdifferences are likely to arise in relation to matters falling under this generalheading.(iii) The interests of the Islands1502. The Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office listed as one of the considerations having a particular bearing on proposals for changein the constitutional relationships the ultimate responsibility of the Crown forthe good government of the Islands. In this respect they regarded the Islandsas being in a category apart from all other dependencies of the Crown; sincethe British Islands are an entity in the eyes of the world, the United KingdomGovernment would be held responsible internationally if practices in the Islandswere to overstep the limits of acceptability. The States of Jersey maintained thatParliaments powers to legislate for the Islands other than at the request of theStates should be exercisable only in the event of grave internal disruption. Forthe Isle of Man, Tynwald acknowledged that the United Kingdom government must have a power of intervention in pursuance of its ultimate responsibilityfor good government. There is room for difference of opinion on the circum-stances in which it would be proper to exercise that power. Intervention wouldcertainly be justifiable to preserve law and order in the event of grave internaldisruption. Whether there are other circumstances in which it would be justifiedis a question which is so hypothetical as in our view not to be worth pursuing.We think that the United Kingdom Government and Parliament ought to bevery slow to seek to impose their will on the Islands merely on the grounds thatthey know better than the Islands what is good for them; there is ample evidence in the differences between United Kingdom and Island legislation in socialmatters to show that this policy has in fact been followed for very many years.(iv) International responsibilities1503. The fourth heading of circumstances justifying the United Kingdomsintervention in the domestic affairs of the Islands concerns internationalresponsibilities. We have already discussed this matter fully. In summary our views are as follows. A claim by one of the Islands for exclusion from aninternational agreement or for special terms must be reasonable in all thecircumstances. The Islands cannot expect, without very good cause, to be excluded from an agreement which lays down minimum standards of conduct
or if exemption would seriously damage the object of the agreement or preventthe United kingdom&apos;s  participation in it. But if the Islands take up and, afterconsultation, maintain a position which is not untenable or unreasonable, theUnited Kingdom Government should, we think, attempt to secure its inter-national acceptance, even though this may make the Governmenfs negotiating position more difficult.1504. It must be accepted, however, that circumstances may arise in which an international agreement will be applied to the Islands against their wishesand that this may come about through no fault of the United KingdomGovernment, which may have tried but failed to secure acceptance of the islands&apos; views. If in such a case legislation needed to implement the agreement in the Islands is of a kind which would ordinarily be enacted by the Islandlegislatures, then the Islands should, unless the matter is of great urgency, begiven the opportunity to enact that legislation. Only in the event of theirunwillingness or failure to do so should United Kingdom legislation be applied.If, in a particular case, the implementation of an international agreement were considered to impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the Islands,we do not see why arrangements should not be made for United Kingdomassistance to be given; but this would be a matter for separate negotiation andnot a condition of legislation if legislation were needed to implement theagreement.(v) The protection of the United Kingdom &apos;s domestic interests1505. The need for intervention in the affairs of the Islands under the last of our five headings, to protect the United kingdom&apos;s  domestic interest in theabsence of international treaty obligations, is likely to be rare. But relationshipsare so close that it would be possible for practices to develop in the Islands,particularly in the commercial field, that would be detrimental to the well-being of the British Islands as a whole. The possibility that intervention in the affairs of the Islands to protect United Kingdom interests may be needed has therefore to be envisaged.1506. The Isle of Man has already seen this as a problem. Its proposals fora division of legislative competence between Parliament and Tynwald, and fora division of insular legislation for the purposes of signifying the Royal Assent,were in part at least directed to ensuring that the United Kingdom Governmentcould not, to suit its own domestic purposes, arbitrarily set the dividing line between the domestic affairs of the Isle of Man and those which transcend the frontiers of the Island. Its concern, as we have earlier noted, arises largely fromdissatisfaction with actions taken in recent years by the United KingdomGovernment in the field of broadcasting, and we can best express our own views under this fifth heading by reference to events in this field.Lessons of the disputes on broadcasting1507. Although the broadcasting issue is in many ways unique none of our witnesses could think of another subject which would be likely to present suchcomplex problems affecting the relationships between the United Kingdom andIsland Governments it provides an interesting case study of the practical application of those relationships, in both the international and the domesticfields, and some conclusions of more general application can be drawn from it.
1508. The brief account we have given in paragraphs 1421-1429 of theprotracted disputes on broadcasting matters shows that the United KingdomGovernment has sought both to comply with its international obligations andto protect the United kingdom&apos;s  domestic interests. Indeed the two have,perhaps inevitably, been intermingled, and it has not always been clear on whatground the Government was purporting to act. In the dispute on Manx Radioit insisted on keeping in its own hands the control of frequencies which isrequired by international agreement, and it refused on domestic grounds toallow Manx Radio to operate with such power as would allow its programmes to be received on a regular basis in any part of the United Kingdom. In thepirate broadcasting issue the need to ensure compliance with the Europeanagreement to suppress unlicensed stations may have been the paramount con-sideration, but there was also a domestic interest in ensuring that stationswhose programmes would be received in the United Kingdom could not besupplied and serviced in the Isle of Man.1509. As regards international agreements, the Isle of Man has not, at leastafter the rejection of its initial request for a licence to broadcast to Europe,sought to operate in breach of international regulations and has been preparedto undertake, if given its own powers of licensing, to ensure the observance of those regulations. The question arises whether it would be practicable toexercise all the necessary controls if the United Kingdom and Isle of ManGovernments shared the licensing powers, as the Isle of Man has proposed.This is mainly a technical question which we are not competent to answer;but as the United Kingdom has to work with the limited number of frequenciesallocated by the International Telecommunications Union for use in the british islands as a whole, we can see that there may be advantage in keeping theallocation and control of frequencies in the hands of the responsible UnitedKingdom Minister (as the Channel Islands have accepted) and that any arrange-ment for shared control might indeed be impracticable. So far as the piratebroadcasting issue is concerned, the United Kingdom Government appears, in applying the United Kingdom Act to the Isle of Man, to have acted in accordancewith the principles which we have suggested as being appropriate to theapplication of international agreements.1510. If the allocation and control of frequencies does remain in UnitedKingdom hands, there is a clear obligation to provide for the reasonable require-ments of the Islands, that is, to see that they get their fair share of availablefrequencies. The main dispute with the Isle of Man has concerned the refusal to permit broadcasts from the Island to be receivable on a regular basis in anypart of the United Kingdom. Tynwald claims that this restriction, imposed onlyto protect the United kingdom&apos;s  domestic interests and not necessary for inter-national purposes, is in breach of the conventions governing the constitutionalrelationship. Placing a somewhat unexpected interpretation on the phrase&quot;transcending the frontiers of the Island&quot;, it maintains that the UnitedKingdom Governments powers of intervention in the Island, so far as they exist, are restricted to matters which affect states outside the British Islands,and that the Isle of Man constitutionally has complete freedom to do anything which is not in conflict with international obligations, no matter what theconsequences might be for other parts of the British Islands.
1511. This view of the United Kingdom&apos;s paramount powers appears to usto be altogether too restrictive. It would not, for example, seem to be sensiblethat a state should enter into a series of international agreements designed topromote mutual interests, and then be unable to protect its own interests againstthe action of a semi-autonomous community for whose international relationsit was responsible. While relations between the United Kingdom and the islands are not directly affected by international agreements, the content ofsuch agreements ought properly to be regarded as a factor to be taken intoaccount in determining what those relations should be. For the rest, the nature and extent of the intervention by the United Kingdom in its own interestsin the affairs of the Islands must be a matter of judgement, weighing the potentialdamage to United Kingdom interests against the invasion of the Islands&apos;autonomy. In striking this balance, it seems to us that the United kingdom should be very careful not to confuse its essential interests with its ownconvenience and preference or the damage to those essential interests withmere irritation or annoyance.1512. It is not for us to express a view on whether the stand taken by theUnited Kingdom Government in relation to broadcasting from the Isle of Manis or is not in all the circumstances a reasonable one. Decisions in matters ofthis kind, as we have said, have to be taken not by application of a rigid set of rules but in the light of political judgement. The history of the dispute does,however, point to the importance of identifying and specifying clearly theinternational obligation or essential United Kingdom interest which is to be safeguarded when intervening in Island affairs or refusing to meet Islandrequests. From what we have been told, it seems possible that this has not alwaysbeen done with certainty or consistency in the matter of broadcasting.Our conclusions on the exercise of paramount powers1513. We have considered under five headings defence, matters of common concern to British people throughout the world, the interests of the Islands, theinternational responsibilities of the United Kingdom and the domestic interestsof the United Kingdom the circumstances in which in practice it would be proper for the United Kingdom to exercise its paramount powers. We believethat, with recognition on each side of the rights and obligations of the other,including obligations in the international field, most matters can be satisfactorilyarranged. Nevertheless, the hard core of difficulty remains. Accepting that thenumber of cases of real difficulty will in any event be very few, and that thenumber that will not yield to treatment by the established methods, expandedand improved in the ways the United Kingdom government departments have proposed, will be even fewer, we must face the fact that cases where there is anirreconcilable conflict of view may still arise. In such cases we are firmly of theopinion that the United Kingdom Government has, and should retain, the rightto decide, and that Parliament has, and should retain, the right in the last resort to legislate for the Islands.the settlement of disputesA proposal for a Standing Committee1514. As we have reached this firm conclusion, it seems to us to be all themore necessary to review and if possible improve the machinery for ensuring
that as few matters as possible ideally, none at all reach this last resort.We received a good deal of evidence relating to the machinery for consultation between the United Kingdom and the Islands and for the resolution of disputes.1515. Serious disputes in the past have been rare and we have no doubt thatin future solutions will continue to be found by informal consultation to thevast majority of the problems that arise. In the case of the Isle of Man, as wehave seen, the informal processes have been reinforced, in accordance with a recommendation of the Stonham Working Party, by the establishment of a formal standing committee. The States of Jersey would like to see a similarcommittee established for that Island.1516. At the time our enquiries were made, it was too early to assess the contribution which the Isle of Man Committee may be able to make to ironingout any difficulties in relations between the Island and the United Kingdom.The report of the Stonham Working Party shows that when the establishment ofthis Committee was first mooted the Home Office representatives thought thatany value it might have would be marginal. It is true that there are potentialdisadvantages in the introduction of formal machinery of this kind. Because itexists, people will want to use it. Any tendency to place less reliance on the informal channels carries the risk of rendering those channels less fruitful.Difficulties may tend to be magnified. Business may be transacted more slowlybut with no greater certainty. The departments have pointed out that wheninternational agreements are being negotiated speed is often essential.1517. Despite these considerations we believe that there would be value in having some formal machinery for consultation. In recent years there has beena notable increase in the number of matters which have not been easily resolvedthrough the normal informal channels of communication. The increase is attributable to the growing complexity of domestic administration and thegreater international involvement in affairs formerly regarded as purely domestic.These trends are likely to continue. Relations with the European economic community alone are likely to throw up many problems which will not be quickly or easily resolved. The ability to refer them to a formal negotiating bodymay be helpful. And as the questions for consideration will generally be of concern to all the Islands we recommend the establishment of a standingconsultative committee on which the Governments of the United Kingdom andof all the Islands are represented. We believe that there would be advantage in having a single committee rather than a separate committee for each Island.The committee would be empowered to consider matters referred to it by anyof the governments concerned, which would generally be matters on which agreement could not be reached through the normal processes of informalconsultation, and it would have a general responsibility to keep under reviewrelations between the United Kingdom and the Islands. It would be able toappoint sub-committees to consider particular matters, including matters of concern to one Island only.A proposal for a Council of the Islands1518. We believe that a committee of this kind, used to supplement but notto replace consultation through the normal channels, would be found to serve a useful purpose. But whatever procedures there may be for consultation
between the United Kingdom and the Islands on matters of common concern,and however great may be the willingness to reach agreement, cases may arise in which the United Kingdom Government will feel impelled to act against thewishes of one or more of the Islands. The question therefore arises as to thenature of the machinery, if any, which should exist for hearing appeals against decisions of the United Kingdom Government. Under existing arrangements,as we have seen, there is a right of petition to the Crown. Petitions are referredto a Committee of the Privy Council which is made up of United kingdom ministers. This is regarded, particularly in the Isle of Man in the light of recent experience over the pirate broadcasting issue, as unsatisfactory in that, ineffect, the same body acts as court of initial judgement and court of appeal.Suggestions for constituting the Committee of the Privy Council in somedifferent way were regarded by the Home Office as unacceptable. In the view ofthe department, so long as the United Kingdom Government has responsibility in relation to the Islands it cannot surrender the final power of decision (on amatter of policy and not one of interpretation of law, which would be appro-priate for judicial determination) to a body over which it has no control, no matter how responsible that body may be. We have no hesitation in saying thatthis view must be accepted. In any petition to the Crown the point at issue islikely to be of such importance that the final decision cannot properly be takenother than on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers.1519. We nevertheless have sympathy with the view that the existing arrange-ment is not entirely satisfactory, and we believe that there would be advantage in introducing an independent element into the consideration of a disputedmatter before the final decision was taken by the Privy Council. This independentelement could have only an advisory function, and we consider that it could best be provided through the appointment of independent members to the consultative committee we have proposed.1520. Our idea is that this body, which might be designated &quot;The Council ofthe Islands&quot;, would be composed of a chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Crown, up to six representatives of the UnitedKingdom Government and six representatives of the Islands. Its independentposition would be emphasised if the members of its secretariat were not them-selves officials of the Home Office or of any of the Island Governments. Withcontinued reliance for day-to-day business on the informal channels of com-munication which have proved so effective in the past, the Council would notbe much concerned with routine affairs. Its primary role, as we have suggested,would be to keep relationships between the United Kingdom and the Islandsunder review and to seek to find solutions to the more difficult questions referred to it.1521. If in any particular matter an agreed solution could not be reached inthe Council and the United Kingdom found it necessary to take action in theabsence of agreement, it would be open to the aggrieved authorities in anyIsland to petition the Crown. Or there might be a petition on an Island matterfrom some aggrieved person or persons other than the authorities. There wouldbe an understanding that in the ordinary course any such petition would bereferred to the Council for its opinion (though the Privy Council could not be under a legal obligation to refer a petition, and United Kingdom ministers might exceptionally have to advise against a reference if in the exercise of their
overriding responsibilities they considered, for example, that time did not permit or that the procedure was being abused). The Council would make areport on the petition to the Privy Council, and in the absence of securityconsiderations this report would be published. In any case arising out of action taken by the United Kingdom Government against the wishes of one or more of the Islands a report containing a unanimous recommendation could not beexpected. The matter would probably already have been considered by theCouncil at an earlier stage without agreement being reached. The report wouldthen set out the relevant facts, the views of the two sides and the assessment ofthe independent members with any recommendations they might wish to make.1522. In making their assessment, the independent members would in no way be acting as a court of law. They would not have a detailed set of rules toapply. But they would have a statement of the constitutional relationships between the United Kingdom and the Islands, based perhaps, if it is accepted,on the statement contained in this report, with all its reservations, of thecircumstances in which the United Kingdom should be free in practice toexercise its paramount powers. If then the United Kingdom claimed that theaction against which complaint was made was being taken, for example, to preserve an essential domestic interest of the United Kingdom, this claim andthe likely implications of failure to take such action could be examined. by virtue of their membership of the Council and their participation in its work asa consultative body, the independent members would acquire a better under-standing of the relationships between the United Kingdom and the Islands thanthey would have if they were called upon to advise only in respect of disputedmatters which became the subject of petitions to the Privy Council; and it is forthis reason that we suggest that the functions of providing formal machineryfor consultation and of giving advice on petitions should be combined in asingle body rather than be exercised by two separate bodies.1523. How effective would the Council of the Islands be in safeguarding theinterests of the Islands? The United Kingdom Ministers would still have thelast word. But the presence of the independent members might in some casesassist in securing agreement on a disputed matter. The United kingdom representatives on the Council might be induced to give way if they did nothave the support of the independent members. They would know that if they decided against the Islands and the matter became the subject of a petition tothe Privy Council which was referred to the Council of the Islands for its opinion, the independent members would be likely to reiterate their support forthe Islands in a report which would be made public before the Privy Council&apos;decision was taken. If in this report the independent members recommended acertain course of action, the Privy Council might be expected to reject it only for some demonstrably compelling reason. Conversely, if in any dispute theindependent members tended to support the United Kingdom Government, the likelihood of a petition to the Crown against its decision would be much reduced.Thus petitions, of which there have been very few in the past, might be expectedto become even more infrequent. And where an aggrieved Island or other bodyor individual did have recourse to petition, it would have the satisfaction, evenif the petition were rejected, at least of knowing that before that position wasreached the matter had been given a full and impartial hearing.
1524. We have not discussed this suggestion for the establishment of a council of the Islands which would include independent members with any ofthe Island authorities. We believe, however, that it goes as far as is practicable in constitutional terms to meet the quite legitimate criticism of the existing arrangements for the resolution of disputed matters. We recommend, therefore,that the United Kingdom and Island Governments should together considerwhether a scheme of this kind should be adopted.crown appointments1525. The remaining proposals put to us by the Islands relate to Crownappointments. They were that the consultation which now takes place on the selection of persons for appointment should be formalised; that in Jersey the selection, except in the case of the Lieutenant Governor, should be effectively in the hands of the insular authorities; and that in the Isle of Man the attorney general should be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. None of the proposal is prompted by a sense of grievance, and it is not thought likely that their adoptionwould lead to different persons being appointed. They are designed to ensurethat consultation is not overlooked and to demonstrate to the world at largethe Islands&apos; independence.1526. We do not feel able to support these proposals. We do not think itwould be consistent with the responsibility of the Crown for the good govern-ment of the Islands for the insular authorities to have the last word in theappointment to Crown offices. It is clearly essential for the Islands to be con-suited, as is now the practice, before appointments are made. And where anIslander is to be appointed, as is generally the case with offices other than thatof Lieutenant Governor, the advice of the insular authorities will naturallyweigh very heavily in the selection. Acceptance of the Islands&apos; proposals wouldprobably therefore, as they suggest, make little or no difference in practice.But in our view, which was shared by the representatives of the States ofGuernsey who gave evidence, it will be preferable for appointments to be madeoutside the Islands and for advice to remain informal than to be formalised ina body of elected persons who might be swayed to some extent by political considerations. And if the giving of advice were to be restricted (as we under-stood the Jersey proposals to imply) to such persons, other individuals whoseadvice might be valuable would be excluded.1527. On the proposal put to us by private organisations in Jersey andGuernsey for splitting the office of Bailiff, we take the same view as the privy council Committee of 1947. Although an arrangement under which one personpresides over both the Royal Court and the legislative assembly may be con-sidered to be contrary to good democratic principle and to be potentially opento abuse, it appears in practice to have some advantages and not to have givengrounds for complaint; and as the office of Bailiff is an ancient and honourableone which the States in each Island wish to see continued with its present range of functions, we see no reason for recommending a change.economic relationshipsExisting relationships1528. Our terms of reference covered economic as well as constitutionalrelationships. We have already noted the main features of the financial and
economic relationships. The Islands are self-financing, paying for their own needs out of their own revenues. But, as the Home Office pointed out inevidence, they are inevitably dependent on the United Kingdom for theprovision of many services ranging from defence to the accommodation inthe United Kingdom of some prisoners sentenced by the Island courts-that itwould be uneconomic or impossible for such small communities to furnishfrom their own resources. In general the Islands either pay for these services orprovide reciprocal benefits. But the Channel Islands make no contribution to thecost of defence or international representation, while the Isle of Man makes a payment that falls well short of a proportionate share1. The Islands have their own fiscal systems, but are treated as part of the United Kingdom forexchange control purposes. They are independent customs areas, though the isle of Man, but not the Channel Islands, is by agreement in customs union with the United Kingdom.1529. All the Islands have a pride in their financial independence and prosperity, the maintenance of which in their view requires the continuation ofa policy of low taxation. Hence their deep concern at the time of our visits,on a practical as well as theoretical plane, about the potential loss of indepen-dence which would follow their entry with the United Kingdom into theEuropean Economic Community.The European Economic Community1530. All the Islands believed that entry into the Community would do graveharm to their economies unless special terms were negotiated for them. Theharmonisation of taxation within the Community, indirect taxes at first andpossibly direct taxes later, would deprive them of their favourable tax position.The introduction of a value added tax would increase the cost of imports,which greatly outweigh exports and bear high transport costs because of the geographical situation of the Islands. There would be no corresponding benefit in increased revenues from exports; the smaller Islands in particular would suffer (we were told in Alderney that the only export the Island could claim was empty bottles). The Islands would lose their present preferential position,by comparison with other countries of the Community, of being able to sendtheir agricultural produce into the United Kingdom duty free. There would bea substantial increase in food prices as a result of the Community&apos;s common agricultural policy. Additional burdens would result from Community pro-visions on freedom of movement, right of establishment and reciprocity of social service benefits. All these changes would combine to increase the cost ofliving for residents and to make the Islands less attractive to tourists and newresidents, and would lead eventually to depopulation.1531. The smaller Islands of Alderney and Sark regarded the prospect of entry into the Community as ruinous. But all the Islands were seriously con-cerned. They recognised that they would also be in difficulty if they were outsidethe Community with the United Kingdom in, and wished to have special arrangements made for them. Even Guernsey, which proposed no change inconstitutional relationships and accepted that if the United Kingdom joined the Community the Island would probably have to do so also, had represented the need to be cushioned against the immediate impact of entry.
1532. As we have earlier noted, special terms were in fact negotiated for the islands, which were accepted by them and included in the Treaty of Accessionproviding for the United Kingdom^ entry into the European Communities.Under these terms the Islands are included within the European economic community for the purpose of free movement of industrial and agriculturalgoods. To that end they are required to apply the common external tariff, theagricultural levies to imports from third countries and certain parts of thecommon agricultural policy. Other provisions of the Treaty of Rome, including those relating to the free movement of persons, capital movements, and theharmonisation of taxation and social policies, do not apply to them. As well asbeing relieved of some obligations under the Treaty, the Islands are deprived ofsome of the benefits; in particular, Islanders who do not possess close ties withthe United Kingdom have no rights of free movement, for purposes of employ-ment and right to establishment, within Community countries, although theymaintain their traditional rights of free access to the United Kingdom labour market. Under a non-discrimination clause all Community persons and bodiescorporate have to be given parity of treatment by the Island authorities; if, forinstance, the Islands wish to maintain controls over the employment of aliens,including people from Community countries, it will be necessary for them toapply those controls to people from the United Kingdom also. Lastly, there isa safeguard clause providing for the application of special measures should either the Islands or the Community encounter difficulties in applying the special arrangements; this clause could not be used to impose provisions entirelyoutside the scope of the agreement.Tax havens1533. Apart from the many references to the European Economic Community,we received little evidence on finance and economic matters, and no proposals from the United Kingdom or Island Governments for change in the existingeconomic relationships. There are, however, two matters to which public attention has from time to time been drawn as possibly calling for action by theUnited Kingdom Government, and it is appropriate that we should commentupon them. The first concerns the use of the Islands as tax havens, and thesecond the so-called imperial contribution, an annual contribution towards thecost of defence, overseas representation and any other services supplied by theUnited Kingdom to the Islands which are not paid for or reciprocated in someother way.1534. Interest has been expressed in the use of the Islands as tax havens by united Kingdom residents taking advantage of the comparatively low rates oftaxation. The Islands are not unique in offering this advantage. Some countriesin other parts of the world either levy no tax at all or offer other advantages which may for some people make them preferable to the Islands as tax havens.The Islands do, however, offer certain advantages in their proximity to theUnited Kingdom, their treatment as part of the United Kingdom for exchange control purposes and the presence of British banks and financial institutions.1535. In our general conclusions about the constitutional relationships between the Islands and the United Kingdom, we have endorsed the spirit ofco-operative independence which has been the general basis of those relation-ships for many years. We have said that legislation on domestic matters should
in the ordinary circumstances continue to be the province of the Islandlegislatures, and taxation has always been regarded as a domestic matter.It follows that, subject to any obligations arising out of international agree-ments, the taxes imposed in the Islands, and the levels of those taxes, willremain a matter for the Islands to decide. Implicit in this situation is the oppor-tunity for abuse; but the United Kingdom taxation authorities have amplestatutory powers to deal with such abuse. A person who makes artificial useof the Islands or any other tax haven for the purpose of avoiding UnitedKingdom tax lays himself open to counteraction by the authorities. given that the situation is one which flows from a constitutional position which both sides accept, it is a matter for good sense and co-operation between theUnited Kingdom and Island Governments to ensure that any loss of tax tothe United Kingdom Exchequer is kept to the minimum.Imperial contributions1536. An attempt was made by the United Kingdom Government after theFirst World War to require imperial contributions to be paid by Jersey andGuernsey. This attempt was successfully resisted by the Islands on the groundthat any contribution must be a purely voluntary one. They argued thatcontributions would have to be paid out of taxation; the imposition by theUnited Kingdom Government of an annual charge would amount to theimposition of taxation, whereas for many centuries the Islands had enjoyed,by grant of charter and by usage, freedom from taxation without the consentof the States. This argument did not preclude the payment of voluntary con-tributions, and both Islands did make a once-for-all voluntary payment to theUnited Kingdom Exchequer as a final contribution to the cost of the war.1537. It seems clear to us that any new contributions by the Channel Islands,whether annual or not, or any change in the contribution made by the Isle ofMan, should be made on the same voluntary basis. The value to the Islands ofthe services concerned, mainly defence and overseas representation, is notquantifiable, at least with any degree of precision, and any attempt to estimatewhat the level of contributions, if any, should be would have to take into account the Islands&apos; capacity to pay. In our view, if this matter is to be pursued at all itshould be by means of direct discussion between the United Kingdom and IslandGovernments. We express no view on whether contributions should be made or,if so, what amounts might be appropriate.Our conclusions on economic relationships1538. We have not, as we stated at the beginning of this chapter, approached the Islands in any spirit of reforming zeal, and we have not thought it right to go out of our way to make searching enquiry into matters on which we received no evidence of need for change. Apart from these two questions the use ofthe Islands as tax havens and the imperial contribution, neither of which wewere invited to take up and the all-important question of the position of the islands in relation to the European Economic Community, our attention hasnot been drawn to any aspect of the Islands&apos; financial and economic relationships with the United Kingdom, and we make no recommendations for change.
summary of conclusions and recommendations1539. Our main conclusions and recommendations are as follows:(1) Although an authoritative pronouncement on aspects of the existingconstitutional relationships which are in dispute could be made only bya court of law, we have proceeded on the assumption, which appears tous to be a correct one, that Parliament does possess an ultimate para-mount power to legislate for the Islands on all matters and in any circumstances, despite the existence of the convention that it does notlegislate for the Islands without their consent on domestic matters(paragraphs 1462-1473).(2) We have been impressed by the virtual unanimity of opinion in theevidence submitted to us in favour of maintaining the existing consti-tutional relationships, either without change or furnished with additionaldefences against encroachment on the Islands&apos; autonomy (paragraphs1464-1468).(3) Our main concern has been to see if means can be found of reconciling the Islands&apos; autonomy in domestic matters with the United Kingdonfsresponsibilities for their external relations (paragraph 1474).(4) We note the view of the Home Office and the Foreign and commonwealth office that a declaration similar to that made in 1967 in respect of the associated States in the West Indies would be unlikely to secure inter-national acceptance, without which it would have no effect. It would inany event have only limited value (paragraphs 1475-1476).(5) We regard as wholly impracticable a suggestion for dividing responsi-bility for external relations between the United Kingdom and IslandGovernments (paragraph 1477).(6) We commend proposals of the Home Office and the Foreign and commonwealth Office for a formal strengthening of the procedures for consultation with the Islands over the application to them of international agreements (paragraphs 1401-1403).(7) The division between matters which are of domestic concern to the islands and those which concern the United Kingdom&apos;s international and domestic interests is not clear cut and is continually changing.It would not be practicable to make a formal division of legislative and executive responsibilities between the United Kingdom and Islandauthorities, with each enjoying exclusive power over matters allocated to it (paragraphs 1479-1496).(8) So long as the United Kingdom Government remains responsible for theinternational relations of the Islands and for their good government,it must have powers in the last resort to intervene in any Island matter in the exercise of those responsibilities (paragraph 1494).(9) While it is not possible to define them with the precision needed for inclusion in a statute, we have indicated in general terms the circum-stances in which the United Kingdom Government might in practice bejustified in using its paramount powers to intervene in the affairs of the islands. We have done so under five headings-defence, matters ofcommon concern to British people throughout the world, the interestsof the Islands, international responsibilities and the domestic interests ofthe United Kingdom (paragraphs 1497-1512).
(10) While we have reached the conclusion that the problem of reconciling the Islands&apos; autonomy in domestic affairs with the United kingdom governments responsibility for their external relations cannot be resolved by changes in the constitutional relationships, we believe that, withgoodwill and recognition on each side of the rights and obligations of the other, few serious difficulties should arise, and that those that dowill be capable of being overcome at least as well under the existingrelationships as under any new relationships that could be contemplated(paragraph 1513).(11) A committee similar to the Standing Committee on the common interests of the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom should be estab-lished for any of the other Islands which desires to have one; or, andwe think this may be preferable, there should be a single committeecovering the interests of all the Islands (paragraphs 1514-1517).(12) We regard as unsatisfactory the existing arrangements by which petitionsto the Crown from the Island authorities against decisions of the UnitedKingdom Government are referred to and considered only by a Com-mittee of the Privy Council consisting of Ministers of the UnitedKingdom Government. We accept that the effective power of decision must remain with the United Kingdom Government. We recommend,however, that consideration should be given to the possibility of devisinga new procedure whereby petitions could be referred to a body which included some independent members for enquiry and report before being accepted or rejected. We suggest as one possibility the addition of inde-pendent members to the standing committee proposed in (xi) above.This body, which might be known as &quot;The Council of the Islands&quot; andbe composed of a chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Crown and up to six representatives each of theUnited Kingdom Government and the Islands, with an independentsecretariat, would combine the function of conciliation with that ofgiving advice to the Committee of the Privy Council on petitions fromthe Islands (paragraphs 1518-1524).(13) We recommend no change in the methods of selecting persons for appointment to Crown offices in the Islands (paragraphs 1525-1527).(14) We make no recommendations for change in economic relationships(paragraphs 1528-1538).
PART XIISUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS1540. We have tried to identify the problems of government as a whole, asreflected in the evidence and other information available to us. This has causedus to go beyond purely regional matters and to refer to a number of problemsof a more general character concerning the relationship between governmentand people. But our work of detailed examination has been concentrated onissues which are primarily geographical in character, and we have seen it as our main task to investigate the case for transferring or devolving responsibilityfor the exercise of government functions from Parliament and the centralgovernment to new institutions of government in the various countries and regions of the United Kingdom. I1541. In Part I of the Report we discuss the nature of our task and the way we set about it. In Part II, as a background to our enquiry, we give a brief account of the history and characteristics of the United Kingdom and its constituent countries and of the existing arrangements for their government.We now summarise briefly the main conclusions reached in the remainder ofthe Report.great britain the present discontents (part iii)Growth and change in government (Chapter 8)(1) The vast increase in the scope, scale and complexity of government business, and in the manpower and other resources devoted to it, has had acumulative effect on people&apos;s lives, and is an underlying factor in complaints about the working of the present system of government (paragraphs 226-241).(2) With the growing pressures on government there is no prospect of halting,still less of reversing, this trend (paragraphs 242-247).(3) There is an evident contrast between this enormous increase in theactivities of government and the extent and pace of change in the governmentinstitutions (paragraphs 248-263).Dissatisfaction with government in Great Britain (Chapter 9)(4) Nearly all the complaints of substance spring either from the centralisationof government in London or from developments in the operation of governmentwhich have tended to run counter to the principles of democracy (paragraph269).(5) The principal complaints made against centralisation relate to (a) the absence of a regional voice in determining the allocation of public expenditure to and within the region (paragraphs 274-277);(b) the failure of departments to co-ordinate their activities so as toensure that policies make sense in regional terms (paragraph 278);(c) the deadening effect on political life in the regions and the adverseconsequences for their commercial, industrial and cultural life&apos; (paragraphs 280-281);
(d) the imposition by the centre of a uniformity which is inconsistent with the retention of a distinctive regional character; on the otherhand there are strong public pressures for uniformity of treatment(paragraphs 283-288); and(e) congestion in Parliament and in Whitehall (paragraphs 289-290).(6) An opposing view, widely held by people with first-hand experience of central government, is that in an advanced industrial society, concentrated ina few relatively small islands, government must necessarily be mainly from thecentre (paragraphs 291-293).(7) Though efforts have been made to overcome the difficulties resulting fromcentralisation (paragraphs 294-295), the degree of discontent remains sub-stantial.(8) Few of those who complain have thought out fully the consequences of amore regional system of government (paragraph 295).(9) Specific complaints about the weakening of democracy relate to (a) the role of the backbench Member of Parliament (paragraphs297-300);(b) the working of the party system in Parliament (paragraphs 301-303);(c) the growth of ad hoc bodies appointed by the government to executeor advise on particular specialised functions (paragraphs 304-307);(d) the secrecy of government (paragraphs 319-320); and(e) the undermining of civil liberties (paragraphs 321-322).(10) There is a desire for greater opportunity to participate in government,but the strength of the desire for participation in the various forms that itmight take is difficult to assess (paragraphs 310-316).(11) There is a feeling that government is remote and insufficiently sensitiveto the views and feelings of the people (paragraphs 317-318).(12) Our conclusion is that, while the people of Great Britain as a wholecannot be said to be seriously dissatisfied with their system of government,they have less attachment to it than in the past, and there are some substantial and persistent causes of discontent which may contain the seeds of more serious dissatisfaction (paragraph 324).National feeling (Chapter 10)(13) In Scotland and Wales dissatisfaction with government has an addeddimension of national feeling. In Scotland the emphasis is largely placed oneconomic considerations; in Wales, while the economic factor is important, it isclosely associated with a desire to preserve the Welsh language and culture(paragraphs 325-335).(14) New political initiatives have been taken, but have not succeeded in raising the prosperity of Scotland and Wales to the desired level. In thesecircumstances political nationalism has grown and put down stronger roots(paragraphs 336-337).(15) In neither Scotland nor Wales has the nationalist cause attracted supportanything like sufficient to constitute a general vote for independence; but it
has provided a means for the people of Scotland and Wales to register theirfeeling of national identity, and has focused attention on the desire for changesin the system of government which would acknowledge their separate identitiesand special interests (paragraphs 339-356).(16) The centralisation of government in London appears to be resented inScotland and Wales more than in England, though Welsh people seem rather more prepared than the Scots to accept that the United Kingdom government must play the dominant role (paragraphs 358-359).(17) Although the existence of the Scottish and Welsh Offices has enabledScotland and Wales to secure a greater allocation of public expenditure thanthey might otherwise have done, and public expenditure per head in Scotlandand Wales is relatively high, many people there think that the present system doesnot enable the best use to be made of the funds provided (paragraphs 360-362).(18) There is a feeling in Scotland and Wales that those countries shouldhave elected assemblies to oversee their administration and to bring the influence of their people more directly to bear on Scottish and Welsh problems; thefeeling is more widely held in Wales than in Scotland, where many peopleinvolved in public life favour the retention of the present arrangements(paragraphs 363-368).(19) Though for many Welsh people the maintenance of United Kingdomstandards may be rather more important than devolution, the Welsh, like theScots, have prominently in mind the idea of self-determination (paragraphs369-371).(20) There are very few Scots who are so dissatisfied that they would supportdevolution if it reduced their standard of living (paragraph 372).(21) An additional cause of complaint in Scotland is that there is insufficientunderstanding of Scots lawin London and that its peculiarities are not sufficientlycatered for in United Kingdom legislation. As it is difficult for Scottish lawyersto engage in United Kingdom politics while pursuing their profession, few areelected to Parliament (paragraphs 373-374).(22) The concern for democracy in Wales shows itself not only in the wide-spread demand for an elected Welsh assembly, but also in the vigorous criticism of appointed bodies (paragraphs 376-377).(23) Whatever achievements may be credited to the Scottish Office and the welsh Office, neither has made a deep impression on the public at large(paragraphs 378-383).general principles (part iv)Chapter 11(24) We examine the domestic character of the United Kingdom (paragraphs392-402) and its position as a member of the international community(paragraphs 403-415) in order to identify the essential characteristics and movements in society which should be taken into account in assessing future constitutional requirements.(25) Important domestic characteristics of the United Kingdom are its essential unity, its great diversity, its long established and widely respectedinstitutions of government, its spirit of pragmatism and compromise and itshigh regard for personal liberty (paragraphs 393-398).
(26) Recent trends towards political apathy and direct action suggest some loss of confidence in the traditional democratic processes (paragraphs 399-402).(27) The problem is to humanise government and keep it democraticallyalive, while permitting it to discharge its essential functions efficiently(paragraph 402).(28) Neither the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the European economic community nor its other international relationships stand in the way of substantial devolution or greatly affect the climate for it (paragraphs 403-415).(29) In examining proposals for constitutional reform we have kept before us the following general principles:(a) the essential political and economic unity of the United kingdom should be preserved, though unity does not necessarily implyuniformity (paragraph 417);(b) democracy must be preserved and fostered (paragraph 418);(c) government should in volume be no greater than is necessary tosatisfy the general will and should be exercised with the greatestregard for the liberty of the individual (paragraph 418);(d) any new arrangements should be a natural development out of what has gone before, and be capable of adaption to changing circum-stances and flexible in their actual working (paragraphs 419-420);and(e) good communication between government and people is essential,with government being carried out as far as possible in the open andwith proper regard for the views and feelings of the people(paragraph 420).separatism and federalism (part v)Separatism (Chapter 12)(30) There are three ways in which Parliament could confer power on a region; it could transfer sovereignty either in all matters (separatism) or incertain matters only (federalism), or it could retain sovereignty in all mattersbut delegate the exercise of selected powers (devolution) (paragraph 423).(31) We discuss separatism in relation to Scotland and Wales only. The main factors are the same for both (paragraph 424).(32) The essentials of the separatist case are that Scotland and.Wales areseparate nations and should be treated as such for the purposes of government,that they have suffered from incorporation into the United Kingdom, that theywould be economically viable as independent states and that only by assertingtheir separate nationhood and achieving full independence can they ensuretheir own prosperity (paragraph 432).(33) The separate national identities of the Scots and the Welsh do not require Scotland and Wales to be administered as entirely separate communities(paragraphs 433-440).(34) There are no grounds for the belief that Scotland and Wales areneglected under the present system and suffer in material terms because oftheir incorporation into the United Kingdom; on the contrary, they tend toreceive preferential treatment (paragraphs 441-452).
(35) Conditions within the United Kingdom are such that a distinctive wayof life will survive if those who possess it want it to survive (paragraphs 453-455).(36) The fact that Scotland and Wales now absorb more United Kingdomrevenue than they provide does not mean that they could not survive on theirown if they were determined to do so. So long as they were prepared if necessaryto accept some fall in their standard of living for the sake of independence,both countries would be economically viable (paragraphs 456-465).(37) To an unknown extent the exploitation of oil resources would assist theeconomic viability of Scotland (and possibly also of Wales in the future)(paragraphs 466-468).(38) The question of economic viability is anyway of secondary importance.Separation would come about only if there existed an overwhelming political-   desire for it, and arguments about viability would then hardly be relevant(paragraph 468).(39) With independence, Scotland and Wales would be worse off materially;in practice they would not be able to cultivate a separate prosperity by adoptingindependent economic policies. They have a better chance of achievingprosperity within the United Kingdom than outside it (paragraphs 469-488).(40) While the United kingdom&apos;s  entry into Europe does not rule outseparation, it does not make it any more attractive; it might add to the already considerable economic difficulties which would face Scotland and Wales as independent states (paragraphs 489-494).(41) Separation would neither serve the purposes of good government inScotland and Wales nor enhance their prosperity quite the reverse; and for very many people in all parts of Britain it would present a problem of national&quot;   identity which they would find unwelcome and regard as totally unnecessary(paragraph 496).(42) The necessary political will for separation does not exist; the vast majority of people simply do not want it (paragraph 497).Federalism (Chapter 13)(43) There is very little demand for federalism in Scotland and Wales, and practically none at all in England (paragraph 498).(44) Because of changes in the responsibilities of government, the federalidea of divided sovereignty is becoming difficult to sustain (paragraphs 513-515).(45) One of the main obstacles to the proper working of federalism is theimpracticability of arranging a division of finance between the federal and provincial governments which will for any length of time satisfactorily matchtheir respective functions under the constitution (paragraph 517).(46) The formal division of sovereignty between federal and provincial governments tends to slow down desirable change and may even prevent italtogether (paragraph 519).(47) Even at its best federalism is an awkward system to operate; its inflexi-bility is an obstacle in the modern world (paragraphs 520-523).
(48) Federalism was designed and is appropriate for states coming together to form a single unit, a stage of constitutional development which the UnitedKingdom has long since passed (paragraph 526).(49) Although in some circumstances the benefits of federalism may outweighthose of any practicable alternative, such circumstances do not exist in theUnited Kingdom. To most people a federal system would appear strange and artificial; it would provide neither continuity with the past nor sufficientflexibility for the future (paragraphs 527-530).(50) There is no satisfactory way of fitting England into a fully federal system(paragraphs 531-534).(51) There is a real danger that in a federal system provincial sovereigntywould lead to inter-governmental rivalry and contention to an extent that wouldbe damaging to the interests of the United Kingdom; in the international fieldit would add to the difficulties of the United Kingdom Governmenfs negotiating position (paragraph 535).(52) A federal system would be less suitable than a unitary system for meeting the economic needs of the United Kingdom (paragraph 536).(53) The United Kingdom is not an appropriate place to introduce federalismand the present is not an appropriate time (paragraphs 538-540).THE SCOPE FOR DEVOLUTION IN GREAT BRITAIN (PART Vi)Introductory (Chapter 14)(54) Having set aside separatism and federalism we turn to devolution a delegation of central government powers which would leave overridingcontrol in the hands of Parliament. The more advanced forms of devolutionwould involve the exercise of powers by persons or bodies who, althoughacting on authority delegated by Parliament, would not be directly answerable to it or to the central government for their actions. Those who exercised the devolved powers in the regions would have a measure of independence,permitting them to do things in their own ways, which might not always havethe support of the central government. In Part VI of the Report we try to estab-lish the practical limits that would have to be placed on that independence ofaction in the wider interests of the country as a whole (paragraphs 541-545).(55) Northern Ireland experience before 1972 is a guide to the technical and practical workings of devolution. Events in the province should not rule outconsideration of the application to other regions of devolved government,including the particular form of devolution which was there applied(paragraphs 548-549).(56) There are nevertheless many differences between Northern Ireland andthe regions of Great Britain which have a bearing on the scope for devolution(paragraphs 550-556).(57) Even if within Great Britain the pressures to conform and the obstacles to regional variation were greater than in Northern Ireland, some distinctiveregional policies or styles of administration could be expected to emerge underdevolved government (paragraph 557).
(58) There are significant differences between the various regions of GreatBritain, some of which would affect the scope for the adoption of genuinelyindependent policies (paragraphs 558-560).The public finance of devolution (Chapter 15)(59) The problem is to devise a scheme for a fair distribution of funds to the regions while permitting them to exercise their devolved powers without undueinfluence from the centre (paragraph 564).(60) Our discussion of finance assumes the existence of directly elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the eight regions of England, all with legisla-tive or at least substantial executive powers of government (paragraph 567).(61) Certain political constraints limit the scope for financial devolution.Parliament must retain legal and effective sovereignty in all matters; the UnitedKingdom Government must have the control over expenditure and taxationnecessary to stabilise the economy and to foster its development; a reasonabledegree of equality in public services must be maintained between regions; andthe United Kingdom Government must be responsible for minimising regionaldisparities in general economic conditions (paragraphs 573-583).(62) These constraints still leave room for a wide range of financial possibili-ties to match regional devolution (paragraphs 584-585).(63) Equality in regional services should be achieved not by imposing uni-formity or laying down minimum standards, but by ensuring that each regionis financially in a position to provide services comparable to those in other regions (paragraphs 578-579 and 584).(64) The constraint most difficult to reconcile with financial devolution is theneed to minimise regional disparities in general economic conditions. In this the United Kingdom Government is bound to play the leading role(paragraph 584).(65) Public expenditure per head in Scotland has risen sharply in recentyears, and in 1969-70 stood at 31 per cent, above the corresponding figure for england (paragraph 590).(66) Public expenditure per head in Wales is also substantially higher thanin England, though well below that in Scotland (paragraph 591).(67) Central government expenditure per head on services which are the maincandidates for devolution is some 38 per cent, higher in Scotland than in the lowest spending English region (paragraph 593).(68) A system of financial devolution would necessarily start, and probablycontinue, with wide regional differences in expenditure per head (paragraph 595).(69) To maintain present standards of service, most parts of the UnitedKingdom, including many English regions, would necessarily be dependent oncentral funds. The bulk of this financial support would come indirectly from thesurpluses in taxation produced by the South East and West Midland regions of England (paragraph 595).(70) Because of central governments need to influence aggregate demand, a region might have to limit its total expenditure even though prepared to finance
higher expenditure out of additional regional taxation. But within the agreedtotal the region would normally be able to allocate funds between and withinservices as it wished (paragraphs 596-614).(71) Possible sources of regional revenue can be fully considered only inrelation to particular schemes of devolution and particular proposals for expenditure (paragraph 616).(72) The regions could not be financed entirely from the proceeds of inde-pendent regional taxes, but might derive some revenue from this source(paragraphs 617 and 657).(73) Only tentative conclusions can be reached about the scope for devolvingcentral taxes to the regions; at present it appears restricted. Vehicle excise duty and petrol duty offer the clearest administrative possibilities; others in the fields of income and sales taxation hinge on future developments(paragraphs 618-628 and Appendix C).(74) It would be possible for the proceeds of central taxes to be shared withthe regions (paragraphs 624 (h) and 627).(75) Regional precepts on local authorities would not generally be appropriate, but charges for regional services could develop into a usefulsource of income; national insurance contributions might be allocated to the regions on tax-sharing lines, but this would be open to objections if social security were to remain a central service (paragraphs 629-632).(76) Whatever other revenues they might have, regional governments would need general revenue grants and equalisation grants from United Kingdomfunds. Special purpose grants might be necessary, but should be avoidedwhere possible (paragraphs 633-639).(77) Regional borrowing powers would need to be controlled from thecentre (paragraph 640).(78) Theoretically there are two possible bases of regional finance. On therevenue basis, a regional government would be given certain fixed sources ofrevenue and would be obliged to finance the devolved services out of the incomeproduced. On the expenditure basis, its expenditure requirements would be measured and it would then be furnished with the income necessary to meet them (paragraphs 648-652).(79) For financial devolution within the United Kingdom only the expenditurebasis would be practicable; but there would have to be built into it someguarantee of regional independence (paragraphs 653-656).(80) Budgetary autonomy within a given total of expenditure would bepossible without independent revenues (paragraphs 657-665).(81) Regions would need independent taxes if they were to be free todetermine their total expenditure; in practice the rates of tax might not varymuch between regions (paragraphs 663-666).(82) Regions might be given independent taxes solely for presentationalpurposes; but shared taxes might do just as well (paragraphs 664-665).
(83) A block grant system would help to foster regional independence and responsibility; it would need to include a sensitive measurement of marginalneeds, probably every year (paragraphs 667-669).(84) An independent exchequer board would be necessary. We suggestwhat its main features should be (paragraphs 670-678).(85) We suggest the basic elements which should be contained in any systemof regional finance, and put forward a possible scheme incorporating an exchequer board and a block grant system (paragraphs 680-692).(86) If regional governments were confined to Scotland and Wales, thepractical difficulties of financing them would be much reduced (paragraph 693).Scope for devolution of government functions (Chapter 16)(87) In most cases there is no ready answer to the question whether a par-ticular function is capable of being devolved. One purpose of devolution is tosatisfy a demand for greater independence, and this may be regarded as of such importance as to override any objections so long as the essential requirementsof political and economic unity are satisfied (paragraph 698).(88) Devolution may also serve to facilitate the adoption of policies and procedures best suited to the needs or wishes of the individual regions; it may provide a greater element of political accountability and greater opportunityfor participation in government; and it may lighten the load at the centre.Proposals for devolution of particular functions must take account both of thecontributions it might make to these objectives and of any disadvantages inthe form of increased costs and demands on resources (paragraph 699).(89) The scope for devolution would be greatest in the environmental,health, education and personal services (paragraphs 707-709).(90) But some functions in these fields for which the responsibilities of the functional departments in Whitehall now extend to Scotland and Wales,notably those relating to the nationalised transport industries, civil scientific research and development policy and the social services providing cash benefits,would offer little scope for devolution (paragraphs 710-713).(91) The Home Office and the Lord Chancellors Department would offer some scope for devolution, but, except in the case of Scotland, there would for most functions be good grounds for retaining powers at the centre(paragraphs 714-716).(92) Agriculture and fisheries would offer possibilities, but the main policy decisions on grants and subsidies would have to be taken centrally(paragraphs 717-719).(93) Scope for devolution in the trade, industry and employment fieldswould be severely limited by the obligations assumed under international agreement and by the requirements of economic management policy(paragraphs 720-728).THE FORMS OF DEVOLUTION (PART VIl)The various forms that devolution might take are examined with a view to providing the information needed to assess their suitability for application to scotland, Wales and the regions of England.
Legislative devolution (Chapter 17)(94) Powers would be transferred to a regional assembly to determine policy on a selected range of subjects, to enact legislation to give effect to that policyand to provide the administrative machinery for its execution (paragraph 734).(95) By devolving responsibility for prescribed matters only, leaving Parlia-ment with the sole right to legislate on matters not prescribed, maximumprecision would be given to the devolved powers (paragraphs 737-745).(96) There are difficulties in the way of qualifying the grant of subordinatelegislative powers by the imposition of limitations designed to guarantee human rights, and this would not be necessary (paragraphs 747-755).(97) The laying down of minimum standards of provision in the devolved services would not be appropriate in this form of devolution (paragraphs 756-757).(98) Though party representation in a regional assembly would not neces-sarily reflect the representation of the region in the House of Commons, the strong possibility of prolonged one-party government in some regions would remain. The risk of the adoption of regional policies incompatible with themaintenance of political and economic unity would be greatest in such circumstances (paragraphs 758-760).(99) The sovereign powers of Parliament would be retained in full. Theywould not ordinarily be used to legislate on a transferred matter without theconsent of the region, but would be available for use in exceptional circumstanceswhen it was considered essential to apply to the region legislation which the regional assembly was unable or unwilling to enact itself (paragraphs 762-763).(100) The United Kingdom Government would also have a power, exercisableperhaps only with the approval of Parliament, to veto regional legislationconsidered to be unacceptable (paragraphs 764-767).(101) Any form of devolution which involves the sharing of powers between two levels of government will work only if there is a readiness on both sides toco-operate in making it work. Given such co-operation, there would be con-siderable scope for devolution of legislative powers (paragraphs 770-771).(102) The matters most suitable for transfer to a legislative assembly would befound from among those which are now in Scotland the responsibility of theScottish Office (paragraph 773).(103) The regional assembly would be able to debate matters in which it didnot have devolved powers. It would be the voice of the region in all matters of concern to it (paragraph 774).(104) The maximum scope for financial devolution which we established in chapter 15 would suffice to support the constitutional status of elected regional assemblies with their own legislative and policy-making powers(paragraphs 775-777).(105) A regional assembly with powers of legislation would need to be directly elected. The proper representation of minorities could best be secured by electing
members by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation;the alternative vote system might be used instead in sparsely populated areas(paragraphs 779-788).(106) The assembly would need to consist of about a hundred members(paragraphs 789-791).(107) The assembly might be elected for a fixed term of four years (para-graphs 792-798).(108) The regional legislature would appropriately consist of Your majesty and the elected assembly; no second chamber would be needed(paragraphs 799-803).(109) Executive power would be exercised mainly through Ministers of theCrown, who would be in charge of departments of the regional government(paragraph 803).(110) The appointment of a Governor to the region would not be necessary.Executive functions not within the competence of a Minister might be delegated to Commissioners specially appointed when required (paragraph 804).(Ill) Each region would need to have its own civil service(paragraphs 806-807).(112) If legislative devolution were to be confined to Scotland and Wales,with Parliament continuing to be the sole legislative assembly for England, the range of functions of Parliament, and of the departments of central governmentother than the Scottish and Welsh Offices, would remain largely as at present(paragraph 809).(113) There is no entirely satisfactory solution to the problem of the level of representation in the House of Commons of a region with its own legislature.An &quot;in,,and out&quot; arrangement is not practicable (paragraphs 811-815).(114) It would be difficult to justify retention of the separate offices of Secre-tary of State for Scotland and Wales, though it would be to the advantage of theScottish and Welsh people to have continued representation in the Cabinet(paragraphs 818-820).(115) If legislative devolution were to be applied in all regions, this wouldhave a profound effect on the machinery of government at the centre. Thecentral civil service would be greatly reduced in size and in character, but some increase in the total number of civil servants employed could be expected(paragraphs 821-822).Executive devolution (Chapter 18)(116) The essence of this form of devolution is that Parliament and thecentral government would be responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy on all matters, but would transfer to directly elected assembliesthe responsibility within that framework for devising specific policies for the regions, for the execution of those policies and for general administration(paragraph 827).
(117) There is no general rule which could be applied to determine whether any particular function should be transferred to the regions. In each subject theextent of the powers to be retained at the centre would be a matter for politicaldecision. Individual statutes would have to be amended so as to transfer powersto the regions where this was considered appropriate. Local authorities could beaffected in a variety of ways (paragraphs 828-844).(118) The allocation of functions to the regions would be a long-term process.In the first instance they might be given certain precisely defined powers inmatters, such as strategic planning, which can be suitably undertaken at regional level (paragraph 845).(119) To safeguard the regions against the encroachment of central govern-ment on their preserves, a statutory council might be set up representative of the regional assemblies, with a right to be consulted on proposals for new legisla-tion affecting regional responsibilities (paragraphs 846-859).(120) The central government would need default powers to ensure that the regions gave effect to policies laid down centrally (paragraphs 860-863).(121) The central government would need to keep closely in touch with theadministration of existing policies in the regions, and a system of inspectionmight be needed for this purpose (paragraphs 864-869).(122) The subjects which have been administratively devolved to the scottish office would offer the greatest scope for the devolution of executive powers,but almost all subjects would offer some scope for regional involvement(paragraphs 870-871).(123) The role of regional assemblies in relation to appointed bodies wouldbe determined in the course of the review of the executive functions of centralgovernment to see which might appropriately be devolved. The assemblies mightassume directly the functions of some of these bodies (paragraphs 872-886).(124) For certain functions not suitable for devolution, the regions might begiven responsibilities on an agency basis (paragraphs 887-890).(125) It would be open to regional assemblies to seek the extension or varia-tion of their functions, and they might have some general powers similar to thoseconferred on local authorities by sections 111 and 137 of the Local government act 1972 (paragraph 891).(126) The financial arrangements would depend on the extent of the responsi-bilities conferred on the assemblies (paragraphs 892-895).(127) As in legislative devolution, each assembly would need to consist ofmembers directly elected for a fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation (paragraph 896).(128) Executive authority would appropriately be vested in the assemblyitself, with power to delegate to committees of the assembly (paragraphs 897-901).(129) Each region would require its own civil service (paragraph 902).
(130) If executive devolution were applied to selected regions only, thelegislative tasks of Parliament would be made more difficult, but the burden on Members representing constituencies in those regions would be greatlyeased (paragraphs 903-904).(131) There would be no need for changes in regional representation in theHouse of Commons (paragraph 905).(132) If regional authorities with executive functions were established inScotland and Wales only, the Whitehall departments would be relativelyunaffected, but the Scottish and Welsh Offices would lose large blocks of executive work. There would be stronger grounds for the retention of the secretaries of State, at least in the initial period (paragraphs 906-907).(133) If executive powers were devolved to all regions, there would be agreat reduction in the work of central government departments responsible forthe devolved subjects. One Minister could be given a general responsibility for regional devolution, including relations with the regional institutions of govern-ment, though the retention of separate Scottish and Welsh Offices, withMinisterial arrangements as for legislative devolution, might be necessary(paragraphs 908-910).Regional councils (Chapter 19)This chapter is concerned with representative regional councils, withoutlegislative or executive functions, which would advise the central government about government policies and the exercise of government authority generally in the regions.(134) The councils could be given clearly defined powers to call for information from government departments and to question officials about the administrationof current policies. Ministers might on invitation attend and take part in theirdebates (paragraphs 940-942).(135) The value of the councils as sounding boards for their regions would depend largely on the willingness of the Government to use them for this purpose(paragraphs 943-944).(136) The councils would need to operate as far as possible in public and onthe basis of full information, but they might exceptionally conduct business ona confidential basis (paragraphs 945-947).(137) The councils could be consulted about the amount and distribution ofpublic expenditure in their regions (paragraph 948).(138) Members of Parliament might be given a right to attend and perhapsparticipate in some of the councils&apos; debates (paragraph 950).(139) In the local government field the councils&apos; main function would be toact in a co-ordinating and promotional role in matters affecting the whole ora substantial part of their regions, including economic and strategic planning(paragraphs 951-953).(140) They would not assume responsibility for any services now in thehands of local authorities, and would not exercise control over appointedad hoc bodies, though they might have the right to appoint members to such bodies and examine and advise on their work (paragraphs 954-956).
(141) Regional councils could be either directly elected or indirectly elected by the local authorities in the region, possibly with the addition of somenominated members. The case for direct election would be strongest in Scotlandand Wales (paragraphs 957-960).(142) The councils would need to employ their own staffs, which might beprovided by secondment from central and local government (paragraph 961).(143) The costs of the councils might be met either by precepting on localauthorities or by central government grant (paragraph 962).A proposal of the Scottish Constitutional Committee (Chapter 20)(144) The Committee&apos;s proposal for a Scottish Assembly should be judgedmainly by reference to the advisory, consultative and inquisitory functionsproposed for it (paragraphs 966-967).(145) If an assembly with such functions were to be established in Scotland,the power to play some part in the passage of Scottish legislation might be a useful addition to them (paragraphs 968-974).Administrative devolution (Chapter 21)This chapter deals with possibilities for the further decentralisation ofgovernment administration.(146) Decentralisation may serve the purposes of assisting management,improving the standards of service provided and facilitating the injection of regional considerations into policy making (paragraphs 983-985).(147) Whether or not more advanced systems of devolution are adopted,government departments should make regular and comprehensive reviews ofthe desirability of transferring additional functions to regional offices(paragraphs 987-988).(148) One obstacle to greater regional co-ordination in England is lack ofuniformity of regional boundaries. Complete uniformity is neither practicablenor essential and its lack does not prevent co-ordination, though it may makeit more difficult (paragraph 992).(149) A second obstacle is that the chain of command in each departmentstretches back to the responsible Minister; no one civil servant has executive responsibility over all regional civil servants, as the prefect has in France(paragraph 993).(150) But the prefect system could not readily be introduced in this country,with its very different history and traditions (paragraphs 994-999).(151) One possibility would be to appoint regional Ministers in the Departmentof the Environment to exercise the executive functions of the department onbehalf of the Secretary of State and to act more generally as the Governmenfsrepresentatives in the regions (paragraphs 1000-1015).(152) The estimates for all regional services could be prepared on a regionalbasis, with the regional Minister making the case for his region and havinglimited discretion to allocate and transfer funds between and within services(paragraphs 1016-1019).
(153) Grants to local authorities and to other government bodies withenvironmental responsibilities in the region would appear as part of the regionalMinisters vote, although the distribution of rate support grant would probablycontinue to be determined nationally (paragraph 1019).(154) While the existence of regional Ministers would ensure that theGovernment thought in regional as well as functional terms, the ministers would not be in as strong a position as the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales to promote the interests of their regions (paragraph 1021).(155) It would not, however, be feasible to extend the Secretary of state system to the English regions (paragraphs 1029-1033).(156) The Secretary of State system has conferred substantial benefits onScotland and Wales. To the extent that criticisms of it are valid, they may call for the adoption of some quite different form of devolution (paragraphs 1034-1035).(157) If the Secretary of State system is retained for Scotland and Wales,more should be done to inform the public of the way it operates and of thebenefits it confers (paragraph 1025).(158) The Welsh Office should progressively assume additional functions,though these should not necessarily include all the functions transferred to scotland. In particular we see no reason to think that Wales would derive anybenefit from the assumption by the Welsh Office of functions in relation to thesystem of law and the preservation of law and order (paragraphs 1036-1038).(159) There is little scope for adding to the executive functions of the scottish office, but the provision of government accommodation, control over domesticairports and air services and responsibility for the new industrial developmentoffices are possibilities (paragraphs 1040-1044).(160) The financial powers of the Secretaries of State, where they are lessthan those we have proposed for regional Ministers, notably in the discretionaryallocation of marginal expenditure, might be increased (paragraph 1045).Regional organisation within Parliament (Chapter 22)This chapter considers arrangements whereby Parliament would conductpart of its business on a regional basis.(161) There are at present no arrangements for the conduct of english regional business comparable to those made for Scotland and Wales, and thelatter have been criticised as inadequate (paragraphs 1053-1065).(162) Discussion of regional aspects of government policy needs to be basedon comprehensive regional statistics and forecasts of public expenditure(paragraphs 1070-1072).(163) If a regional committee structure is introduced into Parliament, itshould be based on the House of Commons; it would be impracticable and undesirable to use the House of Lords for this purpose (paragraph 1073).
(164) Regional committees might take Parliamentary Questions and adjourn-ment debates of local and regional concern, and might examine government policy towards the regions (paragraphs 1075-1078).(165) A Member of Parliament would be free to attend any meeting of hisregional committee, but for the function of examining government policy towards the region a working group of members of the committee would beappointed (paragraph 1079).(166) The lack of uniformity in regional boundaries for the various functionsof government would not give rise to as much difficulty as in legislative and executive devolution (paragraph 1081).(167) The manning of regional committees would present problems, and itwould be for the House of Commons to determine its priorities. The Housemight adjourn at certain times to allow the committees to meet(paragraphs 1084-1086).(168) The problems of providing staff and other assistance for the committees should not be insurmountable (paragraphs 1087-1088).(169) It would not be necessary to appoint committee members from outsidethe region merely to reflect the party balance in the House (paragraph 1089).OUR CONCLUSIONS ON DEVOLUTION (part VIIl)The schemes of devolution which have some measure of support amongus are described, and the reasons for that support are given.The background to our conclusions (Chapter 23)(170) Devolution could do much to reduce discontent with the systemof government. It would counter over-centralisation and, to a lesser extent,strengthen democracy; in Scotland and Wales it would be a response to nationalfeeling (paragraph 1102).(171) We are divided on the question whether as a matter of principle thesame system of government should be applied to all parts of the United Kingdom.The majority of us think this is not necessary (paragraphs 1107-1111).(172) We have regarded our principal function as one of analysis, comprising the identification and presentation of possible forms of devolution and of thearguments for and against them. We are agreed on this analysis, but not on theschemes of devolution preferred (paragraphs 1112-1113).Scotland and Wales (Chapter 24)(173) Our preferred schemes all provide for the establishment of Scottish and welsh assemblies directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of four years (paragraphs 1116-1122).(174) For Scotland eight of us, and for Wales six of us, favour a scheme of legislative devolution along the lines discussed in Chapter 17(paragraphs 1125-1153).
(175) Responsibility for the following matters might be transferred to theassemblies:To both Scotland and WalesLocal governmentEducation (probably excludingWater supply and sewerageOther environmental servicesTown and country planningNew townsHousingBuilding controluniversities)Youth and community servicesSport and recreationArts and cultureSocial work servicesHealthMiscellaneous regulatoryAncient monuments and historicfunctionsAgriculture, fisheries and foodbuildingsRoadsRoad passenger transportHarbours(with certain exceptions)ForestryCrown estatesTourismTo Scotland onlyPoliceFire servicesCriminal policy and administra-tionPrisonsAdministration of justiceLegal mattersHighlands and Islands develop-mentSea transport for some other matters, for example consumer protection, railways, roadfreight, civil aviation and broadcasting, limited powers might be transferred(paragraphs 1131-1133).(176) The financial arrangements would require an independent exchequer board; the main object would be to give the Scottish and Welsh Governmentsmaximum freedom in expenditure (paragraphs 1134-1139).(177) Executive authority would be exercised by Ministers appointed by theCrown and drawn from members of the assemblies (paragraphs 1143-1146).(178) The representation of Scotland and Wales in the House of commons in proportion to population would be the same as that of England, subject toany allowance for special geographical conditions (paragraph 1147).(179) The offices of Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales would dis-appear, but Scotland and Wales would each be represented in the UnitedKingdom Cabinet by a Minister who would be available to discharge other duties (paragraph 1148).(180) For both Scotland and Wales two of us favour a scheme of executivedevolution along the lines discussed in Chapter 18 (paragraphs 1154-1173).(181) It is an essential feature of this scheme that it should be applied in amore or less uniform way throughout Great Britain (paragraph 1155).(182) The functions of the assemblies would be built up gradually and thescheme would be generally flexible (paragraphs 1156-1160).
(183) The Scottish and Welsh assemblies (and the corresponding english regional assemblies) would be represented on a statutory council with a rightto be consulted on matters affecting the devolved functions (paragraph 1162).(184) Finance for the assemblies would be negotiated direct with the UnitedKingdom Government; subject to the implementation of central policies theassemblies would have a substantial measure of freedom in the allocation of expenditure (paragraph 1163).(185) Executive authority would be vested in the assemblies(paragraphs 1165-1167).(186) The offices of Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales would dis-appear. A Minister of the central government would have general responsibilityfor regional affairs (paragraph 1169).(187) Three of us favour a scheme for a directly elected Welsh AdvisoryCouncil (paragraphs 1174-1183).(188) The council would be responsible for scrutinising, debating and making representations to the Secretary of State for Wales about government policies and activities in relation to Wales, including the activities of ad hocbodies; it would replace the existing Welsh Council (paragraphs 1174-1175).(189) It would operate in part through standing committees covering all aspects of the work of the Secretary of State, and would have clearly definedpowers to call for information from the Welsh Office and to question officials(paragraph 1176).(190) Welsh Ministers would on invitation attend and take part in thecouncil&apos;s debates (paragraph 1177).(191) The council would have the right to nominate some members of thead hoc bodies operating in Wales (paragraph 1178).(192) The administrative expenses of the council would be met out of centralgovernment grant (paragraph 1179).(193) One of us favours a scheme for a Scottish Council with functionssimilar to those proposed in the scheme for a Welsh Advisory Council(paragraphs 1184-1187).(194) The council would also have legislative powers along the lines of those proposed by the Scottish Constitutional Committee, as described in Chapter 20,but extended to enable it in certain circumstances to complete all theParliamentary stages of Scottish Bills (paragraph 1185).England (Chapter 25)(195) We are agreed that legislative devolution should not be applied toEngland or to the regions of England (paragraph 1188).(196) Two of us favour a scheme of executive devolution to the regions ofEngland as part of a wider scheme of executive devolution to all parts of GreatBritain (paragraphs 1190-1194).
(197) The regions would be those established for economic planning purposes,modified to make the regional boundaries conform to those of the new countiesdefined by the Local Government Act 1972 (paragraph 1191).(198) Eight of us favour the establishment of regional co-ordinating and advisory councils, partly indirectly elected by the local authorities and partlynominated (paragraphs 1195-1209).(199) The regions would be as in the scheme of executive devolution(paragraph 1196).(200) With certain modifications, the councils would have the functions andbe administered on the lines of the proposed Welsh Advisory Council(paragraphs 1197-1201).(201) Government departments, local authorities, nationalised industries andother government agencies would be required, subject to exceptions on security grounds, to inform the regional councils of their capital investment programmeswithin the region (paragraph 1202).(202) In the local government field, the councils would have a mainly co-ordinating function, including responsibility for formulating strategic plansinto which the structure plans of local authorities would have to fit; they wouldhave no power of direction over the local authorities and would not themselvesadminister services or undertake works (paragraph 1204).(203) The expenses of the councils would be met by precepting on localauthorities (paragraph 1205).(204) The councils would consist on average of about sixty members, about one-fifth of whom would be nominated by the Minister responsible for regionalaffairs, the remainder being elected by local authorities (paragraph 1206).(205) One of us favours a scheme of co-ordinating committees of localauthorities, consisting entirely of indirectly elected representatives of localauthorities (paragraphs 1210-1213).(206) The scheme would substitute for the present voluntary co-operationbetween local authorities a formal system of regional committees. Localauthorities in each region would be required to submit their structure plans tothe committee and obtain its comments before seeking Ministerial approval.The committees would have no other obligatory functions (paragraph 1212).(207) The present economic planning councils would be abolished(paragraph 1213).(208) The scheme could be combined with a scheme of regional committees of the House of Commons, as described in Chapter 22 (paragraph 1214).Summary and assessment of conclusions on devolution (Chapter 26)(209) We all believe that our preferred solutions would go as far aspracticable to meet the demands for change in the various parts of GreatBritain. They would not remove all the grounds for complaint against govern-ment, a good deal of which is bound to remain under central control. The curefor remaining defects would not simply be more devolution. There is noinherent reason why regional government should be more democratic or more
sensitive to public opinion than central government. But devolution, depending on those operating it, could do a great deal to meet complaints which are essentially regional in character (paragraphs 1219-1224).the relationship between government and people (part ix)Chapter 27(210) Our enquiries have raised many issues affecting the relationship between government and people which are not regional in character and whichare not disposed of by our conclusions on devolution. It would not have beenpracticable for us to tackle these issues as well as devolution. We have drawn attention to them, leaving others to consider whether they call for further enquiry (paragraph 1225).(211) We regard as particularly important the problem of communication between government and people. We offer an initial appraisal in the hope that what we have to say will encourage further study and appropriate action(paragraphs 1226-1245).northern ireland (part x)The old system of home rule (Chapter 28)(212) Our work on Northern Ireland has been overtaken by events. with one exception, we make no recommendations for Northern Ireland. We merelyrecord our impressions of the system of home rule which existed until 1972,drawing lessons from it for application to other parts of the United Kingdom,and compare our own proposals for Scotland and Wales with those approvedby Parliament for Northern Ireland (paragraphs 1246-1248).(213) We have no doubt that the old system of home rule was of considerable advantage to Northern Ireland. It was successful in many fields, and attractedthe support of persons of widely differing political views (paragraphs 1249-1265).(214) The main defects of the system, considered as a model to be appliedto other parts of the United Kingdom, were the unnecessarily elaborate con-stitutional apparatus, the inclusion among the transferred matters of some inwhich little, if any, independence of action was practicable,, and insufficientindependence in financial matters. In the special circumstances of NorthernIreland, the system had the additional defect of making inadequate provisionfor the protection of the interests of the minority and for participation by the minority in government (paragraphs 1266-1268).Financial arrangements (Chapter 29)(215) We trace the development,of the financial arrangements in NorthernIreland between 1920 and 1972, assess their value, and suggest the lessons theymight provide for devolution within the United Kingdom generally (paragraphs1272-1314).The new constitution (Chapter 30)(216) The new Northern Ireland constitution has much in common with thescheme of legislative devolution advocated by some of us for Scotland andWales; but it differs in some important respects (paragraph 1315).
(217) The main differences relate to the method of prescribing and the extentof the devolved matters, the restrictions on the exercise of the devolved powers,the financial arrangements, the responsibilities of United Kingdom Ministers,the method of appointing the executive, relations between the assembly and theexecutive and representation at Westminster (paragraphs 1318-1338).(218) Except for representation at Westminster, these differences arise outof the very different circumstances in which the schemes are intended to beapplied and there is no incompatibility between them (paragraphs 1339-1341).(219) We recommend that Northern Ireland&apos;s representation at Westminstershould be determined by the rules applied to other parts of the United Kingdom(paragraphs 1337-1338).THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND THE ISLE OF MAN (PART Xl)A summary of the conclusions reached in this Part of the Report is given inparagraph 1539 at the end of Chapter 33.

REGIONAL TAXESintroduction1. In Chapter 15 we discussed the financing of regional governments in asystem of maximum devolution and the possibility of having, as one source offinance, independent regional taxes. We considered whether it would be administratively and technically feasible for the taxes now controlled by theUnited Kingdom Parliament to be devolved to the regions in the sense that each region would fix its own rate of tax, within limits, and receive the wholeproceeds, and for each tax we stated our conclusion. The purpose of this appendix is to amplify those conclusions. We are not concerned to describe the various taxes; that is done in the written evidence submitted to us by therevenue departments . This evidence has been supplemented by informal discussions with the departments and with others specially interested in the devolution of central taxes, and by our own independent enquiries.2. It may be argued that almost every tax has already been operated in somecountry or other on a regional or local basis, that the devolution of any tax would be feasible given the political will, that if such devolution were desirable for the purposes of regional government no administrative or technical difficulties should be allowed to stand in the way, and that some of the presentrefinements might well be dispensed with if that would enable the regions to operate their own taxes. But we do not believe that under a system of devolutionwithin the United Kingdom people in the regions would want devolved taxesat any cost. They would not willingly accept standards of equity and administra-tion very much lower than those to which they have been accustomed in thepast. There would be a continuing expectation of operational efficiency,reasonable economy in the use of administrative resources, and equity in taxation as between all citizens of the United Kingdom. Moreover, people inthe regions would not be content if the taxes selected for devolution were allsmall and unimportant, or produced in their particular region a very much lower yield per head than in other regions. Nor would they wish to rely on taxeswhich could not readily be identified as belonging to their region, or which were likely to be avoided by the removal of taxpayers to another region with a lower rate. And any tax devolved should affect as broad a section of the regionalelectorate as possible. In judging the possibilities we have tried to keep all these factors in mind.3. In our enquiries the accent has been on administrative and technicalfeasibility. The findings in this Appendix may therefore be regarded as identified-fying those United Kingdom taxes which are prima facie candidates for devolution. Their final selection for regional use would depend on politicaland economic factors of a more general kind. These are discussed in chapter 15.4. One further qualification is necessary. Although we have benefited from work done by others in seeking new sources of revenue for local authorities,
we are not ourselves concerned with that question. We are concerned with the financing of Scotland and Wales and large regions of England. In that contextdifferent considerations apply. Our conclusions should not be regarded asanswering the question whether United Kingdom taxes could be devolvedto local authorities.5. We discuss first the Inland Revenue duties, and then the Customs and excise duties, dealing with each tax in turn. We then go on to discuss the twomotor taxes (vehicle excise duty and driving licence fees) and the selective employment tax.inland revenue duties6. We accept the general conclusion of the Inland Revenue that there wouldbe very substantial administrative and technical difficulties in operating on a regional basis any of the duties now within their field. Nevertheless, as is madeapparent in the Board&apos;s own evidence, there are some limited possibilities.Income tax and surtax7. Income tax is by far the country&apos;s biggest source of revenue. Among the inland Revenue duties it is the one most widely thought to be suitable for devolution. Recently it has undergone important changes and still more are in prospect. For these reasons, and also because of the complications of the taxitself, it is necessary to deal with it at some length. The old surtax, a separatetax on the same income, has to be considered together with income tax.8. Our initial evidence on income tax and surtax was received in 1970, andour main conclusions were reached on the basis of the system as it existed atthat time. Since then the two taxes have been merged into a single newgraduated income tax, and there have been radical proposals for a tax-credit scheme in which income would be taxed and social cash benefits paid out inone operation. These proposals, put forward in the Governments GreenPaper1 of October 1972, have recently been under examination by a SelectCommittee2 of the House of Commons.9. The unification of income tax and surtax, operative from April 1973, didnot much affect our earlier conclusions, but the introduction of a tax-creditsystem could well do so. We have therefore to consider the devolution of incometax and surtax, first as they have generally come to be known, taking accountof unification, and secondly on the footing that the existing administrationmight be greatly changed in a few years&apos; time by the adoption of a tax-creditsystem.10. Theoretically there are three main ways in which income tax might be devolved to regional governments. The most radical would be for Scotland,Wales and the eight English regions to have complete and distinct systems of income tax, as they no doubt would if they were separate sovereign states,taking the tax out of central hands altogether. Secondly, they could administerseparate systems based on United Kingdom income tax returns, the InlandRevenue notifying each person&apos;s income to his regional tax authority. Thirdly,1 Proposals for a Tax-Credit System (Cmnd. 5116).2 Since this Appendix was drafted the Select Committee has reported (Select Committeeon Tax-Credit-Session 1972-3-Volume I 26 June 1973) and the Government has announced its intention of going ahead with the tax-credit scheme.
a regional supplement to United Kingdom income tax, fixed by the regionsthemselves, could be recovered on their behalf through the centrally administeredsystem.11. In our opinion the first of these three schemes would be wholly ih-appropriate for a system of devolution within a small unitary state such as theUnited Kingdom. We consider also that, apart from many other objections, theadministrative costs of the second scheme would be so enormous as to be unacceptable; in their evidence to us the Inland Revenue suggested that it might require, for the country as a whole, some 54,500 extra staff. We have thereforeconcentrated on the third scheme, involving a regional supplement to UnitedKingdom income tax.12. In the administration of income tax there is a division between threegeneral categories of income:(a) Employees&apos; earnings are taxed automatically by deductions under theP.A.Y.E. system and in most cases do not require direct assessment; the tax deducted during the year is usually correct without any furtheradjustment. In 1972/73 about two-thirds of all personal income tax wascollected through P.A.Y.E.(b) Certain kinds of investment income (including, up to April 1973,company dividends) are received after income tax has been deductedby the payer at the basic rate, again without assessment1. Income tax on this category of income accounted for nearly a fifth of the total in1972/73.(c) Other personal income, mainly trading and professional profits, rents,and certain investment income such as bank deposit interest which is received gross, is directly assessed on the taxpayer, who himself paysover the tax to the Inland Revenue. In 1972/73 approximately one-seventhof income tax was recovered by direct assessment in this way2.13. From a purely administrative point of view, a regional income taxsupplement based on the taxpayers place of residence could, with some difficulty, and in so far as it related to employees&apos; earnings, be collected throughthe national P.A.Y.E. system. And in relation to income which is directlyassessed, such as trading profits, it could be added to the national assessment.But in relation to investment income received under deduction of tax at the basic rate it would not be practicable for companies and other payers to makesupplementary deductions at varying regional rates. A vast number of individualtransactions would be involved. Many payers would be required to deal withthe complete range of regional variations in tax, and they would often not know the true identity of the recipient or his place of residence for tax purposes.Such a system would lead to administrative confusion; we think it would be generally unacceptable.14. It would therefore not be practicable to levy a regional supplement ontotal income without a radical change in the present system, the most obviousbeing the adoption of direct assessment for all kinds of income. Such a change1 For the treatment of company dividends since April 1973, see paragraph 18.2 Income within paragraph 12 (c) which belongs to an employee is frequently taxed notbydirect assessment but by an appropriate restriction of the allowances given in his P.A.Y.E.
would involve an enormous amount of extra work for the Inland Revenue andno doubt a substantial loss of tax; it could hardly be justified solely as anaccompaniment to devolution. A less sweeping change would be the directassessment of investment income now taxed at source. All income would thenbe covered for the purpose of national taxation either by direct assessment orby P.A.Y.E., both of which could accommodate a regional supplement. Butthis would still be a big and costly change. The least radical solution would beto leave the present arrangements for collecting the national income tax as they stand, but to extend the direct assessment procedure to all investment income for the purpose of collecting the regional supplement. This would permit a scheme in which the regional supplement would be collected either by directassessment or through P.A.Y.E.; in the main it would be collected along withthe national tax, but in relation to such investment income as continued to betaxed at source for national purposes it would be collected separately by directassessment. A scheme on these lines is discussed in the Inland Revenue&apos;s writtenevidence. We were told that it might require 5,000 to 10,000 additional staff,apart from the extra P.A.Y.E. burden on employers.15. Within the present system it would be administratively possible to have a selective regional supplement to the national income tax on certain kinds of income only, such as P.A.Y.E. earnings. But that is ruled out on technical grounds; it would cut across the established concept of a tax on whole incomewith an integrated system of reliefs and allowances. It would also no doubt beregarded as unfair by those with the kind of income selected for regionaltaxation. Another possibility would be to use the existing income tax machinery in a purely administrative way to levy a regional charge on selected kinds of income, quite outside the main income tax system. For example, a small flat rate regional tax on income from property could be collected with the national income tax. The same might be done with any other conveniently identifiablesource of income now dealt with by direct assessment or under P.A.Y.E. Thiskind of regional income tax would leave the national system technically intact,but would still be regarded by many people as inequitable. Finally, the existingP.A.Y.E. machinery might be used to levy a regional payroll tax on employers,which would not really be a tax on income at all. Taxes on employment are mentioned again in paragraph 62 below.16. As for surtax, before its abolition it emerged as the only Inland Revenueduty which might be devolved without considerable difficulty or substantial numbers of extra staff. It was dealt with wholly by direct assessment. Eachsurtax payer completed a return of his total income; the centralised SurtaxOffice worked out his tax by reference to that total, an assessment was issued to him and he paid over the tax to the Inland Revenue1. With the retentionof central administration this would have been a convenient administrativeframework either for full conversion into a regional tax or for the addition ofa regional supplement. But surtax could hardly have been considered appropriate for devolution by itself. It lacked any particular regional flavour, the numberof people affected was very small and the regional distribution of the yieldwas especially uneven.1 A large proportion of ordinary income tax payers are not asked to complete a returnevery year; and only in a small proportion of income tax cases is it necessary in practice tocompute total income.
17. With the abolition of surtax in April 1973 came, the new unified incometax, operated wholly by local income tax offices. Unified income tax is leviedat a basic rate of 30 per cent., with higher rates from 40 per cent, to 75 per cent,on taxable incomes over  5,000. There is also a surcharge of 15 per cent, on investment income over  2,000. The P.A.Y.E. machinery has been extendedso that it can collect tax on employees&apos; earnings at both the basic and higher rates. Higher rates on other types of income, and the surcharge on investmentincome, are collected by direct assessment. Apart from removing the possibilityof a regional surtax these changes did not affect our earlier conclusions as setout in paragraphs 13 to 16 above.18. Since the change to an &quot;imputation&quot; system of corporation tax, alsoin April 1973, income tax has ceased to be deducted from company dividends,although the practical effect for the shareholder is much the same. Instead of receiving a dividend of  70 after deduction of  30 income tax, he receives 70 plus a tax credit of  30. His income for tax purposes is  70 plus the credit,i.e.  100, as before, but the credit satisfies the basic rate charge of 30 per cent,on the total. This change does not appear to affect our conclusions either.It does not put company dividends into the direct assessment category, and itdoes not make it any easier for companies to deduct, on payment of dividends,a variable regional income tax supplement.19. The tax-credit scheme recently under examination by the Select Com-mittee (which has nothing to do with the tax credit attaching to companydividends) would involve sweeping changes in the administration of income tax.It would apply, broadly, to P.A.Y.E. taxpayers and to those in receipt ofnational insurance benefits, including retirement pensions, representing in allabout 90 per cent, of the adult population and their dependants. P.A.Y.E.would be greatly simplified. It would cease to be operated on a cumulativebasis1. Deductions would normally be at the basic rate only, and without the complications of coded income tax allowances. The allowances for the marriedand the single man, and for children, would be replaced by three correspondingmoney credits. In the case of employees these would be set off by the employeragainst the P.A.Y.E. tax due, any balance of credit being paid to the employee.Most of the other income tax allowances would be either dealt with in anentirely different way (for example, relief for life assurance premiums and for interest on mortgages might be given by allowing the payer to make an appro-priate deduction at the time of payment) or abolished altogether. It is estimatedthan nine out of ten taxpayers within the scheme would be correctly dealt withby the automatic deductions of tax and payments of credits, and would therefore need no special adjustment of their tax liability or credit at the endof the year.20. We have not taken evidence on these tax-credit proposals, but the generaldifficulty which emerges from the Green Paper is that of dealing with all those cases which cannot be fitted neatly into the scheme the self-employed and non-employed, those with abnormal allowances or expenses claims, or with a liability for higher rate tax or investment income surcharge, and those employees  In the present cumulative system each deduction from pay takes into account the employee^ total earnings and tax so far in the year, thus calling for a continuous record ofhis previous tax history, including perhaps several different employments. In the non-cumulative system now proposed each item of pay would be dealt with quite separately,without reference to previous earnings and tax deductions.
with subsidiary income which, under the present system, is conveniently taxedby a restriction of their P.A.Y.E. coding allowances. Until all these difficulties have been ironed out it is possible to express only a tentative view on how far the introduction of the new system would affect the administrative feasibility of a regional income tax supplement. The two most relevant factors are theextent to which the system would rely on deduction at source and the extentto which it would require a review of total income and overall tax liability.Wider use of deduction at source would tend to make a regional supplementmore difficult. Review of total income and overall liability would tend to makeit easier.21. The Green Paper suggests that in the new system tax would be deductedat source on a rather wider scale than at present. For example, it is proposedthat interest on bank deposits should be paid net instead of gross. This would avoid the direct assessments and P.A.Y.E. adjustments which are necessaryfor bank deposit interest under the present system.22. Furthermore the system of deduction at source from employees&apos; earnings would be much more crude. Our conclusion that a regional income tax supple-ment would be administratively feasible in relation to employees&apos; earnings wasreached against the background of a sophisticated system of P.A.Y.E. in whichit is possible to incorporate many refinements. If that system is to go theconclusion will need to be reviewed. The need may be illustrated by the casein which, by an appropriate restriction of P.A.Y.E. allowances, it is possible under the present system to tax, through P.A.Y.E. deductions, income from sources other than the employer. In the large number of cases dealt with inthis way a supplementary regional tax operated through P.A.Y.E. would ineffect be applied equally to the earnings as employee and to the other income.But if P.A.Y.E. is to be greatly simplified, with no system of coded allowances,the other income will have to be taxed in a different way. If by deduction atsource on payment (as is envisaged for bank. deposit interest), a variableregional supplement on that income would probably be impracticable (seeparagraph 13). If by direct assessment, there would at best be two regionaltax operations instead of one and increased technical difficulties.23. Moreover, if it is intended that P.A.Y.E. tax shall normally be deductedat one basic rate only, it might well be thought impracticable to allow fordeductions from employees&apos; earnings at variable regional rates. And if it were practicable it might still be rejected on the ground that it would rob the new scheme of its administrative economy.24. In general, therefore, because the tax-credit scheme would extend thepractice of deduction at source and, in relation to P.A.Y.E., make it much lessflexible, a regional income tax supplement would be more difficult to visualise.It might well be made altogether impracticable.25. As to the review of total income and overall liability, the great economy which is the chief administrative aim of the tax-credit scheme depends on thevast majority of cases not requiring an end of year adjustment1. Reviews oftotal income and direct assessments would be kept to the minimum. In thisrespect, therefore, the scheme would apparently do nothing to facilitate a1 See Select Committee on Tax-Credit: Minutes of Evidence, 1st February 1973, page 38(Board of Inland Revenue).
regional supplement. The only hint of possible advantage is in the green paper&apos;s reference to self-assessment, which is being considered as a possible way of taxing certain kinds of income which cannot readily be fitted into theproposed scheme, such as earnings from self-employment, income from property and some forms of interest. But no very great advantage would accrue, ascompared with the present system, unless self-assessment were to be adoptedgenerally, as is sometimes advocated. If each taxpayer was required to make a return of his total income every year, working out his own liability andreconciling it with the total amount of tax suffered by deduction throughoutthe year, paying over the difference or claiming back a refund as appropriate,then it would appear relatively simple for him to include in his calculation an extra liability for regional income tax at some rate fixed by the region in whichhe resided. This part of the tax could then be paid over to the regions by the inland Revenue. But no scheme of general self-assessment is envisaged in the green paper.26. Our conclusions may be summarised as follows. Any regional tax ontotal income should take the form of a supplement to United Kingdom incometax and be centrally administered. The regions would fix the rate of tax butin all other respects, including the determination of allowances, United kingdom legislation would apply. A regional supplement could not, however, be leviedon total income without a radical change towards direct assessment or generalself-assessment. Such a change could probably not be justified solely as anaccompaniment to devolution, but the least radical solution-referred to inparagraph 14 which would permit a regional supplement using P.A.Y.E. onemployees&apos; income and direct assessment to the regional tax of all other income(including investment income taxed at source for national purposes) might be worth consideration. On a more limited scale there is, within the presentsystem, some administrative scope for special regional taxes on certain kinds of income only, outside the technical structure of the main income tax. Thesetaxes might be rejected as inequitable unless they were complemented by measures to cover people who would otherwise escape regional taxation.We have not taken evidence on the proposed tax-credit scheme, but it seems clear that unless it led to a system of general self-assessment it would tend tomake the operation of a variable regional income tax supplement even moredifficult than under the present system, perhaps altogether impracticable.In particular it would remove the sophisticated system of P. A. Y.E. on which the feasibility of such a supplement largely depends. So far as we can judge itwould not remove all administrative scope for special regional taxes on certainkinds of income only, recovered through the existing income tax machinery,but it would require this possibility to be examined afresh.Corporation tax27. The remaining Inland Revenue duties can be dealt with quite briefly.We are satisfied that a regional tax on corporate profits would be impracticable.1 A non-cumulative system of P.A.Y.E. normally requires an adjustment at the end ofthe year usually a repayment of tax over-deducted. This may be dealt with, as in the UnitedStates, by a process of general self-assessment (Select Committee on Tax-Credit: Minutes ofEvidence, 19th December 1972, page 9 (Board of Inland Revenue)). The indication in the tax-credit proposals that few end of year adjustments would be required presumably rests onan assumption that, in comparison with other non-cumulative systems, the Green Paperscheme is simpler and would be much more accurate in achieving the correct deductions.
There is no satisfactory way of allocating to individual regions the profits ofthe many companies which operate in more than one region, often on a nation-wide basis. Allocation by reference to the place of central management would lead to a heavy and artificial concentration of revenue in London and theSouth East. Allocation by reference to the registered office would also giveartificial results in many cases and could easily be abused. The only fair criterionfor the geographical allocation of company profits is the place where they arise, but this is often very difficult to determine. In practice it could be deter-mined only on the basis of arbitrary rules which would be complicated toapply, open to dispute and circumvention, and still unfair in their result. Allthese difficulties of geographical allocation would apply also to company taxdeductions such as capital allowances, losses and management expenses.28. There would be difficulties also with a regional corporation tax of the registration fee type. Some rule would have to be found to fix a company&apos;slocation for tax purposes, and the only firm criteria would be those relatingto premises. But a corporation tax based on premises would be akin to super-rating. It would trespass on a field of revenue already allocated to localauthorities and would probably have a relatively small potential yield.29. Our conclusions on corporation tax are not affected by the change of system in April 1973.Capital gains tax30. A regional capital gains tax based on the taxpayer&apos;s place of residencecannot be entirely ruled out as an administrative possibility, but we accept the inland Revenue&apos;s view that it is not a strong candidate. Apart from someadministrative difficulties and avoidance problems, the yield of the tax would be liable to fluctuate according to developments on the Stock Exchange (this could be serious for regional governments dependent on a restricted range ofrevenues) and its regional distribution would be uneven.31. As was the case with surtax, capital gains tax is supplementary in nature and affects relatively few people. It could be considered for devolution only in combination with other taxes. It may be noted that the capital gains of companies are charged to corporation tax.Estate duty32. It appears that if the central administration of estate duty were to beretained, and its basic rules were to remain the same for all regions, their discretion being limited to the rate of duty, it would be administratively possibleto have a regional estate duty based on the deceased person&apos;s region of domicile.But this would mean an unprecedented interpretation of the existing law ofdomicile, which is at present related to the country as a whole and is relevantfor many legal purposes besides estate duty. It would be necessary to create anew code to give meaning to the concept, of domicile in relation to a region.33. Scotland has its own legal system and is already a separate country forthe purpose of domicile, but Wales is not. Because of its separate positionScotland has its own arrangements, within the control of the Inland Revenue,for assessing and collecting estate duty. In the past Northern Ireland has alsobeen treated separately, in this case having its own legislation and retaining the
duty collected, but the new constitution will have the effect of abolishing the separate duty for Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland legislation was similar to that applicable in Great Britain.34. Apart from the difficulties surrounding the concept of domicile, it seemsto us not altogether appropriate that a particular region within a unitary state should have the right to operate a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; tax on total world assetsat rates up to 75 per cent. The regions could be limited to a small percentageonly, the national duty being slightly reduced to make room for it, althoughthe total yield is only about  450m. If there were sufficient variation in regional rates to make devolution worth while, legal avoidance would almost certainly be common. The sums at stake in some individual cases would be large.Yet, as with surtax and capital gains tax, the total number of revenue-producingcases would be relatively small. In any particular region the bulk of the electorate would be unaffected. In general, therefore, although estate dutystands as an administrative possibility for regional devolution, it is not in out-view a good candidate. In Scotland, however, where it is already separated, itmight serve as a convenient make-weight in any range of independent revenuesallocated to a Scottish assembly.35. In March 1972 the Government published a Green paper canvassingthe idea that estate duty might be replaced by a different form of death duty,probably an inheritance tax. This Green Paper has not so far led to positiveproposals; we have not taken evidence on it and have not considered how achange to an inheritance tax would affect our conclusions.Stamp duty36. Transactions in land provide the only satisfactory basis for regionalstamp duties, and the yield from these transactions is small and very unevenlydistributed. A special survey carried out for us by the Inland Revenue showed that the yield in 1970/71 was only  29m. of which nearly  19m. was attributable to south-east England2.37. The yield from a regional stamp duty on share transfers would also beunevenly distributed. Apart from this the potential avoidance problems andgeneral upset to daily commercial life are sufficient to rule it out.customs and excise duties38. Our enquiries in the Customs and Excise field excluded the protective duties. Leaving aside value added tax, the chief feature which emerges from theevidence is the great economy of the present arrangements for collection.Hydrocarbon oil duty is charged on delivery from bonded refineries andterminals operated by a small number of large oil companies; most of the dutycomes from about 200 terminals. Tobacco duty is paid on withdrawal of the imported raw leaf from 50 or so approved warehouses. Beer duty is collectedalmost entirely from about 220 breweries; duties on wine come mainly from about 390 bonded warehouses; and the collection of spirits duty, although1 Taxation of Capital on , Death: A possible Inheritance Tax in place of Estate Duty(Cmnd. 4930).2 Written Evidence, Volume 10, page 68.
rather more widespread, still extends only to some 700 main points very fewfor a national tax. The general result is that collection costs are low and evasionis easily contained, despite some very high rates of duty.39. For most Customs and Excise duties, therefore, complete or even partialdevolution to the regions, with a widespread system of collection and regionalvariations in the rate of duty, would inevitably increase the scope for evasionand be much more costly; for some duties it would require a complete change from the present system. Value added tax presents different problems.40. Notwithstanding the general position there are some duties in theCustoms and Excise field which should certainly he included in any list ofpossibilities for devolution.Hydrocarbon oil duty41. The bulk of the duty on hydrocarbon oil relates to motor fuel, and this duty on motor fuel, or &quot;petrol duty&quot;, is one of the stronger candidates for devolution.42. The best of the various schemes drawn to our attention involves centralcollection at a single national rate of duty, as now, and distribution of the proceeds to the regions by reference to the place of consumption. This would beallied with a small variable supplement fixed by the individual regions andchargeable locally at the point of consumption (in effect, the place of retailpurchase1. This scheme would involve setting up a new system of supervision and collection for some 40,000 retail petrol outlets throughout the country,mostly small garages, which are not now subject to revenue control. Supervisionobviously could not be of the present meticulous standard, but only a small proportion of the duty would be at risk and we understand that only about 350additional staff would be required. The national charge and regional supple-ment would together constitute one regional tax, with central administrationbeing retained, for convenience, to collect most of the duty. If the centralgovernment were to keep control of the national rate the commonly expressedeconomic objections to devolving petrol duty would be weakened.43. Only one substantial technical difficulty emerged from our enquiries into this scheme. Not all motor fuel goes to garages; about one-thirdof it is delivered direct to big industrial users in bulk. Deliveries in bulk on this scale would seem to offer considerable scope for avoidance, with users choosingto take delivery in regions with a low rate of duty. It might not be easy to ensurethat the appropriate duty reached the regions in which the fuel was actually used.We have not enquired closely into this special problem. It if can be solved wethink the scheme would be practicable.44. One other scheme which might be considered is a variable regionalpetrol duty levied through the oil companies at the invoice stage. At that stage it should be possible to determine the geographical destination of (andtherefore the appropriate regional rate of duty for) most consignments. Withso few oil companies involved, and with advanced accounting procedures,1 A scheme on these lines was put forward for local authorities by S. H. H. Hildersleyand Raymond Nottage in their study Sources of Local Revenue, prepared in 1968 on behalfof the Royal Institute of Public Administration, and is discussed in the written evidence submitted to us by the Board of Customs and Excise.
such an arrangement could well be workable. But it might be open to avoidance,rather in the manner of bulk deliveries, and it could be a heavy additionaladministrative burden for the oil companies. Any proposed scheme would need to be examined with them in detail.45. It is interesting to note that the yield per head from duties on motorfuel is by no means greatest in the wealthier regions. On the basis of inlanddeliveries the yield per head in the South East and West Midlands is lower thanin four other regions. The highest yields are in the South West, East Anglia andWales1.Tobacco duty46. The situation of the warehouses from which tobacco duty is collectedbears no relationship to the geographical pattern of consumption, or to anyother factor which might reasonably be regarded as a suitable basis for regionaltaxation. For the duty to be devolved to regional governments, with provisionfor varying the rates, it would be necessary to devise an entirely new tax structure.No suitable alternative structure has emerged from our enquiries.47. Probably the only practicable way of deriving regional tax revenue from tobacco would be to retain the existing national duty, based on thepre-manufacturing stage, but to allow the regions to levy an additional low rate of duty on the final manufactured product as part of a general regionalsales tax. A regional sales tax on tobacco only would not be worth the wide-spread administrative complications.Duties on alcoholic liquors48. Similar arguments apply to the duties on wine, spirits and beer. For thepurpose of regional devolution the present highly centralised system of collection and control, based on places of manufacture and bonded warehouses whichbear no relationship to regional consumption, would need to be replaced by a new structure based on numerous points of wholesale or retail distribution.We have not found an acceptable new structure. At an early stage we thoughtit might just be practicable to regionalise the duty on beer, which producesabout half the duty on alcohol and in its commercial handling has certainaffinities to petrol. We had in mind a system of bonded depots distributedthroughout the regions, each supplying only public houses and off-licenceswithin the region. The beer would be delivered in bulk by the brewery to itsappropriate regional depot and would be subjected to a small regional dutyon distribution from the depot. The national duty would remain intact. Wewere, however, discouraged from closer examination of this scheme by itsobvious policing problems and the difficulties it would present for the brewers.49. As with tobacco, the only practicable means of deriving regional revenue from alcoholic liquors may be a general sales tax.Betting and gaming50. The general betting duty could not reasonably accommodate regionalvariations in the rate of duty. Pool betting duty is almost completely centredon Liverpool and its devolution on a regional basis would not be practicable.1 Written Evidence, Volume 10, page 5.
51. Gaming licence duty, gaming machine licence duty and bingo duty canreadily be associated with particular premises. They could all fairly easily be devolved and if desired administered on a regional basis. But the total yield from these three duties is only about  15m.Purchase tax, value added tax and retail sales tax52. When value added tax was introduced in April 1973 purchase tax wasabolished. Even if it had been retained we would not have thought it suitablefor regional devolution. It was confined to a limited range of mainly expensivegoods. It was collected from manufacturers and wholesalers who are heavilyconcentrated in particular regions, and it would not have been practicable forthem to analyse their transactions on a regional basis by reference to the finaldestination of the goods. In very many transactions they do not know the finaldestination.53. Value added tax is structurally unsuited to regional devolution. It is related to all the stages of a products manufacture and distribution, and sincethe taxpayer is allowed to set off the tax he has paid on his purchases againstthe tax due from him on his sales, he is effectively charged only on the value which he himself has added to the product. But in the case of many productsthe stages of manufacture and distribution extend over several different regions,and the application of varying regional rates to the same product would notbe practicable. A region with a high rate, taxing a product received from a region with a low rate, would secure an unfair advantage. It would acquirenot only the tax levied on the value added in its own region, but also an amountof tax representing the difference between the two rates on the value added inthe previous region. Furthermore it would be very difficult within a singlenationwide market to identify the tax base of an individual region i.e. thevalue added within its borders. The geographical location of added valuecould give rise to very complicated problems similar to those involved in the location of corporate profits. In the case of a national value added tax there isno need to determine the region in which the value is added.54. Although value added tax is not itself suitable for devolution it might possibly facilitate the introduction of a regional tax levied at a low rate on allretail sales. Before the introduction of value added tax a general retail salestax was open to the objection that it would require a vast new collection networkcovering perhaps a million retail businesses, all unaccustomed to sales taxation.With the introduction of value added tax such a net work has been broughtinto being, and the practical question now is whether a regional retail salestax could reasonably be imposed and operated alongside the national valueadded tax, using the national machinery of collection but allowing the regionsto determine, within narrow limits, the rate of tax.55. This question cannot be answered satisfactorily until more experience is gained in the working of value added tax by itself. It could be that a dualsystem would give rise to so many difficulties that it would not be worth while.Our own enquiries suggest that its administrative feasibility has not so far beendisproved, and if regional taxes should be required we think it would meritfurther investigation. On general grounds a retail sales tax might be the mostsuitable tax of all for regional use. It would be completely new, not taking
anything away, directly, from the central government; it would be specificallyassociated with regional government; it would affect everyone in the region;it would produce a high and relatively buoyant yield for a low charge; and ifregional variations in the rate of tax were small it could be operated withoutundermining the central governmenfs essential control of the economy.MOTOR TAXES56. The administration of vehicle excise duty and driving licence fees isbeing taken out of the hands of local authorities and centralised on a computerbasis in an office of the Department of the Environment at Swansea. Thetransfer should be complete by about 1976. There will then be many fewer local offices and their functions will be considerably reduced.Vehicle excise duty57. The devolution of vehicle excise duty to the regions would be practicable.Vehicles are widely spread throughout the country and there is already ahistory of local administration. The duty is related to the place in which the vehicle is &quot;kept&quot;, a not altogether clear but well-established concept which provides a reasonable basis for dividing up the duty geographically; and in thecase of private vehicles the owner&apos;s place of residence could, if need be, providea reasonable alternative basis. The rules would continue to be laid downnationally, leaving the actual rate of duty to be fixed by the regions. The duty would be collected centrally, at the regional rate appropriate in each case,and handed over to the regions. The current centralisation programme mightbe a reason for postponing devolution for a year or two, but when completeit should not make devolution more difficult. Our understanding is that in asystem of devolution central administration would actually be more convenientthan regional administration.58. After special enquiry1 we concluded that it would probably not be practicable to have regional variations in the rate of duty applicable to com-mercial vehicles. These vehicles, which produce about a third of the total yield,travel over wide stretches of the country and their places of registration oftendo not coincide with the area in which they mainly operate. It would be easy for them to be registered for tax purposes in whichever regions levied the lowest rates of duty. There are also good economic and trade reasons why therate for commercial vehicles should be centrally controlled. Nevertheless the proceeds of a single national rate for commercial vehicles could be transferredto the regions, in accordance with the department&apos;s best estimate of theirregional distribution. In revenue terms the commercial duty and the variableduty on private vehicles would then together constitute one complete regionaltax.59. There are indications that many so-called private vehicles perhaps40 to 50 per cent, of the total are in fact owned or subsidised by businessconcerns. It is possible that fleets of commercially-owned cars would present1 See the supplementary note on the treatment of duty on goods vehicles submitted by the(then) Ministry of Transport (Written Evidence, Volume 10, page 111).
avoidance problems of the sort associated with goods vehicles. It is unlikely,however, that these problems would be so great as to rule out regional controlover the rate of duty on private vehicles.60. In purely administrative terms vehicle excise duty is perhaps the strongestcandidate for devolution.Driving licence fees61. Whereas the primary object of vehicle licensing is the raising of revenue,the primary object of driver licensing is road safety. There are good policyreasons for keeping driving licence fees low and under national control; this isthe approach in many other countries also. Although devolution would be practicable, with full regional control over the fee whether it was collectedcentrally or regionally, the policy objections are sound and in our view the yield is too small to justify upsetting the present system.selective employment tax62. Selective employment tax was abolished along with purchase tax whenvalue added tax was introduced in April 1973. Its devolution to regional governments would have been administratively difficult but not impossible.Despite the administrative difficulties, especially those associated with companiesemploying people in several different regions, the argument against devolutionimpressed upon us most strongly was that regional taxes on labour, whetherselective or non-selective, would not give satisfaction to regions with high unemployment and would take out of central hands a valuable tool of regional and economic policy. This general argument would apply also to a payrolltax of the sort referred to in paragraph 15 above.

THE SCOPE FOR DEVOLUTION OF DEPARTMENTAL FUNCTIONSintroduction1. This Appendix describes the main functions at present exercised by government departments, other than those relating to foreign affairs, defence and finance and taxation, and examines the factors affecting their scope for devolution. It provides the material on which are based the conclusions reached in Chapter 16.2. We have found it convenient to review the functions of government by reference to the departments which have responsibilities in England. In somecases those responsibilities extend to Scotland and Wales and, exceptionally, to northern Ireland. Where they do not so extend, comparable functions areexercised by the Scottish and Welsh Offices and by the Northern Irelanddepartments. :i3. We consider first the Department of the Environment; then departmentsconcerned with the principal social services the Department of Education and science and the Department of Health and Social Security; then those con-cerned with public control, legal and internal matters the Home Office andthe Lord Chancellors Department; then the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food; and finally the departments concerned with aspects of trade, industry,employment and communications the Department of Trade and Industry,the Department of Employment and the Ministry of Posts and telecommunications-cations.4. For each department, we describe the nature of the functions performed,the extent of its responsibilities outside England, the arrangements, if any,which have been made for the functions to be exercised regionally or locally(including the extent of local authority involvement) and the principles whichhave been followed in determining those arrangements. In the compilation ofthis material we have been assisted by the departments. We are, however,entirely! responsible for the discussion which follows under each functionalheading of the factors affecting the scope for further devolution.department of the environmentGeneral statement of functions5. The Department of the Environment (D.O.E.) was set up in November1970, with functions previously exercised by the Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of public building and Works. Except in Scotland and Wales, the department is responsible for the whole range of functions which affect people&apos;s living environ-ment. It is responsible for the planning of land-use, the road programme andregulating the use of roads; for the urban and rural environment, includingthe conservation and recreational use of the countryside and the protectionof ancient monuments and historic buildings; for the control of air, water andnoise pollution; for the construction industries and the housing programme;and for the transport industries, including public programmes of support anddevelopment for the means of transport. Many of these functions are amongst
the main responsibilities of local authorities, and the department carriesresponsibility at the centre for the structure and functioning of local governmentand a major responsibility for regional affairs. Within D.O.E. the PropertyServices Agency develops and maintains the estate required by other govern-ment departments, the armed services and the Post Office, and furnishes supplies to them.6. The Secretary of State for the Environment has final responsibility forall the departments work and all the relevant statutory powers and dutiesare vested in him.Responsibilities outside England7. In Scotland D.O.E. is responsible only for ports (although the scottish office has certain statutory responsibilities for fishery harbours in Scotlandand transport harbours in the Scottish highlands and islands), railways, roadfreight, the use and licensing of road vehicles, driving tests, the construction industry, public building and works and defence lands. In Wales the department is responsible for these functions, and for building controls and some aspectsof road transport. In Northern Ireland its responsibilities are limited to certainpublic building and works and defence lands.Regional and local organisation8. The department has a policy of carrying out in the English regions and,where appropriate, in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, those of its functions which are of a local or territorial character. These include matterson which it deals directly with the public, local authorities and other localbodies, and particularly those on which a first-hand acquaintance with local circumstances and problems makes for better or more expeditious work.Executive programmes of construction, for example are also carried outthrough regional units. Since the department was set up much of the caseworkarising under the Town and Country Planning Acts has been decentralisedand is now dealt with in the departments main regional offices. Some types of local casework, however, are too specialised, or too occasional to be decentra-lised; and policy matters, involving Ministers and Parliament as they do,are in general dealt with in London, where many contact points essentialto the work are to be found.9. In England D.O.E. has a main regional organisation based on the eighteconomic planning regions. Outside London and the South East and east anglia, where rather different arrangements apply, there are regional offices,each headed by a Regional Director of Under-Secretary rank, who is the depart-menfs senior representative in the region. They deal with regional planning,housing and environmental planning, and highways and transportation work.The department has separate regional organisations for a number of differentpurposes. These are the regional works organisation and the lands servicesorganisation, both forming part of the Property Services Agency; road construc-tion units; road safety units; the traffic area organisation; the driving testorganisation; certain mobile crane depots and material testing laboratories;the district audit organisation; rent assessment panels; some ancient monumentfunctions; and the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate.
Water supply and sewerage10. Responsibility for public water supply and for sewerage and sewage disposal rests with local bodies; D.O.E. has a general responsibility in england to ensure that provision is adequate. The conservation and prevention of pollu-tion of sources of water supply are the responsibility of the river authorities,which have power to control the abstraction of water from both surface andunderground sources. The department co-ordinates the efforts of neighbouringauthorities and acts as a source and clearing house for information aboutresearch and development. Among its detailed powers are quasi-judicial functions in connexion with water services and pollution control.11. In Wales, the Secretary of State for Wales has responsibility for water and sewerage matters, and acts jointly with the Secretary of State for the environment in formulating and implementing national water policy for england and Wales.12. The Water Act 1973 provides for the reorganisation of the water services in England and Wales. Nine regional water authorities in England and a WelshNational Water Development Authority will take over virtually all the functionsof the existing public authorities responsible for river management, watersupply, sewerage and sewage disposal. The chairman and some membersof each of the English regional authorities will be appointed by the Secretaryof State for the Environment, but a majority of members will be appointedby local authorities in the region. The Government has stated that it doesnot propose to reach a final decision on the composition of the Welsh authorityuntil this Commission has reported. A National Water Council will be set upto speak for the industry in England and Wales as a whole.13. In Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland has responsibility forthese functions. The Scottish water service is at present administered by thirteenregional boards and the Central Scotland Water Development Board. in announcing proposals for the reorganisation of local government in Scotland,the Secretary of State indicated that the organisation of water, sewerage andriver purification would become a responsibility of the new regional authorities of Scottish local government and provisions for this have been included in theLocal Government (Scotland) Bill.14. The new arrangements are based on the belief that executive functions in these services are best performed at regional level. The arrangements for england and Wales have been criticised for removing the water services fromdemocratic control, and the establishment of elected assemblies in the regionsmight provide an opportunity for the restoration of this control. But waterservices are best administered within boundaries determined by hydrologicalconsiderations, and these are unlikely to coincide with regional boundariesdrawn with wider considerations in mind. Some special arrangements might,therefore, have to be made for the joint provision of services by neighbouringregions. There would in any event be a continuing need for some centralplanning and direction of water services, at least in England.Air and noise pollution15. Most air pollution is controlled by local authorities, who have power tomake orders, subject to confirmation by the Secretary of State, creating smoke
control areas. Under the Clean Air Act D.O.E. may make grants to localauthorities to cover the expenditure incurred in adapting appliances to preventsmoke emissions. Technically complex emissions are the responsibility of theChief Alkali and Clean Air Inspector. The department oversees local authori-ties&apos; responsibilities for refuse collection and disposal, including the disposalof toxic wastes. Noise pollution (other than aircraft noise) is also D.O.E.&apos;sconcern, and the Secretary of State is Chairman of the Noise Advisory Council.The Central Unit on Environmental Pollution, a team of scientists and admini-strators, supports the Secretary of State in his task of co-ordinating pollutioncontrol in this country and provides the United Kingdom contribution to inter-national work on pollution.16. The Scottish and Welsh Offices are responsible for these functions inScotland and Wales. In Scotland, there is separate legislation and a separate scottish Alkali Inspectorate. The Welsh Office has the services of the D.O.E.Inspectorate. There is close inter-departmental co-ordination, and the scottish and Welsh Offices have liaison arrangements with the Noise Advisory Counciland the Central Unit on Environmental Pollution.17. Many of these responsibilities, involving co-ordination of functionsdirectly exercised by local authorities, could be devolved. But the control oftechnically complex emissions depends for its effective exercise on an inspec-torate which is highly specialised. If this function were devolved it might bedifficult for regional authorities to build up inspectorates with expertisecomparable to that of the D.O.E.Road safety and vehicle licensing18. The work of D.O.E. on road safety includes periodic revision of the highway code, work on traffic signs and speed limits, the making of regulationscovering the construction and use of motor vehicles, the administration ofthe driving test system, and the promotion of road safety publicity and trainingin conjunction with local authorities and the Royal Society for the Preventionof Accidents. The department supervises the operation of the testing schemefor cars, and the plating and testing scheme for heavy goods vehicles. It isalso responsible for vehicle registration and licensing and driver licensing;this work is being transferred from local authorities, which at present carry it out on an agency basis, to a centralised organisation with a main office inSwansea.19. The Scottish and Welsh Offices are responsible for some of these functions.In general those aspects of road safety which relate to the roads for example,pedestrian crossings and parking and waiting restrictions have been trans-ferred, while those which relate to the construction, licensing and use of roadvehicles are exercised by D.O.E. on a Great Britain basis. Some functions,such as the determination of speed limits, are exercised jointly.20. Devolution of most of these functions would be possible. But if it ledto regional variations in such matters as the highway code and regulations forthe construction, use and testing of motor vehicles, it would cause seriousinconvenience and might militate against road safety. Some of the advantages of computer-based vehicle registration and licensing now being introducedwould be lost if they became a regional responsibility.
Land-use planning21. Land-use planning is a function of local planning authorities, whichprepare development plans and have extensive powers to ensure that develop-ment proceeds in conformity with those plans. D.O.E. approves the development plans of English planning authorities (except local plans, which are approvedby the authorities themselves); it can hear appeals by individuals against decisions made by local authorities in the exercise of their development controlpowers and call in the more important cases for decision by the Secretary ofState. Planning legislation also provides for the designation of national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, the perservation of woodlands and the designation of conservation areas in towns. The Secretary of State makesappointments to the Countryside Commission, which has functions inconnexion with national parks and collaborates with local authorities in the promotion of enjoyment of the countryside. In the South East, the departmentexercises a first control over new office development through the issue of office development permits designed to further the governmenfs regionalobjectives.22. In the urban field, the department aims to take into account not onlyland-use planning considerations, but also all the environmental considerations which affect those who live in towns. The aim is to consider transportation,development, traffic management and parking schemes, conservation of historic buildings, etc. as a whole in order to improve the urban environment.23. All these functions are exercised by the Scottish and Welsh Offices,with specific machinery for Scotland and Wales as appropriate. For example,the Secretary of State for Wales has access to the advice of the CountrysideCommission and its Committee for Wales and considers proposals fordesignations of national parks in Wales. There is a separate CountrysideCommission for Scotland, responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland.24. Devolution of responsibility for planning policy might result in the emergence of substantially different planning laws, and national planning for the distribution of population, for example would no longer be possibleexcept on a basis of inter-regional co-operation. The executive functions which relate to the co-ordination and supervision of the work of local authorities inthe planning field, and the hearing of appeals against planning decisions,could be devolved, though this might make inter-regional co-ordination moredifficult and there would no longer be consistency in the application of planninglaw. If control over office building in the South East were to be devolved, the regional authority would not have the same incentive as central government to restrict development in the interests of other regions.Regional economic planning25. A major part of planning is concerned with preparing and implementingdevelopment strategies for the various regions, covering all aspects of environ-mental development. A strategy for the South East already exists, and others are in preparation. D.O.E. plays a leading part in major developments ofnational importance for example, the planning of the Third London Airport.Regional planning in the eight planning regions of England is a non-statutory
process carried out with the help of the economic planning council (appointedby the Secretary of State) and the local authorities in each region. The objectof regional planning is to evolve and maintain a framework, at both national and regional levels, partly economic, partly social and partly environmental, towhich the statutory plans prepared and revised by local planning authoritiescan be sensibly related.26. While D.O.E. is responsible for the co-ordination of planning throughout great Britain, regional economic planning in Scotland and Wales is the responsi-bility of the Scottish and Welsh Offices, who consult the members of theScottish Economic Council and the Welsh Council about economic matters.27. This function is closely related to land-use planning, and similar con-siderations apply. Most of the functions of the economic planning councilscould be vested in regional authorities.Ancient monuments28. D.O.E. schedules ancient monuments of national importance and listsbuildings of special architectural or historic interest. Scheduled monuments areprotected by the department under statutory powers and some of the mostimportant, for example, Stonehenge, are in its guardianship. Arrangements forthe statutory protection of listed buildings are either supervised or, where necessary, made by the department. In addition it provides works services(including maintenance) for the Royal Palaces, the Houses of Parliament andthe national museums and galleries in London, and it administers the RoyalParks.29. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have comparable responsibilities inScotland and Wales, but the actual custody and maintenance of properties isundertaken by D.O.E. on their behalf.30. Devolution of responsibility for these matters might help to foster localinterest, though regional authorities might sometimes give priority to buildings of regional rather than national interest. They might have some difficulty in maintaining the standard of expertise on the management and restoration of historic buildings which the department has built up. The retention of centralgovernment responsibility for works services for buildings and parks of nationalconcern would be appropriate.Public passenger transport31. D.O.E. is responsible for sponsorship of the National Bus Company, a nationalised industry whose subsidiaries provide a very substantial part of the network of local bus services in England and Wales outside the urban munici-municipalities. Other functions under this heading include the establishment of passenger Transport Authorities, licensing of road passenger services, co-ordination of bus industry research and development, and the making of variousgrants to bus operators.32. In Wales, some of these functions rural bus grants, infrastructure grants and the designation of Passenger Transport Authorities are exercised by the
Welsh Office. In Scotland, the Scottish Office has full responsibility in this field, except for licensing, research and development, new bus grants and grants towards duty charged on bus fuel. It also has certain responsibilities forthe provision and financial support of local essential shipping services arisingout of the special communication requirements of the Scottish islands. Thewhole of the Scottish road passenger transport and sea transport networks in central public ownership is concentrated in the hands of the Scottish TransportGroup, responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland.33. These functions are primarily of local interest, and could be devolved.Problems would arise for inter-regional transport, and the National bus company might have to be broken up.Local government34. D.O.E. is responsible for the machinery of local government in England,and is concerned to see that it is efficient and that its structure is adequate tomeet the demands made upon it. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have similarresponsibilities in Scotland and Wales. Local government is being reorganisedin all three countries.35. All three departments have extensive responsibilities for the regulationof local authorities&apos; activities, particularly in the finance field, including theissue of grants and loan sanctions for various purposes. D.O.E. is responsible in England and Wales for the settlement of rate support grant and its allocationamong individual authorities, and for the District Audit Service, which auditsthe accounts of most local authorities. The Scottish Office is responsible for allthe corresponding functions in Scotland; the auditing of local authorities&apos;accounts is carried out by independent auditors appointed by the Secretary ofState.36. Many of the functions of government generally regarded as most suitablefor devolution are those in which the local authorities have been given executive responsibilities, and the organisation and regulation of local government itselfoffers considerable scope for devolution. Central government might thereby be relieved of a large block of executive work.Highways37. D.O.E. has general responsibility in England for the building, improve-ment and maintenance of trunk roads (including motorways) and for payinggrants to local highway authorities for improvements on principal roads. the design and supervision of construction of all major trunk roads and motorways isin the hands of Road Construction Units, which are staffed jointly by departmentaland county council professional and administrative staff and operate under the direct control of the Director General Highways. The department also adviseslocal authorities on highways construction and maintenance standards andapproves schemes for new or improved roads on which grant is paid. through its Regional Controllers (Roads and Transportation) the department maintainsclose links with local authorities in the development of transportation plans and traffic management; the Regional Controllers are themselves able to approvesmaller improvement schemes on both trunk and principal roads.
38. The Scottish and Welsh Offices exercise similar functions in Scotlandand Wales. There is consultation between the departments on the planning of major through routes.39. The building of roads is closely associated with other aspects of environ-mental planning. Though there is regional and local interest in the routing of roads and in the determination of priorities, in many instances the demandfor new roads is not associated primarily with the areas through which theyare to pass. If the function were to be devolved regional schemes would haveto be closely co-ordinated.Housing40. The main executive role in public sector housing belongs to local autho-rities, who clear slums and provide and maintain new dwellings. D.O.E.determines for England minimum standards and maximum costs for localauthority dwellings, and it supervises the progress of the public sector housing programme. It is also concerned with the existing housing stock, improvement grants and slum clearance.41. The department implements the governments policies on home ownership and assistance to prospective purchasers. It is also responsible for the legislationregulating rents of public and privately rented premises and for the administrativeorganisation to regulate rents. Rent Officers are independent statutory officers;objections to their determinations are adjudicated upon by rent assessmentpanels nominated by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State. Localauthorities administer schemes initiated by the department for rent rebatesand allowances. The department is also responsible for the development and administration of policy on commercial rents.42. New Towns Development Corporations are appointed by the Secretaryof State, and the department is closely concerned in the designation, financingand progress of new towns.43. The Scottish and Welsh Offices exercise comparable functions in Scotlandand Wales. In Scotland, where there is separate legislation, there are some differences to take account of Scottish law, and a government supportedagency, the Scottish Special Housing Association, builds houses in areas requir-ing industrial development and in certain special circumstances under arrange-ments approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland.44. Since the cross-border effects of differing regional policies on housingwould be less marked than with most other matters, there would be considerablescope for devolution. The siting of new towns is of both national and regionalconcern, but there would be scope for devolution of executive responsibilities.Construction45. D.O.E. acts generally throughout Great Britain as a sponsor for theconstruction and building materials industry, and in so doing initiates andcarries out research and development, co-ordinates and standardises technicaldata and information, collects and analyses statistics and generally looks to
safeguard or improve the efficiency of the industry. The main forum in whichthis role is exercised is the National Consultative Council of the Building and civil Engineering Industries, with its subordinate committees and working parties. Counterparts exist in Scotland, Wales and the regions.46. The department is responsible for legislation and regulations on building control in England and Wales (although the Welsh Office carries out someexecutive functions). In Scotland responsibility for building control rests withthe Scottish Office.47. If these functions were to be devolved there would be loss of standardisation-tion and of benefits of scale.Property Services Agency48. D.O.E. has responsibilities for providing other government departments,the armed services and the Post Office with property and estate management services; for designing, constructing and maintaining their buildings and otherfixed installations; and for providing associated supplies and transport services.These responsibilities are discharged by the Property Services Agency, which isan integral part of the department. The Agency is responsible for providingthese services throughout the United Kingdom, and it provides similar services for diplomatic and consular establishments and military establishmentsoverseas.49. These functions are provided for central government departments.Scope for devolution therefore depends on the devolution of the departmentalfunctions to which they relate.Ports and the Channel Tunnel50. The functions of D.O.E. in relation to ports include control of majorharbour developments and of the investment programme of the British transport docks Board, which is a nationalised industry responsible for twenty ports inGreat Britain. Other responsibilities include the appointment of members ofthe Board and of the National Ports Council, which advises the Secretary ofState on ports matters generally, the making of harbour revision orders and harbour reorganisation schemes and the confirmation of port byelaws. Thedepartment established in February 1973 a branch of their Ports Directoratein Edinburgh, to assist in providing advice on matters, including North Seaoil, affecting Scottish ports. Harbours throughout Scotland used mainly forfishing and, in the case of the highlands and islands, for internal communica-tions are, however, the responsibility of the Scottish Office, which has grant and loan powers to assist their provision and improvement. In conjunctionwith the French Government, D.O.E. is also responsible for work on the implementation of the Channel Tunnel project.51. There is a strong regional interest in development of the ports as partof the communications system of the region. But the scope for devolution is limited by the fact that about 85 per cent, of the country&apos;s imports and exportspass through fifteen major ports, each of which serves the country as a whole and not exclusively or mainly its regional hinterland. -
Railways52. D.O.E. exercises central government responsibility on a Great Britainbasis for British Rail, including the appointments of members to the Board,control of investment, administration of grants for unremunerative passenger services and the closure of such services. The Railway Inspectorate investigatesrailway accidents and reports to the Secretary of State on railway safetygenerally.53. The departments full responsibilities for railways could not be devolvedwithout the division of British Rail into regional components. While this might facilitate the inclusion of rail services in co-ordinated regional transportplans, it would present problems for the very many services which cross regionalboundaries. Regions might be given limited powers, as local authorities now have, to pay grants towards the financing of unremunerative services.Road freight54. The functions of D.O.E., which extend to Scotland and Wales, includelicensing of road haulage operators, regulation of drivers&apos; hours, negotiation of international agreements on exemption from carriers&apos; licensing hours, andgeneral sponsoring functions such as the appointment of members and thecontrol of investment in respect of the National Freight Corporation.55. Problems would arise if devolution led to different regional policies.The National Freight Corporation could not be retained if there were, nocentral government responsibility.Research56. D.O.E. has a general interest in research in fields appropriate to its policy functions, and has four research establishments the Building research establishment, the Hydraulics Research Station, the Transport and road research Laboratory and the Water Pollution Research Laboratory. Therewould be duplication of research effort and loss of economies of scale if centralresponsibility were not retained.      ,Ordnance Survey57. The Ordnance Survey is responsible for surveying and mapping GreatBritain. It is not part of D.O.E., and has its own Accounting Officer, but theSecretary of State for the Environment is the Minister responsible for the survey. Devolution would involve the breaking up of the Survey into regionalunits and the loss of economies of scale.department of education and scienceGeneral statement of functions58. The Department of Education and Science (D.E.S.) is concerned withall aspects of education, with the arts, museums and libraries and with civilscientific research. Most of its functions in relation to education are conferred by the Education Act 1944 (as later amended), which lays upon the Secretary
of State for Education and Science the duty &quot;to promote the education of thepeople of England and Wales and the progressive development of institutionsdevoted to that purpose, and to secure the effective execution by localauthorities, under his control and direction, of the national policy for providing a varied and comprehensive educational service in every area&quot;. In relation toprimary and secondary education in Wales, this function has been transferredto the Secretary of State for Wales.Responsibilities outside England59. In Scotland the department has responsibility only for universities and civil scientific research, although the Scottish Office grant aids a number ofagricultural research institutes in Scotland and is the channel for grant aid tothe Royal Society (Edinburgh). In Wales the department has responsibilityfor all matters except primary and secondary education and the NationalLibrary and the National Museum of Wales. In Northern Ireland the depart-mentS responsibilities are limited to civil scientific research.Regional and local organisation60. Executive powers in the field of primary, secondary and further educationare exercised mainly by local education authorities. The departments regulatoryfunctions are carried out from a central office, but in respect of the functions which the department retains in Wales day-to-day business is handled by D.E.S.officials who form part of the Welsh Education Office in Cardiff.61. The Inspectorate in England is organised on a regional basis, and toprovide the Inspectors with executive and clerical support the departmentmaintains offices in nine regional centres and some forty other local centres.The Inspectorate for Wales, which is based at Cardiff, is organised under itsown Chief Inspector and advises both the Secretary of State for education and Science and the Secretary of State for Wales. There is a separate Inspec-torate for Scotland responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland.62. D.E.S. has no regional structure for handling policy or regulatorymatters. The central functions of the department are carried out in london or in headquarters offices at Darlington, which deal with the major part of thework concerned with teachers&apos; pensions and salaries and with the departmentscomputer-based activities.Schools63. The departments regulatory and supervisory powers relating to schools in England are concerned mainly with the setting of minimum standards of provision, controlling the rate, distribution and nature of school building andsettling disputes. The department also grant aids a small number of directgrant schools which are not maintained or provided by the local educationauthorities. In addition to the direct grant schools there are a number of fee-charging independent schools which are not maintained or provided by localeducation authorities and receive no financial assistance from the department.All independent schools have to be officially registered under the Education
Acts and some are recognised as efficient by the Secretary of State. All schoolsof whatever kind are subject to inspection. The Welsh Office has similar func-tions in Wales, and the Scottish Office in Scotland.64. Devolution would be possible, though, if it led to the adoption ofsubstantially different policies for the organisation of the schools system,problems would be created for children moving from one region to another.If policy control remained at the centre many of the departments executive functions could be devolved.Further education65. Local education authorities are responsible for securing the provisionof adequate facilities for further education. D.E.S. exercises regulatory andsupervisory powers similar to those in relation to schools, but in this case its responsibilities extend to Wales. In addition, the provision at a local educationauthority establishment of further education of any course at advanced (i.e.higher education) level requires the Secretary of State&apos;s prior approval.Responsibility for dealing with proposals to provide such courses is delegated to Regional Staff Inspectors, who consider them in the light of the advice oftheir specialist colleagues and the recommendations made about them by theappropriate Regional Advisory Council for Further Education. The nineCouncils in England were established by voluntary co-operation among thelocal education authorities within each region and are financed by those authorities. Their membership includes representatives of the local educationauthorities, universities, principals and teachers of further education colleges and both sides of industry and business. The department appoints assessors to each Council. The Welsh Joint Education Committee carries out regionaladvisory council functions for Wales. In Scotland, the Scottish education department exercises regulatory and supervisory powers broadly similar tothose exercised in England and Wales by D.E.S., but there are no regionaladvisory councils.66. The catchment areas of institutions within the further education systemtend to be local, with most students attending colleges within their own localauthority area, and there is already an element of regionalism in the system inthe Regional Advisory Councils. Devolution would be possible, but, as certainspecialist courses are are present provided in particular regions only, co-ordination would be required if there were not to be unnecessary duplication.Teachers67. D.E.S. regulates and exercises general supervision over the teacher-training system in England and Wales, the training being given in colleges ofeducation maintained by local education authorities or voluntary bodies and inuniversities. It is responsible for policy on the demand, supply and distributionof teachers. It decides on questions of teachers&apos; status, probation and medicalrequirements. It administers the regulations on teachers&apos; misconduct. It is represented on the Management Panel of the Burnham Committees, which,under the provisions of the Remuneration of Teachers Act 1965, negotiate the pay of teachers in schools, establishments for further education and farm
institutes. It also negotiates the pay of university teachers. It administers the teachers&apos; superannuation scheme.68. In Scotland there is a separately administered system of teacher trainingin colleges which are almost entirely financed by grant from the scottish education Department. Registration with the General Teaching Council forScotland, which is the mark of recognition of the qualified teacher, is required of all teachers. Teachers&apos; salaries and superannuation differ from those inEngland and Wales and are separately negotiated.69. If regions took over these functions it could be expected that problems would arise in matching the supply of teachers to the demand and in ensuringan adequate distribution. At present some regions are notably more attractive to teachers than others, and there is considerable movement around the country.Joint action on training and qualifications would probably be necessary.Universities70. D.E.S. is responsible for the financing of universities throughout GreatBritain through the University Grants Committee, which consists of persons from the academic and business worlds appointed by the Secretary of State for education and Science after consultation with the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales. The Committee is not a statutory body, but exercisesexecutive power in the allocation of grant, approval of building projects, etc.at universities, as well as advising the government generally on university needs.Salary scales for university teachers are negotiated by the department with theuniversity authorities and teacher representatives. The department is alsoresponsible for policy relating to awards to students at all institutions of higher education and itself makes awards to certain classes of students, mainly inEngland and Wales; in Scotland these matters are usually the concern of theScottish Office.71. Unlike other institutions of further and higher education, universitiesdraw their students from all over the country and not primarily from theirown regions or localities, and the requirements of the universities for teaching and research are considered by the University Grants Committee on a GreatBritain basis. Although the universities have links with other institutions ofeducation and there might on this account be something to be said for givingresponsibility for them to the bodies responsible for other forms of education,there would be formidable obstacles in the way of replacing a British universitysystem by a number of regional systems. Responsibility for student awardscould be devolved, but regions might find it desirable to seek agreement on ratesof award.Non-vocational adult education and the youth service72. Provision for non-vocational adult education and the youth service ismade by local education authorities and independent bodies. D.E.S. grant aidsa number of the latter in England and Wales and also contributes directlytowards the cost of voluntary youth service, village hall and community centrecapital projects. The Scottish Office carries out similar functions in Scotland,where most education authorities operate a combined youth and community service.
73. Devolution of these functions would be possible.The arts, museums and libraries74. D.E.S. is responsible for government policy and expenditure on the arts,including in England national museums and galleries, and for national policyin respect of libraries. In Wales it is responsible for museums and librariesexcept for the National Museum and the National Library oi Wales, which arethe responsibility of the Welsh Office. The Scottish Office is responsible for thenational museums and galleries and the National Library of Scotland, forgovernment policy in respect of local libraries and museums and for government expenditure on the arts other than through the Scottish Arts Council. Thegreater part of government aid for the arts is distributed by the Arts Councilof Great Britain, through the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils and regionalarts associations in England (jointly financed by the Arts Council, by localauthorities and by private support) and directly to individual activities, including&quot;major clients&quot; such as Covent Garden.75. These functions could be devolved. Special arrangements might need to be made for the support of institutions which had more than, regionalsignificance.Civil scientific research76. The main responsibility of D.E.S. in this field is for the financing of thefive research councils -Science, Medical, Agricultural, Natural environment and Social Science-whose function is to foster research and training in theirrespective fields. They do so by giving grants (and in some cases by providingmajor items of equipment) to support work undertaken in universities and other institutions, by carrying out research programmes in their own institutions and by providing maintenance grants to postgraduate students. They are alsoresponsible for the payment of United Kingdom subscriptions to internationalscientific research organisations. Under the arrangements set out in the white paper &quot;Framework for Government Research and Development&quot; (Cmnd.5046) they will increasingly undertake research commissioned and paid forby other government departments.77. The departments responsibilities extend to Scotland and Wales. But theScottish Office in some cases bears a proportion of the cost of the work whichthe research councils conduct on a Great Britain basis.78. Devolution would not be possible without breaking up the research councils themselves, a step which might lead to loss of economies of scale andduplication of research effort.department of health and social securityGeneral statement of functions79. The Department of Health and Social Security (D.H.S.S.) assumed itspresent form when the Ministries of Health and Social Security were amal-gamated in November 1968, the Ministry of Social Security having itself
been formed in 1966 by a merger of the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance and the National Assistance Board. At the beginning of 1971 thestaff and responsibilities of the Children&apos;s Department of the Home office were transferred to the department. In broad terms the department is responsiblefor the central administration of the health services, for the promotion of the personal social services administered by local authorities and for the directprovision of social security benefits.Responsibilities outside England80. The department is responsible throughout Great Britain for all social security matters and for some general health functions, such as the licensing of medicines and the safety of drugs. In general it has no responsibilities inNorthern Ireland, except for matters relating to war pensioners and their dependants.Regional and local organisation81. In the main the work of D.H.S.S. headquarters is concentrated on the determination of policy and formulation of guidance for the executive branches.There are separate regional organisations for the health, social work servicesand social security sides of the department. On the health side two regional and Planning Divisions form, in association with professional counterparts, an administrative liaison service between the departments headquarters and the bodies hospital authorities, executive councils and local authorities whichin England provide services for which the Secretary of State has central respon-sibility. There are six Divisional Medical Officers providing a referee serviceand maintaining links with general practitioners throughout the country;links with dentists are maintained by Regional Dental Officers. The RegionalSocial Work Service, staffed by social work service officers, operates from nineregional offices three in London and six in the provinces and acts in liaison with the local authority social services organisations.82. On the social security side there are ten regional offices in England,central offices in Wales and Scotland and some 900 local offices throughout great Britain. Unemployment benefit is administered on behalf of D.H.S.S.from some 1,000 Employment Exchanges. The main records of the national insurance schemes are maintained at the Central Record Office at Newcastle,where a number of other large-scale jobs, including the issue of retirement pensions, widows&apos; pensions and family allowance order books, are also carriedout, while a central office at Blackpool deals with other specialised blocks ofwork, including work relating to pensions for the war disabled, family income supplement and attendance allowance. These large blocks of work do nothave to be done locally or regionally and can with advantage be centralised.Health and Social ServicesPresent position83. At present the responsibilities of D.H.S.S. in the health field are &quot;totake all steps as may be desirable to secure the preparation, carrying intoeffect and co-ordination of measures conducive to the health of the people&quot;
(Ministry of Health Act 1919) and &quot;to promote the establishment in England. . . of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the people of England . . . and the prevention,diagnosis and treatment of illness&quot; (National Health Service Act 1946). Thelargest single responsibility of the departments wide range of functions on the health side is the oversight of the National Health Service. In general thedepartment does not itself directly administer the National Health Service, its functions being of a supervisory and planning nature.Hospitals84. The management of National Health Service hospitals in England isentrusted to 14 Regional Hospital Boards, more than 300 Hospital management committees and 36 Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals. These bodieshave a wide measure of independence in hospital management and the planning of hospital and specialist services in their areas. The members of the regional hospital Boards are appointed by the Secretary of State. The departmentexercises overall control of the running costs of hospitals by means of annualestimates from Regional Hospital Boards and Boards of Governors, on thebasis of which money is advanced to them. From their funds Regional hospital boards allocate money to the Hospital Management Committees after retainingsufficient to cover the costs of their own administration and the services provideddirectly by them. The.capital programmes of the Boards are subject to approval by the Secretary of State, and the departments approval is required for individualschemes costing more than  500,000. Major schemes for teaching hospitalsare selected and financed by the department. In addition to these financial controls the department has certain responsibilities for the general management of the hospital building programme, including design and contract procedure.It seeks to improve the standard of administration and to promote greatermanagement efficiency. Where appropriate it co-ordinates hospital authorities&apos;purchasing functions and lays down specifications for items of medical and non-medical equipment.Executive Councils85. The second arm of the National Health Service in its present formconsists of the general medical, general dental, general opthalmic and pharma-ceutical services, for the provision of which Executive Councils are responsible in their respective localities. As with the hospital service, the functions ofD.H.S.S. in relation to the services provided by Executive Councils are of aregulatory and supervisory character. About a quarter of the members of executive Councils are appointed by the Secretary of State (the others being appointed by local professional committees and local health authorities).The Councils make payments to doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticiansand administer their contracts, but the scales of remuneration and the termsof service are determined by the department, in consultation with the professions concerned. The Executive Councils are financed by the department.Local authorities&apos; health service86. A third group of services forming part of the National Health service is provided by local authorities. The arrangements for providing most of these
services are subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. They includemeasures for the prevention and control of infectious disease, maternity and child health, health visiting, home nursing and home midwifery and theprovision of ambulance services.Scotland and Wales87. The Scottish Office has responsibility for all aspects of the national health Service in Scotland. There is separate legislation, but the service is organised on lines broadly similar to those in England in three parts-thehospital service, the general practitioner service and the local authority service.There are some significant differences; teaching hospitals, for example, aremanaged by Boards of Management (corresponding to the Hospital Manage-ment Committees) and are not directly responsible to the Secretary of State,and the ambulance service is organised on a national and not a local authoritybasis. On all matters of common concern there is close collaboration withD.H.S.S. The Welsh Office has, since 1969, had responsibility for the national health Service in Wales. The organisation is on similar lines to that in England;for the hospital service there is a Welsh Hospital Board which corresponds to the Regional Hospital Boards in England.Proposed changes in the National Health Service88. Radical changes in the reorganisation of the National Health Service inEngland will take place under the provisions of the National Health Service(Reorganisation) Act 1973, which is intended to come into effect on 1st April1974. The tripartite division will disappear, and hospitals, family practitionerservices and the local authority health service, together with the school health service, will become the responsibility of new National Health Service authoritiesacting on behalf of the Secretary of State. D.H.S.S. will continue to have thecentral responsibility for the service and for overall budgeting and accounting for health expenditure in England. It will determine the kind of services to beprovided and set long-term guidelines for effective regional and area planning.The major responsibility for the administration of the service will, as now, be delegated to local bodies. There is to be a two-tier system of administration,consisting of fourteen regional health authorities and about eighty area health authorities, the latter with areas conterminous with the new local authorityareas.89. The regional health authorities will be appointed by the Secretary ofState after consultation with interested organisations, including the universities,the main local authorities and the main health professions. They will beresponsible for general supervision and regional planning of the health service.Unlike the present Regional Hospital Boards, they will thus have responsibilityfor family practitioner and community and school health services as well ashospitals. They will be accountable to the Secretary of State both for theirown activities and for those of their area health authorities. They will distributemoney allocated to them by the department to the area health authoritiesaccording to approved plans and budgets, and they will be the main buildingagencies.
90. Members of area health authorities will be appointed by the regional health authority, except for those appointed by the corresponding local authority. Thechairman of each authority will be appointed by the Secretary of State. The area health authorities will be responsible for achieving national health care objectivesthrough the provision of comprehensive health services designed to meet theneeds of the communities in their areas. They will thus take over the responsi-bility of the local authorities for the community and school health services,and that of the present Executive Councils for family practitioners services, aswell as being responsible for the management of hospitals in their areas. Theywill be required to appoint special committees, of broadly the same compositionas Executive Councils, which will have direct responsibility for administering the contracts of the family practitioners (doctors, dentists, opticians, andpharmacists) and for handling their remuneration. The Act also provides for theappointment of a Health Service Commissioner to investigate complaints.It is intended that this appointment will, in relation to hospital services, be made some months before the health service reorganisation takes place and willextend to cover the remainder of the health services on 1st April 1974.91. The National Health Service in Scotland and Wales is being reorganisedalong similar lines, and with effect from the same date. In Wales the functionsof general supervision and regional planning which in England will be theresponsibility of regional health authorities will be directly exercised by the welsh Office. In Scotland the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1972provides the statutory basis for reorganisation (including a mandatory require-ment to appoint a Health Commissioner for Scotland). There is to be a single-tier administrative structure of fifteen health boards appointed by the Secretaryof State, each responsible for the whole range of health services in its area.Some activities best administered on an all-Scotland basis (such as the ambulanceservice and the execution of major building projects) will be provided forby a common services agency under a management committee drawn from the boards and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Each health board,and each of the four universities with a medical school, will be represented on a scottish Health Service Planning Council, which will advise the Secretary ofState on the future development of the service.92. It would be possible to devolve these functions and to have quite separateregional health services, but elaborate arrangements would need to be madefor their co-ordination. Under central service the question arises whether anyor all of the executive functions which it is proposed under the reorganisationscheme to devolve to regional and area health authorities could be put insteadin the hands of elected assemblies. Successive governments have given two reasons for not conferring these functions on local authorities. The first is thatthe professions believe that only a service administered by special bodies onwhich they are represented can provide a proper assurance of clinical freedom.The second is that the independent financial resources available to local authori-ties are not sufficient to enable them to take over responsibility for the wholeservice. On the other hand the new arrangements have been much criticised for the lack of a strong democratic element, and the establishment of regionalorgans of government would enable the matter to be looked at afresh.
Other health functions93. In addition to its responsibilities for the National Health Service, D.H.S.S.is directly responsible for the management of the special hospitals providedfor patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1959 who require treatmentunder conditions of special security, and also for the artificial limb and appliancecentres. In Scotland, the centres are located at hospitals and are an integral part of the hospital service. Other responsibilities of the department includeadministration of the food hygiene provisions of the Food and Drugs Act,the licensing of medicines and the administration of the Anatomy Act. Thedepartment also deals with legislation relating to the professions concerned withhealth and the social services, and has a number of functions with internationalaspects, including supervision of Port Health Authorities&apos; health control at ports, administration of the international sanitary regulations and liaison with international bodies such as the World Health Organisation. It is involvedin negotiations with the European Economic Community over health matters and reciprocity over health and social security arrangements.94. Except for the licensing of medicines and the administration of theAnatomy Act, which are exercised by the department on a Great Britain basis,these functions are the responsibility in Scotland and Wales ofthe Scottish and welsh Offices respectively (with, in some cases, separate Scottish legislation).But there is close co-operation among the departments where it is considered necessary or desirable to establish a uniform policy. In international mattersD.H.S.S. acts as the co-ordinating department for the United Kingdom.95. This miscellaneous group of functions dealing mainly with specialisedor international matters offers little scope for devolution.Social Services96. It is a function of D.H.S.S. to ensure the provision by local authoritiesand voluntary agencies in England of personal social services under the LocalAuthority Social Services Act 1970 and other social service legislation. Theservices include the care in the community of the mentally disordered, thephysically handicapped, the elderly and the homeless; the care and protectionof children; and provision for the socially inadequate, including alcoholicsand drug addicts. Local authorities are required to discharge their responsi-bilities in accordance with any guidance given by the Secretary of State. Thedepartments&apos; Social Work Service provides professional advice in the dischargeof these functions, and through its regional organisation offers support tolocal authorities, monitors their performance and informs the department ofneeds and developments in the field.97. The Welsh Office administers the social services in Wales. In Scotlandseparate legislation on social work is administered by the Scottish Officethrough its Social Work Services Group; social work departments in localauthorities provide an integrated service which covers probation and after-care in addition to the personal social services. Children&apos;s hearings have replacedjuvenile courts in Scotland and deal with children in need of compulsorycare and supervision, including most juvenile offenders; the hearings are organ-ised by local authorities and serviced by their social work departments.98. Devolution of these functions would be possible.
Social SecurityNational insurance scheme, family allowance and family income supplement99. D.H.S.S. administers social security on a Great Britain basis. The mainscheme is the national insurance scheme, under which persons in employmentpay contributions, partly on a flat-rate basis and partly graduated accordingto earnings. Self-employed and non-employed persons pay a flat rate only.These contributions are supplemented from general taxation, and part of the employed person&apos;s contribution is paid by his employer. The main benefits of the scheme are sickness, invalidity and unemployment benefits, maternitybenefits, widows&apos; benefit, retirement pensions and death grant. In addition there is an attendance allowance, which is without contribution conditions.100. Another part of the social security system is the family allowance scheme. This is not an insurance scheme; the money comes out of general taxa-tion. Allowances are paid to families with two or more children. In addition a family income supplement is payable to families whose normal gross weeklyincome is less than a prescribed amount, which varies according to the size of the family.101. Separate regional schemes would be possible, with contributions and rates of benefit tailored to match regional differences, including differences inthe cost of living. But there are strong pressures for uniformity in a matter inwhich standards can be measured in numerical terms, and these would belikely to continue under a scheme of devolution, so that in practice there mightbe little scope for regional variation of policy or administration. NorthernIreland has followed a policy of complete uniformity with Great Britain.War pensions and industrial injuries102. The department administers the schemes under which pensions and allowances are payable to those disabled in the armed services and in industry.The case for uniformity in the rates paid is as strong as with social securitypayments.Supplementary benefits103. The Supplementary Benefits Commission, an independent corporatebody appointed by the Secretary of State, administers a scheme of supple-mentary benefits. The scheme provides that everyone in Great Britain over theage of sixteen is entitled to supplementary benefit if his &quot;resources&quot; are lessthan his &quot;requirements&quot; as defined in the Acts and Regulations. The Supple-mentary Benefits Commission is responsible for determining claims to suchbenefit. Its functions are exercised through the local Social Security Offices.104. Because of the greater element of discretion involved, by comparisonwith national insurance, devolution might give some scope for regional variation.But the links between national insurance and supplementary benefit are soclose that responsibilities for the two would have to be exercised at the same level.home officeGeneral statement of functions105. The Home Office deals with such internal affairs of the United kingdom as are not assigned to other departments. The Home Secretary is the principal
channel of communication between the Crown and its subjects, and is respon-sible for relations between the United Kingdom Government and the Govern-ments of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Home Secretary is primarily responsible for the maintenance of law and order and the protection and safety of the Crown&apos;s subjects.106. The functions of the department relate to the administration of justice;efficiency of the police; control and administration of the prison service; general supervision over the probation and after-care services; civil defence; supervision of the fire service and responsibility in other fields of public safety; constitu-tional matters; control on the entry of foreign nationals and commonwealth citizens into the United Kingdom and naturalisation of foreign nationals;general responsibility for the co-ordination of policy on community relations;and many other miscellaneous subjects.Responsibilities outside England107. In Scotland Home Office responsibility is limited to matters with international implications immigration, extradition and nationality and toa few matters on which unified control is especially desirable, such as explosives,vivisection, poisons and dangerous drugs. Home Office responsibility extend to Wales for practically all its functions. In Northern Ireland Home Officeresponsibility is restricted to matters which were reserved under the Govern-ment of Ireland Act 1920, namely the Crown, elections to the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom, dignities and titles, and immigration, extradition andnationality.Regional and local organisation108. Extensive functions in relation to the police, fire and civil defence services, the administration of magistrates&apos; courts, the probation and after-care service and many of the departments miscellaneous subjects have beenconferred by Parliament on local authorities and other specially appointedlocal bodies, and in these fields the Home Office exercises a variety of regulatorypowers. Many of the departments responsibilities involve performing essentiallycentral functions in relation to the services administered and do not lendthemselves to regional operation. Where, however, the scale of operation is such that the aims of convenient administration and provision of economicaland efficient services are best achieved by inspection or supervision on a regionalor area basis, the staff concerned have been based accordingly at appropriateregional centres or area offices.109. For carrying out such of its own work as has been regionalised thedepartment has at present no unified regional organisation. regional organisations, each with boundaries adapted to the needs of the particular service, have been created in England and Wales for the purposes of prisonadministration, police inspection, probation and after-care inspection andsome other regulatory functions. Immigration staff are stationed mainly atthe sea and air ports throughout the United Kingdom.Administration of criminal justice110. The department is concerned in England and Wales with the formand content of the criminal law, the machinery and procedure of the criminal
courts, oversight of the administration and finance of the magistrates&apos; courts(which are provided by local committees of justices and paid for partly by thelocal authorities), advice on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, thetreatment of offenders, criminal statistics and research into the causes of crime.In addition, the Home Office is concerned with the law and practice relating toguardianship and adoption and to the matrimonial jurisdiction of magistrates&apos;courts.111. In Scotland, with its separate system of law, the Scottish Office is responsible for all these functions. There is close consultation between theScottish Office and the Home Office and there are joint organisations forcriminological research and compensation to victims of crimes of violence.But otherwise there are separate administrative arrangements.112. Devolution would permit regional differences in criminal law and thetreatment of offenders, reflecting any differences there might be in regionalconditions or climates of opinion. But except in the special Scottish circum-stances, these differences are probably not now, and are not likely to become,substantial. Moreover, the development of widely differing criminal codeswould cause inconvenience to the public and to legal practitioners, and mightbe held to conflict with the concept of securing for all citizens within the UnitedKingdom equality of treatment before the law. Any considerable devolution ofpowers to regional authorities would have the effect of transferring to them,and away from the central government, responsibility for the maintenance oflaw and order. If responsibilities for major policy were to remain at the centre,there would be no large block of subordinate policy-making or executivework which could usefully be devolved (with the possible exception of workrelating to the administration of magistrates&apos; courts).Police113. As part of his general responsibility for the maintenance of law andorder the Home Secretary is concerned to ensure the adequacy and efficiency of the police in England and Wales. He has a number of statutory powers and duties relating to the police as a whole and he is the police authority for theMetropolitan Police District. The Home Office acts as a central co-ordinatingand advisory body on a wide range of matters of common interest to police authorities and forces, and provides common services in relation to training,the scientific investigation of crime, criminal records and communications.Reports on the efficiency of provincial police forces are submitted annuallyto the Home Secretary by the Inspectorate of Constabulary.114. There is no Welsh Office responsibility for the police service in Wales,but in Scotland the service is the responsibility of the Secretary of State forScotland and operates under separate legislation. There are a separate ScottishInspectorate, training college and Police Advisory Board. But pay and allowances are negotiated on a Great Britain basis by the Police Council for Great Britain.There is close liaison between the Scottish Office and the Home Office on all matters affecting the police, especially where common policy for Great britain is thought desirable and is practicable in terms of the differences in criminal law and procedure.
115. Devolution of these functions to regional authorities would not be compatible with the retention of central government responsibility for thepreservation of law and order. There would be some loss of operational efficiency if the common services provided by the Home Office ceased to become-ordinated at national level. One possibility would be for the functions of a police authority to be exercised at regional level; but this might be regardedas being too remote for the exercise of democratic control over the police,and we have assumed that the local authorities will continue to be police authorities. There might then be scope for the provision at regional level ofsome common services, in relation to recruit training, for example.The prison service116. The Home Office directly administers the prison service in Englandand Wales; day-to-day supervision of individual prisons and the provisionof general support in operational matters has been delegated to four regional offices, as has also responsibility for a substantial part of the case-work onprisoners. But all policy formulation, general administration and management of the service, together with case-work and operational support in the moresensitive or specialised areas, remain the direct responsibility of headquarters.So far as possible, each region is designed to be self-sufficient in accommodatingprisoners sentenced in its area; but there are limits to this and the need forfrequent transfers of prisoners between regions remains unavoidable.Institutions offering special treatment facilities or designed for special classesof prisoners, including young offenders and women prisoners, are as yetprovided only on a national scale.117. The Scottish Office administers the penal system in Scotland. There is aseparate Scottish prison service. Conditions of service are the same as inEngland and Wales, and there is close liaison with the Home Office, which makes some services available to the Scottish Office.118. Since the prison service is in a sense the servant of the courts, it wouldbe appropriate for the responsibilities for prison administration and criminaladministration to be exercised at the same level. Prison administration is not a subject with an identifiable regional or local interest, and there would be dis-advantages of scale in breaking up the national prison service into a number of separate regional services. Scottish experience has shown that there is not always an adequate range of choice for the treatment of prisoners within the separate Scottish service. If general control is retained at the centre, it may bepossible to carry out much of the day-to-day administration in the regions.Probation and after-care119. The Home Office exercises a general supervision over the probationand after-care service in England and Wales, the service being administeredlocally by committees consisting mainly of justices and being paid for partly by the local authorities. The Home Secretary prescribes salaries and conditionsof service of probation officers, carries out inspections, administers a grant of80 per cent, and acts as a central co-ordinating and advisory authority on a wide range of matters of common interest to local probation services and to voluntary bodies active in the field.
120. In Scotland, the functions dealt with by the probation and after-careservice in England and Wales are the responsibility of the social work depart-ments of the local authorities.121. As in the case of the prison service, the links with the more generalfunction of criminal administration are so strong as to make it desirable forthe main responsibilities to be placed with the same level of government. there might be scope for the devolution of some executive functions, for example inconnexion with training and the provisions of homes and hostels.Civil defence122. Although the local government organisation of civil defence has since1968 been on a &quot;care and maintenance&quot; basis, the department has remainedresponsible in England and Wales for the co-ordination of plans and prepara-tions for home defence, including the provision of warnings and fall-outinformation to civil and military authorities, and it maintains a Civil DefenceCollege. The Scottish Office has corresponding functions in Scotland, and thereis very close co-operation between the departments. Policy and plans have tobe geared to those of the defence authorities, and the retention of central direc-tion is essential.The fire service and public safety123. The Home Secretary has central responsibility for the fire service inEngland and Wales and has various powers of control over and supervision of the local authority fire-brigades. The department is responsible for the inspection of the brigades and provides central services in such matters ashigher training, communications, research and statistics. It also has responsi-bilities in the field of fire prevention, control of explosives and various other aspects of public safety.124. The fire service in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Office.There are some differences in organisation, training and codes of practice, butthe service operates under Great Britain legislation and there is close co-opera-tion on all aspects of the work.125. A departmental committee which reported in 19701 recommendedwider responsibilities for the Home Office in relation to the fire service and fire prevention. The considerations which point to the retention of central directionare similar to those in the case of the police. Devolution would be possible,though there would be no apparent advantage and there is probably littleregional interest.Constitutional matters126. These include advice to the Sovereign on the grant of a variety ofhonours and privileges, the relationship in England between Church and State,electoral law and practice, the appointment and procedures of Royal Com-missions, tribunals of inquiry, etc., and any general measures designed to protect1 The Report of the Departmental Committee on the Fire Service (Chairman: Sir RonaldHolroyd) (Cmnd. 4371).
the liberties of the individual. Home Office responsibility for most of thesematters extends to Wales. The Scottish Office performs comparable functions in Scotland.127. There would be some scope for devolution, in relation, for example, toCommissions, etc. on regional matters and elections to local authorities.Immigration and nationality128. The Home Office is responsible for the control on the entry of foreign nationals and Commonwealth citizens into the United Kingdom and theconditions of their stay; also for nationality law, the grant of certificates ofnaturalisation and the registration of persons as citizens of the United Kingdomand colonies. It acts in these matters for the whole of the United Kingdom.These are essentially matters of national concern, requiring full central control.Community relations129. The department has general responsibility for the co-ordination ofpolicy on community relations, as well as specific responsibilities for the race relations Board and the Community Relations Commission, for research intorace relations, for the urban programme for aid in areas of special social need,and for co-ordinating the governments interests in voluntary social service.These responsibilities extend throughout Great Britain, except that the scottish and Welsh Offices have responsibility for the urban programmes and social services in Scotland and Wales respectively. In Scotland community relations were a responsibility of the Scottish Office.130. It is probable that public opinion would regard it as essential that bothlegislation designed to prevent racial discrimination and general policies to foster good community relations should be uniform throughout the country.There is a close relationship with immigration and other social and economic policies which must remain of central concern. But some devolution of executive functions might be possible, and would indeed be essential to theextent that responsibility for services such as housing and education had beendevolved.Miscellaneous matters131. These include betting, gaming and lotteries, obscenity, charities, shops,liquor licensing, dangerous drugs, vivisection, and the co-ordination of measuresto reduce discrimination against women. There are small inspectorates forthe purposes of the control of dangerous drugs and of experiments on animals,but for most of the subjects the department has no continuing executive functions and its responsibilities are confined to keeping a watch on the opera-tion of the existing laws and the possible need for amendment. executive responsibilities rest with the local authorities, the police or the courts or someother special body. Day-to-day supervision of charities, for example, is theresponsibility of the Charity Commission, and of gaming that of the GamingBoard.132. None of these functions has been transferred to the Welsh Office but,with separate Scottish law, the Scottish Office has responsibility in scotland for all except drugs and experiments on animals.
133. Devolution would be possible, though for some functions, notably thecontrol of dangerous drugs and experiments on animals, there would be stronggrounds for maintaining uniformity of policy and arrangements for inspection.There is no considerable volume of executive work which could usefully be devolved.lord chancellors departmentGeneral statement of functions134. The principal task of the Lord Chancellors Department can be broadlydescribed as that of legal administration. Important aspects of this are theadministration of the higher courts and the county courts, judicial appoint-ments, and general responsibility for the state of the civil law and, to a lesser degree, of the criminal law (which is primarily the responsibility of the HomeOffice).Responsibilities outside England135. The Lord Chancellors functions cover both England and Wales and,in respect of judicial appointments to the Supreme Court, Northern Ireland.In Scotland, where there is a separate system of law and legal administration,comparable functions (which are shared between the Secretary of State and theLord Advocate) are the responsibility of the Scottish Home and HealthDepartment or the Scottish Courts Administration, depending on the subjectinvolved.Regional and local organisation136. Administration of the courts is the task of Circuit Administrators ineach of the six circuits into which England and Wales are divided. Under the mare courts administrators, each of whom is responsible for the administrationof a group of courts in his area.Administration of the courts137. The Lord Chancellor has administrative responsibility, dischargedthrough a unified court service, for all courts in England and Wales abovethe level of the magistrates&apos; courts. In Scotland, the Secretary of StateS responsi-bility for the organisation and administration of the courts is exercised throughthe Scottish Courts Administration.138. Any devolution of this function would be a reversal of a process ofunified administration which has only recently begun in England and Wales,and could be considered only as part of a major transfer of government functions.Judicial appointments139. The Lord Chancellor is responsible for advising the Crown on theappointment of High Court and Circuit judges, recorders and metropolitanand provincial stipendiary magistrates, as well as judicial appointments to theSupreme Court of Northern Ireland. He is in practice always consulted beforeadvice is tendered on the appointment of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, LordsJustices of Appeal and certain other high judicial offices. He appoints the
Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court and county court and districtregistrars, as well as the lay magistrates in England and Wales and the legalchairmen of a great diversity of administrative tribunals. In the appointmentof magistrates he is assisted by advisory committees in each county and in eachborough having its own commission of the peace, and by this means he is keptclosely informed about the quality of candidates for appointment.140. Corresponding legal appointments in Scotland are made on the recom-mendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation with theLord Advocate.141. As the present procedure indicates, much reliance is placed in the selection of persons for appointment as magistrate on local knowledge and advice. Responsibility for the appointments could be devolved, though NorthernIreland experience shows that appointments might be regarded, whetherjustifiably or not, as having been made in a less impartial way if not removed from the local scene. Appointments to the higher courts could be devolvedonly as part of a wider scheme of devolution of responsibilities for the courts.&apos; &apos; il-&apos;      tLaw reform142. The Lord Chancellor has important responsibilities in the field of law reform. He is directly responsible for the state of the civil law in England andWales, except in those specialised fields for which another department may beresponsible (for example, the Department of Trade and Industry in respect of company law). Although the Home Secretary is responsible for the substantivecriminal law, the Lord Chancellor has a close interest in its operation, particu-larly in matters affecting the procedure of the higher courts. Much detailed work of law reform is now the primary responsibility of the Law Commission,but it generally falls to the Lord Chancellor to handle the recommendations for reform made by the Commission. In addition, the Lord ChancellorsDepartment services other bodies set up to deal with law reform projects in a wide variety of fields, and the several Rule Committees responsible for amendingand keeping up to date the rules of procedure in the courts.143. For Scotland there is a Scottish Law Commission, which reports tothe Lord Advocate. It works in close collaboration with the Law Commissionin all matters where assimilation of the two fields of law is likely to be practicable.144. Scope for devolution would depend on decisions taken on the devolution of the matters to which these functions relate.Other responsibilities145. The Lord Chancellor has a number of other responsibilities in thefield of the administration of justice. He is the Minister responsible for thework of the Law Commission and the Council on Tribunals, and for that of bodies such as the Lands Tribunal and the Pensions Appeal Tribunals. Inaddition, he has administrative responsibility for the Judge Advocate General&apos;office , the National Industrial Relations Court and the Restrictive PracticesCourt. He has general responsibility for the operation of the Legal Aid and advice Scheme, which is administered by the Law Society. Finally, he has
Ministerial responsibility for the work of the Public Record Office, the public trustee and the Land Registry, although these are separately accountableoffices and are not directly part of the Lord Chancellors Department. (It hasbeen announced that the Government proposes to merge the Public TrusteedOffice with the Official Solicitors Department, for which the Lord chancellor has direct responsibility, with a view to the eventual transfer or rundown oftrusts administered by the Public Trustee, and to hive off the Land Registryas an independent entity outside the civil service.)146. In Scotland similar but separate arrangements obtain for these services where they are specific to the Scottish legal system or to Scottish institutions;for example, there are the Department of the Registers of Scotland and theScottish Record Office.147. Except in the special circumstances of Scotland, there appears to belittle scope for the devolution of these functions. The Land Registry may be an exception.ministry of agriculture, fisheries and foodGeneral statement of functions148. The geographical extent of the responsibility of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (M.A.F.F.) varies with the subject matter.Broadly speaking, however, the Ministry carries the main responsibility forgovernment policy towards the supply of food and drink in the United Kingdom.To this end it has a responsibility, jointly with the other agricultural departments,to promote stable and efficient agricultural and fishing industries, capable of producing that part of the nation&apos;s food supply which needs to be produced at home, and it exercises executive powers in England and Wales for thesematters. It is concerned with other departments in the policy decisions and negotiations that determine the volume and nature of imports. In the interestsof the food consumer, it is concerned to ensure free competition under essentialsafeguards concerning the quality and safety of food and its description, andto establish the right conditions for efficient marketing. It is involved in the regulation of supplies in the interests of market stability by import and exportcontrols and is the department generally responsible for the food and drinksprocessing industries. It is responsible for ensuring that meat processing plantsoverseas which supply the United Kingdom market understand and are capableof complying with the United Kingdom public health requirements. In pursuingthe governments agricultural policies, the Ministry employs a wide range of measures, such as price support and specific grants, assistance toward capital investment, the improvement of livestock and crop production, the provisionof research, development and advisory services, and schemes to promote farmsafety and animal and plant health. In its fisheries policies it is similarlyresponsible for research, conservation, support and other matters, affectingfishing and fish as food. Since the beginning of 1973 many of the Ministry&apos;s functions have been exercised within the context of the law and policies of theEuropean Economic Community (E.E.C.) applicable in the United Kingdom.Responsibilities outside England149. In Scotland the Ministry is responsible only for operational controlof epidemic diseases of animals, the State Veterinary Service, the supply and
price of food to the consumer (though the Department of Agriculture forScotland undertakes promotional work in Scotland in the food processingfield), food defence planning and external relations. In Wales the Minister isjointly responsible with the Secretary of State for Wales for policy and administration in agriculture and fisheries, excluding animal health, arterialland drainage (other than certain appointments), land tenure, the supply and price of food to the consumer and certain, mainly international, fishery matters,in all of which the Minister retains sole responsibility. The Ministry&apos;s staff in wales are not part of the Welsh Office, but to assist the Secretary of State tocarry out his agricultural responsibilities the Ministry of Agriculture^ WelshSecretary acts also as the Secretary of State&apos;s adviser on agricultural matters;and the Ministry&apos;s Welsh Department at Aberystwyth maintains a close liaison with the Welsh Office (whose officials have no specific responsibility foragricultural functions). In a similar way, the Ministry&apos;s Fisheries Departmentadvises the Secretary of State on the fishery functions for which he sharesresponsibility.150. Agriculture and fisheries were transferred matters under the Govern-ment of Ireland Act 1920, but M.A.F.F. has responsibilities there, as elsewhere,for supplies of food and for food prices. The main agricultural and somefishery support schemes are by agreement applied on a United Kingdombasis, the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland acting as agent ofM.A.F.F. in administering them in the province. The Secretary of Stateresponsible at Westminster for Northern Ireland affairs joins in policy decisions on these matters.Regional and local organisation151. Within England and Wales M.A.F.F. has a substantial regional net-work. England is divided into seven regions with regional offices. In Wales the regional office organisation is embodied in the Ministry&apos;s Welsh Department.The regional offices and the Welsh Department co-ordinate the work of and give specialist technical services to the divisional offices (twenty-six in Englandand five in Wales), which have the first responsibility for administering the grant and subsidy schemes and for providing advisory and veterinary services forfarmers and growers in their area. The Ministry&apos;s Sea Fisheries Inspectorate,which is responsible for enforcement of conversation regulations, functionsindependently of the regional and divisional offices and has local offices in themain fishing ports.152. Any work of the department which has a local significance is devolvedto regions. In general, this applies to any block of work where the volume is sufficient for economic working and to enable the necessary expertise to be developed. Where necessary, this work is carried out within a framework ofrules and procedures drawn up centrally in consultation with regions. Regionalstaff have authority to deal with all matters delegated to them subject, as necessary, to consultation with headquarters in special cases or where nationalconsiderations could apply.153. There are nine Regional Panels (seven in England, two in Wales) whichare non-statutory advisory bodies whose members include farmers, landownersand farm workers. Their main function is to assist with the two-way channel
of communication between the government and the agricultural industry. they also advise Ministers on disputed grant and subsidy decisions and othermatters.Food policy154. A significant part of the Ministry&apos;s work arises from its responsibilities for food, which extend over the whole United Kingdom. Since the UnitedKingdom is a major food importer/exporter and manufacturer, international agreements governing trade in food are of great importance, and the Ministry(together with other departments, such as the Department of Trade and Industryand the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) is responsible for their negotiation and administration. The Ministry is also concerned with agricultural and foodconsiderations arising from bilateral trade agreements with Eastern Bloccountries, tariff negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,and work in connexion with other international organisations.155. The Ministry also prescribes, through legislation, standards for the composition, quality and labelling of food and negotiates, on behalf of theUnited Kingdom, international agreements on standards. A further responsi-bility is that arising from government concern with the level of food prices inthe United Kingdom, and the Ministry also determines the retail price for milk.It administers aid to the bacon curing industry in the form of payments orlevies designed to stabilise their collective return. National planning ofemergency food supplies is carried out by the Ministry.156. Devolution of responsibility for these matters would require close co-operation between regions. The international work could not be devolved.If regions chose to adopt their own standards, inconvenience would be caused to industry and there would be difficult problems of enforcement.Price support measures157. A major part of the support of the agricultural industry comes fromprice support measures. The administration of these measures is the responsi-bility of the three agricultural departments, but the levels at which prices for a range of products are guaranteed are decided jointly by Ministers in the lightof an annual review of the state, of the industry with the three farmers&apos; unions and also the comments of other members of the E.E.C. These guarantees applyto cereals, fatstock, milk, potatoes, eggs, sugar beet and wool. For most of these products, if the average price realised by producers collectively throughout theUnited Kingdom falls below the guaranteed price, a deficiency payment ismade to producers equal to this difference. For milk and sugar, the governmentensures that, taking one year with another, the consumer meets the full cost ofthe guarantee so that no deficiency payment is necessary. Since July 1971import levy schemes for beef and veal and milk products other than butter and cheese, a revised import levy scheme for cereals, and duties on mutton and lamb have been operated. Their aim has been to limit the cost of exchequer support and to protect the home market from disruption.158. Entry into the E.E.C. will involve radical changes in the system ofagricultural support, and on 1st February 1973 the United Kingdom adopted
the Community support system, but not Community prices. This system isbased on the maintenance of market prices as distinct from supplementingmarket prices, which has been the main feature of the United Kingdom&apos;ssystem. Maintenance of market prices is brought about by levies on imports,export refunds and intervention measures (which include support buying andincentives for private storage). The management of market prices under theCommunity system requires considerable executive machinery to collect pricedata, license imports and exports, collect levies and make payments. these functions will be carried out by Customs and Excise and the InterventionBoard for Agricultural Produce, which is a United Kingdom department under the Agricultural Ministers applying the detailed Community rules andhandling Community funds. The United Kingdom&apos;s present system of supportwill be gradually phased out during the transitional period, and for a time thetwo systems will be operated in parallel.159. If responsibility for price support measures were devolved it is most unlikely that regions could make use of them to influence to any significantextent the development of farming within their areas. Even under the deficiency round system outlined in paragraph 157 above, so long as there was free movement of produce there would be many important factors over whichregions would have no control and it is likely that they would collaborateclosely in determining policy. Such collaboration would be essential under theE.E.C. common agricultural policy. There is no scope for regional variations in price support policy, and all member countries of the E.E.C. are requiredto comply with decisions on prices and other matters taken in international legislation in Brussels. This leaves little scope for devolution of policy,though regional authorities might administer support schemes as agents ofthe Ministry.Grants and subsidies160. In addition to the price guarantees, M.A.F.F. administers a number of grants or subsidies which are available to farmers and growers. These fall into two main groups, those which directly affect the producers&apos; income, suchas the subsidies to encourage the rearing of calves for beef and the use of fertilisers, and the grants designed to encourage investment in fixed capital and the amalgamation of uneconomic farms. The grants and subsidies availablein Scotland are in many cases identical and in other cases very similar to thosein England and Wales, although there are some additional grants, for example,those designed to develop agricultural production on crofts in Scotland.161. Assumption of responsibility for these matters by the regions could result in variations in the rates of grants paid to farmers. The scope for variationhas been considerably reduced by the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the E.E.C.The Community has laid down principles to which aids for capital investment and structural improvement should conform and, while these permit theexisting system of capital grants to continue broadly as at present and on linesconsidered appropriate in the United Kingdom, it is probable that inter-nationally agreed measures will assume a growing importance.Animal health162. This function of M.A.F.F. includes matters such as control overimports of certain animals, including poultry, carcasses and animal products
or material which might introduce disease; measures to eradicate or preventthe spread of certain diseases (including responsibility for the control ofepidemic diseases, such as foot-and-mouth, in the whole of Great Britain,but not in Northern Ireland); policy on raising health standards in livestock;and the welfare of farm animals. The department, in collaboration with D.H.S.S.,also has responsibility for measures to protect human health from diseasecarried by animals or animal products, and for the statutory control of medicines.The Scottish Office has, with the exception mentioned above, similar respon-sibilities in Scotland.163. Devolution would permit regional variations in such important matters as the decision whether to eradicate certain animal diseases by slaughter orto contain them by vaccination. This might make more difficult the co-ordinatedaction needed in the event of outbreaks of animal disease. Close co-operation would be required in reaching decisions on policies for control of imports.Plant health and seeds164. M.A.F.F. is responsible for a number of measures designed to protectplant health, including controls over the importation of plants and plantproducts, regulations designed to prevent the spread of specified pests anddiseases and certification schemes to encourage the marketing of healthystocks. The Scottish Office has responsibility for plant health matters in Scotland,but although there is separate legislation the controls are similar. The PlantVariety Rights Office, which is a separate statutory organisation though itoperates as part of the Ministry&apos;s headquarters, acts under the general directionof the three agricultural Ministers. It administers legislation which enablesbreeders and discoverers of new varieties of plants to be granted statutoryrights throughout the United Kingdom. The department is also responsiblefor measures designed to ensure that seed offered to growers is of a satisfactorystandard. Regulations made under Part II of the Plant Varieties and SeedsAct 1964 apply to the United Kingdom; there is separate legislation underSeeds Acts, but the controls exercised by the three agricultural departments aresimilar.165. E.E.C. regulations will require many aspects of seed production andtrade to be regulated, and the exercise of regional control of these matterswould therefore be subject to many limitations. Although outbreaks of plantdiseases are not usually as difficult to control as outbreaks of animal diseases,regions would need to co-operate closely to ensure that there was no increasein plant pests and diseases as a result of varying regulations. Co-operation would also be needed to ensure that breeders of new plant varieties did nothave to register their rights in each region individually.Advisory services166. The Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, which providesfree advice to farmers and growers in England and Wales, is part of M.A.F.F.It also provides for a fee certain analytical and diagnostic and drainage designservices. In Scotland these services are provided by the three agriculturalcolleges (Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen).
167. Devolution would enable regions to develop services closely related to the nature of agriculture in their areas. The more specialist services, however,can most economically be made available on a national scale.Land tenure168. Under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, as amended, M.A.F.F.has certain responsibilities relating to disputes arising between landlords andtenants of agricultural holdings. The Scottish Office exercises comparablefunctions in Scotland.169. Devolution would be possible. It might lead to increasing disparitiesin the law and custom governing land tenure.Smallholdings170. The department is responsible under Part HI of the Agriculture Act1970 for the administration of functions concerning the provision and improve-ment of smallholdings by local authorities. It is also empowered to providesmallholdings direct, and the land held for this purpose includes a number ofsmallholdings estates managed on an agency basis by the Land SettlementAssociation. In Scotland, land settlement has always been administered directby the central government, and smallholdings in the ownership of the Secretaryof State are managed and maintained by the Scottish Office. These functionscould be devolved.Land drainage and flood warning service171. Arterial land drainage, including flood protection and sea defence,in England and Wales is the responsibility of river authorities (whose functionswill be taken over by the proposed new regional water authorities) and internaldrainage boards; local authorities also have general land drainage powers.M.A.F.F. provides grants for capital works and is responsible for the east coast Storm Tide Warning Service and the London Tidal Flood warning system. The Scottish Office has broadly similar responsibilities for drainagein Scotland.172. Devolution would be possible. It would probably make little difference in practice since technical rather than policy considerations largely determine the form which land drainage and flood protection measures take. Some regions would have to carry a greater burden of expenditure than others. It wouldseem to be desirable for general responsibilities for these functions and for thefunctions proposed for the new regional water authorities to be exercised at thesame level.Wages and labour173. Wages and conditions of service for farm workers in England andWales are regulated by the Agricultural Wages Board. The chairman and independent members of the Board are appointed by the Minister for Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, and its secretariat is provided by the Ministry. Whilethe Board&apos;s deliberations are autonomous, M.A.F.F. is responsible for the enforcement of its minimum wages regulations in England and Wales. Separate
but parallel arrangements apply in Scotland. Training of farm workers is organised by the Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Industry TrainingBoard established by the Secretary of State for Employment under the industrial training Act 1964. Responsibility for the Board will be transferred to agricul-tural Ministers during 1974.174. Devolution of responsibility for wages would permit different minimum wage levels, reflecting differences in the profitability of agriculture in the variousregions. Lower minimum wage rates might, however, create difficulties about&quot;unfair&quot; competition in an industry which in many other respects would be regulated on a national basis, and might be regarded as undesirable by the farmworkers&apos; unions. It is easier to envisage the devolution of responsibility fortraining, though this would probably entail the break up of the Training Board.Safety and pollution175. M.A.F.F. is responsible for the safety of workers and children on farms,and administers a variety of legislation on such matters as the guarding ofagricultural machinery, the use of tractor safety cabs, the avoidance of accidentsto children and the protection of workers using poisonous substances. it also operates the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme, under which no productfor use in agriculture, forestry and food storage practice is allowed on the marketwithout a prior scientific screening of its potential hazards to humans, other forms of life and the environment. The department is also concerned withthe effects of environmental pollution caused by and affecting the agricultural industry. The Scottish Office is responsible for these functions in Scotland,but policy is in all cases determined jointly and embodied in legislation which isuniform throughout Great Britain.176. If devolution led to the adoption of different standards, the manufac-turers of the products concerned (farm machinery, agricultural chemicals andso on) would have to produce different products for each region.Infestation control177. The department is responsible for enforcing the statutory responsibilityplaced on occupiers of land to keep certain agricultural pests under controland for supervising the work of local authorities in keeping their districtsas free as possible from rats and mice. The Scottish Office is responsible inScotland. Devolution would be possible.Fisheries178. The sea fisheries responsibilities of M.A.F.F. include conservation,fishing rights and the protection of the marine environment. Action for all ofthese purposes has to be taken on an international basis, and the ministry in conjunction with other departments is responsible for formulating policyand representing the United Kingdom on the various international organisa-tions which deal with these matters. Support is also provided for the fishing industry in various ways, some administered by the fisheries departments and others by the White Fish Authority (funded on a Great Britain or UnitedKingdom basis from M.A.F.F. Votes) and the Herring Industry Board (similarly
funded from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland). Aswith agriculture, entry into the E.E.C. is likely to bring administrative changesaffecting market intervention and import policy ; but, as there have been noguaranteed prices for fish producers, differing administrative needs may emerge.The administration of salmon and freshwater fisheries in England and wales is largely in the hands of river authorities (whose functions will be taken overby the regional water authorities), which have byelaw-making powers; thedepartment has, however, certain supervisory and appellate powers, and also has responsibility for the control of diseases of salmon and freshwater fish.In Scotland the Scottish Office has powers similar to M.A.F.F. Some of thesea fish conservation byelaws and arrangements for their enforcement are different, and there are differences too on the enforcement side; local admini-stration of salmon fisheries, for example, is in the hands of District SalmonFisheries Boards. M.A.F.F. also to a large extent covers the Northern Irelandfisheries interest in problems with international implications.179. The sea fishing industry is more important to some parts of the UnitedKingdom (for example, the east coast of Scotland, Yorkshire and Humbersideand East Anglia) than to others, and devolution would allow scope for this to be reflected in regional priorities. But fishing vessels from different portsoften fish the same grounds and supply the same markets, and if regions adopteddifferent support policies it might be felt that there was an element of unfair competition by the most heavily subsidised fleets. On the conservation side,the regulations are internationally agreed and there would be little scope for local variations. Devolution of functions in relation to freshwater fisheriesdoes not present problems of a similar character, though co-operation wouldbe necessary in the control of diseases of salmon and freshwater fish and inthe arrangements for research, now carried out by the Ministry.Research and development180. The main responsibility for the organisation and development of agri-cultural research rests with the Agricultural Research Council, but M.A.F.F.has important functions in this field and in the fields of agricultural development,food and fisheries. It directly administers its own establishments carryingout research and development and finances research and development carriedout by the Agricultural Research Council, the National Environment research council and certain non-governmental bodies, especially the four FoodResearch Associations. The Scottish Office has comparable functions inScotland in agricultural research and development.181. Devolution could be expected to lead to a more diverse pattern ofagricultural research, but arrangements for the sharing of services would be needed if duplication were to be avoided.Forestry182. The Forestry Commission, which is charged with the general duty of promoting the interests of forestry and development of afforestation and theproduction and supply of timber and forest products in Great Britain, worksunder the general direction of the three Forestry Ministers the Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
183. Devolution would be possible. A single Forestry Commission could probably not then be retained, but planning and environmental aspects mightbe assisted.department of trade and industryGeneral statement of functions184. The Department of Trade and Industry (D.T.I.) was set up in October1970 and was made responsible for the functions of the Board of Trade andof parts of the Ministry of Technology. Its general aim, as then set out in theWhite Paper &quot;The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot; (Cmnd. 4506),is to assist British industry and commerce to improve their economic and technological strength and competitiveness. All statutory functions within thedepartments field are exercisable by the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, who is primarily concerned with the strategic issues of policy andpriority which determine the operations of the department as a whole. He is supported by the Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs, who is also inthe Cabinet, and by the Minister for Industry, the Minister for IndustrialDevelopment and the Minister for Aerospace and Shipping, who each have a status equivalent to that of a Minister in charge of a separate department not represented in the Cabinet.185. Entry into the European Communities has affected the departmentover almost the full range of its responsibilities. Some of the more important aspects of its work now being developed in a Community framework are trade policy and tariffs, regulation of companies, competition policy, reduction of technical barriers to trade, patents and trade marks, assistance to industry,regional industrial policy, energy policy and advanced technology.Responsibilities outside England186. The functions of the department extend with certain exceptions tothe whole of Great Britain. The exceptions are electricity in Scotland, forwhich the Scottish Office is responsible, and tourism, where responsibility forthe Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards lies with the Scottish and Welsh Offices.In addition, the departments statutory functions in connexion with theadministration of the Acts relating to bankruptcy and companies liquidationdo not extend to Scotland, where the Official Receivers&apos; service does not operate.The department also exercises certain of its functions in Northern Ireland.These relate either to matters which were reserved to the United kingdom parliament under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or to functions expresslyconferred on the department by United Kingdom legislation; examples areexternal trade, shipping, civil aviation, aerospace, patents, designs, trade marksand copyright.Regional and local organisation187. The departments main regional network is based on eight regionsin England, and on Scotland and Wales, which are treated as single units.The regional offices represent the department in its dealings with industry,local authorities, the regional offices of other government departments andother local bodies and organisations in each region. The regional offices are
also responsible for administering selective assistance to industry in assisted areas and for aspects of regional industrial development and export promotion.In addition some parts of the departments work are handled through specialistlocal offices, including those of the Export Credits Guarantee Department,the Coastguard Service, Mercantile Marine Offices, offices handling regional development grants and the residual investment grants, and the Official Receiversin bankruptcy and company liquidation.188. Work is devolved to regional offices or retained at headquartersaccording to where it can best be done and the extent to which it requireslocal contacts and local knowledge. When work is devolved to regional offices,they operate within rules or guidelines prescribed by headquarters so as toensure reasonable consistency throughout the country. One example of regionaldevolution is the scheme of selective assistance to industry, where, within limits, the regional offices are free to decide without reference to headquarterswhether or not financial assistance should be provided to applicants in the region.Overseas commercial relations and tariffs189. D.T.I. is responsible for the protection of United Kingdom commercial interests overseas, for commercial policy and the negotiation of trade agree-ments. It also has responsibility for the policy and administration of the UnitedKingdom protective tariffs, and is concerned with tariff questions arising frominternational tariff negotiations. It examines applications for changes in importduties and for the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.It also administers arrangements for remitting duty in special circumstances.These functions cannot be devolved.Export promotion and overseas trade190. The department is responsible for the promotion of exports from theUnited Kingdom. This is done under the direction of the British OverseasTrade Board, whose President is the Minister for Trade and Consumer affairs and whose membership includes industrialists and representatives of otheroutside interests. The department provides an export information service to industry and commerce, largely through its regional offices. It also handlesgovernment support for overseas Trade Fairs and British Weeks. It is respon-sible for export licensing. The Export Credits Guarantee Department is a distinct and semi-autonomous part of the department which is constituted toprovide a self-supporting credit insurance facility for British exports of goods and services. It also provides investment insurance for British companies operating overseas.191. There would be some scope for devolution, e.g. of the promotion of exports. But few industries are localised within a single region and close co-operation would be needed. If the insurance function were to be devolved,there would be a smaller base over which to spread the risks.Counter-inflation programme prices192. The department, in association with the Treasury and Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, is responsible for the prices aspects of the
counter-inflation programme. Executive responsibility for implementation ofthe prices aspects of the Prices and Pay Code rests with the Price Commission.Control of insurance premiums is, however, the direct responsibility of thedepartment. These functions must remain under central control.Companies regulation and bankruptcy193. D.T.I. is responsible in general for the basic legal framework for the regulation of industrial and commercial enterprises. Through the Registrarsof Companies in London and Edinburgh it deals with the incorporation of companies and the collection and custody for public inspection of statutorydocuments and returns made by companies. It is responsible through the inspector General of Bankruptcy and Companies Liquidation for the OfficialReceivers&apos; service. The Official Receivers are attached to the courts in Englandand Wales for the purpose of administering bankruptcies and compulsoryliquidations. The department also exercises functions over trustees in bankruptcyand liquidators.194. Serious inconvenience would be caused to persons concerned in anyway with industry and commerce if devolution led to substantial disparitiesin the law in different parts of a single market area. It is recognised on bothsides of the border between England and Scotland that opportunity should betaken, where possible, to remove existing differences in the law. NorthernIreland made little independent use of its powers in this field.Competition policy and consumer protection195. D.T.I. is responsible for policy on monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices. Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, however, the Director Generalof Fair Trading appointed by the Secretary of State will take over much ofthe work of administering this policy (as well as assuming the duties of theformer Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements). He will also have important functions in relation to consumer protection. But the department willcontinue to have a general co-ordinating responsibility for consumer policyand for much of the related legislation, such as the Trade Descriptions Actsand the Weights and Measures Act. These functions extend to the whole ofGreat Britain. In Northern Ireland, either Westminster legislation has applieddirect or Northern Ireland legislation has closely followed the Westminsterpattern.196. Devolution might reduce substantially the effectiveness of any controls.If an industry which could be regarded as monopolistic was largely locatedwithin one region, the only effective controls could be applied by that region,but the region might be more concerned with securing employment than withprotecting consumers, the majority of whom were in other regions. If, on theother hand, the industry were spread amongst several regions, strict anti-monopoly controls might be circumvented by locating new operations inregions with the less rigorous controls. In most other aspects of consumer protection, e.g. trade descriptions, where advertising and standards of manufac-tured goods are involved, differences in regional regulations would be likely tocreate difficulties for industry and to have adverse effects on the efficiency ofthe economy without conferring corresponding benefits on the consumer.
Marine functions197. D.T.I. is responsible for policy relating to the United Kingdomshipping industry and international shipping questions, including the law ofthe sea and negotiation of shipping agreements with overseas countries. It alsoadministers the Merchant Shipping Act and is concerned with matters affectingmerchant seamen. Other responsibilities concern safety at sea, standards, of construction and equipment of ships, wreck and salvage, the administrationof the Coastguard Service and measures connected with the prevention of pollution, particularly by oil. These matters are of national and internationalrather than regional significance, and there is little scope for devolution.Patents and copyrights198. The department has general responsibility for patent, trade mark andcopyright matters in the United Kingdom. The Patent Office, which is partof D.T.I., is responsible for the examination of specifications and the grant ofpatents. The department also registers designs and trade marks. It is responsibletoo for matters falling under the Copyright Act, and for related subjects.It conducts international negotiation on these matters. If they were to come under regional control, it would be necessary for patents, trade marks andcopyrights to be registered in different regions.Industrial Development Executive199. D.T.I. is responsible in Great Britain for the sponsorship of most of manufacturing industry and for the service and distributive trades, for theindustrial components of regional policy and for financial assistance to industry under a number of statutes, including the Industry Act and the Science and technology Act. These functions have mainly been grouped together in theIndustrial Development Executive under the Minister for IndustrialDevelopment.200. The sponsorship function extends to most manufacturing industry(exceptions being the food and drink industry, the pharmaceutical industryand the building and building materials industries, for which M.A.F.F.,D.H.S.S. and D.O.E. respectively are responsible), the mining and energyindustries and the service and distributive trades. It involves a responsibilityfor handling the problems which the industries present to the government,and for assisting them to strengthen their economic and export performance and technological strength. It includes the placing of research and developmentcontracts with industry. The department has powers under a number of statutesto give financial assistance to private industry where necessary and, apartfrom the general provisions of the Industry Act, it has special powers to assistthe development of tourism and to encourage mineral exploration. It is also concerned to enable United Kingdom industry to compete effectively in supply-ing goods and services for oil and gas developments, particularly in UnitedKingdom waters. The department has a responsibility for looking after thespecial needs and interests of small firms.201. Most industries, and many individual companies, are organised on a united Kingdom basis, with little concentration in particular regions. devolution-tion would mean that their needs would be looked at on a regional and not a
national basis. In general this would be likely to involve some duplication anda wasteful use of resources. In some instances tourism is perhaps an example devolution might allow government assistance to be more satisfactorily tailoredto the needs of the regional industry.202. D.T.I. is generally responsible for regional industrial policy, which is designed to reduce the imbalance between some of the less prosperous regionsand the rest of Great Britain. In particular it offers positive inducements byway of regional development grants and selective financial assistance to firmsprepared to develop in the assisted areas, and controls industrial developmentoutside the development areas by means of industrial development certificates.The department is responsible for the designation of the assisted areas. regional development grants are administered from offices sited in the development areas, and selective financial assistance to industry for regional purposes is administered in large measure by the departments main regional organisation,which is also responsible for the allocation of D.T.I. factories built and managed by the Industrial Estate Corporations. The department also has residual res-ponsibility for the administration of investment grants and assistance underthe Local Employment Acts.203. Regional incentives to industry form part of the machinery by which,for economic and social reasons, funds are redistributed from the richer to the poorer parts of the country. Only the central government can order thatredistribution and decide which regions should benefit and by how much;the scope for devolution is therefore restricted to the way in which the money is actually spent. This scope may be further restricted by the need to avoidwasteful competition between the regions; by the interest which the centralgovernment would continue to have in the treatment of industries which wereimportant to the United Kingdom as a whole; by the need to ensure generallythat the exercise of regional choice in this important field did not interfere too much with the central governments management of the economy; and possibly by E.E.C. rules governing the kind of assistance which industry might be offered.Aerospace204. The sponsorship function of D.T.I. includes the aerospace industry.Funds are provided for civil aircraft research, and for launching selected civil aircraft and aero-engines, notably at present Concorde and the RB 211 engine.These responsibilities include the governments relations with Rolls Royce(1971) Ltd. The department is also responsible for certain aspects of spacepolicy, including the National Space Technology Programme and internationalspace collaboration, other than that relating to scientific programmes. these functions have a national importance, and it would be impracticable to devolvethem.Research and development205. D.T.I. is responsible for three main fields of applied research anddevelopment. The largest of these relates to civil aerospace. The departmentformulates its aerospace research and development objectives in consultation
with industry, the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence, advisorybodies and other organisations. Most of the work required to meet thoseobjectives is commissioned and paid for by the department and carried outthrough the agency of the Procurement Executive. The second main blockcomprises the reactor and other nuclear research and development undertaken by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Thirdly, there is the workof the five D.T.I. Industrial Research Establishments (the National PhysicalLaboratory, the National Engineering Laboratory, the Safety in Mines research establishment, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist and the WarrenSpring Laboratory), the non-nuclear work of the Atomic Energy Authority,extramural contracts which the department places direct with industry and universities, and the grant-aided work of the Industrial Research Associations.Responsibility for commissioning most of the third block of research anddevelopment is channelled through a series of Requirements Boards on whichcustomer interests in the department, in industry and elsewhere are represented.The department also provides a technical information service to industry.It is responsible for the National Research Development Corporation. Withfew exceptions there is no specifically regional interest in these functions, andthere is no scope for devolution.Standards and quality assurance206. The department is responsible for general government policy on UnitedKingdom and international standards, quality assurance and metrication.It co-ordinates United Kingdom interests in E.E.C. directives and in action by other intergovernmental bodies to eliminate technical barriers to trade.There is no scope for devolution.Nationalised industries and public corporations207. D.T.I. is responsible for government policy towards the nationalisedcoal, gas, electricity (except in Scotland) and steel industries in Great Britain.It exercises certain statutory powers and responsibilities laid down in the nationalisation Acts, including the appointment of members to the boards of these industries and to the relevant statutory Consumer Councils. It approvesthe industries&apos; capital investment programmes, provides public finance forthis purpose, sets financial objectives and is accountable to Parliament for theefficiency and performance of the industries. The department exercises similarresponsibilities for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which is apublic corporation.208. In each case devolution of full responsibility would involve the breaking up of the nationalised industry into separate regional units (and would allow a region to denationalise a particular industry). The industries are at presentorganised to serve a national purpose, though with regional considerations in mind. Their replacement by a number of separate competing regional units would give rise to immense technical problems and a need for large-scaleco-ordination if overall efficiency were not to be very seriously impaired. Theindustries need large capital expenditure, which can be more readily provided on a national basis. But there is some scope for devolution. Distribution and sale of the product of some industries, as distinct from production, might, forexample, be made a regional responsibility. In the case of electricity in Scotland,responsibility for generation might also be devolved.
Energy policy209. D.T.I. is responsible for the co-ordinated development of energysources and the promotion of economy and efficiency in the supply, distribution and use of fuel and power. In the case of the nationalised energy industriesthis duty can be met through the specific responsibilities mentioned under theprevious heading. Close contacts are maintained with the oil industry, and thedepartment licenses petroleum and natural gas exploration and productionwithin the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf.210. Devolution of responsibility for the control of petroleum and gasexploration would enable the regions to plan the use of resources in accordancewith their particular needs; they might, for example, wish to impose conditionsabout the locations in which oil was processed. On the other hand, there are important international aspects, both in the negotiation of rights to exploit the resources of the sea bed and in the international composition of many ofthe companies concerned.Safety and health211. In addition to safety at sea (paragraph 197 above) D.T.I. has certain other safety and health responsibilities, mainly in relation to mines and quarries,nuclear installations, petroleum drilling and production installations and safety of pipelines. These functions are exercised by the appropriate policydivisions and inspectorates, and by the Safety in Mines Research Establishment,but it is intended that some of them will pass to the proposed Safety and HealthCommission (see paragraph 227). Many civil aviation safety aspects are now the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority, but the department has itsown Safety Adviser and an independent Accident Investigation Branchresponsible for investigating accidents to civil aircraft. Uniformity of law and practice is obviously desirable, and there is little scope for devolution.Civil aviation212. The department is responsible for four groups of civil aviation matters commercial and economic aspects of civil aviation, international aspectsof air services, airports, and safety and security. The first group includesresponsibility for government policy towards the nationalised airlines and inrelation to the Civil Aviation Authority; the Authority is responsible for mostcivil aviation functions, including such matters as economic and safety regulationof airlines, air traffic control and airworthiness requirements. The department is primarily responsible for the international aspects of civil aviation, includingthe United Kingdom civil aviation relations with overseas territories. its responsibilities for airports extends to matters relating to the British airports authority, the third London Airport, and problems concerned with aircraftnoise. The Civil Aviation Safety Adviser is also concerned with civil aviationsecurity.213. The international and security aspects of civil aviation could not be devolved. There would be scope for devolution of responsibilities in relationto the provision of domestic air services and airports.
department of employmentGeneral statement of functions214. The Department of Employment assumed its present form on there organisation of central government departments in October 1970. nearly all its functions are in the manpower field. It performs some functions as agentfor other government departments.Responsibilities outside England215. The responsibilities of the department extend to the whole of GreatBritain. It has no responsibilities in Northern Ireland.Regional and local organisation216. The department has headquarters offices in London, Watford, andRuncorn. It has seven regional offices in England, and Scottish and welsh offices, each under a Controller. The Controllers are responsible to head-quarters for the execution of the departments policies and agency functions in their regions, including the operation of the network of area and local offices, Government Training Centres and Industrial Rehabilitation Units.There are also five separate regional finance offices in England, one of whichserves two regions, and corresponding offices in Scotland and Wales, the latterserving also a region in England; these perform advisory, funding, paying,accounting and audit functions, and are responsible direct to finance divisionat headquarters. The Factory Inspectorate has a separate divisional organisa-tion, with ten divisions in England and Wales and a Scottish division, eachunder a Superintending Inspector of Factories.217. The general principle is that as much work as possible is devolved tothe outstations. Primarily, the application of the principle is governed by the frequency with which clients need to be met personally, and by the distributionof the places at which those meetings must take place. The general aim is toensure that as much as possible can be performed in the field, leaving head-quarters to determine policy and to cater for extraordinary situations that fall outside the scope of the general rules. (The increasing use of automatic data processing e.g. for maintaining the London &quot;Job Bank&quot;, for calculatingand paying unemployment benefit to unemployed people, for processing thedepartments statistics and for payroll does not run counter to devolution,but supplements it by relieving local staffs of needless burdens.)218. The Employment and Training Act 1973 provides for the establishmentof a Manpower Services Commission to become responsible inter alia for theEmployment Service Agency at present operating within the Departmentof Employment, and for the Training Services Agency, which is being set up within the department. The two agencies will be the executive arms of theCommission, and will be statutory corporations, each headed by a chief executive appointed by the Commission with the approval of the Secretaryof State.Employment service219. The department is responsible for advising the Government on theemployment aspects of government policies generally, and on the most effective
use of the country&apos;s manpower resources, including collaboration with otherdepartments in formulating and presenting policy on the distribution of industry.This involves the collection, detailed analysis, and interpretation of statisticaland other information about employment and unemployment. Through itsemployment exchanges it offers a service to help individuals to find suitable employment and to help employers to find suitable employees. Vacancieswhich cannot be filled locally are notified to other exchanges, and workers who cannot be found work locally can be put in touch with employers outside their locality. The department also provides a specialised employment infor-mation and placement service the Professional and Executive Register for people with professional qualifications or with managerial experience. Inaddition to these placement services, occupational guidance is available atforty-four units attached to employment exchanges to assist those who needexpert advice in choosing or considering a change of occupation. The department has powers to make grants and loans towards the costs incurred when workersmove from one area to another.220. Devolution would be possible, though it would make more difficultthe placing of persons in employment across regional boundaries.Youth employment service221. A separate youth employment service exists to help young persons as they pass from education into employment. It provides information aboutemployment, careers and further education, gives vocational guidance, places in employment, and keeps in touch with and advises young workers after theyhave taken up jobs. In some parts of the country local education authoritieshave exercised an option to operate this service, while in others it is carriedout directly by the department. Under the Employment and Training Act,local education authorities will have a duty to provide an occupational guidance and placing service for persons attending and leaving educational institutionsother than universities. It is intended to bring this duty into force on the dates of local government reorganisation in England and Wales and Scotlandrespectively. Central government financial help will be given through rate support grant.222. This function could be devolved with other functions for which themain operational responsibility has been placed on local authorities.Training223. The Department of Employment has a general responsibility for ensuring that adequate facilities are available for the training of workers employedin industry or commerce, and for the training or re-training of unemployed orredundant workers, disabled persons and members of the forces returning to civilian life. This responsibility is discharged in three ways. First, under theIndustrial Training Act 1964, a number of industrial training boards have been set up, financed by levy on firms in their industry and by grants and loans from the department, with the responsibility of securing that training is adequate for the needs of their industries. The department supplements the work of the boards by offering employers a variety of training services at reasonable cost,including supervisor training. Secondly, under the Training Opportunities
Scheme, the department offers free full-time training with maintenance allow-ances to individuals who want to prepare for new employment. Such trainingmay take place at government training centres, at colleges of further education,or in employers&apos; establishments. Colleges and employers who carry out suchtraining are paid an appropriate fee. Thirdly, the department gives special assistance towards the labour training expenses of firms going into or expandingin development and intermediate areas.224. Devolution would be possible. It would probably involve the dissolution of the industrial training boards since very few industries are concentrated in asingle region. On the other hand it would allow the adoption of training arrange-ments geared to the needs of the regional labour market. Northern Irelandused its transferred powers to lay particular emphasis on developing a supplyof skilled labour as part of its industrial development programme, and other regions might wish to do the same.Disabled persons225. The Department of Employment administers the Disabled Persons(Employment) Acts 1944 and 1958. It is responsible for the registration ofdisabled persons and for the enforcement of the obligations concerning disabledpeople which the Acts impose on employers. Through its Disablement Resettle-ment Officers it advises and assists disabled persons in obtaining suitable employment. Disabled people are mainly trained alongside the able-bodied,but the department gives financial and technical support to voluntary traininginstitutions for those for whom normal training methods are not suitable.Courses of industrial rehabilitation are provided at Industrial RehabilitationUnits administered by the department, and at centres run by non-governmentorganisations acting as the departments agents. A non-profit making company,Remploy Limited, has been established to provide employment under shelteredconditions for severely disabled people. Financial assistance is given to localauthorities or voluntary bodies which provide approved training or shelteredemployment for such people. Financial assistance is also given to a non-profitmaking company, Industrial Advisers to the Blind Limited, set up to advise onthe modernisation of workshops for blind people.226. Responsibility for disabled persons&apos; employment is subject to many ofthe same considerations as employment and training generally, and is probablybest exercised at the same level.Occupational safety and health227. The department is responsible for the administration of the FactoriesAct 1961, the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, and certain other legislation dealing with occupational safety and health. The factory inspectorate (which with the Medical Services Division forms the directorate of occupational safety and health) is responsible for enforcing the FactoriesAct,, and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act in certain premises.Local authorities enforce the latter Act in other premises, and Senior Inspectorsof Factories (the Central Advisory Inspectorate) are appointed under the Actto advise local authorities and to secure that the Act is enforced in a uniform
manner. The Acts lay down requirements for maintaining standards of safety,health and welfare in factories and for the notification of accidents and industrialdiseases. The Chief Inspector appoints Appointed Factory Doctors to examineyoung persons and those in certain hazardous industries to which codes of regulations apply, and to investigate industrial diseases and gassing incidentsreferred to them by inspectors. Under the Employment Medical advisory service Act 1972, which came into force on 1st February 1973, an EmploymentMedical Advisory Service has been set up within the department to study and give advice on any medical problems arising in connexion with any kind ofemployment. It was announced on 21st May 1973 that early legislation isproposed to provide for the integration of the present complex body of statutory provisions in the field of occupational safety and health and for its extension tovirtually everyone at work. It will also provide for the setting up of a newSafety and Health Commission to administer the legislation, perhaps with a statutory Safety and Health Executive as its operational arm.228. The retention of uniform standards of safety and health is desirable,and would probably be supported by both sides of industry. Responsibility for inspection and enforcement could be devolved, but it would then be less easy to ensure uniform application of standards.Industrial relations229. The Department of Employment is responsible for government policy on industrial relations, with the broad objective as set out in the Industrial relations act 1971 of promoting good industrial relations within the framework of collective bargaining. To this end it offers advice and assistance for theprevention and settlement of disputes through its Conciliation and advisory service. In its advisory capacity the Service assists in the establishment ofmachinery for negotiation or consultation to deal with matters of common interest to employers and workpeople. It seeks to diagnose the causes of personnel problems and to encourage the development of good personnel management practices. The departments policy is to encourage the parties tocompose their differences voluntarily through established procedures. If this isunsuccessful the department provides facilities for the settlement of disputes,including conciliation, arbitration through the Industrial Arbitration Board orby ad hoc boards or single arbitrators, and inquiry by a Court of Inquiry orCommittee of Investigation. The department is responsible for maintainingliaison with the Commission on Industrial Relations, the National industrial relations Court, the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations,the Industrial Tribunals and the Industrial Arbitration Board.230. The national organisation of the trade unions and the fact that muchof the industry with which the unions deal is dispersed throughout the countrymakes it likely that regions would have to collaborate closely in exercisingindustrial relations functions. The damage to the national economy and other national interests which major strikes may inflict is so great that centralgovernment would be bound to be concerned.Incomes231. The department is responsible for advising the Treasury on pay aspectsof the governments counter-inflation policy, for co-ordinating the application
of the pay policy in the public sector and for maintaining contact with largefirms and employers&apos; organisations on its application in the private sector.It maintains liaison with the Pay Board, and with the Office of ManpowerEconomics, which services a number of review bodies on pay as well as arbitra-tions and committees of inquiry into pay questions. It administers the wages councils legislation. This includes the appointment by the Secretary of Stateof members of Wages Councils, which regulate wages in a number of industries,and the inspection of undertakings by the Wages Inspectorate to ensure com-compliance with Wages Regulation Orders. The department is also responsible for implementing the Equal Pay Act, which involves issuing public guidance onits terms and monitoring progress.232. Devolution would permit the level at which minimum wages were fixed and other aspects of incomes policy to be closely related to economicconditions and costs of living in each region. It is doubtful, however, whether there would be much scope for regions to develop distinctive policies. Apartfrom any other considerations, the organisation of the trade unions predisposesthem to think in terms of national wage agreements.Selective employment payments233. The Department of Employment has the major responsibility for the repayment of selective employment tax under the Selective EmploymentPayments Act 1966 and related legislation. Broadly this involves the refund of tax to employers in certain industries and to charities. In development areas,manufacturers who receive the refund of tax are paid a regional employment premium in addition. Selective employment payments will be phased out during 1973/74 and regional employment premiums some time later. the suitability of such matters for devolution is referred to in Appendix C.Redundancy payments and employers&apos; liability234. The department is also responsible for the administration of the redundancy Payments Act 1965, which provides for employers to makeredundancy payments based on length of service, age, and pay to employeesdismissed because of redundancy. It also administers the Employers&apos; Liability(Compulsory Insurance) Act, the aim of which is to ensure that, regardless ofthe employer&apos;s financial position, employees receive compensation for anyinjury or illness caused in the course of their work as a result of their employersnegligence.235. Devolution would probably reduce the scope for a fully comprehensive system of redundancy payments and compensation for industrial injuries.Both sides of industry are likely to favour uniformity.Statistics236. The Department of Employment is responsible for the collection and publication of official statistics relating to labour matters. These includeemployment and unemployment, wage and salary earnings, wage rates, hoursof work, labour costs, retail prices and household expenditure, industrial disputes and holidays with pay. Where practicable, separate statistics are
compiled for Scotland, Wales and the regions of England. Offices in the regional organisation of the department play an important role in the data collectingarrangements. Although regional employment departments would require theirown statistical services, this function could not be shed completely by centralgovernment since there would be a continuing need for employment and wagesstatistics in national economic planning.Race relations, Commonwealth immigrants, and foreign labour237. Under the Race Relations Act 1968 discrimination on grounds ofcolour or race is unlawful in the field of employment. The Department ofEmployment is responsible for approval of the arrangements which exist incertain industries to deal with complaints; it issues vouchers permittingCommonwealth immigrants to work and settle in the United Kingdom, and itregulates, by the issue of permits, the entry for employment of foreigners(but not E.E.C. nationals). These are essentially national matters requiringcentral control.International matters238. The department is responsible for implementing the provisions of theTreaty of Rome and the regulations and directives made under it relating to labour questions, including the free movement of labour, training and thepreparation of claims on the European Social Fund. It will also be concernedwith the implementation of certain directives relating to safety and health.The department also has an interest in other labour matters of an internationalnature through the United Kingdom&apos;s membership of the International LabourOrganisation and in certain aspects of the work of other international organisations. Labour attaches in British Embassies abroad are usually officials of the department. There is no scope for devolution of these internationalmatters.Agency services239. The Department of Employment acts as agent for D.H.S.S. in theday-to-day administration and payment of claims for unemployment benefit,the issue of national insurance cards to young persons and the franking of thecards of unemployed insured persons. It also pays non-contributory benefits and issues free milk tokens to unemployed persons registered at local offices.On behalf of the Foreign Office it handles applications for passports and issuesBritish Visitors&apos; Passports. These agency functions depend to a large extent on the existence of a network of local offices throughout the country and could be devolved to similar networks of offices under regional control.ministry of posts and telecommunicationsGeneral statement of responsibilities240. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was created underthe Post Office Act 1969, which transformed the Post Office from a departmentof state into a public authority. The Ministry exercises statutory and regulatoryfunctions in the field of posts and telecommunications, and considers matters
relating to the Post Office, Cable and Wireless Ltd., the Post Office Users&apos;Councils, the broadcasting organisations and the use and licensing of wireless telegraphy, frequency assignment and planning.Responsibilities outside England241. The departments functions extend to the whole of the United Kingdom.Regional and local organisation242. The department has no regional organisation and its entire operations are conducted from its headquarters in London. The industries which itregulates have regionally based organisations. Of the Post Office&apos;s four mainservices postal, telecommunications, Giro banking and data processing only the first two lend themselves to regional organisation. Giro and data processing are organised centrally. Giro in Bootle and data processing inLondon. The postal and telecommunications services are organised each under its own Regional Directors in nine regions in Great Britain; in NorthernIreland, the Regional Director has responsibility for both posts and tele-communications. In each region there is further devolution to Head Post-masters and the general managers of the telephone areas. The broadcasting organisations have their own regional structures. j;Post and telecommunications matters243. The department exercises for the Post Office the usual central govem-ment functions in relation to nationalised industries. It is responsible for international relations at the governmental level, including United kingdom representation in bodies such as the Univeral Postal Union, the InternationalTelecommunication Union and the Commonwealth TelecommunicationsOrganisation.244. The departments international responsibilities could not be devolved.If its domestic responsibilities for posts and telecommunications were devolved,the Post Office would have to be divided into separate regional organisations.Separate regional services would no doubt be practicable; the Channel islands and the Isle of Man have recently assumed responsibility for their own postal services. But the advantages of centralisation are so great that even in federalcountries postal services are normally a federal responsibility.Radio regulation245. The department has regulatory functions under the Wireless TelegraphyAct 1949. It takes part in the formulation and implementation of the Inter-national Radio Regulations and co-ordinates the planning nationally andinternationally of the radio spectrum, as well as detailed frequency planning and assignments in the United Kingdom. It issues licences for the use of radio,and deals with radio interference problems and illicit radio transmissions.It is also concerned with maritime radio questions, including the licensing of wireless operators. A Directorate of Radio Technology provides technicalresearch and expertise necessary to form and implement Ministry policy. Theinternational aspects and restrictions on available frequencies make central control essential.
Broadcasting246. The department is responsible for broadcasting policy, including theestablishment of broadcasting organisations and government functions inrelation to them.247. It would not be practicable for the regions to assume full responsibilityfor broadcasting, if only because of the importance of frequency controls. but so long as essential technical and other controls remained at the centre, somematters affecting the development and organisation of broadcasting regionallymight be devolved to the regions for decision, either independently or jointly with the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications.

PREFACE1. We regret having to present a separate Memorandum of Dissent. However,it gradually became clear that we were at variance with our colleagues on so many points that no other course was possible.2. The extent of our disagreement with the majority can be summarised asfollows: (a) We have interpreted our terms of reference as meaning that we should consider what changes might be necessary in our system of government as a whole if it is to meet the needs and aspirations of the people. our colleagues have concentrated almost exclusively on the single questionof devolution though the word was not in fact used in our terms ofreference; and they make no specific recommendation on any otherissue.(b) The majority report, we believe, has the effect of magnifying the extentof the social and cultural differences between Scotland, Wales and england. This is partly because of the way it handles in the historicalsection the concept of Nationhood&apos; with Scotland and Wales thusappearing as separate nations with distinctive values and ways of lifeStruggling to be free&apos;. In contrast there is no matching study of themore homogeneous contemporary pattern of social and cultural valuesand behaviour which characterise all the different parts of the UnitedKingdom. This imbalance, we believe, has led many of our colleaguesinto recommending more extreme Solutions&apos; for Scotland and Walesthan the evidence actually warrants.(c) Our colleagues do not give an analytical assessment of the validity orotherwise of the particular complaints about our system of governmentwhich were made to us. They summarise these complaints under suchheadings as &quot;centralisation&quot; and &quot;the weakening of democracy&quot;. Butnowhere do they say whether in their view the complaints about over-centralisation or about the &quot;weakening of democracy&quot; are in fact justi-fied. They conclude simply that &quot;while the people of Great Britain as awhole cannot be said to be seriously dissatisfied with their system ofgovernment, they have less attachment to it than in the past, and thereare some substantial and persistent causes of discontent which may contain the seeds of more serious trouble&quot;1. But unless we determinewhich complaints are justified and which not, we cannot, in our view,make well-founded recommendations for change.(d) The principles and criteria adopted by &quot;our colleagues as a background to their recommendations are stated so generally as to have no preciseimplications. Thus they point in no particular direction; they can justifyradical change or the maintenance of the status quo. We have sought tobring out the full implications of the principles and criteria we haveacMjyir.adopt.edJ. BnohfifanSffimobai liuiohmmnoo aril jqtmfi loffriCD: rlf (A)(e) We believe that our colleagues have seriously underestimated the likelyconsequences of United Kingdom membership of the Common Market.1 Majority Report, Chapter 23, paragraph 1102.2 Compare in this respect Chapter 11, paragraphs 416-421, of the Majority Report withour Chapter IV.
We consider that over the years this will have a major impact on theworking of our main institutions of government; we have, accordingly,sought to take account of this in our recommendations.(/) No single group of our colleagues is presenting a comprehensive schemefor the United Kingdom as a whole which will achieve what we considermust be the three essential objectives of any changes in our system ofgovernment: (i) to provide equality of political rights for people in all parts of theUnited Kingdom;(ii) to reduce the present excessive burdens on Whitehall andWestminster;(iii) to provide full opportunities for democratic decision-making bypeople in all parts of the United Kingdom at all levels of government;(iv) to provide adequate machinery for the redress of individual grievances.(g) We cannot accept the scheme of legislative devolution for Scotland andWales recommended in the majority report. This scheme (akin to theold Stormont system of government) would devolve to Scottish and welsh Parliaments and Governments Sovereign&apos; or &quot;autonomous&apos;powers in a wide range of subjects with the Westminster Parliamentnormally precluded from legislating for Scotland and Wales in thesematters. We oppose this because: (i) we believe it makes no sense today to seek to move Sovereignty&apos;downwards when in more and more subjects it is actually movingupwards to Brussels;(ii) it would be giving to the people of Scotland and Wales significantadditional political rights which would be denied to the people inthe different regions of England (all of which have larger populationsthan Scotland and Wales and a range of problems no less special to themselves). This would be the more unacceptable in that some of theEnglish regions would be providing, perhaps for Scotland, and certainly for Wales, substantial economic and financial supportwhile being denied the same degree of self-government;(iii) we cannot believe it is right or acceptable that the WestminsterParliament should be precluded from legislating for Scotland andWales in a wide range of subjects (including education, housing and health) while at the same time, about 100 Scottish and WelshM.P.s at Westminster would have a full share in legislating in thesesame matters for England alone ;(iv) the scheme at best would not result in any significant reduction inthe burdens on Whitehall and Westminster; and, indeed, it is alltoo likely in our view to increase those burdens still further.(A) We cannot accept the constitutional recommendations our colleaguesmake about the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This is becausealthough our terms of reference also required us to examine &quot;the economicrelationships between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands andthe Isle of Man&quot;, there has in fact been no such examination. As a Corn-mission, we do not know, for example, the extent to which these off-shore
islands have developed, and are still further developing, as &quot;tax havens&quot;either for United Kingdom citizens or international companies. without such information (and we consider an urgent enquiry should be mountedto get it) we do not believe one can make any worthwhile pronounce-ments on their future constitutional relationships with the UnitedKingdom. We, therefore, make no such pronouncements.(r) Although our colleagues have been influenced by a number of ourconstitutional and financial ideas, the basic form of the majority report made it impossible for these to be presented in a way which does them fulljustice. This is largely because our ideas were conceived in the context of reforming our system of government as a whole; and they become fully comprehensible only when presented in that context.3. In view of the far-reaching differences of approach and opinion summarised above we became convinced that our Memorandum of Dissent, if it were to serveany positive purpose, had to be much more than a mere listing of points of disagreement. Accordingly, we have felt obliged to present what is intended tobe a largely self-contained alternative report. Thus we have sought to considerthe United Kingdom system of government as a whole. In this context we have presented our own analysis of the evidence and the problems; and we have setout the main principles which have guided us in reaching our recommendations.The changes we propose will, we believe, adapt our system of government tothe needs and aspirations of our highly educated and mature democracy.A summary of our diagnosis and recommendations precedes the main body ofour report.NOTE BY LORD CROWTHER-HUNT1. This Memorandum of Dissent is based on the written and oral evidence to the Commission and the various research papers which were produced.However, I have also been greatly helped by a large number of informal and confidential discussions I have had with Ministers, ex-Ministers, M.P.S, CivilServants, Clerks of both Houses of Parliament, academics, local government officials and others with direct experience of public affairs. To all these whohave given so generously of their time, I am extremely grateful.2. I was particularly pleased when Professor Alan Peacock felt able to joinme in this Memorandum of Dissent. Though he was a late recruit to theCommission, it was soon evident that we had similar misgivings about thegeneral approach of our colleagues. I am greatly indebted to him, therefore,for the many &quot;reinforcing&quot; discussions we have had over the last couple ofyears and his assistance in the final stages of our work (even in the areasoutside his own special competence) has been invaluable.3. I am also most grateful to Christopher Smallwood, Lecturer in Economicsat Edinburgh University. When it looked as though I would be completely on my own I asked him to help in producing an economic and financial schemewhich would fit my political and constitutional ideas.
4. I naturally want to be associated with the general acknowledgement ofthe special debt that all members of the Commission owe to the late LordCrowther for his guidance and inspiration during the early years of theCommission^ work. And I also want to stress how much I have enjoyedworking with my fellow Commissioners these last four years. I have particularlyappreciated the fact that we have been able to maintain the most friendly andco-operative personal relationships in the closing stages of the Commissionswork even after it had become clear that we had to go our own separate ways.The fair and sympathetic chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon was a major factor in ensuring the maintenance of this personal harmony; I am most grateful tohim.5. Finally, I particularly wish to thank Ronald Guppy and the other membersof the Commission Secretariat. They have not, of course, been involved in thewriting of this Memorandum of Dissent. But in the best Civil Service traditiontheir critical analysis of my proposals in their earlier forms helped to ensurethat the various ideas were more fully thought through. And in the later stagesthey have been enormously helpful in providing and checking information.They were also unstinting in the assistance they gave in connection with the commissions various research projects for which I had a special responsibility.NOTE BY PROFESSOR ALAN PEACOCK1. In the course of examination of the evidence presented to the Commission,I came independently to four conclusions: (a) The system of government of the United Kingdom can only be basedon equality of political rights for all citizens in the separate regions andnations. This is not only an important matter of principle, but also areasonable prediction of what would be politically acceptable in thelong run.(b) The exercise of these rights in accordance with the wishes of the citizens of the United Kingdom can only be brought about by increasing regionalparticipation in the system of government, but without&apos;decreasing thepowers already devolved to Scotland and Wales.(c)&apos; The combination of equality of political rights and greater participation in government can be achieved without making it appreciably moredifficult to pursue other widely accepted aims of government. In particular,a more democratic system of decision-making would not hinder the promotion of economic policies which depend on central control overthe system of public finance. Indeed, allocation of national resourcesmight be improved if regions were given a measure of fiscal independence.(d) The sheer size of the public sector reflected in the large share of annual output devoted to government use and in the large proportion of personal and corporate income taxed away in order to transfer resources togovernment places strict limits on the exercise of democratic control of
government, however it is constituted. I recognise and accept thatgovernment has a crucial role to play in providing common services, inregulating the economy, in helping the unfortunate and in regulating the conduct of the unscrupulous, but these important functions must not interfere with the rights of individuals to make the major decisions which affect the conduct of their lives, which is the essence of democracy.Increased regional participation in government will do something topromote this ideal, but I believe that governments seriously interestedin preserving democracy need to do much more to make it possible forits citizens to rely less on its support. It follows that the size and composi-tion of the public in relation to the private sector needs to be kept under continuous review, and should not therefore be regarded as sacrosanct.2. My first two conclusions are fully shared by Lord Crowther-Hunt, andI am glad to accept his professional judgment on the detailed working out oftheir implications for the entire system of government. I am profoundly grateful to him for shouldering the burden of drafting the Memorandum of Dissent.My part in its preparation has been confined to detailed commentary on particular sections and to the preparation of material which has been embodied in the sections dealing with financial matters.3. My third conclusion is concerned with rather technical issues which it seemed better to discuss separately. I have considered the fiscal implications ofthe general scheme in Appendix A of the Memorandum. I would emphasise that were our general recommendations accepted, it would be necessary inmy view to mount a full-scale investigation of the effects of a devolved systemof public finance on policies implemented by central government with appro-priate statistical analysis and illustration. Appendix A only offers a point of departure for such an investigation.4. Our all-embracing terms of reference could easily encompass considerationof the issues raised by my fourth conclusion. It is important to note, therefore,that both the Report of the Commission and the Memorandum of Dissentare based on the assumption that the relative size of the public sector in the economy, whatever the distribution of tasks between the central and subordinatelayers of government, would remain more or less as at present. I have accepted this assumption only because an interpretation of our terms of reference whichexcludes consideration of the size of government has offered us problems enoughto grapple with. But a very important matter has remained undiscussed.5. I join Lord Crowther-Hunt in acknowledging an immense debt both toour late Chairman, Lord Crowther, and to his successor, Lord Kilbrandon.As one of the later recruits to the Commission I particularly appreciate thewarm-welcome I was given by my fellow Commissioners and their under-standing, if not their acceptance, of a different point of view from their own.Finally, I also wish to thank the Commission Secretariat for their valuableservices.
SUMMARY OF OUR DIAGNOSIS AND OUR MAINRECOMMENDATIONSOur diagnosis of the problem and our basic principles1. There has been a decline this century in the extent to which we as a peoplegovern ourselves. This has been the unintended consequence of five main trends in our system of government which, for the most part, are still continuing.2. First, there has been an enormous expansion and strengthening of thecentral executive as it has assumed an ever increasing range of responsibilities.This has been particularly marked since the Second World War. Then thegovernment accepted responsibility for the maintenance of full employment and the provision of comprehensive social services. Now we expect it to achievesuch general economic aims as a satisfactory rate of growth, stable prices and a healthy balance of payments. Through nationalisation central government hasbecome responsible for most of our basic industries. It has assumed respon-sibility, too, for town and country planning. The latest and perhaps most far-reaching duty we now call on our government to perform is the general preservation-tion and improvement of the environment; and this has been signalised by thecreation of a new &quot;giant&quot; department the Department of the Environment.3. These vastly.enlarged responsibilities of central government are reflected in the great increase in public expenditure now rather more than 20,000 million a year, over 43 per cent, of the gross national product andsome  400 per head of population, compared with just less than  100 million in 1870, when it was 9 per cent, of the gross national product and  3 per headof population. They are reflected, too, in the great increase in the numberof civil servants employed in central government. In 1900 there were about50,000 civil servants; today there are over half a million. The fact that thiscentury the number of civil servants has gone up not less than tenfold whilethe number of Ministers has doubled has fundamental implications for theproblem of democratic control. There is reason to believe that the day to dayburden on Ministers is now so great that they are unable to control adequatelythe full range of departmental business. If this is so the new balance of powergives bureaucracy the edge over democracy.4. Alongside this growth and strengthening of the central executive, thesecond main development of the twentieth century has been a correspondingdecline in the power of Parliament. Its staffing and procedures have failed tokeep pace with the requirements of twentieth century democracy. The develop-ment of mass political parties and the attendant party discipline have alsoweakened the House of Commons as a check on the executive. The House asa whole no longer has the positive share in policy making that was the normin the latter half of the nineteenth century.5. Thirdly, there has also been a weakening of the other main arm of democracy local government. Since 1945 local authorities have lost their responsibilities for a wide range of public services including hospitals, gas,electricity, trunk roads, etc. They are shortly to lose water, sewerage and whatthey had left of health. And under the new reorganisation of local governmentto be effective from 1st April, 1974, the number of elected representatives inEngland, Scotland and Wales is to be reduced from 37,510 to 23,950.
6. Many of the functions taken away from local government have been givento nominated ad hoc authorities of various kinds e.g., Hospital Boards,Gas Boards, etc. Indeed, one of the main institutional developments since1945 has been the proliferation of a wide range of ad hoc authorities. They havenot been confined to duties previously the responsibility of local government.Many of the new tasks of central government have also been entrusted toad hoc authorities. For the most part they have been set up in the cause ofmanagerial efficiency. It was felt that this could be achieved only if respon-sibility for the functions concerned was entrusted to specially nominated (ratherthan elected) individuals who must be able to operate without being subjected to the detailed control of Parliament or local government. Often the effect hasbeen to make the operations of these bodies largely independent of democraticsupervision certainly in their day to day impact on the life of the community.7. The fifth major governmental development has been the extent to whichthe main central departments of government have set up their own regional andlocal structures. It is not a tidy picture. There is no uniformity, for example,in the number of regions into which England has been divided by departments for administrative purposes. In fact there are some twenty different departmentalregional structures only two of which are coterminous. More important,though, is the extent of this large scale decentralisation. Twice as many civilservants work in departmental regional and local offices as at departmentalheadquarters. This has serious implications for the problem of democraticcontrol. In the interests of efficiency departments have devolved a great dealof decision making to their regional and local outposts. There are, however,no regional ministers (apart from the Scottish and Welsh Secretaries of State)to give close supervision to the work of civil servants at these levels. So, in so faras these civil servants are involved in administrative decision making, they are operating without being subject to much close democratic supervision.8. The general effect of the developments outlined above is that governmentappears to be, and is, remote from the people. Popular dissatisfaction expressesitself in a number of ways. There are nationalist movements in Scotland andWales. Everywhere there is a growing &quot;we they&quot; syndrome with an increasingrecognition that &quot;they&quot; control &quot;us&quot;, rather than &quot;we&quot; control &quot;them&quot;.Political parties and elections appear to do nothing to redress the balance.Hence people are increasingly alienated from the political process. And thereis a growing tendency to resort to direct action as the only means of achievingpolitical change.9. Quite simply, the fact has to be faced that if we really believe thatdemocracy means that the people and their representatives should have a realshare in political power, our institutions do not make adequate provision forthis today. And this at a time when a more educated citizenry has a greatercapacity for playing a fuller part in the country&apos;s decision making processesthan ever before in our history.10. The evidence we received or obtained was mainly a natural and healthydemocratic reaction to the trends outlined above. Clearly, there is a widespread and disturbing sense of powerlessness in the face of government. At the sametime there is a clear demand that the people and their representatives should
have a greater share in political power. Thus, in our view, the essentialobjectives of any scheme of constitutional reform must be: (d) to reduce the present excessive burdens on the institutions of centralgovernment;(b) to increase the influence on decision making of the elected representativesof the people;(c) to provide the people generally with more scope for sharing in, andinfluencing, governmental decision making at all levels;id) to provide adequate means for the redress of individual grievances.In our view all the evidence makes it clear that it is just as important to achieve these objectives for the people in the different regions of England as for thepeople in Scotland and Wales.11. United Kingdom membership of the Common Market makes the achievement of the objeptives in paragraph 10 above even more urgent and important. This is because the constitutional and institutional consequences ofour Common Market membership are so profound and far-reaching. Theycan be summed up as follows: (a) important areas of decision making are increasingly moving to Brusselsand will thus become more remote from the people of the UnitedKingdom and their elected representatives in Parliament;(b) there will be a still further strengthening of the power of bureaucracy,both national and European;(c) the two points at (a) and (b) above make it imperative that parliament should become an effective countervailing force developing the capacity to exercise the full influence of the British people on the decisions madein Brussels. Parliament must be the vehicle by which the will of thepeople prevails over the will of the bureaucrats;(d) there will be a major increase in the load on our central machinery ofgovernment on Parliament if it develops as envisaged at (c) above and on Ministers and the central departments of government as moreand more major problems have to be decided in a European context andat a European level.12. In our view our central institutions of government will not be able satis-factorily to cope with the Common Market dimension unless they devolve asubstantial proportion of their present functions to subordinate units ofgovernment within the United Kingdom. At the same time our common market membership imposes serious constraints on the form and extent of any system of devolution that might be devised. For example, it would hardly be prudent to recommend a devolution of legislative power and autonomy to the&quot;different nations and regions of the United Kingdom&quot; in any of the increasingrange of subjects where legislative power is in fact moving to Brussels.13. Before outlining the institutional changes we believe to be necessary to achieve the objectives in paragraph 10 above, we think it important to summarisethe main principles on which we believe the restructuring of our system ofgovernment should be based. These are as follows: (a) the essential features of our existing system of government should, asfar as possible, be maintained and the necessary changes should bemoulded into the existing framework;
(b) any necessary changes should not weaken the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom;(c) there must be a substantial equality of political rights and obligationsfor the people in all parts of the United Kingdom;id) the basic and overriding principle that should govern any institutionalchange should be the maintenance and extension of democratic rightsand freedoms;ie) because of the supreme value we place on the individual in a democracy,the system of government must be sensitive and humane;if) the different levels of government in the United Kingdom should be linked closely together without at the same time restricting the freedomof the different levels to take independently the decisions appropriate for them to determine. A way of providing for this is to adopt what wehave called the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; and to devise methods wherebyelected representatives and officials at one level of government are abledirectly to participate in the decision-making process of the immediatelysuperior level. jjOur scheme14. To modify our system of government in accordance with the principles and objectives set out in paragraphs 10 and 13 above, the first major decision that must be taken is whether or not we need a tier of government in the UnitedKingdom between the local authority level on the one hand, and the centralgovernment level in Whitehall and Westminster on the other. In fact, though ithas not been very generally appreciated, we already have a tier of government at this intermediate level. It consists essentially of two different types of organisation: id) the direct outposts of central government, e.g. the Scottish Office, the welsh Office, and the offices of the various central government depart-ments in the different regions of England;ib) the regional organisations of the various ad hoc authorities e.g. the gas, Electricity and Hospital Boards etc.; thus, for example, from 1st April, 1974, England will have fourteen Area Health Authoritiesand a number of Regional Water Authorities.15. Even with the new and enlarged units of local government operating from 1st April, 1974, it is clear that this existing intermediate level of government isnot going to disappear. This is quite simply because there are a large number ofimportant problems and functions which cannot be satisfactorily handled except by bodies operating at this level. But at this intermediate level: id) we need in England to rationalise the jungle of boundaries and replace them if possible by one set of standard regional boundaries;ib) we need in England to create a centre of power in each region comparable with the Scottish and Welsh Offices so that decisions can be taken on the wide range of different functional problems about schools, hospitals,roads, housing, etc., which, together, comprise regional policy andstrategy;
(c) we need in Scotland and Wales and in the regions of England to devisearrangements so that the people in these areas can share in the decisionmaking process and hold those who take decisions fully accountable; itshould be democratic government, not bureaucratic government.16. Accordingly, the essence of our scheme is to set up seven democraticallyelected Assemblies and Governments one for Scotland, one for Wales andone for each of, say, five English regions1. The Assemblies would be elected bythe single transferable vote system of proportional representation. They wouldbe given very substantial powers. Thus, these Assemblies and governments would: (a) take over the control of, and responsibility for, virtually all the outpostsof central government now operating in their areas. Thus, for example,the Scottish and Welsh Offices will be detached from Whitehall andWestminster and be placed instead under the full control of scottish and Welsh Assemblies and Governments. Similarly, as far as the english regions are concerned, virtually all the outposts of central government likethe Department of the Environment Regional Offices, etc., will be&quot;hived off&quot; from their departmental headquarters and come under thecontrol of English Regional Assemblies and Governments;(b) take over the functions of the non-commercial, non-industrial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas. Thus, for example, the functions ofthe projected Regional Health Authorities in England will be transferredto, and absorbed by, the Regional Assemblies and Governments; so will the functions of the projected Regional Water Authorities. Similarlyin Scotland and Wales; the Scottish and Welsh Governments andAssemblies will take over the functions and responsibilities of all thenon-commercial, non-industrial ad hoc authorities operating there;(c) be given some supervisory responsibilities in respect of the variouscommercial and industrial ad hoc authorities (e.g. Gas Boards, electricity boards);(d) be responsible for devising policies for the general welfare and good government of their respective areas within the framework of the legis-lation and overall policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and government and, within the framework, too, of any regulations anddirectives emanating from the European Commission in Brussels.Clearly, an important aspect of the work of these intermediate level governments will be to draw up and regularly modify as necessary a strategic plan for the future physical, social and economic developmentof their areas and to decide within this what for them is the right balanceof functional spend as between roads, hospitals, schools, housing, water,sewerage, etc. In this general context their duties will not be limited toany specific functions or duties conferred on them by Parliament; theywill also have a general competence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas;1 We make no specific recommendation about Northern Ireland. The scheme hererecommended could be extended to include Northern Ireland. Alternatively, the scheme inthe Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 could easily be dovetailed into the overall structure of government here proposed. In fact, under either alternative the people of Northern ireland would probably have in practice substantially the same amount of devolved power thoughthe two schemes appear to be very different from each other.
(e) have some independent revenue raising powers and sufficient financial&quot;independence&quot; of central government to give them the requisite degreeof freedom in carrying out their duties and responsibilities while stillleaving central government with the tools it needs for the overall manage-ment of the economy.17. It is an important part of the scheme that minority parties or groups inthe intermediate level Assemblies should be closely associated with decisionmaking at this level. Accordingly, it is envisaged that intermediate level govern-ments will operate on lines similar to the present local authority committeesystem rather than on the Whitehall Ministerial pattern which denies opposition parties and groups any direct share in governmental decision making.18. Each intermediate level government will have its own &quot;civil service&quot;.As with local government now there would be a substantial uniformity ofgrades and conditions of service over the United Kingdom as a whole; andjust as local government officials now move on their own initiative between different local authorities so there would be similar movements of officialsbetween the different intermediate level governments. In our view there shouldalso be a substantial vertical movement of officials between all the different levels of government in the United Kingdom. Thus all posts at all levels in thecentral departments of government should be open to appropriately qualifiedand experienced officials in intermediate level and local government; and itshould be part of the normal career pattern of the most important officials atany level of government to have served in the other main levels of government.This will be an important means of giving effect to the interlocking principlereferred to in paragraph 13.19. There will be an Ombudsman associated with each intermediate levelgovernment. There will be provision for direct access to him by members of thepublic. He&apos; will not be limited by a narrow interpretation of the concept of&quot;maladministration&quot;. He would have terms of reference similar to those of theMew Zealand Ombudsman and thus would be able to look at the merits of adecision and recommend redress where any decision seems fo him unreasonablein the light of all the facts presented. The ambit of each Ombudsman&apos;s responsi-bilities will need to cover not only individual complaints against the inter-mediate level government itself, but also against the local authorities in thearea and all those who are concerned with the provision of public services including, for example, the health service and the police.20. There will be no change in the functions of local government; they willremain broadly as set out in the Governments Local Government Act (1972)which covers England and Wales and the Local Government Bill for Scotland.Local authorities, though, will lose their present day-to-day administrativecontacts with the departments of central government; they will deal insteadwith the Government and Assembly in their area. In this connection, it isimportant to stress that they will themselves be directly represented in thisintermediate level of government in accordance with the inter-locking principlereferred to in paragraph 13 (/) above.
21. The scheme involves far-reaching changes in the structure, organisationand responsibilities of central government. The following departments will(with minor exceptions) lose their regional outposts and local offices which, ofcourse, will be taken over by the Assemblies and Governments in the areas concerned: The Department of the environment the Department of employment the Department of Health and Social security the Department of Trade and industry the Home office the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The main functions of these departments (together with the Department ofEducation and Science which at present has no regional organisation apartfrom its inspectorate) in future will be to evolve new general policy and monitorthe operation of existing policies; they will lose their present responsibilities for the day-to-day detailed administration of policy which will be taken overby the Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments.22. It might seem logical under the scheme to propose the abolition of the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales since their present departments will be taken over by the Scottish and Welsh Governments. However, in ourview, there is much to be said for having a United Kingdom Minister in theCabinet charged with the special responsibility of safeguarding and promotingScottish and Welsh interests at this level of decision making. This will be ofparticular importance in the future given United Kingdom membership of theCommon Market and the fact that Scotland and Wales have no right to appointEuropean Commissioners and cannot seat any representatives on the Council ofMinisters. Accordingly, we consider that one of the &quot;non-departmental&quot;Ministers in the United Kingdom Cabinet, e.g. the Lord Privy Seal, or the lord president of the Council, or the Paymaster General, or the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, should be charged with a special responsibility for scottish affairs and, if this were thought appropriate, also given the title of Secretary ofState for Scotland; a second &quot;non-departmental&quot; minister could be givensimilar responsibilities for Wales. It would then be appropriate for a thirdnon-departmental minister in the Cabinet to become specifically responsiblefor the interests of the different English regions at this highest level in theUnited Kingdom Executive.23. A fundamental objective of the scheme is the rejuvenation of parliament and in particular the House of Commons. In a modern democracy it is not enough for the great majority of the elected representatives of the people tobe limited, for the most part, to essentially negative carping criticism of, and ex post facto investigation of, departmental decisions they have had no chance to shape. This means, therefore, that Parliamentarians must be able to make their contribution to policy making while policies are still being worked outin departments and before ministerial decisions have been taken. And, giventhe Common Market dimension, Parliament must at the very least be able todiscuss with the appropriate United Kingdom Ministers all recommendationsemanating from the European Commission On which decisions have eventually
to be taken in the Council of Ministers in Brussels. To fulfil these responsibilitiesit will, in our view, be necessary for M.P.s to: (a) organise themselves into functional committees matching the maindepartments of central government. The functional committees should: (i) be associated with departments in the policy-forming process and before any Bill is presented to the House of Commons;(ii) consider and investigate proposals from the European Commissionto the Council of Ministers which fall within their sphere of respon-sibility. The appropriate House of Commons functional committeewould discuss these with the United Kingdom departmental minister concerned before he is called upon to take a decision inthe Council of Ministers;(iii) investigate the operation of existing policies and legislation in theirrespective spheres and make any necessary recommendations forchange;(iv) take the committee stages of legislation falling within their area ofresponsibility; I&apos;(i) have a bigger share in the formulation of economic and fiscal policy.This means that the role of the Public Expenditure Committee shouldbe expanded so that members can consider the relationship betweenexpenditure plans and the methods of financing them; alternatively, aseparate Public Taxation Committee should be set up which would work in close co-operation with the Public Expenditure Committee.All these committees will, of course, need to be adequately served by professional and expert staffs who will need access to the appropriate departments ofgovernment.24. The enlarged responsibilities of Members of Parliament outlined inparagraph 23 will inevitably involve still heavier demands on their time andenergies. It will be some compensation that some of their present burdens and much of their present concern for individual case-work will have been &quot;hived-off&quot; to the members of Scottish, Welsh and English Regional Assemblies.Even so, we need to recognise that if we require from M.P.s this bigger role in the process of government, then we are in effect requiring them to becomefull-time professional men and women and as such they should be paid a full-time professional salary. The &quot;new&quot; House will not be able to &quot;carry&quot; thepresent proportion of M.P.s who are so busy with other jobs that they have little or no time to devote to the committee work of the House.25. With M.P.s in the future having this much bigger and more crucialrole in the processes of government than they have at present, it is no partof this overall scheme for the democratisation of our system of government toreduce the number of Scottish and Welsh M.P.s in the House of Commons.There is, in our view, a strong case for leaving Scotland and Wales with theirpresent slight &quot;over-representation&quot; as some recognition both of theirremoteness from the centre and also as some recognition of their feeling about their special national characteristics and interests.26. It is not essential to the new scheme of government so far outlined thatthere should be a reform of the House of Lords. But there are two reasons why  we think serious consideration should be given to modifying the
composition of the Upper House though not to altering its existing powers.First, we believe that if leading members of the intermediate level governments were also made members of the House of Lords, this would help to give effectto the inter-locking principle referred to in paragraph 13 and it would givethe representatives of the intermediate level governments a national and publicplatform on which to make their voices heard. Secondly, their voices and influence at Westminster in the United Kingdom Governments policy-makingprocesses could provide a most useful countervailing force to the naturalcentralising tendency of all governments and thus help to ensure that thecentral government left intermediate level governments with the widest possiblescope for their own activities.27. Finally, in our view, we think it important to recognise that our political parties are, and will be, the chief motivating force of our main governmentalinstitutions. Since authoritarian or oligarchically controlled parties couldfatally distort the working of democratically designed institutions we believethat consideration ought to be given, with appropriate legislation if necessary,to ensuring that a larger number of people than at present can take part in the selection of party candidates for public office. We also consider that attentionneeds to be given to various problems associated with political campaigning because, to a very considerable extent, the vitality of our system of governmentdepends on fair and equal competition between our political parties. Finally,we are disturbed that our major parties lack the capacity, when in opposition,to subject government policies to adequate and sufficiently detailed politicalscrutiny and, perhaps most important of all, lack the capacity for working outcoherent and fully practical alternative programmes which will stand the tests and rigours of public office. We believe that for the health of the bodypolitic the party or parties in opposition should have the resources to overcomethese deficiencies; other democratic countries have seen the need for this andhave accordingly devised equitable ways for making public funds availablefor these essential party purposes.28. We recognise that all the changes summarised in the preceding para-graphs could not, and should not, be introduced immediately and at once.A constitution like ours which is the product of centuries of evolution shouldbe modified over the years, not overnight. Thus the strategy to implement our recommendations should consist of three distinct phases spread over asubstantial period of time. The first phase would be essentially a period ofpublic debate in which our recommendations would be tested alongside thevarious other proposals for constitutional change made by our colleagues.At the same time there would be a detailed study by the government to deter-mine the right number and the right boundaries of the intermediate level governments. The second phase would be marked by setting up the inter-mediate level governments and giving them a limited range of functions. The1 In this context we would also hope that an alternative scheme for constitutional reformwhich we ourselves have devised would also be considered during this period of public debate.This alternative scheme is presented in Appendix D. It is based on the diagnosis of theproblems presented in this Summary. However, it then seeks to meet these problems bydevising changes in our central institutions of government instead of setting up Scottish,Welsh and English regional governments. We do not believe this alternative will be as effective as the scheme presented in this Summary. Nor do we believe it will command as much public support. But we think it ought to be part of the general debate.
third phase would involve a gradual addition to their responsibilities. Through-out there would be appropriate changes in Westminster and Whitehall.29. Clearly, for our scheme to prosper, a successful launching of the second phase would be vital. This means that though the intermediate level governments would not at that point assume their full range of responsibilities they must,nevertheless have a major role to play. We see no difficulty in giving them thefollowing major responsibilities from the moment they are created: (a) to draw up a strategic plan for their respective areas. This would, ofcourse, involve much more than the traditional &quot;town and country&quot;planning. It would include economic and social planning as well;(b) to assume all the functions and duties which will have been conferred on the fourteen nominated Regional Health Authorities in England(which would then be abolished) and on the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales;id) to assume along the lines of (b) above the functions of the nine english regional Water Authorities and of the Welsh National Water Develop-ment Authority which will have been created under the new Water Bill.And the Scottish Assembly would become responsible for co-ordinating the corresponding water and sewerage responsibilities which in Scotlandhave been conferred on the larger units of local government (insteadof on the nominated ad hoc water authorities as in England and Wales);(d) to assume control of the police service thus eliminating all need for joint police authorities. And with the police service, for technical reasons,would go the fire service and the main responsibility for traffic management;(e) important functions in the field of education. Thus it. would not bedifficult to confer on the Scottish and Welsh governments the maineducational responsibilities now exercised by the Scottish and welsh offices; these include primary and secondary schools, nursery schools and further education. The English regional intermediate level govern-ments could be given similar responsibilities;(/) important functions in the field of housing. Thus, the existing housingfunctions of the Scottish and Welsh Offices could be transferred to thenew Scottish and Welsh Governments. These are substantial. TheEnglish intermediate level governments could be given similarresponsibilities;(g) the residual power for the good government and general welfare of thepeople in their areas;(h) appropriate financial powers and resources.Intermediate level governments with this range of responsibilities at the outset of Phase II would obviously have a major role to play in the running of ouraffairs. And that role would become even bigger as they gradually assume thefull range of functions envisaged in Phase III.30. We believe that by implementing the proposals summarised above the devolution of functions from Whitehall and Westminster to democraticallyelected Assemblies in the different nations and regions of the United Kingdom
coupled with increasing the role of Parliament in policy-making in both Londonand Brussels power will gradually be returned to the people and their repre-sentatives. There will be much more opportunity and encouragement for all of usto help shape the decisions which affect our lives. Government will be moreobviously be based on the consent of the governed. If we wish to restoredemocracy in Britain we can do no less than we propose; and we can do no more if we want to maintain the political and economic unity of the UnitedKingdom.XXll
THE NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM AND THENEED FOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMIntroduction: the terms of reference . Our terms of reference require us to &quot;examine the present functions ofthe central legislature and government in relation to the several countries,nations, and regions of the United Kingdom&quot;. We are then to consider &quot;havingregard . ... to the interests and prosperity of Our people under the Crownwhether any changes are desirable in those functions or otherwise in present constitutional and economic relationships&quot;. This is an exceptionally wide remit.It means that virtually every aspect of the central legislature and governmentis subject to our scrutiny. After all, the essential purpose of the way our centralmachine of government operates is to contribute in some way or other to&quot;the interests and prosperity&quot; of the people &quot;in the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom&quot;. Indeed, only if we recommend the abolitionof the Monarchy would we be in conflict with our terms of reference; thatappears to be precluded by the limitation of our concern to &quot;the interests and prosperity of Our people under the Crown&quot;. But that restriction apart, the wholeform and operation of the United Kingdom system of Government is open to us.2. Nor was our remit in any way constricted by the Prime Minister,Mr. Wilson, when he spoke of our task in the House of Commons at the timethe decision to set up the Commission was announced. An important reasonfor appointing the Commission Mr. Wilson said in the debate on the Addresswas the &quot;strong feeling, not only in Scotland and Wales, but in many parts ofEngland, of a greater desire for participation in the process of decision making[moving it] nearer wherever this is possible to the places where people live&quot;1.This clearly implied that the question of devolution or decentralisation must bean essential part of our concern. But it also inevitably meant that we had toconsider whether there is &quot;a greater desire for participation&quot;, and, if so, whatprecisely that means. Does it mean there is a demand for devolution? And,if so, for what sort of devolution ? Or does it mean that people are not interestedin any more devolution than already exists, but want instead a greater share inthe decision-making processes of central government? Or is &quot;a greater desire for participation&quot; a way of expressing discontent with our political parties inthe operation of our party system rather than with the main institutions ofgovernment themselves? Or is it, in part, simply a demand for better and moreresponsive machinery for dealing with individual complaints and grievancesrather than for a greater positive share in government policy-making? Or,could it be that the basic cause of any discontent is a general feeling that our traditional liberties are being eroded by a massive growth of state power andbureaucracy? Questions like these, which naturally and inevitably spring fromthe relatively narrower base of participation and devolution emphasised by thePrime Minister, naturally and inevitably lead us to look at virtually every aspect of our main institutions of government and the way they work.1. Hansard, 30th October, 1968,VoIume 772, column 35.
3. It was right, therefore, that our terms of reference were drawn up in suchan all-embracing way. They recognised that the essential purpose of our investi-gation was to look at our system of government as a whole and to considerwhether it matches the needs and aspirations of the people in all parts of theUnited Kingdom. This involved seeking answers to such questions as: (a) Are our main institutions today well adapted to the tasks we, the people,call on them to perform?(b) Are our institutions responsive enough to perform those tasks as we want them performed?(c) Have we the opportunities we need for participation in the process ofgovernment?(d) Does our system of government provide adequate means for the redressof individual grievances and for the safeguarding of civil liberties andminority rights?(e) Are our institutions likely to prove flexible enough to meet the needs ofthe future in so far as these needs can be identified?There are other questions, too, which we had to consider if we were to do a worthwhile and balanced job, but those listed above are enough to indicatethat it would have been wrong to place restrictions on ourselves which were notimposed by our terms of reference.4. The scope of the inquiry, then, envisaged by our terms of reference wasinevitably far-reaching and comprehensive. It was about our system of govern-ment as a whole which is the only way systems of government can properly be investigated. No doubt this is why our official title is &quot;Commission on theConstitution&quot;. And this is where we first part company with the majority ofour colleagues. They have argued that &quot;such a wide review was not intended,and would not be practicable&quot;; and they have accordingly mostly limited them-selves to what they argue was &quot;the main intention behind our appointment . . .that we should investigate the case for transferring or devolving responsibilityfor the exercise of government functions from Parliament and the centralgovernment to new institutions of government in the various countries and regions of the United Kingdom&quot;1; accordingly, their specific institutionalrecommendations are limited to this single issue of devolution, even though theword &quot;devolution&quot; was never mentioned in our terms of reference. In contrast,we have operated on a very much broader canvas;, we have not sought toconstrict the wide remit of our terms of reference.The tasks of modern government5. In investigating whether our institutions of government today match theneeds and aspirations of the people of the United Kingdom, it is natural to start by considering the vast expansion in the functions and responsibilities ofgovernment which has taken place particularly since the end of the nineteenth century. In the reign of Queen Victoria, the tasks of government were for themost part relatively simple; they were mainly passive and regulatory. Since thenits traditional regulatory functions have multiplied in size and greatly broadened1 Majority Report, Chapter I, paragraphs 13 and 14.
in scope. It has also taken on vast new duties particularly since the second world War. Then the government accepted responsibility for the maintenanceof full employment and the provision of comprehensive social services. Now itis expected to achieve such general economic aims as a satisfactory rate of growth, stable prices and a healthy balance of payments. Through nationalisationit has become responsible for most of our basic industries. It has assumed responsibility, too, for the location of industry, and for town and country planning. The latest and perhaps most far-reaching duty we now call on our government to undertake is the general preservation and improvement of the environment; and this has been signalised by the creation of a new &quot;giant&quot;department the Department of the Environment.6. These vastly enlarged responsibilities of central government are reflected in the great increase in public expenditure. It has grown from about 100millionsin 1870 when it was 9 per cent, of the gross national product and  3 per headof the population to some  20,000 millions in 1970-43 per cent, of the G.N.P.and some  400 per head of the population. They are reflected, too, in the great increase in the number of civil servants employed in central government. In 1914the size of the non-industrial civil service (excluding the Post Office) was61,000; today it is over half a million.7. The expansion in the size of the central bureaucracy is not only the consequence of the enlarged role of government. It also reflects a greatlyincreased and increasing sophistication in the techniques of decision-making;it reflects, too, the growing complexity of the problems the government hasto handle.8. This enlargement of the role of government and the increased complexities of the problems it is called on to handle have not been matched by anycorrespondingly large changes in our main institutions of government. This isnot to say that there have been no changes in the role and working of parliament and the Cabinet, in the administration of justice, or in the responsibilities and organisation of local government. Nor is it to say that no new institutions havebeen developed to meet new needs. But at best the changes have been piecemealimprovisations following no coherent pattern or plan; at worst they have often been self-contradictory and self-defeating.The general pattern of institutional change, 1870-19709. The first and most obvious change is in the size of the central executive.Disraeli in 1874 had a Cabinet of twelve. Lord Salisbury in 1900 had nineteen.Since then the size of the Cabinet has remained fairly stable at about twenty;Mr. Wilson had a Cabinet of twenty-three and Mr. Heath has eighteen1.There has, though, been a marked increase this century in the number of non-Cabinet Ministers. In 1900 there were ten; in 1960 there were twenty; Mr. Heathhas twenty-eight. And there has been an increase, too, in the number of junior ministers from thirty-one in 1900 to fifty-eight in 1967. In broad terms thismeans that in this century the number of Ministers has just about doubled.1 This and the subsequent figures for Mr. Heath&apos;s Government given in the rest of thisparagraph refer to the situation on 1st January, 1973.
By contrast their staffs have gone up not less than tenfold. Thus in 1900, twenty-nine Ministers (plus thirty-one Junior Ministers) controlled about 50,000 CivilServants; today there are forty-eight Ministers (plus fifty-eight Junior Ministers)to over half a million Civil Servants.10. This vast increase in the size of the central executive-particularly thevery much larger expansion in the number of Civil Servants compared with ministers has fundamental implications for democratic control. There is some reason to believe that the day-to-day burden on Ministers is now so great that they are unable to control adequately the full range of departmentalbusiness. If this is true the new balance of power gives bureaucracy the edgeover democracy. Certainly, the concept of individual ministerial responsibilityfor all departmental decisions is today little more than a constitutional fiction.11. The problem of ministerial control is starkly focussed by the emergence of the new &quot;giant&quot; departments like the Department of Trade and Industry(created in October, 1970, by the amalgamation of the Board of Trade, theMinistry of Technology and part of the Department of Employment and productivity) and the Department of the Environment (created in November,1970, by the amalgamation of the Ministries of Housing and Local Government,Public Building and Works, and Transport). On 1st January, 1971, the D.T.I.consisted of three Ministers and 24,800 Civil Servants; and in the Departmentof the Environment there were four Ministers and 38,900 Civil Servants.Clearly, departments of this magnitude and each with nearly 100 CivilServants at the level of Under Secretary and above-are not easy to subject to close ministerial supervision1.12. Whether Ministers run departments or departments run Ministers,there is no doubt that Parliament is less well-equipped today to exercise inde-pendent control of the executive than it was in 1900. For one thing, just about100 M.P.s now hold paid government posts and are thus part of the executivethey are supposed to control compared with only 33 in 1900. More important,though, there has been little expansion in the House of Commons staff to match the growth of government. In 1966 the number of House of Commons&apos; Clerkswas one fewer than in 1900 (i.e., 36 compared with 37); in 1971 there were 46.Nor does the House sit for much longer (an average of 129 days a year beforethe First World War compared with an average of 149 days a year between thewars and 163 days a year since 1945). In fact we spend much less on the Houseof Commons than on any single department of state in 1968/9 the cost of theHouse of Commons was  4,862,000 compared with the Treasury&apos;s  9 million and the Home Office&apos;s  29 million and yet the Commons should be the ultimatemaster of them all. Only since the mid-1960s has there been much of an attemptto redress the balance with some expansion of House of Commons staff&quot; andthe development of Specialist Select Committees. Even so nothing moreaccurately reflects the true position of the Commons than the fact that the new and potentially very influential Select Committee on Expenditure cannot buildup its own staff or even add to it a single clerk without the prior approval ofthe Treasury the very body it is in theory there to control.1 The figures are taken from &quot;New Trends in Government&quot; by Sir Richard Clarke,page 119, where Annex I illustrates that the problem is common to most large departments.
13. A further major factor which has contributed to the emasculation of theHouse of Commons has been the development of our mass political parties and the attendant party discipline. So far this century no government whichstarted its term with an overall majority has ever been defeated and forced to resign. Thus the concept on which ultimate Parliamentary control of theExecutive is supposed to rest the collective responsibility of the Cabinet toParliament no longer operates in its traditional sense. Certainly, thanks to modern party discipline, the Government can almost invariably rely on getting a majority for its policies.14. Moreover, governments today increasingly by-pass the House ofCommons in the policy-making process. Before Bills are introduced into parliament governments frequently and naturally have confidential discussions about the proposed new policies with the representatives of the various outside interests most likely to be affected by them e.g.&quot;, the C.B.I., the T.U.C., theB.M.A., the N.F.U., etc. And while this has the obvious merit of associatinginterested parties more closely with the formative stages of the policy-makingprocess, nevertheless it has the equally obvious consequence of reducing the contribution which backbenchers make to the development of.policy or theform of legislation.15. So, then, the House of Commons has gradually been losing out to theExecutive. As we have seen, the twin concepts on which its control is supposed to rest-individual ministerial responsibility and collective responsibility-have lost much of their nineteenth century content. And the House has not yetsufficiently expanded its staffs or adapted its committee structures and opera-tions to match the growth of the Executive. Quite simply we have to recognisethat the main instrument of democracy the House of Commons no longerwields the power it did1.16. Alongside the continued growth and strengthening of the central executive,there has been a! corresponding weakening of the other main arm of democracy local government. Since 1945 local authorities have lost their responsibilities for hospitals, gas, electricity, trunk roads, public assistance and valuation for rating. The abolition of watch committees and the creation of joint police authorities has reduced still further local authority control over our police forces. And local authorities are shortly to lose water, sewerage and what theyhad left of health. These losses have to some extent been offset by the acquisitionof new duties in such fields as town and country planning, social services, and child care. But local governments increasing financial dependence on centralgovernment together with the expansion of other means of central control(e.g., central approval of various schemes) has meant that over the years the capacity of local government for initiative and independence has declined. Thefailure hitherto to expand the geographical areas of local government to meetthe needs of modern administration has accelerated the decline.1 The position of the House of Commons in the nineteenth century has been well summed up by Professor John P. Mackintosh in his book &quot;The British Cabinet&quot;&apos;. Writing with referenceto the period 1830 to 1880, Mackintosh says: &quot;In that half-century, the House of Commonssacked Cabinets, it removed individual ministers, it set up select committees to carry outinvestigations and frame Bills and it re-wrote government Bills on the floor of the House .. .&quot;(Second Edition, page 613). And its position today has perhaps been most succinctly expressedby Professor A. N. Hanson and Malcolm Walles in their book &quot;Governing Britain&quot; wherethey have written: &quot;The House of Commons is essentially a body in which the back benchMembers ratify decisions taken elsewhere. It legitimises but does not legislate&quot;, (page 68).
17. All this is vividly reflected in the changing financial balance between central and local government. In 1870 more than half of total government expenditure was undertaken by local authorities; by 1970 this proportion had fallen to less than one-third. Equally striking has been the fall in the proportionof local authorities&apos; expenditure financed by themselves. In 1870 probablyabout 80 per cent, of local expenditure was financed by local rates, fees and charges; in 1970 this percentage had fallen to 45 per cent.18. Many of the functions taken away from local government have beengiven to ad hoc bodies of various kinds hospital boards, gas boards, electricity boards, and so on. Indeed, one of the main institutional developments since1945 has been the proliferation of a wide range of ad hoc authorities. They havenot been confined to duties previously the responsibility of local government.Many of the new tasks of central government have also been entrusted to adhoc authorities. Some perform executive functions like Nature ConservancyCommittees, the Arts Council, River Authorities, the Gas, Electricity and hospital Boards, the Coal Board, the Post Office and so on. Others are mainlyadvisory like the Economic Planning Councils, the Broadcasting Councils and committees for Aviation.19. Many of the executive bodies were set up in the cause of managerialefficiency; and it was felt that this could be achieved only if responsibility forthe functions concerned was entrusted to specially nominated (rather thanelected) individuals who must be able to operate without being subjected to the detailed control of local or central government. Often the effect has been tomake the operations of these bodies largely independent of democratic super-vision certainly in their day-to-day impact on the life of the community.20. The advisory committees are a device to associate a wide range of interested individuals and organisations with government and public authoritydecision-making processes to provide a link between those who make decisions and those affected by them. But, like the executive ad hoc authorities they arenominated and not elected. Thus they enable the executive to have a decisivevoice in determining who should give it advice. And that advice is usuallygiven in secret.21. As the central departments of government have grown both in number and size to cope with the increased range and complexity of government duties,many departments have found it necessary to set up their own regional andlocal structures. It is not a tidy picture. The Department of Education and science has no regional organisation (apart from its Inspectorate of Schools).The Department of Employment has a network of local and regional offices and divides England into seven regions to which its 900 or so local offices areresponsible. The Department of Health and Social Security operates through anumber of different regional structures. It divides England into ten regions forgeneral administration purposes on the Health side of its responsibilities, butit has six regions for general practitioner purposes and two regions for its dentalservice responsibilities; at the same time the Department divides England intoten regions for social security administration and has 654 local offices. Although,as these examples indicate, there is no uniformity in the pattern of regional or local organisation which central departments have developed, nevertheless the
extent of this departmental regional and local organisation is now so great that over twice as many civil servants work in departmental regional and local offices as at the departmental headquarters1.22. This large scale administrative decentralisation has important implications-tions for the problem of democratic control. In the interests of efficiencydepartments have devolved a great deal of administrative authority to theirregional and local outposts. There are, however, no regional ministers (apartfrom the Scottish and Welsh Secretaries of State) to give close supervision tothe work of civil servants at these levels. So that in so far as these civil servantsare involved in administrative decision-making they are operating without being subject to much, if any, democratic control since the doctrine of ministerial responsibility must obviously be still further attenuated when applied to thework of departmental outposts.23. This vast expansion in the work of central government, the increasein the number and size of government departments, their development of regional and local outposts, the tremendous growth of the civil service, the over-shadowing of Parliament, the decline in the independent responsibilities of local government, and the proliferation of non-elected ad hoc authoritiesoperating for the most part in secret have, of course, been accompanied bysome countervailing institutional developments designed to safeguard the rightsof individuals. Thus we have developed a system of public enquiries whichprecede final ministerial decision in land-use planning questions where individualproperty rights or amenity questions may be in dispute. We now have a largenumber of administrative tribunals (e.g. National Insurance Tribunals, Indus-trial Injuries Tribunals, Rent Tribunals, Transport Tribunals, etc.) to whichindividuals can appeal if they believe they are being denied their pension rights, etc. And most recently we have created the office of parliamentary commissioner for Administration (sometimes referred to as the Ombudsman) toprovide a further channel for the investigation of individual complaints againstadministrative decisions; and this institutional device is being extended to localgovernment and the health service. But, important as these developments are,they are in two fundamental respects very far from being an adequate counter-poise to the trends outlined in paragraphs 9 to 22 above.24. First, they fail to provide the individual with the full independent safe-guards he needs against administrative decision-making. For example, membersof administrative tribunals are not as independent of the executive as are members of the judiciary; and in some cases no appeal is possible. In any event,there is now such a complexity of different tribunals that an aggrieved citizenmay not always know where to take his case. And in planning cases it is theMinister who is the final arbiter between private rights and the public interest.As far as the Ombudsman is concerned, important areas are outside his purview1 Civil Service Statistics, 1970 (published by H.M.S.O. in February, 1971) states that:&quot;Government establishments can be divided into three types: &apos;headquarters&apos;, which comprisethe Ministerial Offices and supporting policy-making and other branches which performfunctions of a countrywide character; &quot;regional&apos; and &apos;local&apos; (which consist mainly of officesresponsible for detailed work in a locality but also include research establishments and a fewmiscellaneous groups). On this basis on 1st January, 1970, there were 146,000 staff in the&apos;headquarters&apos; category, 21,000 in the &quot;regional&apos; and 306,000 in the &apos;local&apos; categories (mostof the remaining 17,000 were employed overseas, at sea or in transit). In other words threeout of five civil servants worked in the group which consists predominantly of local offices and establishments&quot;.
altogether (e.g., complaints against the police or the nationalised industries,though there is now a similar proposal as far as the first example is concerned).Even within the area of the Ombudsman&apos;s jurisdiction he is on the wholeprecluded from considering the merits of an administrative decision and is largely restricted to considering merely whether the proper administrativeprocedures have been observed in reaching the particular decision which is thesubject of the individual complaint. Moreover, the fact that he can be approachedonly through an M.P. severely restricts the number of cases with which he dealsin any one year. And it looks as though there will also be serious restrictionson the work of the proposed Health Seivice and Local GovernmentOmbudsmen.Conclusion25. The inadequacies outlined in paragraph 24 can be remedied relativelyeasily. The number of administrative tribunals could be reduced and appealmade available in all cases. Individual rights in planning decisions might befurther protected by setting up an independent authority to decide appeals, orby increasing procedural safeguards prior to the Ministers decision. And theambit and powers of all the Ombudsmen could clearly be extended so thattheir responsibilities would match those of their counterparts in the countries from which this institution was copied.26. However, even if the reforms suggested in paragraph 25 were put intoeffect they would still be a completely inadequate counterpoise to the trendsoutlined in paragraphs 9 to 22 above. This is because the fundamental conse-quence of these trends has been the erosion of the extent to which we as a peoplegovern ourselves. And this is an issue quite distinct from the question of safeguarding individual rights in the processes of administration.27. The main institutions which exist to enable us to govern ourselves are an elected House of Commons and elected local government authorities. Asparagraphs 9 to 22 indicate, it is these elected bodies which have been steadilylosing power to a vastly enlarged executive and an increasing number of non-elected ad hoc authorities. M.P.s today (except those in paid governmentposts) have little positive share in the main policy formulating process; and theydo not participate at all in the control of the mass of administrative decisions which so much affect the day-to-day life of the community and which are takenwithin the departments of central government, their regional and local outpostsor in the various ad hoc authorities. Parliaments relative powerlessness in thepolicy formulating and administrative processes expresses itself in an essentiallynegative carping criticism of, and ex post facto investigation of, the departmentaldecisions it has been excluded from participating in. So Parliaments relationship with government departments is an essentially unfruitful one. M.P.S by theirnegative criticism and search for information add greatly to the burdens ofcivil servants and thus impede efficiency without being able to exercise any positive democratic control. Even a Minister, nowadays, has such a vastday-to-day burden of policy and administrative decision making that it is doubt-ful if he can personally exercise real (as opposed to nominal) control over morethan a small fraction of the thousands of decisions that civil servants make inhis name.
28. So government appears, and is, remote from the people and their repre-sentatives. Popular dissatisfaction expresses itself in a number of ways. Thereare the nationalist movements in Scotland and Wales; there the demand is for independence so the people in those parts of Great Britain can actuallytake over the government of their countries themselves. Everywhere in theUnited Kingdom there is a growing &quot;we-they&quot; syndrome with an increasingrecognition that &quot;they&quot; control &quot;us&quot;, rather than &quot;we&quot; control &quot;them&quot;. political parties and elections appear to do nothing to redress the balance. Hence thepeople are increasingly alienated from the political process.. For example,since the general election of 1950 there has been a fairly regular decline in theproportion of the electorate going to the polls1. In local elections, fewbother to vote at all. Those who seek to get their demands met are more and moreresorting to direct action instead of putting their hopes in normal constitutional and institutional processes; so workers occupy shipyards, enraged house-holders block motorways and in Northern Ireland minority grievances had become so acute and the means of redress so slow that in the special circum-stances of Ulster the gun-man and terrorist were able to move in.29. Quite simply, the fact has to be faced that if we really believe that democracymeans some sort of government by the people, our institutions do not make adequate provisions for this today. And this at a time when a more educatedcitizenry has a greater capacity for playing a fuller part in the country&apos;s decision-making processes than ever before in our history.1 Thus in the 1950 General Election, the turn-out was 84 per cent. In 1951 it was 82-5 percent.; in 1955, 76-8 per cent.; in 1959, 78-7 per cent.; in 1964; 77-1 per cent.; in 1966, 75-8 percent.; in 1970, 72 per cent. This is in sharp contrast with nearly every other comparabledemocracy. (See paragraph 77 in Chapter II where the point is further developed andillustrated.)
THE NATURE OF OUR PRESENT DISCONTENTSthe written and oral evidenceIntroduction30. Evidence received by Royal Commissions is notoriously unreliable andunrepresentative. This is partly because those who volunteer informationfrequently have special axes to grind. And though Commissions do their best to invite before them those representing as wide a cross-section of opinion aspossible, it is, for the most part, the literate, educated middle classes who respond.So the weight of written and oral evidence received by Commissions is notnecessarily an accurate indication of the nation&apos;s views and opinions.31. The evidence we received was, of course, no exception to this general rule; and there is no doubt that it distorted the extent and nature of thedissatisfaction felt about our system of government. For example, the greatmajority of those who volunteered or were invited to give evidence about thestate of affairs in Wales were middle-class Welsh-speaking Welshmen; whereas,of course, only about one-fifth of the people in Wales claim to speak the languagefluently, and about half neither speak it nor understand it at all. Anotherobvious imbalance in our evidence was between Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland on the one hand, and, on the other, the different regions of England.We took a great deal of evidence in Scotland, Wales and Northern Irelandwhere we had some 30 meetings (including both the public and the privatesessions) and heard from 210 witnesses on the problems of those parts of theUnited Kingdom. By way of contrast we had only 2 meetings outside london to hear English regional witnesses, though we did have 8 meetings in london at which some 50 witnesses from the regions (mainly members of the economic planning Councils) gave evidence (all of it in private). In this general context,even the Commission itself might be thought to be unrepresentative. over one-third of our membership was drawn from Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland though those parts contain less than one-fifth of the population of theUnited Kingdom. And the Commission members for Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland were reinforced by the appointment of Scottish, Welsh andNorthern Ireland Assistant Commissioners.32. Our written and oral evidence, then, is unbalanced. It tells us why some people are critical of the existing state of affairs and indicates the nature and variety of their dissatisfaction. It does not, however, tell us anything aboutthe nature and extent of any general dissatisfaction with our system of govern-ment and the intensity with which this may be felt in the community as a whole.Still, it is useful to start with this evidence as a guide to the main features of our system of government which are today being called in question.The views of the critics33. To any student of government, there was nothing new or unexpectedin the written and oral evidence from those outside the government machine.
The criticisms which were put to us can best be grouped under two main heads:Centralisation and the Erosion of Democracy. They are summarised in thefollowing two paragraphs.34. As far as centralisation is concerned, the point was made that the UnitedKingdom is the largest and most centralised unitary state in Western Europe.It was argued that the degree of centralisation is so great that it has the followingundesirable consequences ^ -(a) Local Government is too closely controlled by the officials of centralgovernment; this leaves too little scope for local initiative and means that important decisions are often made by those who are inevitablyremote from a real understanding of the practical problems involved.ib) Over-centralisation produces too much emphasis on uniformity, whereas the needs of the different parts of the United Kingdom are obviouslyvery varied. In any event, people should be able to cultivate differencesif they want to, rather than be forced by Whitehall into the strait-jacketof uniformity. The heavy-handed paternalism of Whitehall should give way to the spirit of regional and local initiative.(c) In the allocation of resources the special needs and wishes of the different parts of the United Kingdom are not properly appreciated. Thus, theTreasury makes out a five-year rolling programme of public expenditureon a functional basis. Headings such as housing, law and order, education,health and welfare cover the whole country and the rate of increase to be permitted is fixed for each category at a certain percentage. this procedure, it is argued, neglects the obvious fact that the right balanceof functional spend as between, say, education on the one hand androads on the other, might be different in different parts of the country.If decisions about the allocation of public expenditure between roads,hospitals, schools, etc. were made on a regional basis and by the regions,the needs of the regions would be better served than by the remotedecisions now taken in Whitehall.id) Central Government has now become so big and its attempts at admin-istrative control so detailed that there is frequently a lack of co-co-ordination between the thousands of departmental officials. So Whitehall speakswith many voices; the attempt to obey produces conflict and frustration.(e) The centre is seriously overloaded. Ministers, it is suggested, are soburdened with the day-to-day attempt to run their large departmentsthat they have too little time for long-term or even short-erm policythinking. Within departments as a whole the pressures are so great thatthere are long delays in securing the decisions without which firms cannotplan their investment programmes, local authorities cannot build theirroads or schools, and people cannot get their complaints about social security or other administrative decisions investigated. As far as Parlia-ment is concerned, it is suggested that its timetable is now so congestedand the Bills it processes so long and detailed that it simply does nothave the time to give adequate consideration to the major policy problems involved. It still has time to bark, but not to bite.While none of the above points is exactly novel, a reference to our detailedwritten evidence will show them presented by a wide range of people with
experience of public affairs. And they were frequently presented to us veryforcefully indeed in oral evidence.35. As far as the erosion of democracy is concerned, the main complaintsmade to us were: (a) The power of Parliament vis-a-vis the Executive has declined. CertainlyM.P.s today appear to have little influence on the Executive^ policy-making processes. They are officially brought into the act only when thegovernment presents its policy decisions for their approval; and strictparty discipline in the end ensures the Executive mostly gets its way.The growth in the use of delegated legislation has also played its part in reducing the role of Parliament.(b) Many of the executive responsibilities of government have been handedover to nominated ad hoc authorities which run the nationalised industries, broadcasting, the health services, and so on. Since these bodies are not democratically elected and their day-to-day work isspecifically removed from ministerial control, this means that in practicethey are not accountable to, or controlled by, the people.(c) The activities of government (both central and local) and of the ad ad hoc authorities (particularly the advisory ones like the Economic planning councils) are too much shrouded in secrecy. This applies particularly to the formulation of policy. In the formative stages people are too oftenkept in ignorance of what is going on; so they are unable to have anymeaningful influence on the policy-making process.(d) The means for the redress of individual grievances are inadequate-whether the grievances are against central or local government or thead hoc authorities. As the responsibilities of government have expanded,administrative authorities of various kinds have been given wide dis-cretionary powers which may affect the lives and properties of everyindividual in the community. The means to investigate individualcomplaints against these decisions and to secure the redress of individual grievances have not kept pace with the vast expansion of this discretionarybureaucratic power. When a citizen cannot secure what he believes heis entitled to, or sustains damage as a result of a decision or action by agovernment agency, or finds his way of life or his property are beinginterfered with by state officials, he often faces insuperable difficultiesin seeking to ensure that he is being treated fairly and reasonably. Evenif he can see how to overcome these difficulties the costs incurred (interms of time and money) in seeking redress may be so great that he willprefer to do nothing.Again, none of the above complaints is exactly novel. It is a natural reactionagainst the trends of government outlined in Chapter I.36. The net effect of the complaints about centralisation and the erosionof democracy led some of our witnesses to argue that government had becometoo remote from, and insensitive to, the needs of the people; and that thepeople are excluded from an adequate share in the decision-making processeswhich so much affect their lives.
the evidence of public opinionIntroduction37. We recognised as a Commission that while we could be reasonablycertain about the main features of our system of government which are todaybeing called in question, it was not so easy to determine the extent of thesediscontents. This was partly why we commissioned an Attitude Survey ofPublic Opinion. It is reproduced separately as Research Paper 7.38. The Survey in fact had three main objectives. We wanted to measure,of course, the extent and nature of any general dissatisfaction with our systemof government. But within that general remit we specifically wanted information on three main themes: (a) The theme of participation. How far is any dissatisfaction with our system of government due to a feeling that the &quot;ordinary man&quot; can playno part in the processes of government the &quot;We and They&quot; situation ?Does he want to have a bigger share in political decision making thanthe system now provides for? Or is the main cause&apos;of any discontentnot so much due to an unsatisfied demand for a larger active role in political decision making but caused instead, for example, by: (i) the feeling that government operations at all levels are conducted in too much secrecy, or(ii) the feeling that the existing machinery for dealing with individualcomplaints is inadequate.(b) The theme of nationalism. Does nationalism in Scotland and Walesadd a different dimension or intensity to the questions at (a) above ?(c) The theme of devolution. How far is devolution seen as a means of satisfying popular discontent? Is there a preferred form of devolution(e.g. a devolution of power from the centre to elected bodies or to non-elected ones) ?39. Unfortunately, however, the Commission was not as successful as itmight have been in establishing the state of public opinion on these matters.This is because: (a) Much of the ground to be covered was inevitably abstract; to get atattitudes towards such concepts as centralisation, regionalism andparticipation was not exactly easy.(b) People naturally had difficulty in distinguishing whether their discontentwas with the government of the day or with the system of government itself.(c) The Commission asked for only one Survey to be done; there was no attempt to measure any change in, or stability of, attitudes over a periodof time.(d) The Commission did not ask those who carried out the Survey to settheir findings in the context of other comparable work in the field1.1 This is in sharp contrast to a similar survey done for the Fulton Committee on theCivil Service. The Fulton survey was conducted by A. H. Halsey and I. M. Crewe and was published as Volume TJI of the Report (H.M.S.O., 1969). Halsey and Crewe were asked toset and discuss their findings on the British Civil Service alongside comparable information about other professions in the United Kingdom and about the Civil Services of other countries.
This was a pity. A comparison of the Survey&apos;s findings with other material available might have been particularly instructive and wouldII   certainly have done something to off-set the limitation noted at (c)above.Still, the material in the Survey does make a useful starting point for an analysis of the extent and general nature of our discontents. However, on the questionof how far a demand for participation is a significant ingredient of thesediscontents, the Survey commentary seriously underplays its own evidence.We deal with each of these issues separately in the following paragraphs where we also try to supplement the findings of the Survey with other evidenceabout the state of public opinion on the various issues involved1.The extent and general nature of public discontents40. The Commission^ Attitude Survey reveals &quot;some general feeling ofdissatisfaction&quot;2 with the present system of government and &quot;a widespreadfeeling for some degree of change&quot;3. Indeed, 49 per cent, of those questionedthought the system needed major improvements4. The Survey says that &quot;thisdiffuse feeling of dissatisfaction pervaded all sections of the population . . .to much the same degree, though it was marginally stronger among the young,the middle classes and the more educated&quot;5. Nor, according to the AttitudeSurvey, can this &quot;diffuse feeling of dissatisfaction&quot; be written off as &quot;simply areflection of readiness to accept change for its own sake&quot;5.41. Of course, this finding of &quot;some general feeling of dissatisfaction&quot; withthe present system of government is not based on the response to one questiononly. It is borne out, too, by answers to questions in the rest of the Surveywhere attempts are made to probe the precise aspects of the system whichproduced the complaints, and to elicit the remedies people supported or wanted.These supplementary and more precise findings are discussed later in this chapter. First, though, it is useful to consider this main, general finding bothin an international context and also over a period of time. After all, it could bethat widespread criticism of the system is common to all democratic countries;and it could also be that widespread criticism in Britain in the summer of 1970was more a reaction against a particular government than a system of govern-ment.1 The additional information we have been able to provide is much more limited than we would have wished. This is because we did not have the time or resources to carry out thefull-scale operation here that was really needed.2 Attitude Survey, page x.3 Attitude Survey, page 1.4 Attitude Survey, Table 1, reproduced below: &quot;Which of these statements best expressed your opinion on the present system of runningBritain?&quot;Weighted base: all informants (4,892)&quot;Works extremely well and could not be improved&quot; 5 %&quot; Could be improved in small ways but mainly works well&quot; 43 %&quot; Could be improved quite a lot&quot; 35 %&quot;Needs a great deal of improvement&quot; 14%&quot;Don&apos;tknow&quot; 4%5 Attitude Survey, page x.
42. Unfortunately directly comparative international material is not easilyavailable. However, a survey done in 1959 provides an interesting perspectivein which to view the findings in paragraph 40 above. The survey was an attemptto compare the general attitudes to government in the United States, Britain,Western Germany, Italy and Mexico. In 1959 people in these countries, havingbeen told that the survey was about the peoples&apos; attitudes to their countryand to government and political affairs, were asked: &quot;Speaking generally,what are the things about this country that you are most proud of?&quot; In replying to this question, the respondents were not directed in any way to select politicalcharacteristics. So when they gave political institutional responses, it may beassumed that the expression of political pride was spontaneous. Eighty-fiveper cent, of the American respondents cited some feature of the Americansystem of government or political tradition the Constitution, politicalfreedom, democracy and the like compared with 46 per cent, for the British,7 per cent, for the Germans, 3 per cent, for the Italians and 30 per cent, for theMexicans1. So at this point of time, just over ten years before our Survey wastaken, the United States system of government was apparently much morefirmly rooted in the pride of the governed than our own system which had hadeven longer to become part of our national heritage and which at one time was thought to be one of our most important exports. In this general context it isparticularly significant that in a survey of British opinion in the spring of 1973no less than 34 per cent, of the respondents agreed with the extreme proposition that &quot;Our system of government will not give ordinary people what they wantuntil it is completely changed&quot;2. Which is, perhaps, not entirely surprisingin the light of a survey carried out in June, 1969, which revealed that 57 percent, then considered they had no influence at all on the country&apos;s future and when this survey was repeated in February, 1973, the figure had gone upto 63 per cent.31 The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations, by Gabriel A.Almond and Sidney Verba, 1963, page 102. The full table of responses was: Aspects of Nation in which Respondents report Pride, by Nation(in per cent.)Per cent who say they are proud of        U.S.     U.K.   Germany   Italy    MexicoGovernmental, political institutions 85 46 7 3 30Social legislation 13 18 6 1 2Position in international affairs 5 11 5 2 3Economic system 23 10 33 3 24Characteristics of people 7 18 36 11 15Spiritual virtues and religion 3 13 6 8Contributions to the arts 1 6 11 16 9Contributions to science 3 7 12 3 1Physical attributes of country 5 10 17 25 22Nothing or don&apos;t know 4 10 15 27 16Other 9 11 3 21 14Total % of responses* 158       148       148       118       144Total % of respondents 100       100      100      100       100Total number of cases 970      963       955      955     1,007* Percentages exceed one hundred because of multiple responses.2 Survey by Opinion Research Centre and published by The Times on 7th June, 1973.The full replies were: Agree 34 per cent.Disagree 55 per cent.Don&apos;t know 11 per cent.3 Surveys by Gallup.
43. In considering in more detail the main ingredients of the &quot;widespread&quot;and &quot;diffuse feeling of dissatisfaction&quot; with our system of government theAttitude Survey reveals that in essence it amounts to the fact that the &quot;ordinaryman&quot; feels powerless in the face of government. Thus, compositing the findings of a number of questions, the Attitude Survey showed than 55 per cent, of thepeople feel &quot;very powerless&quot; or &quot;fairly powerless&quot; in the face of government compared with 45 per cent, who felt &quot;not at all powerless&quot; or &quot;not reallypowerless&quot;1.44. This widespread feeling of &quot;powerlessness&quot; is compounded of threedistinct ingredients: (a) There is a &quot;felt lack of communication&quot; between government andgoverned2. &quot;There are two aspects of this problem; not only a feeling of lack of communication from local and central government about what they are doing but also a feeling that those in government are not aware of the views of the ordinary person, that they ought to be moreaware of them and to react to them&quot;2.(b) There is a similar &apos;felt lack&apos; of participation&apos; in government. This isclear from much of the material in the Survey. But since the Surveycommentary has tended to disregard or underplay this evidence whichis so important to the work of the Commission, we have assembled itseparately in the last section of this Chapter where we also supplement it with other evidence about the state of public opinion on this issue.(c) There is substantial dissatisfaction arising from a large body of un-resolved individual grievances against central and local governmentand a specified list of those services for which the central governmenthas ultimate responsibility the nationalised industries, the health service, etc. Because the Attitude Survey was not able to cover the full range of organisations and institutions against which many of us fairlyregularly have complaints3, the Survey findings are obviously an under-estimate of this kind of popular discontent4. Even so, the Survey findsthat almost two-thirds of the population &quot;had a grievance at some time&quot;.Of these, &quot;one-third failed to do anything about it, and another thirdcomplained but were left dissatisfied&quot;5. In terms of the populationas a whole &quot;these results indicate that just under half may have had inthe past grievances which remained unresolved either because they failedto complain about them or because their complaints were not dealt withsatisfactorily&quot;6. And of those with grievances who did not complain,1 Attitude Survey, page 20.2 Attitude Survey, page 22.3 Though it specifically included the National Health Service, British Rail, the Gas board the Electricity Board, and the Local Council Office, it did not, for example, specifically includeSocial Security Offices, Unemployment Exchanges, Inland Revenue Offices, the Police, etc.4 The Survey makes it clear that it was not a probe in depth of our attitude to the nationalised Industries and other public services (&quot;It was not the purpose of the survey to evaluate public services and the results of the survey cannot be used in this way&quot;. AttitudeSurvey, page 36). And, in fact, only two of the thirty Questions used in the Survey were evenpartially concerned with this issue.5 Attitude Survey, page 36.6 Attitude Survey, page 27.
the great majority said they failed to do so either because they thoughtit would be useless, or because of too much red tape, etc.; only 12 percent, decided that on reflection their grievance was mostly too trivialto be worth complaining about.45. It needs to be emphasised that the material in the Survey does not enable us to give a relative weighting to the above major causes of dissatisfactionreferred to in paragraph 44 above. This is because the extent of individual grievances against government and public services (i.e. 44 (c) above) wasprobed much less deeply and comprehensively than the dissatisfaction which led to the findings at 44 (a) and 44 (b) above. And the material which leads tothe conclusions at 44 (a) and 44 (b) above cannot be quantified in a way whichwould enable us to say that (a) is more important than (b) or vice versa.46. In this general context it is important to stress that the extent of thegeneral dissatisfaction with government was not significantly different in thedifferent parts of Britain. &quot;This diffuse feeling of dissatisfaction&quot;1, the AttitudeSurvey says, pervaded &quot;all regions of the country to much the same degree&quot;1;people in Scotland were only &quot;a little more dissatisfied with the present systemof government than those living elsewhere&quot;. This is of particular significancefor the work of the Commission in view of the further finding in the AttitudeSurvey about the extent of the sense of identity which exists on the one handbetween the people of Scotland and Wales and their respective countries, and,on the other, between the people of England and the regions in which theylive. Thus, the Attitude Survey points out: &quot;A major finding is that feelings of regional identification are fairlystrong throughout the country. Although they are particularly strong in wales and Scotland, they are almost as marked in the South West andYorkshire ... It therefore seems that the sentiments which exist inScotland and Wales are not unique; they are held to almost the same extent in the country as a whole and there are some regions of Englandwhere regional feeling is almost as strong&quot;2.In other words, in any reforms that may be necessary to alleviate the discontentsso far outlined no case has yet been made for treating the people in Scotlandand Wales much, if any, differently from the people in different regions ofEngland.The demand for participation a significant ingredient in our discontents?47. It was clearly crucial to our work to establish, if we could, whether ornot there was a frustrated demand for greater participation in the processes of government, the precise nature and extent of any such demand, and the institutional changes that might be necessary to accommodate it. After all,the essence of democracy is that the ordinary man should be involved in thepolitical system and should be able to participate in the political decision-making process.1 Attitude Survey, page 13.2 Attitude Survey, page 58.

After all,the essence of democracy is that the ordinary man should be involved in thepolitical system and should be able to participate in the political decision-making process.1 Attitude Survey, page 13.2 Attitude Survey, page 58.
48. There is a good utilitarian argument why a person should have theopportunity to take part in the political decision-making process quite apartfrom theoretical arguments derived from such concepts as the rights of man.The utilitarian argument is that one of the advantages a democratic political system is supposed to have over other systems is that those who are able toparticipate in decisions will therefore be more satisfied with the decisions and will be more attached to the system than those who cannot participate.A survey of attitudes to government systems in five different countries (theU.S.A., the United Kingdom, Western Germany, Italy and Mexico) suggeststhere is much validity in this thesis. It found that the degree of participation in decisions affected the degree of satisfaction with the system in which an individual participated. In general, satisfaction increased with participation.The opportunity to participate in political decisions was associated with greatersatisfaction with that system and with greater general loyalty to the system.49. We need, then, as a mature democracy to be sure that the opportunities for meaningful participation in the processes of government match the needs and aspirations of the people. That is an essential condition for political stability and satisfaction. And that is why a major part of our remit to those whoconducted the Attitude Survey was to establish whether the people of thiscountry wanted a greater share in political power more participation, as the popular phrase has it.50. Although the Attitude Survey contains some very useful raw materialon this problem, most unfortunately the general commentary in the Surveyfails to bring out its significance. From the raw material in the Survey it isabundantly clear that a substantial proportion of the population believe theydo not have as much share in political power as they ought to have. Yet nowherein the Survey Commentary is there any recognition of this. Indeed, quite thecontrary; the Survey Commentary gives the impression that the demand for more participation is negligible even if its exists at all.51. This serious under-estimate of the popular concern for a larger share in political power is largely due to the fact that the authors of the SurveyCommentary adopted an excessively restricted definition of this key politicalconcept and largely judged the interest in participation from the response toone question only. Thus only those who set a high value on the suggestionthat the general situation would be improved if we had &quot;more ordinary peoplerunning things&quot; were categorised as wanting a larger share of political power.And since the response to that particular question was not entirely and widelyenthusiastic (perhaps it might have drawn a more enthusiastic response if ithad been put in the form &quot;more people like yourself running things&quot;), the survey Commentary generally paints the picture that for the most part people are not interested in more participation. And then, by way of contrast, the survey Commentary develops the theme that what people really are concerned about is the lack of communication between the government and the governed.And here it puts most emphasis on the need for the government to take moretrouble to explain its policies to the general public and to make &quot;a positiveeffort to understand the people&apos;s needs&quot;2. So the general argument in the1 Almond and Verba, op cit., page 230 et seq.2 Attitude Survey, page 22.
Survey Commentary is that the main way to counter our present discontentsis for governments themselves to set about communicating more; and this theCommentary implies is much more important than devising any institutionalchanges to give people a larger share in political power for which, accordingto the Survey Commentary, there is little, if any, enthusiasm or concern.The following extracts from the Survey Commentary illustrate this generaltheme: (a) &quot;Less than a quarter of the sample . . . feel capable of dealing with the kinds of issues which local government handles ... Of course, this must not be taken to imply that such a proportion would in fact wantpolitical responsibility. Previous studies have shown that very manyfewer have ever shown much interest in becoming local governmentcouncillors. This seems to suggest that most people feel that those whoassume government responsibility are rather different from the ordinaryman and to this extent it can be said that there is a &quot;we and they&quot;situation&quot;1.(b) &quot;The majority feel that There should be more opportunity for ordinarypeople to become councillors&apos; despite the fact that most of them do not themselves feel capable of tackling the job of councillor; this suggeststhat although people do not necessarily feel able to play an active partin local government, they would like to feel that people on the council were sufficiently like themselves to understand their views. This inter-pretation is supported by the large proportion who agree with thestatement &apos;The council should take more notice of the views of thepeople who live in the area&apos; &quot;2.(c) &quot;Among the questions comprising the measure of political powerlessness,the ones clearly drawing the most emphatic response are&quot; those which&quot;indicate that there is a felt lack of communication. There are twoaspects to this problem; not only a feeling of lack of communication from local and central government about what they are doing but alsoa feeling that those in government are not aware of the views of theordinary person, that they ought to be more aware of them and reactto them. What people seem to be feeling a need for is not simply moreopportunity to make their views known to those in government (importantthough this is); the man in the street considers that his rulers should bemore positively concerned to know what his problems and his views are.This is evidenced by the very large proportion (73 per cent.) who agreestrongly that The Council should take more notice of the views of thepeople who live in the area&apos; &quot;3.(d) The argument at (c) above is &quot;further supported by the relative valuegiven to various suggestions for improving matters in their region. . . the suggestion thought likely to make the most marked improve-ment is Tor the government to take more trouble to understand the region&apos;s special needs&apos;; this suggestion, which implies the government1 Attitude Survey, page xi and page 34.2 Attitude Survey, page 19. It would have been very difficult for the great majority of people not to have agreed with that last statement.3 Attitude Survey, page 22. Our underlining. Again it would surely have been verydifficult indeed to disagree.
making a positive effort to understand the people&apos;s needs1, is rated alittle more highly than the suggestion which puts more of the onus onthe people to explain their problems To make it easier for people inthe regions to explain their special problems to the Government&apos; . . .The suggestion given least value is &apos;To have more ordinary peoplerunning things&apos;; only 19 per cent, give this a score of five, indicating that,at the regional level, the solution to problems is not widely seen aslying in the hands of people like themselves2. Nonetheless, the fifthwho feel that this would be a solution must not be discounted. Althoughthe majority feel that they would not be capable of coping with thesorts of decisions that the local council had to make, a sizeable minority(around 23 per cent.) do feel some confidence in their political capabilitiesand should not be ignored (though it cannot be assumed that they wouldbe interested in serving on the council)&quot;3.(e) &quot;In conclusion, it can be said that to some extent a &apos;we and they&apos;situation does exist in the country and that its effect is to make manyfeel that the ordinary person lacks power to influence government.Outstanding in the responses given to questions discussed in this section is the need which appears to be expressed for those in power in both thelocal and central government to do more to discover and to understand the views and problems of ordinary people. And this appears to be givenmore weight than providing opportunities for people to make theirviews known to those in power though many feel that this also shouldbe improved. When considered in conjunction with the low level ofconfidence in their political capability, it may be that many people donot feel competent to make their views and needs known to governmentbecause they do not understand the issues to which their views and needs are relevant; if this is the case, it would follow that people mighconsider that those who do understand these issues ought to investigate the feelings of those who will be affected&quot;4.(/) As far as those working in large private or public industries, etc., areconcerned, &quot;The indications are that the &apos;we and they&apos; feeling exists in which the same way and to much the same extent . . . Whilst many people would certainly like more say in how their work is organised,they give substantially more weight to having their views understoodand taken into account than to having direct responsibility formanagement&quot;5.(g) &quot;When people were asked to say spontaneously what they themselves would like to see done to improve things in their region, they mentioneda wide variety of subjects but only 3 per cent, mentioned more self-determination for the people&quot; (more say for the people) &quot;in the region&quot;6.(/;) &quot;Only about a quarter feel confident in their political capability&quot;7.1 Attitude Survey Commentary underlining.2 Our underlining.3 Attitude Survey, pages 22 and 23.4 Attitude Survey, page 23. Our underlining.5 Attitude Survey, page 37.6 Attitude Survey, page 54.7 Attitude Survey, page 17.
52. The majority of our colleagues have tended broadly to agree with this lineof argument. This is why they devote Part IX of their report to stressing thevalue of &quot;communication between government and people&quot;1. And afterquoting with approval the side-lined portion of the Survey Commentary repro-duced at paragraph 51 (c) above, they add: &quot;If, as we believe, this conclusion is right, the general disenchantment with government may be largely attributable to a failure in communication. Government must demonstrate more clearly tothe people that it is willing to put itself in their shoes and to listen as well asto inform&quot;2.53. We do not believe that the actual findings of the Survey support this general line of argument that (a) the main cause of dissatisfaction with government is the gap in communi-cation between the government and the people (the &quot;felt lack ofcommunication&quot;);(b) there is very little evidence of an unsatisfied demand for participation.54. That there is a &quot;felt lack of communication&quot;, thie Attitude Surveycertainly demonstrates. But it perhaps over-estimates its extent and importance.After all, when it was suggested to people by the interviewers that &quot;The council should take more notice of the views of the people who live in the area&quot; and&quot;The Government should take more trouble to understand the regions&apos; special needs&quot;, the vast majority were bound to agree. But if the Attitude Surveyprobably over-estimates the importance of the &quot;communications gap&quot; it most certainly seriously under-estimates the popular concern for a greater share in political power. And here it quite simply fails to understand the implications of its own evidence. The people are in fact at least as much concerned about&quot;a felt lack of participation&quot; as they are ahout &quot;a felt lack of communication&quot;.55. Assessing popular concern about &quot;participation&quot; is clearly a complexundertaking. This is largely because it can express itself in a number of different,if complementary, ways; and it is the failure to recognise this that has resultedin the commentary in the Attitude Survey failing to recognise the significance of its own raw material. In fact the demand for more &quot;participation&quot; can take any of the following forms: (a) A belief that the elected representatives of the people (whether inParliament or in a county or district council) should have more power.The objective here would be to enable the peoples&apos; representatives toparticipate more in, and have more influence on, the country&apos;s decision-making processes and thus enhance the influence of the people overgovernment.(b) A belief that there should be more opportunities for more people tobecome councillors or M.P.S.(c) Support for the idea of a devolution of power to elected Scottish and welsh Assemblies and to elected regional assemblies in England. here the objective would be to move decision making nearer to the people Majority Report, Part IX, Chapter 27, paragraph 1226.2 Majority Report, Part IX, Chapter 27, paragraph 1231. Our underlining.
affected by it and thus enable the people, through their elected represen-tatives, to feel they have a bigger influence on the decisions which affectthem.(d) Support for the idea of devolving power to still more localised bodiesthan those in (c) above e.g., to local government, parish councils,voluntary agencies, community associations, etc.(c) A general but perhaps incoherently expressed belief that in someunspecified way the people affected by government decisions shouldhave a share in making them or, put rather differently, a belief that the&quot;ordinary man&quot; should be able to play a bigger part in the process ofgovernment than is possible under the existing arrangements.(/) Support for the idea of regular referenda on important policy questions.Unfortunately, however, the Attitude Survey chose to limit its interpretation of participation to support for the idea of having &quot;more ordinary peoplerunning things&quot;. Accordingly, its conclusions on the &quot;participation&quot; themelargely neglect its own findings under (a) to (e) above.56. Before assessing the extent of the demand for more participation underthe various headings at paragraph 55 (a) to (/) above, it is important to remember that if one broadens the concept of participation to include thedevelopment of regular contacts between the government and the governed,then it can be argued that particularly since the Second World War there hasbeen a vast increase in this form of participation. Thus it is now virtually aconvention of our constitution that there should be consultations between thegovernment and the various interest groups like the C.B.I., the T.U.C., theB.M.A., etc., before decisions are taken which affect them or their members.Indeed, it is usual for the whole spectrum of interested associations and pressuregroups to be consulted in this way. It may be, of course, that there is a feeling that these contacts have the effect of undermining the role of the elected repre-sentatives of the people in parliament . Alternatively, it could be that thereis a feeling that existing contacts of this kind should be made a formal constitu-tional requirement. And it could also well be that there is a feeling that such a constitutional requirement to consult interested groups would not be enough, andthat some institutional mechanism should be devised whereby the representativesof these groups would actually share in the process by which decisions are taken(e.g., the House of Industry kind of institution once advocated by winston churchill or the formal representation of the more important groups in are formed House of Lords). But whether the existing system of consultationshould be modified, formalised, or go further, the fact remains that the govern-ment nowadays spends an enormous amount of time in consultations withthose outside organisations and interests whose members will be affected by its decisions. And it is against this background that the concern for participation of the kinds referred to in paragraph 55 needs to be assessed.57. In assessing the concern for participation under the different categoriesat 55 (a) to (/) above, it also needs to be remembered that crude measurement1 The Attitude Survey did not take any soundings on (/); but we refer to other evidence on this question later in this Chapter.2 See Chapter I, paragraph 14.
of percentage majorities is not enough for our purposes. An essential requisiteof any constitutional system is that it should freely and with the minimum of coercion elicit the consent of the governed to acts of government. A demo-cratic system of government seeks to do this by providing the people with theopportunity of governing themselves and associating as many as possible withthe processes of government though such devices as voting in elections, servingon elected bodies, or holding some non-elected office in the governmental process.It seeks to do it, too, by wide-ranging consultations of the kind referred to inparagraph 56.58. In this general context, as was pointed out in paragraph 48, the greater the opportunities to participate in political decisions, the greater the general satisfaction with, and loyalty to, the system. Thus not only do we need toprovide adequate opportunities for participation, but we also need to remember that if our system fails to provide substantial minorities with the influence and means of expression and participation they believe their due, the foundations of the body politic may be fatally undermined. It is against considerations ofthis kind that the extent of the concern for participation in the ways defined in paragraph 55 needs to be assessed.59. There is little doubt about the extent of the concern to see more par-ticipation as defined in paragraph 55 (a) above. Thus the Attitude Surveyshows that: (a) 53 per cent, believe the local council has very little power. The generalimplication here and in the rest of the Survey is that the local council should have more power but this specific question was not in factasked.(b) 55 per cent, believed that M.P.s do not &quot;have enough power and influence on what decisions are made&quot;2; this is particularly significant since60 per cent, believed that &quot;Most M.P.s are on the side of the man in the street and are always willing to listen to his views&quot;3.60. The findings of the Attitude Survey referred to in paragraph 59 above are well supported by evidence in other Surveys taken at different times. Thus, forexample: (a) A survey carried out in 1964-5 for the Maud Committee on theManagement of Local Government showed that nearly half the localgovernment councillors believed that their council did not have enoughpower4.(b) A survey of M.P.s in 19635 showed that: (i) 63 per cent, of them thought that the balance of power within theHouse of Commons since 1945 had shifted to the Executive.1 Attitude Survey, Table 13, page 16.2 Attitude Survey, Table 17, page 20. Indeed, only 9 per cent, were completely opposedto this view.3 Ibid., Table 17, page 20.4 Management in Local Government, Volume 2, page 156.5 The! Survey was carried out by the Observer and was published in their issue of27th March, 1963. It is reproduced in the first edition of Bernard Crick&apos;s The Reform ofParliament, page 207.
(ii) 44 per cent, of them believed back-bench M.P.S had too littleinfluence.(c) A survey of M.P.S in 1967 showed that over four-fifths of them believedthey did not have the information they needed to act as a check on theExecutive1.(d) A survey carried out in June, 1969, showed that only 21 per cent, of thepeople thought the average M.P. had a &quot;lot of influence on the country&apos;future&quot; while 15 per cent, thought he had none at all. And this corn-pares with 70 per cent, who put the Trade Unions in the top category of influence, 65 per cent, who put Big Business in that category and39 per cent, who put the Civil Service at that level of influence2. Andthis view about the relative powerlessness of back-bench M.P.s isreinforced by a large scale survey carried out in November, 1973, aboutpublic attitudes to Parliament. To get its full implications, it needs tobe studied in detail. But its authors summarise its findings thus: &quot;The ordinary constituent is aware of the average back-bencherspolitical impotence, and wants him to act as a more effectivespokesman for his constituents&apos; views and interests3.&quot;There is ample evidence, then, that people generally are disturbed by the&quot;Lack of participation&quot; of the kind defined in paragraph 55 (a).61. As far as the form of &quot;participation&quot; at 55 (b) above is concerned (i.e., the belief that there should be more opportunities for more people to becomecouncillors or M.P.s), the Attitude Survey asked the question only in respectof councillors; and on this 67 per cent, believed that there should be moreopportunity for ordinary people to become councillors4. In this context it isworth noting that 26 per cent, thought they could do as good a job as theaverage councillor5. This latter point leads the Attitude Survey Commentaryto say that &quot;only about a quarter feel confident in their political capability&quot;6.1 Anthony Barker and Michael Rush, The Member of Parliament and his Information,page 150. The precise question asked was: &quot;Do you think M.P.s feel they are adequatelyinformed about the many administrative acts of the Government and Civil Service?&quot;Eighty-two per cent, said &quot;No&quot;!2 The full response to the question &quot;How much influence do these groups have on thecountry&apos;s future?&quot; was: 	A lot of influencePrime Minister	75%Trade Unions	70%Big Business	65%Cabinet Ministers	54%Newspaper Proprietors	39%Civil Service	31%The average M.P.	21%Royal Family	19%House of Lords	18%The Church	15%Generals and Admirals	8%People like yourself	6%3 The Survey was carried out by N.O.P.&apos; for Granada Television. The quotation is fromIvor Crewe&apos;s and James Spence&apos;s summary of the findings in their article &quot;Parliament andthe Public&quot;, published in New Society on 12th July, 1973.4 Attitude Survey, Table 17, page 20.5 Attitude Survey, Table 14, page 16.6 Attitude Survey, page 17.
But in absolute numbers, &quot;only about a quarter&quot; represents about 10 million people aged 18 and over. And when this is set against the fact that under the reorganised system of local government there are less than 25,000 councillorsin Scotland, England and Wales, then those who believe they could do as gooda job as a local councillor are far in excess of the opportunities available.62. The third index of interest in more participation is the attitude to theidea of devolving power to directly elected Scottish and Welsh Assemblies andto similarly elected bodies in the English regions. (Paragraph 55 (c) above.)Clearly, there is a substantial body of opinion which would welcome a changeof this kind. Thus, in answer to one question, 61 per cent, indicated they wouldlike to see some degree of change that would allow more decisions to be madein Scotland, Wales and the English regions1. In answer to another question76 per cent, believed that things would be more efficiently run in their part ofthe country if Scotland/Wales/the region &quot;had more say in running its own affairs&quot;2. Similarly, 76 per cent, considered that if Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions &quot;had more say in running their own affairs&quot; then &quot;The ordinaryman could have more say in deciding what is done&quot;, and 81j!per cent, thoughtthat &quot;The needs of the people in the region would be looked after much better&quot;3. And if there were to be more devolution, at least 48 per cent, wanted the power to be devolved to democratically elected bodies4.63. Other surveys carried out over a period of time broadly support the findings in paragraph 62 about devolving power to elected assemblies inScotland, Wales and the English regions. Thus: (a) A survey by Gallup in 1966 found that 47 per cent, thought it a goodidea to set up regional Parliaments for Wales, Scotland and other areas;33 per cent, thought it a &quot;bad idea&quot; and 20 per cent, were &quot;Don&apos;tknows&quot;.(b) In a survey carried out by National Opinion Polls Limited in 1968,the question put was:-&quot;It has been suggested that Britain should have a system of electedregional councils and that these councils should be given some ofthe powers which Parliament now has. Would you be for or against this?&quot;The response was that 57 per cent, would be in favour and 27 per cent,opposed with 16 per cent. &quot;Don&apos;t knows&quot;. In the same survey 59 percent, believed the central government had too much power.64. On this question of &quot;attitude towards devolution&quot; as one index of interestin more participation it is useful to consider in more detail just which groups in society provide most support for some degree of devolution. Against an1 Attitude Survey, Table 45, page 62.2 Attitude Survey, Table 56, page 75.3 Attitude Survey, Table 55, page 74.4 Attitude Survey, Table 65, page 86. When asked which of three groups of people theywould &quot;like to be mainly responsible for taking decisions&quot; in Scotland, Wales and the Englishregion concerned, 3 per cent, plumped for Civil Servants, 45 per cent, for &quot;people appointedbecause of their special expertise&quot; (without any indication of who would do the appointing an elected assembly?), and 48 per cent, chose &quot;people elected by those who live in the area&quot;.
average figure of 61 per cent, wanting to see more decisions made in Scotland,Wales, and the English regions (see paragraph 62 above), the following groupsprovide more than average support for devolution:-(a) the under thirty age group with a figure of 68 per cent.ib) those who were in full-time education up to between the ages of seventeenand nineteen with a figure of 65 per cent.1(c) those who were in full-time education up to the age of twenty or over with a figure of 65 per cent.1id) those in professional or managerial occupations 62 per cent, to 63 percent.1(e) those who are particularly involved in political and community activity 67 per cent.3(/) those who feel very powerless in the face of government 70 per cent.2ig) those dissatisfied with the way things are run 67 per cent.2As the Attitude Survey puts it &quot;the picture that emerges is one that seemsto begin to make a pattern; those who are dissatisfied with the way things are run at present&quot; (i.e. just over half the population), those &quot;who feel that theviews of people like themselves are ignored&quot; (i.e. 55 per cent, of the population)and those &quot;who are concerned and interested in political and communityaffairs&quot; (i.e. 50 per cent, of the population) &quot;show most interest in devolution-tion to more regional responsibility&quot;3. Add to this the above average support for devolution from the under 30&apos;s, from the better educated and from thosein professional and managerial occupations, then this is very substantialbacking indeed for this ingredient of the demand for more participation.65. In this general context it is important to consider separately the attitudetowards devolution in Scotland and Wales. The following are the most signifi-cant comparative findings in the Attitude Survey on this subject: id) The people in Scotland were only marginally more interested in moredevolution than the people in most English regions. Thus, for example,73 per cent, of the people of Scotland favoured more devolution, corn-pared with 69 per cent, of the people in the North West of England,66 per cent, in the South, 65 per cent, in the East Midlands, and 62 percent, in Yorkshire4.ib) The people of Scotland were only marginally more in favour of the mostextreme form of devolution considered (i.e. let Scotland/Wales/ the region take over complete responsibility for running things in the area)than the English regions. Thus, 23 per cent, of the people in Scotlandopted for this form of devolution compared with 21 per cent, in theSouth, 20 per cent, in East Anglia, 18 per cent, in the East Midlands,17 per cent, in the West Midlands, and 16 per cent, in the North,Yorkshire and the South East4.1 Attitude Survey, Table 47, page 65.2 Attitude Survey, Table 48, page 67.3 Attitude Survey, page 69.4 Attitude Survey, Table 45, page 62.
(c) The people in Wales were less interested in more devolution than theaverage for Britain as a whole and less even than in most english regions. Thus, for example, while in Britain as a whole 61 per cent,favoured more devolution, in Wales the figure was 59 per cent.; andthe Welsh figure compares with 69 per cent, in the North West ofEngland, 66 per cent, in the South, 65 per cent, in the East midlands and 62 per cent, in Yorkshire. Indeed, only in three areas of Englandis there less support for more devolution than in Wales-East Anglia(where the figure is 58 per cent.), the South East and Greater London(both of which show a figure of 57 per cent.). And, as will be clear froma comparison with (a) above, the people in Wales were very much less interested in more devolution than the people in Scotland (thefigures being 59 per cent, and 73 per cent, respectively)^1)(d) The people in Wales were markedly less in favour of the most extremeform of devolution considered (i.e. let Scotland/Wales/the region takeover complete responsibility for running things in the area) than thepeople in every English region except one. Thus in Wales 13 per cent,favoured this form of devolution, compared with 21 per cent, in theSouth, 20 per cent, in East Anglia, 18 per cent, in the East midlands and 16 per cent in Yorkshire. Only in the South West was there lesssupport for this form of devolution than in Wales (i.e. 12 per cent,compared with 13 per cent.). And, as will be clear from a comparisonwith (b) above, the people in Wales showed very much less support for this extreme form of devolution than the people in Scotland (thefigures being 13 per cent, and 23 per cent, respectively)1.Against the implications of the findings at (a), (b), (c), and (d) above has to be set the fact that the idea of more devolution seems to be &quot;more to the forefront ofof the minds of those in Scotland and Wales than in any of the English regions&quot;2.Thus, when people were asked to say spontaneously what they themselves would like to see done to improve things in their region/country, there was amarked difference in response as between Scotland, Wales and England.Thus, while for England, those spontaneously giving the answer &quot;more localself-government/more home rule/more say for the people in the area as againstcentral government&quot;, the figure was 1 per cent., in Scotland and Wales thefigures were 20 per cent, and 9 per cent, respectively3.66. Summing up the findings in paragraphs 64 and 65 abOve the AttitudeSurvey says: &quot;It is not surprising that the concept of devolution should not comespontaneously to mind for people in England since the issue has notbeen debated publicly to any extent. Nor is it surprising that it shouldbe more frequently mentioned in Scotland and Wales where the concepthas been overtly formulated and the subject of much publicity for anumber of years. What is perhaps unexpected is the widespread support&quot;(i.e. for more devolution) &quot;given by those in England. . . when theidea was put to them&quot;4.1 Attitude Survey, Table 45, page 62.2 Attitude Survey, page xv and page 54.3 Attitude Survey, page 54.4 Attitude Survey, page 90.
Which is obviously valid as far as it goes. But the findings in paragraph 65-particularly when considered alongside those in paragraphs 62-64 do suggestthat in any institutional change to produce more devolution there is no case fortreating Scotland and Wales much, if any, differently from the regions ofEngland. Certainly, with the long term in mind, and in so far as the figures at paragraph 65 (a), (b), (c) and (d) above are a comparative measure of the basicinterest in more devolution as an ingredient in the general concern for moreparticipation, then the different regions of England have a claim to substantialequality of treatment alongside Scotland and Wales.67. Before leaving the question of devolution as an ingredient in the demandfor more participation, it is important to consider the strength (as opposedto the extent) of the support for this type of institutional and political change.Here the Attitude Survey seems once again to underplay its own evidence.Thus its general Commentary tends to suggest that the people basically arenot really as concerned about more devolution as the evidence so far presentedwould suggest. For example: (d) In its &quot;Appraisal of Attitudes Towards Devolution&quot; it sums up asfollows: &quot;The evidence in this final section indicates, however, that someof those who react favourably to the concept of devolution do nothave much confidence that it would, in fact, make much difference: Although 61 per cent, were in favour of some degree of change to more regional responsibility, only 38 per cent, were infavour and felt certain that it would make a difference; 23 percent, were in favour but felt it would make no difference&quot;1. . . but &quot;would simply be a change for the sake of a change&quot;2.&quot;Only 16 per cent, were in favour of change and felt that they themselves would personally benefit from the change; 40 percent, felt it would make no difference to them&quot;1.(b) It emphasises that when people were asked what they would like to seedone to improve things in the regions, only 3 per cent, spontaneouslysuggested any change in the direction of more regional responsibilityfor running things3.68. Before seeking to refute these generalisations by reference to otherfindings in the Attitude Survey, it is particularly interesting that the Surveycommentary should use the low &quot;spontaneous response&quot; figure at 67 (b) above to help build up a picture of lack of interest in this form of participation.The figure is taken from the table it reproduces on page 54. The Surveycommentary, however, does not use the information in the same table toemphasise an apparently even greater lack of interest in its &quot;better communica-tions between the government and the people&quot; solution which, as paragraph 51above shows it so much commends. In fact, as its table on page 54 shows,1 Attitude Survey, page xix.2 Attitude Survey, page 91.3 Attitude Survey, page 54.
no-one spontaneously mentioned anything remotely resembling &quot;better com-munications betv/een the government and the people&quot; as a means of improvingthings in the region. But the Survey commentary omits to draw attention tothis fact.69. On the question of v/hether the Attitude Survey commentary underplaysits own evidence on the strength of the interest in devolution as one indication of the demand for participation, it is important to set against the generalisationsat paragraph 67 above the findings of two of the Survey&apos;s own tables reproduced in a different section of the Report. Thus Table 55 shows that 81 per cent,of the population of Britain believe that the needs of the people in the regionwould be looked after &quot;much better&quot; if regions had more say in running theirown affairs; Table 56 shows that 76 per cent, believe that if the region/Scotland/Wales had more say in running their own affairs they &quot;would be run more efficiently&quot;2. And linked with these two points is the further finding(also recorded in Table 55 and previously referred to in paragraph 62 above)that 76 per cent, believe that with a region having more say in running its own affairs, &quot;The ordinary man could have more say in deciding what is done inthe region&quot;3....... .   t ^&apos;    &apos; &apos;70. The idea of more devolution, then, is favoured by a substantial majorityof people in all parts of Britian as a means of increasing participation ingovernment. And it is widely believed that it would lead to more efficient andmore responsive decision making.71. We now come to the fourth and rather vague index of interest in moreparticipation the belief that in some unspecified way the people affected by government decisions should have a share in making them, or, put ratherdifferently, the extent to which the &quot;ordinary man&quot; feels fit to, and wants to,play a bigger part in the process of government than he does at present. Therearc, in fact, three different questions here: (a) Do people believe they are fitted to play a role in government ?(b) Do they want to?(c) Would they?These are dealt with separately in the following paragraphs.72. There is no doubt that the Attitude Survey shows that a surprisinglyhigh proportion of people believe they are fitted to take part in government: (a) 26 per cent, believe they could do as good a job as the averagecouncillor4.(b) 53 per cent, feel capable of playing a role (unspecified) in government5.1 Attitude Survey, page 74.&apos;2 Attitude Survey, Table 56, page 75.3 Attitude Survey, Table 55, page 74.4 Attitude Survey, Table 14, page 16.5 This is based on scales of political capability constructed in the Attitude Survey on thebasis of weighted responses to three questions. The weighting, labelling and classification is inevitably a subjective process. And we would have weighted, labelled and classified theresponses rather differently from the authors of the Survey. However, we have regarded all those scoring between four and twelve (on the basis of the Survey&apos;s weighting) as having someconfidence in their &quot;political capability&quot;. See Attitude Survey, page 16 et seq.
(c) 64 per cent, of those whose education ended between the ages of seventeen and nineteen feel capable of playing a role in government;and the figure of 76 per cent, for those whose education ended after theage of twenty1.(d) in the professional classes 75 per cent, feel capable of playing a role ingovernment; so do 65 per cent, of employers and managers; and evenhalf the skilled workers think the same1.73. On the question of whether those who feel capable of playing thisunspecified role actually want to do so, the Survey gives the following scattered,if inconclusive offerings: (a) among the very substantial numbers at 72 (b), (c) and (d) above whofeel capable ol playing a role in government about half of them feelpowerless in the face of government2. On the assumption that theydo not want to be powerless in the face of government, this would indicate some sort of unspecified demand for participation.(b) When asked to give between one and five points to indicate how mucheach, of a series of different suggestions would help to improve thingsin the region 19 per cent, gave top marks to the suggestion: &quot;To have more ordinary people running things&quot;. This seems to us surprisinglyhigh in view of the form of the question. What percentage would havegiven it top marks if instead it had been phrased: &quot;To have more people like yourself running things&quot; ?(c) Between one third and a half thought that those who worked in largefirms, or the nationalised industries, or the health service or central or local government were not given enough influence on how things wererun. 78 per cent, agreed with the suggestion that most people who workin large organisations would like more say in the way their job is done(the equivalent of those affected by government decisions wanting ashare in making them); and 68 per cent, agreed with the suggestionthat most employers and managers do not give people who work forthem enough say in how things are run3. These findings in the AttitudeSurvey are reinforced by: (i) A survey of workers&apos; attitudes in the British Steel Corporationcarried out by a team led by Professor Ken Alexander of StrathclydeUniversity between October, 1970, and May, 1971. His team foundthat 70 per cent, of all workers thought there should be some formof workers&apos; participation in the running of the industry.(ii) Surveys done by Michael Argyle, Reader in Social Psychology atOxford University. His work shows that where there are arrange-ments in industry for workers&apos; participation in decision making,it makes them more co-operative, it increases output and jobsatisfaction, it leads to better decisions being made and gets thosesharing the decisions committed to supporting them and carrying1 Attitude Survey, Table 15, page 18. The comment at footnote 5 page 29, also applies.2 Attitude Survey, Table 19, page 21.3 Attitude Survey, Table 27, page 31.
them out. Where there is no participation, it leads to alienationfrom the job, the firm and its &quot;organisational goals&quot;; it is one ofthe main sources of discontent in industry.The above examples at least seem to indicate that substantial proportions of people believe that people affected by decisions want, in some unspecifiedway, some share in the process of making them.74. But would people take a bigger share in political decision making ifthey had more opportunity? To seek to answer this question, the Survey setout to measure the extent of present involvement in various voluntary organisations or associations-as some sort of indication of the &quot;propensityto participate&quot;. It found that 46 per cent, were members of a political orcommunity oriented organisation, that 20 per cent, had helped to organise&quot;social, sports, youth club, etc.&quot; and 7 per cent. (i.e. 31 million) were&quot;committee members or officials&quot;2. Of particular significance in these figuresis the &quot;index of involvement&quot; which the Survey constructs in terms of socialclass and education. Thus it classifies 68 per cent, of the professional/managerialclasses as &quot;fairly or very involved&quot;; and it puts in the same category 65 percent, of those whose &quot;terminal education age&quot; was seventeen-nineteen, and75 per cent, of those whose &quot;terminal education age&quot; was twenty or over.This indicates a very substantial &quot;propensity to participate&quot; among particularly important groups in British society; and these are the groups which haveconsiderably expanded in size since the Second World War. Moreover, thereis reason to believe that that the Attitude Survey has in fact under-estimated thisindex of the &quot;propensity to participate&quot;. That this is so is indicated by otherSurveys which suggest that the proportion of the population belonging to atleast one voluntary organisation ranges from 47 per cent, to 65 per cent, andthe proportion of &quot;office holders&quot; ranges from 8 per cent, to 14 per cent.3.In any event, compared with other industrial democracies Britain ranks secondonly to the United States in the extent of voluntary community action. so with this evidence of a high degree of participation in social and communityaffairs, particularly among growing and influential groups in British society,it would be surprising if people did not in fact play a bigger role in politicaldecision making if they got more opportunities and if they felt it worth theirwhile. In this context it is worth mentioning that the propensity to participate in Scotland is below the average of the rest of Britain4.75. And if there are still any doubts about the need to provide more oppor-tunities for meaningful participation of the kinds considered above, then1 Michael Argyle, The Social Psychology of Work.2 Attitude Survey, Table 6, page 6.3 e.g., 56 per cent, were found to belong to one or more organisations in a survey done for the Maud Report on &quot;Management in Local Government&quot;. See Volume 3: The LocalGovernment Elector, page 114.4 Attitude Survey, page 8.
evidence drawn mainly from the Gallup Poll archives assumes particularsignificance. Thus: -(a) In a survey in June, 1969, people were asked &quot;Is Britain becoming moreor less democratic?&quot; The answers:&apos;/ S^^SS^K ;&apos;!More      ......      ......... 14Less       ......      ...      ...... 50No change       ............ 23Don&apos;t know      ............ 13(b) In the same survey at (a) above, people were also asked, &quot;Does theordinary person have any influence&quot; on: (i) &quot;The way the government runs the country?&quot;: /oYes        ...............     25No - ... : .7. - ... &apos; ... &apos; 66Don&apos;t know      ............       9(ii) &quot;The way the local authorities handle things?&quot;: ....      &apos; .        &apos; &apos;       , &quot;    - &apos; , : - &apos;&apos;   -/o&apos;   Yes     &apos; :::.;&apos;: &quot;...:&apos; 1 ... &apos;    28 &apos;No        ...     ...      ...      ... 61Don&apos;t know      .........      ...      1.1(iii) &quot;The conditions under which they work?&quot;: -Yes &apos;.. ... &apos;   ... 34 i;&apos;in?&apos;;   No        ...     ... &apos;   ...      :.. .. 45    &apos;Don&apos;tknow...... ...     21.

And they show a very strong demand indeed for morepopular participation in political decision-making.
General conclusion76. The combined evidence of our witnesses and various surveys of publicopinion reveal a widespread and grave disquiet about our system of governmenttoday. The disquiet is what one would expect in a country nourished on demo-cratic values but faced with the erosion (as outlined in Chapter I) of the extentto which we as a people govern ourselves. What is particularly disturbing isthe pervading sense of powerlessness in the face of government and the attendantindications of a growing alienation from the governmental system.77. It is in this context that the constant decline in the proportion of peoplevoting in our general elections since the Second World War is of particularsignificance. The turnout in our 1970 general election was the lowest since 19451.It was lower than that of nearly every other comparable democracy2. And,perhaps most significant of all, the generally declining turn-out in Britainbetween 1950 and 1970 is in contrast to trends in the opposite direction incomparable Western democracies for which reliable data is available3. Of the eleven Western democracies for which reliable data is available, only britain has experienced a substantial decline in turn-outs in general elections over thelast twenty years.78. The evidence strongly suggests that the decline in the proportion of the electorate voting in general elections is linked to the widespread sense ofpowerlessness in the face of government referred to in paragraphs 43, 44 and 75above; it does not seem to make any difference to what actually happens whichever party wins.

as well as our system of government. Parties may fail to live up to their promisesbecause their programmes are ill-founded and unrealistic. Equally, it may bebecause the system of government and the entrenched power of the bureaucracyhave become insuperable obstacles to the achievement of party objectives.In any event, the resulting sense of powerlessness contributes to the growingalienation from our peaceful, constitutional political processes. The danger is that this will push us along the road to direct action possibly violent action when people and groups believe they have no other alternative to secure whatthey feel are their just demands; there is already obvious evidence that this isthe road we are beginning to travel.79. It is, therefore, crucial to the health of the body politic that we should provide the institutional changes required to counter today&apos;s widespread andjustifiable belief that the country is becoming less democratic, that we thepeople, have not enough say in, and influence on government, that we have too little power in the face of government and that government has become toocentralised and congested. If we believe in democracy, this must mean seeking to involve more people in the governmental and political process particularly since the greater the people&apos;s share in decision-making, the greater their satisfac-tion with these decisions and the greater their attachment to the system.It must mean, too, providing adequate means for the redress of individual grievances against government and the services it provides. And in the interestsof more efficient and more responsive decision-making we must also seek to devise means of lightening the load on our central institutions of government.80. Institutional changes will also be needed if we are to bridge the com-munications gap between the government and the people referred to in para-graph 44 (a) above. It is not in the nature of governments and their bureaucraciesto provide the people with more information than institutional and otherpressures can prise out of them. Nor can we expect governments to seek out,listen to, and be responsive to, the wishes of the people unless the people andtheir representatives have the institutional power to require this sort of conductfrom their rulers. If any believe that the &quot;communications gap&quot; can be bridgedby exhortation alone, and without institutional change, then they show atouching faith in the natural behaviour of governments which flies in the face of all historical and contemporary evidence.81. Finally, whatever the remedies needed to counter the erosion of democracyand to meet the complaints and aspirations of the people, it is important to stress that so far, at any rate, there is no case for treating the people in Scotlandand Wales any differently from those in any of the English regions; as our In this context, it is worth stressing that the present trends in government are still in. the opposite direction. Thus, in the most recent changes in local government: (a) the number of elected councillors in England and Wales is being reduced from 34,080to 22,400; and in Scotland from 3,450 to 1,550;(i) still further powers in health, water and sewage are being taken away from localauthorities and given to nominated ad hoc bodies.Further reference is made to these points later in this Memorandum.
Survey shows their attitudes, needs and grievances do not differ in any significantway from those of the people in the various parts of england.82. Before, however, we can begin to devise the appropriate changes now sourgently needed in our system of government, we have to assess the whole problem in the context of a new dimension United Kingdom membership ofthe Common Market. That is the subject of the next chapter.. 1 Indeed, there is slightly more support in England for devolution to the English regionsto be based on a system of democratically elected regional assemblies than there is in Scotlandand Wales for a similar devolution of power to Scottish and Welsh Assemblies. (AttitudeSurvey, Tables 71 and 72, pages 99 and 101.)
THE COMMON MARKET DIMENSIONIntroduction83. United Kingdom membership of the European Economic community as from 1st January, 1973, adds a new dimension to our system of government.Over the years it will obviously have a major impact on the working ofParliament and Government Departments. It has important implications, too,for any scheme of devolution; it will hardly make sense, for example, to seek to devolve legislative power and sovereignty to the different nations and regions of the United Kingdom in those matters where legislative authority is in factmoving from London to Brussels.84. Obviously, it is not possible to be certain at this stage precisely howCommon Market membership will affect the operation of our system of govern-ment. Nevertheless any general recommendations for constitutional changeneed to take account of its likely long-term impact. In this context two main features of the Common Market seem likely to have profound consequences for our main institutions of government. These are, first, the ambit of common market responsibilities and, secondly, the methods of decision making withinthe Community. Each of these is dealt with separately in the following paragraphs.The ambit of Common Market responsibilities85. The European Economic Community was seen by its founders as thethin economic end of a thick political wedge. Thus the immediate objectives ofthe Community as expressed in the Treaty of Rome were the creation of a customs union by the removal of all restrictions on trade between members,and the creation of an economic union by the establishment of commoneconomic policies. But in the minds of the draftsmen of the Treaty, the gradualprocess of practical economic integration was intended to lead to eventualpolitical union or integration in the words of the Treaty&apos;s preamble-&quot;an ever closer union&quot;. So the range of Common Market responsibilities is notstatic; it has gradually widened over the years and, if the organisation is to fulfil the hopes of most of its members, this process seems likely to continue.86. Even the present range of Common Market functions covers a very largenumber of different fields and therefore in practical terms inevitably limits the sovereignty of member countries in these areas. Thus, for example, the european commission and the Council of Ministers have adopted, or are now working out, common European policies for: (a) Company law, patent law and the law governing bankruptcy.(b) Qualifications for entering the various professions.(c) Agriculture including quality control, prices and marketing.(d) Transport including safety regulations, road licensing and rules aboutworking conditions.(e) Ports including organisation and charges.
(/) Public finance including the harmonisation of direct and indirect taxes and development of a Community Budget.(g) The regulation of European Economic Community economies, includingmonetary union, co-ordination of stabilisation policies, regulation offinancial institutions and anti-monopoly measures.(/i) Regional development and regional assistance.(/)  The development of science and technology.(j) Food and drug regulations to produce uniformity between the differentCommon Market countries in such matters as permissible dye-stuffs,preservatives and other additives, etc.(k) The social field where the Commission has the task of promoting close co-operation between the member states in their general policies on employment, labour legislation and working conditions, occupationaltraining, social security, industrial health and safety, Trade Unionlegislation and collective bargaining.87. Community regulations and directives in the different fields set out inparagraph 86 above can be both detailed and extensive. This is well known asfar as Agriculture is concerned. It is, perhaps, not so well known in the other fields listed in paragraph 86, where Community regulations may also havefar-reaching implications for any schemes within the United Kingdom to devolvequasi-sovereign legislative powers to Scottish, Welsh or English regional governments. Thus, for example: (a) Under E.E.C. Directive No. 63/607/E.E.C. dated 15th October, 1963,member states are required to permit the &quot;unrestricted importation,distribution and exploitation of&quot; films. Which would appear to rule out any form of censorship by government at any level.(b) E.E.C. Directive No. 71/305/E.E.C. dated 26th July, 1971, lays downlong and complicated uniform procedures which have to be observed in the award of public contracts valued at one million or more unitsof account.(c) Regulation 117/66/E.E.C. dated 28th July, 1966, lays down very detailed provisions to apply to the carriage of passengers by road where &quot;theplace of departure is in the territory of a member state and the destinationis in the territory of the same or another member state&quot;. This wouldappear to preclude subsidising road passenger services without theagreement of Brussels.(d) Decision 63/326/E.E.C. of 17th May, 1963, lays down general principles for implementing a common vocational training policy. There must bea &quot;common vocational training policy . . . which entails that each member state shall draw up programmes and shall ensure they are putinto effect&quot;. The Commission &quot;will draw up in respect of variousoccupations which call for specific training a standardised description of the basic qualifications required at various training levels. On this basis, harmonisation of standards required for success in final examina-tions should be sought, with a view to mutual recognition of certificatesand other documents confirming completion of vocation training&quot;.
(e) In the areas of employment, housing, education and social and welfare services states are required to afford to immigrants from common market countries all the rights and benefits given to their own nationals.(/) Aid from the European Social Fund is available in respect of immigrantworkers for the following purposes: &quot;the management of training courses including teacher training,including the rents of buildings, etc., language teaching, hostels,welcoming services, young people in hostels,&quot; etc.The U.K. Government will have to submit the appropriate applicationsfor this1.88. Paragraphs 86 and 87 above give some general indication of the variousfields of government affected by United Kingdom Common Market membership and they illustrate, too, how detailed and extensive Community regulations and directives can be. All this is an obvious limitation on any scheme to devolvelegislative and sovereign power in these matters from the Westminster Parliamentto the different nations and regions of the United Kingdom; questions to besettled in Brussels cannot at the same time be devolved for independent decision-making to Scottish, Welsh or English regional governments and legislatures.In this context it is worth considering separately and briefly in the next two paragraphs the implications for the whole field of education which flow fromthe Treaty of Rome.89. Education is normally thought of as a subject pre-eminently suitable for devolution. Thus, in the United States it is a state and not a federal responsibility;in Western Germany the Constitution (drawn up, of course, before Germanmembership of the E.E.C.) gives the Lander legislative power in primary and secondary education; and in the Majority Report there is a recommendation that similar legislative powers in the field of education should be conferred onScotland and Wales. Yet, the implications for the whole field of education whichflow from the Treaty of Rome certainly cast serious doubts on whether, in thefuture, legislative devolution in this sphere is a practical possibility. The starting point here is the &quot;right of establishment&quot; set out in Article 52 of the Treaty.It concerns for the most part those in self-employed professional occupations(e.g., architects, doctors, etc.); and it means that they must be allowed to carryon their professional work in any member state. This is closely linked with asecond article in the Treaty which also has implications for education. This isArticle 57 which says: &quot;In order to facilitate access to, and pursuit of, self-employed occupa-tions, the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission and afterthe Assembly has been consulted, by unanimous decision from the first stage and by qualified majority thereafter, issue directives for the mutualrecognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of qualification&quot;.The third aspect of the Treaty of Rome which leads into the field of education is its emphasis on vocational training. This is referred to in a number ofArticles2. In effect they commit the Community to common policies for basicand advanced vocational training.1 Regulation 1612/68.2 Articles 125, 128 and 41.
90. The potential effect of these three avenues into the field of education canbe seen from the following two examples: (a) The Commission has been making studies of the following professions:architects, engineers, surveyors and agronomists, chemists, doctors and dentists, veterinary surgeons and others concerned in the medical field.Here the Commission is seeking to establish what qualifications in one country are equivalent to those in another. This is leading it to lay down a number of minimum requirements which the different states will haveto adopt in their training for these professions for there to be a mutualrecognition of diplomas, etc. These requirements at present1 are falling into the following five categories: (i) the global period of training in years;(ii) the total number of hours;(iii) the obligatory subjects;(iv) the allotment of hours per subject;(v) the conditions of the period of study.Thus, in the end the Community will be determining the minimumcontent of educational courses in member countries leading to pro-fessional qualifications.(b) In the general field of vocational training, a Council decision of 2nd April,1962, sets out a number of basic principles. It says they &quot;concern thetraining of young people and adults, preparing for employment oralready employed up to the level of middle management&quot;. their objective is to produce a common policy on vocational training in all member countries. Among other things, the vocational training is to be&quot;wide enough, on the basis of general education to encourage theharmonious development of the individual and to meet the requirementsof technical progress, of innovations in the organisation of production,and of economic and social development&quot;. In this context it is alsoenvisaged that the teachers engaged in vocational training willhave to reach certain minimum standards Which will be prescribed forall member countries.Clearly, then, membership of the Community could in the long term have a major impact on the content and organisation of education in our schools,teacher training establishments, the polytechnics and the universities2. It isdifficult to see, therefore, how real legislative power in these matters can be devolved downwards to Scottish, Welsh or English regional governments whenit is in fact moving upwards to Brussels.91. Paragraphs 86 and 87 above are intended to give a general indication of the various fields of government which will now be affected by UnitedKingdom Common Market membership. But, as was pointed out in1 December, 1972.2 This is no doubt why Dr. Sloman, the Vice-Chancellor of Essex University, who declaredhimself in favour of the mutual recognition of qualifications, said that the Community could,therefore, as far as universities are concerned, stipulate a minimum number of teaching hours,a list of compulsory subjects as course requirements and other matters such as the amountof practical work.
paragraph 85, the range of Common Market responsibilities is not static.The most recent additions are those agreed at the Common Market summit meeting in Paris on 19th and 20th October, 1972. This was attended by the heads of State or of Government not only of the six founder member countriesbut also of Britain, Denmark and Eire. The Paris communique listed thefollowing as the main additions to, or enlargements of, Common Marketresponsibilities and objectives: (a) Economic and Monetary Policy. Member countries are now committed&quot;irreversibly to achieve economic and monetary union&quot;1 not later than31st December, 1980.(b) Regional Policy. Member countries undertook &quot;from now on ... toco-ordinate their regional policies&quot;. The European Commission hasbeen instructed to &quot;prepare without delay a report analysing the regionalproblems which arise in the enlarged Community and to put forwardappropriate proposals&quot;. A Regional Development Fund was to be setup before 31st December, 1973.(c) Social Policy. The Heads of State or of Government &quot;emphasised thatthey attached as much importance to vigorous action in the socialfield as to the achievement of the economic and monetary union&quot;. TheCommunity is to draw up a programme of action between now and1st January, 1974. &quot;This programme should aim in particular at carryingout a co-ordinated policy for employment and vocational training and improving working conditions and conditions of life, at closely involvingworkers in the progress of firms... and at strengthening and co-ordinatingmeasures of consumer protection&quot;.(d) Industrial, scientific and technological policy. Member countries are nowcommitted to seeking &quot;to establish a single industrial base for theCommunity as a whole&quot;. This involves &quot;the elimination particularly inthe fiscal and legal fields, of barriers which hinder closer relations andmergers between firms, the rapid adoption of a European companystatute . . . the transformation and conversion of declining industries under acceptable social conditions ... the maintenance of fair competitionas much within the Common Market as in external markets&quot;. In addition&quot;objectives will need to be defined and the development of a common policy in the field of science and technology ensured&quot;. To achieve all this &quot;a programme of action together with a precise time-table and appropriate measures should be decided by the Community&apos;s institutionsbefore 1st January, 1974&quot;.(e) Environment policy. The Heads of State or Government &quot;emphasised the importance of a Community environmental policy. To this end they invited the Community institutions to establish, before 31st July, 1973,a programme of action accompanied by a precise time-table&quot;.(/) Energy Policy. The Heads of State or of Government deemed &quot;it necessaryto invite the Community institutions to formulate as soon as possiblean energy policy guaranteeing certain and lasting supplies under satis-factory economic conditions&quot;.1 The Paris Communique, 20th October, 1972.
92. It is clear from paragraphs 86-91 above that at least for the next decadeeach major &quot;home&quot; department of government is going to be heavily involvedin Brussels &quot;policy making&quot;. And towards the end of that period and beyondthere are then the vast but unspecified consequences of the commitment to&quot;European Union&quot;. The Paris Communique puts it in these words: &quot;The Heads of State or Government having set themselves the majorobjective of transforming, before the end of the present decade and withthe fullest respect for the treaties already signed, the whole complex of therelations of member states into a European Union, request the institutions of the Community to draw up a report on this subject before the end of1975 for submission to a summit conference&quot;.Whatever European Union may eventually mean there can be no doubtthat the all-embracing nature of Common Market responsibilities and objectiveswill itself have a profound impact on the whole operation of our system ofgovernment. That impact will be all the greater in view of the methods of decisionmaking adopted by the Community. So, before the full consequences of common market membership are assessed it is necessary to consider the Community&apos;decision-making processes.The methods of decision-making within the Common Market93. Power in the Community is shared between four institutions: an Assembly&quot;which shall consist of representatives of the people of the States brought together in the Community&quot;; a Council of Ministers, which &quot;shall consist ofrepresentatives of the Member States&quot;; a Commission whose members &quot;shallbe chosen on grounds of their general competence and whose independence isbeyond doubt&quot;; and a Court of Justice which &quot;shall consist of seven judges&quot;1.94. In the areas of Community responsibility the legislative power is exercised by the Council of Ministers and the Commission. It is important in this contextto stress that the European Parliament or Assembly has no legislative power.The Council of Ministers has the power of final decisions on all major policyand legislative questions. The Council&apos;s powers are usually exercised on pro-posals put to it by the Commission; and on most of the important subjects itcan act only on a proposal from the Commission. The Council of Ministersnormally obtains the opinions of the European Parliament before taking its decisions and is often required to do so by the Treaty of Rome; but Parliamentsopinions are never binding. So the European Parliament is not a legislativebody.95. In addition to the law-making shared between the Council of ministers and the Commission described in paragraph 94 above, the Commission also has law-making powers of its own. For the most part these are concerned with matters which are treated as a kind of delegated legislation i.e., the detailedimplementation of what has already been settled in broad terms by theprevious decisions of the Council.1 Articles 4, 137, 146,157, 165 and 166 of the Treaty of Rome.
96. The Community&apos;s law-making falls into four categories. First theregulations; these, whether emanating from the Council of Ministers as inparagraph 94 or directly from the Commission as in paragraph 95, are bindingand have direct force of law in every member state. These regulations com-pletely by-pass a member state&apos;s normal legislative processes. Secondly thedirectives; these are binding as regards their objective, but leave open the meansof implementation to the individual member governments. Thirdly thedecisions; these, whether emanating from the Council of Ministers or directly from the Commission, may be addressed to a government or to a private company or person and are binding on the party named. Finally majorlegislative proposals; the significance of regarding them as a separate&quot;legislative category&quot; is that though they are in effect proposals for regulations or directives they have to be published on submission from the Commissionto the Council of Ministers while other proposed regulations and directivesare not required to be published at that stage.97. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, it has already been emphasised that it has no legislative power. In general, it is consulted by theCouncil of Ministers on proposals made by the Commission to the Council.However, the provision for this consultation covers by no means all caseswhere the Council is required to take a decision, even when it involves the enactment of legislation. In any event, the Parliament has no power at allover the Council of Ministers; the Council of Ministers can disregard its advicewith impunity. It does, however, have some power over the Commission; bya two-thirds majority vote of censure it can force the Commission to resign.This is too big a weapon to be of any real value, particularly since it has no power over the appointment of a hew Commission. Finally, the Parliamentdoes have some power in the budgetary field. Here, however, it is limited tothe right to draw up estimates of its own expenditure. For the community budget as a whole, it can do no more than propose amendments to the draftdrawn up by the Council of Ministers; but the last word remains with theCouncil.98. Notwithstanding its almost complete lack of power, the european parliament absorbs a large proportion of the time of its members. They are alldrawn from the national Parliaments of the member countries. And theyhave to spend something like 100 days a year in Strasbourg or Brussels. TheEuropean Parliament itself is usually in session for about 45 days a year butservice on its functional committees (which include committees on Agriculture,Social Affairs and Health Protection, Transport, Economic Affairs, Finance,Legal Affairs, Energy and Research Problems and External Trade Relations)is usually more time-consuming-about 55 days a year.99. There are four further points to note about the Community decision-making machinery or processes which have their impact on the United Kingdomsystem of government: (a) There is a Committee of Permanent Representatives which acts as asort of &quot;mini&quot; Council of Ministers. It not only prepares Councildecisions, but is also in practice a body with genuine decision-makingpowers of its own. This is due mainly to the special procedure (commonlycalled &quot;A-points&quot;) which enables the Permanent Representatives of the
member countries, once they have come to an agreement between themselves and with the Commission, to propose that the council should adopt a decision without discussion. This &quot;A-points&quot; proceduredoes not, of course, cover matters of major importance; but issues ofsome substance are certainly determined in this way.(b) There is a further factor weakening the consultative role of the european parliament besides its lack of power. It is the fact that although theCommission seeks the support of the European Parliament, the Corn-mission often enters into negotiations with the Council of ministers on issues before it submits its formal proposals to the Council. Thus,frequently, Parliament is consulted only after consultations between ministers and the Commission have often resulted in informalagreements.(c) Originally, the intention was that the Council of Ministers should takemost of its decisions by a system of majority voting in which the major powers France, Germany and Italy would each have four votes, belgium and the Netherlands two votes each and Luxembourg one. And anytwelve votes were to be sufficient for approval of a proposal from theCommission. However, as a result of the constitutional crisis of 1965and the Luxembourg compromise of 1966 the practice of unanimityhas prevailed in the Council. The compromise records the agreementof all Member States that, on matters where a decision that could betaken by a majority vote on a proposal from the Commission would affect very important interests of one or more partners, the membersof the Council will endeavour to reach a unanimous decision within areasonable time. The French delegation felt, however, that &quot;wherevery important interests are at stake the discussion must be continued until unanimous agreement is reached&quot;. This difference of opinion isnoted but not settled in the Luxembourg compromise.(d) Partly as a result of the present &quot;unanimity&quot; practice in the Council ofMinisters referred to in (c) above decisions are taken by the Council inelaborate, often lengthy, late night bargaining sessions. In these amember country may, for example, agree to a deal which, say, adverselyaffects its cattle producers, but which gives the country what it wantsfor bacon or on the axle weight of lorries.100. The implications for the United Kingdom machinery of Governmentof all these Common Market decision-making processes referred to in para-graphs 93 to 99 above are set out in the next section. They are considered inthe context of the ambit of Common Market responsibilities set out inparagraphs 85 to 90.The implications of Common Market membership for the United Kingdommachinery of government101. The first and clearest consequence of Common Market membership is that in many fields (not limited to Agriculture, Finance, Trade and Economics)important areas of decision making will inevitably be moved still further away from the citizens of the United Kingdom. Major policies will now be determined in Brussels, not London. This has a second important implication for what
hitherto has been a vital feature of our system of government the clear-cutnature of political responsibility. Hitherto, Parliament and the electoratehave, in theory, at any rate, been able to hold a particular Minister or Govern-ment fully responsible for major policy decisions. This will now be changed.In future major policy in many fields will emanate from the Council of ministers by the complex bargaining processes referred to in paragraph 99 (d) above.There will, inevitably, therefore, be many instances when United kingdom ministers will have to tell Parliament that a particular policy is the best theycould get rather than what they really wanted. So, with decision making movingstill further away from the British people and with Parliament and the electorateunable in the future to hold Ministers or even the Government as fully respon-sible as now for major policy decisions, all this will give a still further impetusto the trend away from democratic control noted in Chapter I, unless wedevelop the appropriate countervailing forces.102. The most obvious potential countervailing force is Parliament. Andthere is no doubt that in this repect it could have a major role to play. Thirty-six of its members are, of course, also members of the European Parliament.But while this will place an immense extra burden on them it can hardly producemuch British impact on Brussels policy making primarily because the Euro-pean Parliament in Strasbourg, as is clear from paragraphs 94 to 98 abovehas virtually no power. So if United Kingdom Parliamentarians are to exercise any control of, or influence on, the European Commission and the Council ofMinisters it will have to be done from London not Strasbourg. And even if theEuropean Parliament manages to increase its powers, nevertheless UnitedKingdom Ministers in the Council of Ministers must remain accountable fortheir actions to the United Kingdom Parliament.103. It is generally recognised that there is only one possible and satisfactory way for the United Kingdom Parliament to make its impact on the Brusselsdecision-making processes. This is for Parliament to be able to put its views to United Kingdom Ministers on the issues coming up for decision in theCouncil of Ministers. This means that M.P.S must be able to know in advancewhat proposals are in fact coming from the European Commission to theCouncil of Ministers. The pattern that probably ought to be followed here isthat adopted in Western Germany. There the Federal Government is requiredto inform the West German Parliament (both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat)of any legislative proposals (i.e. proposed regulations or directives) being madeby the Commission to the Council of Ministers which, if approved, would necessitate changes in German law. The proposals are then considered by theappropriate functional committees of the Bundestag (e.g. the Committee on agriculture, etc.; each German Ministry has its counterpart specialised com-mittee in the Bundestag). This has enabled committees of the Bundestag to investigate the proposals being made and to comment on them before theWest German Government itself has to take a final decision for the meetingof the Council of Ministers. The comments made by the Bundestag committees,including recommendations for change and improvement to the proposalsbeing considered, are summarised in a report which then undergoes theformality of acceptance by the Bundestag itself. Only in a few exceptional cases have these reports been debated.
104. If the United Kingdom Parliament eventually adopts something broadlyon the lines of the West German Parliament, this will, of course, add to itspresent burdens. It is important, therefore, to know how great that extraburden might be. In 1971 the Community made 2,900 Regulations and410 Directives and Decisions. But over 90 per cent, of the Regulations repre-sented autonomous Commission action of the type described in paragraph 95;thus, while these Regulations have the direct force of law in member countries,they are in effect the detailed implementation by the Commission of broadpolicies already agreed on by the Council of Ministers. It could be argued,therefore, that this category of Regulations should not be scrutinised by theUnited Kingdom Parliament; certainly, Parliament could do no more thantake note of them since normally, they are law from the date they are published.That still leaves, however, all the other Regulations and Directives. how many of these ought to be scrutinised by Parliament it is difficult to say. the guiding principle ought to be that all proposals made by the Commission tothe Council of Ministers for decision should be submitted to Parliament forprior scrutiny and report by a Select Committee. Perhaps the best guide tothe volume of business that might be involved in this is again to be found in west Germany. In 1971 the Bundestag considered 198 proposals on whichthe Council of Ministers had to take a decision.105. To scrutinise by some new Select Committee or Committees something like 200 proposed Common Market instruments a year is undoubtedly theleast that Parliament should do if it is to exert some sort of democratic controland influence on what happens in Brussels. Many people would argue that parliament should, indeed, go much further than this. For example, it hasbeen suggested that by the time the Commission submits its proposedRegulations and Directives to the Council of Ministers, they are in too finala form to admit of much amendment. Thus there is a case for the Commissionconsulting with member Parliaments as it formulates the proposals it will eventually lay before the Council of Ministers. After all, at this stage theCommission has consultations with all the various international and nationalpressure groups which may be affected by its proposals. And no doubt theCommission officials will also at this stage be in informal contact with british civil Servants. So why should the elected representatives of the people be excluded from the act? And then there is the problem of all those Regulationsemanating directly from the Commission and having the force of law in member countries without scrutiny or approval by the Council of Ministers, theEuropean Parliament or, at present, by any national Parliaments. Perhaps theEuropean Parliament or the national Parliaments have a role to play here if only in a post-mortem capacity?106. Whatever final answers are given to the questions raised in paragraph 105(and some suggestions about what the answers should be is given in chapter VII), three facts are clear beyond all reasonable doubt. membership of the Common Market will: (a) remove important areas of decision making still further away from theBritish people;(b) further weaken the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. For decisions taken in the complex negotiating sessions in Brussels, it will be illogical
and impractical to seek to pin responsibility for them on the BritishGovernment of the day. The British Government will have made its contribution, and no doubt have argued for solutions acceptable to thiscountry. But the final result will be a compromise. Whilst parliament will be justified in asking whether the British Government or individual ministers have played their cards well and pursued intelligent policies,it will be pointless to react as if the Government and its ministers were acting as independent agents;(c) increase even more the power of officials. The Commission bureaucracyis the power-house of the Common Market. The interlocking contactswhich are sure to develop between United Kingdom Civil servants and their counterparts in the Commission and other member countries will add to the difficulties of ministerial control.If the United Kingdom Parliament is to develop as an adequate countervailingforce to the still further potential erosions of democracy involved in (a), (b)and (c) above, the fact has to be faced that Parliament will be taking on a very big additional burden. And if Parliament does not develop in this way, then theHouse of Commons Select Committee on Procedure was no doubt right whenit reached this conclusion: &quot;Your Committee conclude that the entry of Britain into the Communitiespresents a profound challenge to many of the established procedures ofParliament which, if not adequately dealt with, could leave Parliamentsubstantially weaker vis-a-vis the executive&quot;1.107. Whatever Parliament does to meet this particular challenge, anothercertain consequence of Common Market membership will be the greatly in-creased burden of work which will be placed on United Kingdom ministers and their departments. As will be clear from paragraphs 85 to 91 above, atleast some part of the responsibilities of every main home department ofgovernment are or will be affected by the new European dimension. As SirChristopher Soames has emphasised, &quot;basically each Minister and each depart-ment will be responsible for its own European thinking . . . Whole departmentsmust now be learning to think European and to take account at all times of theobligations imposed by Community Membership. This will apply, too, indiffering degrees to those government departments and to certain facets of localgovernment which so far have had little or no responsibilities beyond ourshores, but whose work will be found to have a European content&quot;2.108. Obviously, it is not possible to quantify at this stage what this additional burden will amount to. It will, of course, vary from department to department.In the early stages the main departments affected will be the Treasury, Agricul-ture, Trade and Industry, and Environment. But, even at the start, no department will be unaffected by our Common Market membership. And there will, ofcourse, be a consequential additional burden on all members of the cabinet and the Cabinet Office.1 Third Special Report from the Select Committee on Procedure.

109. It may well be found in the end that the United Kingdom Governmentwill have to follow the example of France and create within its machinery of central government a new organisation to co-ordinate the work of the different departments on Community questions. Thus, France has set up the SecretariatGeneral du Comite Interministeriel europeene (S.G.C.I.). Its head is directly responsible to the Prime Minister. The S.G.C.I. includes about sixty civilservants, many of them &quot;high flyers&quot; with experience in ministerial cabinets.Its primary responsibilities are to ensure that the French bargaining positionis effectively co-ordinated prior to Community-level discussion and to mediateamong the competing interests of functional ministries. But whether or not wefollow the French example here, it will not of course reduce the load on centralgovernment; it will at best co-ordinate the way it is carried.110. However things are organised in Whitehall, we are obviously following the example of other Common Market countries and establishing a PermanentDelegation in Brussels. The Permanent Delegations of the original six common market members are composed of staff drawn from national diplomatic servicesand from domestic ministries, reporting back to their Foreign Offices, theirfunctional ministries and to their national machinery for policy co-ordination.In 1972, the German Delegation was the largest. It had a service staff of forty-five of which five came from the Foreign Office; the largest part of its con-tingent came from the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs. The size and composition of the United Kingdom Delegation is not yet known1 butseems unlikely to be smaller than the West German Delegation. Whatever its size, it is simply another illustration of the extra burden which in the end comesback to Whitehall.111. Perhaps in the end some rough quantitative illustration of the extraload to come may be gained from the fact that: (a) Dr. Erhard, the former Chancellor of Western Germany is quoted assaying that nearly a third of the civil servants in the relevant depart-ments of the Federal Republic were occupied solely with papers to do with the Community, produced in Bonn and Brussels2.(b) As far as Italy is concerned, it has been estimated that between fortyand fifty senior officials from the different Italian Departments ofGovernment visit Brussels each weeks.General conclusion112. The implications of United Kingdom Common Market membershipfor the work of the Commission on the Constitution are profound. They can be summed up as follows: (a) important areas of decision making will become still more remotefrom the people of the United Kingdom and their elected representatives in Parliament;1 Written in December, 1972.2 Politics and Bureaucracy in the European Community, by David Coombes, page 48.This quotes as authority: M. Camps, What Kind of Europe, page 93.3 The Impact of Community Membership on the British Machinery of Government. Paperby Helen and William Wallace and published in &quot;Integration&quot;, Brussels. Reference is topage 6 of typescript version of paper.
(b) there will be a still further strengthening of the power of bureaucracy,both national and European;(c) the two points at (a) and (b) above make it imperative that parliament should become an effective countervailing force developing the capacity to have a full share on behalf of the British people in the decisions madein Brussels. Parliament must be the vehicle by which this will of the peopleprevails over the will of the bureaucrats;(d) there will be a major increase in the load on the central machinery ofgovernment Parliament, Ministries, the Cabinet, and the various departments. The load is more likely to increase over the years than to diminish;(e) the point at (d) above greatly strengthens any case there may be for adevolution of some of the present responsibilities of Whitehall andWestminster to subordinate units of government within the UnitedKingdom;(/) although Common Market membership, as pointed out at (e) above,greatly strengthens any case there may be for devolution, it also providesserious constraints on the form and extent of devolution that might be devised. For example, it would hardly be prudent at this stage for us torecommend a total devolution of legislative power to any of the &quot;differentnations and regions of the United Kingdom&quot; in any of those subjectswhere legislative power is in fact moving to Brussels. And this for two reasons: (i) it would produce a confused and double level of litigation. Forexample, if legislative power in education were devolved to Scotland,there could be litigation both on whether a piece of Scottish legisla-tion on, say, vocational training, fell properly within its educationalpowers, or conflicted with United Kingdom employment legislation,or with Brussels policies on vocational training;(ii) if legislative power were given to the government of any &quot;nationor region&quot; within the United Kingdom on any matter that might bethe subject of policy making in Brussels, there is no provision in theTreaty of Rome and the Treaty of Accession for that governmentto be separately represented in Brussels on either the Council ofMinisters or the Committee of Permanent Representatives when thematter is being discussed or decided. Nor is it at all likely that theUnited Kingdom could secure such a concession. Thus, we shouldhave the spectacle of policy being made in an area for which a subordinate government in theory had full responsibility, but wasexcluded from the forum which takes all the main decisions.Since the ambit of Brussels is so potentially all-embracing this leavesvery little scope for real legislative devolution to the different nations and regions of the United Kingdom.113. The way to deal with the problems raised in paragraph 112 is devolped in Chapters VI and VII. It is necessary first to consider the basic principles which should guide us in devising any modifications to our system of govern-ment to meet not only the problems of Common Market membership surveyedin this chapter, but also the criticisms of our existing machinery of governmentoutlined in Chapters I and II.
THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF REFORMIntroduction114. It is clear from the preceding chapters that our system of government isin urgent need of reform. Those chapters have also indicated in general terms the nature of the changes we now need to make. Here we outline the basic principles on which we believe a restructuring of our system of governmentshould be based and the main objectives it should seek to achieve. We set outfirst the general considerations which have governed our approach. We thendraw attention to the particular objectives that need to be met. And finally wesurvey the general principles which have guided us in devising the changes inour system of government we now believe to be necessary.General considerations governing our approach115. A key feature in any political system is the concept of legitimacy theextent to which a governmental system commands the respect of, and therefore the support of, the people. In a democratic state that is the ultimate basis of theauthority of government. Our system of government today is the product ofcenturies of growth and evolution as successive generations have adapted it tomeet the needs of their time. This emphasis on evolution rather than revolutionhas been a crucial factor in endowing our system of government with alegitimacy that most countries can only envy and aspire to. It follows, therefore,that we should not now embark on any course of precipitate or unnecessarychange in a system of government which has served us so well and proved soflexible and adaptable. This necessary insistence on the conservatism of EdmundBurke should not, however, lead us to forget the conservatism of Robert Peelwith his emphasis on the need to reform &quot;proved abuses&quot;. And here we need to remember that there have been times in our history when we have seen the need for fundamental and radical change to preserve the legitimacy of essential features of our governmental system. This is what we need to do today.For another vital ingredient of legitimacy is that the governmental system shouldmatch the needs and aspirations of the people; it should serve, not thwart,those needs and aspirations.116. This necessary emphasis on maintaining as far as possible the essential features of our existing system of government has important, if obvious,consequences. Thus it would be folly to demolish the existing institutions and seek to produce from scratch a brand new constitutional design; the appropriatechanges should, as far as possible, be accommodated within the existing frame-work. To build the necessary modifications into the existing system also tends to rule out a Presidential type of Government on the United States model. Wemust, if we can, preserve the essential characteristics and principles of cabinet government which have served us so well a Cabinet responsible to Parliamentwhose writ should run, as now, throughout the United Kingdom. Which alsotends to rule out a federal or quasi-federal structure (as the majority of our colleagues wish to recommend); it would be alien to our best traditions tocreate substantial enclaves within the United Kingdom outside the normaljurisdiction of our Westminster Parliament.
117. Within these necessary limitations imposed by our long history of successful institutional adaptation, there is still plenty of scope for the radical changes needed to meet our present discontents. And the basic objective ofthese changes must be that which inspired our major institutional changes inthe nineteenth century to come still nearer to the democratic ideal of govern-ment of the people, by the people, for the people. Today this objective has tobe set both against the increasing complexity of the problems modern govern-ment is called on to handle, and the increasing capacity of the people, withsteadily rising standards of education and understanding, to govern themselves.118. Any necessary changes in our system of government should not weaken the economic and political unity of the United Kingdom. There are two reasonsfor this. The first is a historical one. Centuries of tradition should not be lightlyabandoned. And in this context it is important to stress that any objectiveassessment of the evidence before the Commission inevitably leads to theconclusion that over the years all parts of the United Kingdom have derivedsubstantial benefits from the development of economic and political unitywhich might not otherwise have accrued. And while the benefits might not havebeen equally shared among the different parts of the United Kingdom, that isnot an argument for breaking up the United Kingdom into separate politicaland economic entities; it is an argument for improving the present constitutional,political and economic arrangements in such a way that the needs of thedifferent nations and regions which now form the United Kingdom are moreproperly and effectively recognised and the benefits of economic and politicalunity more fairly and equally shared among the different parts. The secondreason for maintaining the economic and political unity of the United kingdom is that to do otherwise would be to seek to run counter to the main forces ofour time. Under the impact of population growth, mass communications,aspirations for a better life, and modern technology the trends everywhereare towards enlarging areas of unity not towards fragmenting existing ones.The problem is to ensure that the needs of individuals, nations and regions are fully served by these larger units and unities whose sole justification, after all,is the enrichment of mankind.119. To adapt our constitution to the needs of the latter part of the twentiethcentury, we have to consider those needs in the context of our system ofgovernment as a whole. Such an approach was clearly within our terms ofreference1. And inevitably, in our view, it involved considering, for example,such issues as the decline in the power of Parliament vis-d-vis the executive in the central policy-making process; the power of the Civil Service in aninevitably increasing bureaucratic age and whether it is subject to adequatedemocratic control; whether the central government is now unduly overloadedwith functions and responsibilities so that they cannot be properly or efficientlyperformed; whether there are adequate means available for the redress of individual grievances; whether there is too much central control of localgovernment; the extent of the alleged demand for &quot;participation&quot; and what it means; and so on. In considering such a range of problems the question of devolution and its nature could have been put in its proper perspective. our See our Chapter I, paragraph 1 et seq.
colleagues, however, rejecting this interpretation of our terms of reference ,chose to put the main (and almost sole) emphasis on considering the case fordevolving power from the central government to the various countries and regions of the United Kingdom. This has led them to concentrate on, and togive an unbalanced prominence to, the case for devolution as far as Scotlandand Wales are concerned, and to commend it in an extreme form; whereas thecase for devolution should have been considered as one (among many other)possible alternative or complementary changes in our system of government asa whole. If there is a case for devolution (as we believe there is) it should beseen as part of a whole series of modifications which should now be made toour system of government. And if our colleagues had approached the task inthis way, we doubt if they would have been led to put forward schemes of devolution for Scotland and Wales in such an extreme form, while virtuallyneglecting the essentially similar problems of the English regions. For they are seeking to achieve for Scotland and Wales by devolution alone what needs tobe achieved for all parts of the United Kingdom (including the different regions of England) by a more moderate and balanced form of devolution coupled withother equally important changes. We have, therefore, taken a much broaderand more comprehensive approach than our colleagues. Against the background of the present discontents we have considered what changes should be madein our system of government as a whole. In this way we hope that the question of devolution has been put in its proper perspective.The particular objectives of reform120. The particular objectives of the reforms we now need have been broadlyindicated in the preceding chapters. In this section we summarise what wethink those objectives should be in the light of our assessment of the evidence.121. A major objective of any scheme of reform must be to adapt UnitedKingdom institutions to the consequences of our membership of the common market. In our view, as we have shown in Chapter III, Common Marketmembership is likely to have a profound and far-reaching long-term impact onour main institutions of government. In particular, there will be a big increasein the burdens on Parliament and the main government departments. This,together with the removal of so much decision-making in so many spheres toBrussels, means both that Whitehall and Westminster will have to shed someof their present loads (so they can cope with the additional Common Marketwork), and also that the nature of the loads that can be shed is limited. Thus,as we concluded in Chapter III, there is very little scope for any real devolution of any independent legislative power to the different nations and regions of theUnited Kingdom. So our objective here must be substantially to reduce the burdens on central government so that Whitehall and Westminster have thetime to promote and watch over British interests in Brussels but to do it without any significant devolution of legislative autonomy.122. There is abundant evidence that even before our entry into the common market, Parliament, Ministries and Government Departments were heavilyoverloaded. Decisions often take too long and frequently are not properly1 See our Chapter I, paragraph 4, and also the Majority Report, Chapter 1, paragraphs 13and 14.
considered. More fundamentally it has meant that Ministers, even thoughworking an excessive number of hours a day, have not had the time to scrutinisewith adequate care and evaluate fundamentally all the recommendations oftheir Civil Servants and thus exercise the full control of departmental and inter-departmental administration and policy-making which a democratic systemdemands. And Parliament has been able to consider only a small fraction ofthe departmental policies and decisions it is supposed to control. So, even before the new Common Market dimension, there was an urgent need toreduce substantially the burdens on central government. Thus an essentialobjective of any scheme of reform irrespective of any Common Market con-siderations must be that the decisions made at central government level must belimited to those which cannot, without obvious detriment to efficiency and tothe economic and political unity of the United Kingdom, be made at a lower level. This will make it possible for Ministers and Parliament to exercise fullercontrol over central policy making and the work of the central departments ofgovernment.123. Any reform of our system of government must recognise that one ofthe main developments of the twentieth century has been the vast expansionof bureaucracy. It is an expansion in numbers, power and range of operation and is the inevitable consequence of the expansion in the functions of govern-ment, the growing complexity of the problems it has to handle and the increasedsophistication in the techniques of decision-making. And whether these bureau-crats are employed by central government, local government, the nationalised industries or other ad hoc authorities, their common characteristic is that theyare making policy recommendations or individual decisions which greatly affectmost of us in our daily lives. And, as was shown in Chapter III, a likely conse-quence of our Common Market membership is to increase still more theinfluence of our central bureaucracy. So a major objective, therefore, of anyreform of our system of government must be to ensure that this vastly expandedbureaucracy must be under adequate democratic control. Only if the peoplefeel that they or their representatives control the bureaucrats will our systemelicit the maximum consent of the governed to the acts of government. Thismeans that bureaucrats everywhere must be the servants of the people in factas well as in theory, not their masters. And to achieve this objective involves (a) reconsidering the relationship and power balance between Ministers,Parliament and Government Departments;(6) reconsidering the relationship between government at all levels on theone hand, and on the other hand the nationalised industries and otherad hoc authorities;(c) reconsidering the relationship between local authorities and governmentdepartments and between local authorities and their staffs.124. The evidence surveyed in Chapter II revealed a disturbing and wide-spread feeling of &quot;powerlessness&quot; in the face of government. Detailed analysisshowed it was compounded of three main ingredients: (a) Lack of effective two-way communication between government andgoverned.(b) A widespread concern for a greater share in, or influence, on, government decision-making.
(c) Dissatisfaction arising from a large body of unresolved individual grievances against central and local government and the services forwhich central government has ultimate responsibility the nationalised industries, the health service, etc.The institutional changes we devise must provide an adequate counter to theseingredients of powerlessness.125. Finally, we recognise that any reform of our institutions of governmentto meet the particular objectives in paragraphs 121 to 124 above, may not, initself, be enough. This is because the agencies that operate our main institutionsare the political parties. It might follow, therefore, that a democratic par-ticipatory system of government could be thwarted by the operations ofoligarchically controlled and dominated political parties; or it could be thatour parties have not the resources to work out realistic and practical policies which they can implement when in office. In any event, our constitutional arrangements cannot neglect the way our political parties operate. Our political parties, no less than our institutions of government, must provide for fullpopular, participation in their operations; and they must be adequate instru-ments to meet all their responsibilities in a modern democratic system ofgovernment.Our guiding principles and some of their implications126. We have already stressed the importance we attach to maintaining thepolitical unity of the United Kingdom, In our view an essential condition for maintaining this unity is that there must be a substantial equality of political rights and obligations for the peoples of its different nations and regions. this principle has far-reaching implications. For example, it means that normally inall parts of the United Kingdom:(a) racial, religious or other minority groups should have the same political rights and obligations;(b) there should be equal means for the redress of individual grievances;(c) there should be equal rights to freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly;(d) there should be available to all individuals equal rights and opportunities to participate in government.And the justification for asserting this principle of the equality of political rights and obligations for all citizens of the United Kingdom is self-evident ifwe consider the implications of departing from it. Clearly, there would nolonger be any reality to the concept of the political unity of the United Kingdomif individuals in one part of the United Kingdom had significantly greater orlesser political rights and obligations than those in another part.127. This principle of a substantial equality of political rights and obligationsthroughout the United Kingdom carries with it, in our view, important economicand financial rights. This is because the ultimate purpose of political rights isto enable people to provide for themselves a fuller, freer and richer life than might otherwise be possible. It follows, therefore, that political rights are a
hollow sham if people in some parts of the United Kingdom are too poor orill-educated to make proper use of them. So the United Kingdom government must continue to have the obligation of directing our economic resources and making its financial arrangements in such a way that all parts of the UnitedKingdom have the means of enjoying equality of standards in those serviceslike health, education and so on which are now regarded as a responsibility ofgovernment. It does not necessarily follow from this that there will in fact be an absolute uniformity of standards in these matters throughout the UnitedKingdom. The people in the different parts of the country might wish to re-allocate expenditure between the different government services. But they musthave the right to resources which could produce an equality of standardsthroughout the United Kingdom in those services the government provide.128. The concepts of a substantial equality of political and economic rightsand obligations throughout the United Kingdom have particularly important implications for any scheme of devolution. It means that we cannot offer rights to one part of the United Kingdom which we deny to another part. Morespecifically, if we think it is in the interests of &quot;the good government of our people under the Crown&quot; (to quote from our terms of reference) that thereshould be elected Assemblies with legislative or other powers in Scotland andWales and thus give the people in Scotland and Wales an extra vote and an extra &quot;say&quot; in the way their affairs are conducted, then we cannot deny, as themajority of our colleagues wish to do, that extra vote and extra &quot;say&quot; to thepeople of the different regions of England. Still less can we accept a secondfeature in the scheme of legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales proposedby our colleagues. Not only do they want to transfer legislative sovereignty in important fields like education, health, agriculture, etc., from the UnitedKingdom Parliament to Scottish and Welsh Assemblies, they also envisage thatwhen the U.K. Parliament then legislates for England alone in the matters which have been transferred to Scottish and Welsh Assemblies, the 100 or soScottish and Welsh M.P.S at Westminster should have a full share in thelegislative process for England. While we agree that within the framework oftheir scheme there was no practical alternative, that does not commend theirsolution; it condemns the scheme. For it must be completely unacceptable notonly to give the people in Scotland and Wales political rights which are denied to the people in the various regions of England but, in addition, to give tothe people of Scotland and Wales a share in determining policies applying toEngland only, while denying the people of England any similar share in shapingpolicies in Scotland and Wales. There is surely a profound irony here; thescheme commended by the majority of our colleagues to give Scotland andWales autonomy in certain specified fields would actually deny autonomy toEngland in those very same fields. This is no way to maintain the political and constitutional unity of the United Kingdom. And, anyway, it is a fundamentalviolation of the principle of the equality of political rights of the basic demo-cratic principle expounded by Bentham when he wrote: -&quot;everybody to countfor one, nobody to count for more than one&quot;.129. There are two further reasons why in our view there must be equality of political rights in all parts of the United Kingdom and why the people of
Scotland and Wales should not have political rights denied to the people inthe different regions of England: (a) The claim to be a separate nation within the United Kingdom (even ifit is true) does not entitle the people in Scotland and Wales to be bettergoverned or to have more participation in the handling of their own affairs than is offered to the people of Yorkshire or Lancashire (to mention only counties with comparable populations)1.(b) Scotland and Wales, like certain of the poorer regions of England, arenow heavily subsidised by the richer regions of England. The concept of&quot;the right to equality of standards&quot; outlined in paragraph 127 is the justification for this. And it is an essential feature of the economic andpolitical unity of the United Kingdom. But it would neither be rightnor just to deny the people in the richer regions of England equality ofpolitical rights with the people of Scotland and Wales while at the sametime expecting them to continue to provide certainly for Wales andpossibly for Scotland very substantial economic and financial support.130. We have implied earlier in a number of places in our report that the basic and overriding principle that should govern any institutional change isthe maintenance and extension of democratic rights and freedoms. This is vital,in our view for the health of the body politic; and it assumes particular impor-tance in the United Kingdom today in view of all the evidence about the erosionof democracy the decline in the extent to which we as a people govern our-selves. The application of this fundamental principle has widespread ramifica-tions and implications which are developed in the following paragraphs. Herewe wish to emphasise that in our view the essence of the principle means thatthe people or their directly elected representatives must have full control overthe political decision-making processes. The more the people or their repre-sentatives share in making decisions, the more likely they are to accept them.People who feel they have had an adequate part in the decision-making processdo not then usually find themselves as part of the forces of direct action at thebarricades. So, in our view, this principle is fundamental to achieving theultimate objective of a modern democracy the maximum consent of thegoverned to acts of government.131. In this general context, it needs to be remembered that the process ofgovernment involves a whole gamut of decisions ranging from major issues ofgeneral policy through subordinate policy decisions to give effect to these general policies right down to particular decisions affecting particular localitiesor individuals. So a successful system of democratic government must providethe right number of levels for decision-making. And in determining the rightnumber of levels and the distribution of functions between them, we need, inour view, to adopt the principle that decisions must be made as near as possibleto those affected by them; and linked with this is the principle we have referredto in a different connection in paragraph 122 above i.e. that decisions madeat central government level should be limited to those which cannot, without1 On the basis of the preliminary 1971 Census figures the populations are as follows: ScotlandLancashireYorkshireWales5,227,7065,106,1235,047,5392,723,596
proven detriment to efficiency and the economic and political unity of theUnited Kingdom, be made at a lower level. The application of these principleswill make it easier for those most intimately concerned to have a maximumimpact on the decision-making process. It is also an important means of pre-venting the development of remoteness between the people and the government.And it will help to ensure that decisions are taken with the most detailedpossible knowledge of their consequences for those affected by them.132. Besides devising the right number of levels of government, it is alsoclearly important to have them closely associated with each other. There aretwo reasons for this: (a) if there is too much independence between the different levels, clearly the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom would be injeopardy;(b) since the decisions at the higher level inevitably have a major impact on the operation of subordinate authorities it is crucial that they shouldbe taken with a full awareness of the problems and methods of operationof those affected by them. At present, for example, central governmentis often accused of being too remote, and of taking decisions whichbetray a serious lack of awareness of the problems and potentialities of local authorities; this is the sort of situation which, in the interestof good government, we must avoid.Both (a) and (b) above point to the need to provide institutional mechanismsto link the different levels of government closely together without at the sametime restricting the freedom of the different levels to take independently thedecisions appropriate for them to determine. A way of providing for this is toadopt what might be called &quot;the inter-locking principle&quot;, and devise methodswhereby elected representatives and officials at one level of government are able directly to participate in the decision-making process of the immediatelysuperior level. This cross-fertilisation could go a long way towards ensuring a proper integration of our system of government; it will also help to ensurethat the proper functions of subordinate governments are not unduly circum-scribed by higher authority. The way practical effect might be given to this principle is indicated in more detail in Chapters VI and VII.133. The inter-lockingprinciplereferredtoinparagraph 132 must not, however,be carried so far that the different levels of government become a fully unifiedand integrated structure. This is because long experience has shown that theinterests of political liberty are best served when institutional and constitutionalstructures are based on the principle of the &quot;separation of powers&quot;. And thismeans much more today than so ordering the arrangements in the machineryof central government that the executive, the legislature and the judiciary act asbalancing checks to, the aggrandisement of power. It means, too, in our view,that we should seek to check the natural tendency of central government as awhole to enlarge its powers and extend its controls. To this end we think it important to endow the lower levels of government with sufficient democraticauthority to enable them to operate as effective countervailing powers to thenaturally aggrandising and centripetal tendencies of central government.
134. We have stressed in paragraph 130 that the basic and overriding principlethat should govern any institutional change is the maintenance and extensionof democratic rights and freedoms. This has further important implicationsin addition to the ones so far developed. It involves more than enabling thepeople or their representatives to share in, or control, the decision-makingprocesses at all levels of government; and it involves more, too, than arrange-ments for the proper control of bureaucracy referred to in paragraph 123.We also need to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of individualrights; and we need, too, to provide satisfactory machinery for the redress of individual grievances. Because, however well-meaning our officials or elected representatives may be, decisions will inevitably be made which adversely affect an individual^ rights or leave people with a sense of individual grievance.And if people feel their liberties are being curtailed or that adequate meansdo not exist to protect their individual rights or to investigate their grievancesagainst any public authority or service, democratic rights and freedoms will inevitably seem more sham than reality. That way the people&apos;s support for thesystem of government and the decisions it makes will be seriously weakened. Sosafeguarding individual rights and liberties is not only an essential part of the democratic ideal, it is also an essential means of eliciting the maximum consentof the governed to acts of government and indeed to the system of government itself. -&quot;135. In any democracy there is a crucial problem about the rights of minorities.The minorities in this context are not only racial or religious though these maybe the most lasting and the most important. But on some issues the minoritymay be trade unionists or employers or professional people; equally the minority may be all the people in a particular geographic area of the UnitedKingdom in Scotland, Wales, Yorkshire or Lancashire for example. In factany group of people with common interests is likely to find itself a minorityat some time or other. And the essence of the problem here is that if the vital interests of minorities are overridden or neglected by an insensitive majority the essential basis of consensus in society will be eroded and minorities will feel forced to take to the streets in often violent direct action instead of seeking to achieve their ends through peaceful constitutional processes. So a vitalprinciple of any scheme of reform must be to provide for, and to safeguard,the fullest possible range of minority rights. It is not easy to devise constitutional and institutional mechanisms to this end without undue limitation on the rightsof majorities and without impeding the efficient dispatch of public business.In the last analysis here, one has to rely on the tolerance and good sense of majorities and their recognition that there is a point beyond which minoritiescannot be pressed if the essential consensus in society and the state is to bemaintained. But there are constitutional and political devices which, if they are adopted, will give minorities of all kinds a fuller share in decision-makingprocesses than they enjoy at present. So an important objective of any schemeof reform must be to build these devices into our governmental system.136. To command the support of the people it is essential that the processes of government and decision-making should be as open as possible. This is a vital characteristic of any democracy. If people do not know what is going onthey are not able to bring their influence to bear before final decisions are taken.
The greater the secrecy, the greater the sense of exclusion from the decision-making process and the greater the difficulty of gaining public acceptance forthe decisions arrived at and very probably, too, the worse the decisions.No doubt it will always be necessary to impose some limitations on the principlethat in a democracy all decisions should be &quot;open decisions openly arrived at&quot;;but in a mature democracy those limitations must clearly be kept to an absoluteminimum.137. It seems desirable, other things being equal, that any changes in our system of government should be in the direction of simplicity. This is partly because undue complexities are likely to impede the efficient dispatch of public business: and also because the more complex the system, the more difficult itis for people to understand how it really works.138. A system of government, besides being as simple as possible, shouldalso be flexible. There are three obvious reasons for this: -(a) the central government must be able to deal quickly with emergencyor crisis situations without necessarily going through 1 all the normalconsultative or deliberative processes; but in these circumstances it must always be possible for the representatives of the people to call it to full account; j(b) the structure of government should be such that it can assume additionalduties and responsibilities, or shed any of its present ones, should thepeople so wish;(c) over the years our institutions must be able to adapt themselves to thefull consequences (many as yet unseen) of Common Market membership and the way the Common Market institutions themselves develop.139. An essential feature of any democracy is the concept of politicalresponsibility and accountability. The people must be able to see clearly who is responsible for the multitude of decisions taken by the various public authorities which affect their daily lives; and they must be able to call to account those who take these decisions. Since in any system of government different decisions are taken at different levels and by different public authorities, there must, therefore,be a clear demarcation of the responsibilities of the different levels of governmentand the relationship of those levels to any other public bodies with decision-making powers. And it inevitably follows from this that there must be no organsof public decision-making which the people feel they cannot call to account.140. It goes without saying that in any necessary reforms to our systemof government a major principle must be the enlargement of the area of individual freedom and liberty. This, however, must not only be interpretednegatively as meaning reducing the governments demands on the individualto the minimum necessary to achieve the aims of the community as a whole.It must also be interpreted positively; and this means an individual must havethe greatest possible political freedoms and opportunities which enable him totake a full share in the processes of government. And it means, too, that our political system should offer all the people the widest possible range of choicesbetween different policies and between various would-be representatives. In thelast analysis, individual choice is the very essence of individual freedom andliberty.
141. It follows from the supreme value we place on the individual in ademocracy that the system of government must above all be humane. Thismeans that its essential concern is for individual rights and individual welfare.Thus, if in devising constitutional and institutional arrangements there is aclash between the dictates of efficiency and the needs of humanity, the interestsof human beings must always come first.General conclusion142. We have set out in the preceding sections of this chapter the general considerations which have governed our approach to the whole question of constitutional and institutional reform. We have also drawn attention to theparticular objectives that must be met in the light of our assessment of theevidence. We have set out, too, the general principles (and their implications)which have guided us in devising the changes in our system of government we now believe to be necessary. It will be evident from what we have said that since one Of our basic objectives is to achieve a modern system of democracywhich will elicit the maximum consent of the governed to acts of government,then the changes we recommend must be able to command the support of thepeople and match their needs and aspirations. That must be the crucial test.143. It will also be evident from the preceding sections of this chapter thatthe general considerations governing our approach and the various objectives and principles are not all of equal weight or importance. Nor are they without their contradictions; they do not all point unequivocally in the same direction.But whatever balance may have to be struck, there must be no compromise withour fundamental objective to recommend changes which will bring us stillnearer to the democratic ideal of government of the people, by the people,for the people in an age when we, as a people, are more fitted than ever beforeto govern ourselves. And it must be fair and equal government for all our people.
THE NUMBER OF LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT NEEDED IN THEUNITED KINGDOM. DO WE NEED A LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTBETWEEN THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LONDON?The apparent nature of the problem and the views of the Royal Commission on local Government in England144. To modify our system of government in accordance with the principles and objectives set out in Chapter IV, the first major decision that must betaken is whether or not we need a tier of government in the United Kingdombetween the local authority level on the one hand, and the central governmentlevel in Whitehall and Westminster on the other. For the changes we need to devise to meet the objectives set out in the preceding chapter will naturally be very much affected by whether or not there is to be such an intermediatetier. And here, since one of our objectives is to make our system of government as simple as possible, it follows that the fewer levels of government we have, the better. So clearly we do not want an intermediate tier if we can do withoutone.145. With the reorganisation of local government in Scotland, Wales and england following the Local Government Acts of 1972, it might well be thoughtthat whatever case there might have been for an intermediate tier of governmenthas now been at least very considerably weakened. This is partly because :-(a) a basic objective of the reform was to create local authorities large enough to meet the increasing demands on local government and &quot;to achieve the rising standards of service which the public is likely to expect over the years ahead&quot;1;(b) in creating larger local government areas the Government had a secondmajor objective. They were &quot;determined that local government shouldbe powerful enough to take its own decisions, establish its priorities andallocate the resources available to it. They want reformed local govern-ment to be free from the detailed control by central government&quot;2.Clearly, these larger and more powerful local authorities can undertake functions and responsibilities of government which previously could be effectivelydischarged only at either a central or intermediate level.146. The nature of the reform of local government might be thought to be another factor weakening whatever case there has hitherto been for an inter-mediate level of government. The essence of the new pattern of local governmentis its two-tier structure of operational authorities. Thus: (a) In Scotland with its population of 5,227,706 and an area of 30,414 square miles, the proposed two-tier structure will consist of:(i) Nine regions with populations ranging in size from 99,000 in the borders to 2,580,000 in Strathclyde. Orkney and Shetland, each1 Reform of Local Government in Scotland (Cmnd. 4583, February, 1971, paragraph 5).The corresponding White Paper, Local Government in England (Cmnd. 4584, February, 1971),put the same objective slightly differently: &quot;There are too many authorities and many ofthem are too small in area and resources to support the operation of services to the standards which people nowadays have a right to expect&quot; (paragraph 6).2 The Reform of Local Government in Wales. February, 1971, paragraph 2.
with a population of 17,000, and the Western Isles, with a populationof 30,000, are excluded from the two-tier structure. Each will forman island area carrying out all the services of local governmentexcept police and fire services which are to be exercised jointly withthe Highlands region,(ii) Within the nine regions, forty-nine districts with populationsranging from 9,122 in Badenoch and Strathspey to 1,145,573in Glasgow. The average population of a district is 106,700. Hereit might just be noted that there are eighteen districts with largerpopulations than the smallest region, the Borders, and eight withlarger populations than the Dumfries and Galloway region1.(b) In Wales, with its population of 2,723,596 and an area of 8,016 square miles the two-tier structure consists of: -(i) Eight counties with populations ranging in size from just under100,000 in Powys to over 530,000 in Mid-Glamorgan; the averagepopulation per county is 340,450.(ii) Within the eight counties thirty-seven districts with populationsranging in size from 18,500 in District 2 in Powys to 286,400 inDistrict 1 in South Glamorgan. The average population of districtsis 73,600. Here it might be noted that seven districts have largerpopulations than the smallest county.(c) In England, with its population of45,870,000 and an area of 50,332 square miles, the two-tier structure consists of: (i) The G.L.C., six Metropolitan Counties and thirty-nine non-Metropolitan Counties forty-six authorities altogether. Theirpopulations range from 7,379,000 in the G.L.C. to 109,000 in the isle of Wight. Leaving out the G.L.C. the average population ofupper-tier authorities is 855,300.(ii) Within the forty-six authorities at (i) above there are thirty-twoboroughs in the G.L.C., thirty-six districts in the six MetropolitanCounties, and 296 districts in the thirty-nine Non-MetropolitanCounties. Leaving out the boroughs in the G.L.C., the averagepopulation of the lower-tier authorities is about 116,000. within each district existing parish councils are to continue, and wherethey do not at present exist they may be established by theappropriate district council.So with a two-tier structure of main authorities and in addition a parish councillevel (or community council in Wales and Scotland), it might well appear thatthere is no room for, or no need for, any further tier of government between these local authorities and central government.147. Before we can accept the conclusions suggested by paragraphs 145 and146 above, we have to consider the basic principles behind the new two-tierreorganisation. This is, perhaps, best expressed in the Governments white paper, &quot;Reform of Local Government in Scotland&quot;, where it says: &quot;The district authorities will not be subsidiary (sic) to the regional authorities, but will be complementary to them. Each type of authority will1 The figures in this sub-paragraph relate to the situation when the Local Government(Scotland) Bill left the House of Commons.
be independent of the other and, while consultation and co-operationbetween them will be essential, their statutory functions can be quitedistinct, the regions dealing with the services which require managementover a wide area and the districts with more local services&quot;1.The same point is made in &quot;The Reform of Local Government in Wales&quot;: &quot;The district councils would be autonomous within their own areas ofresponsibility . . . Essentially, the new county councils will be made responsible for those functions for which large areas or large populations,or both, are required . . . The new district councils will be responsiblefor those functions which can be satisfactorily administered on a morelocal scale&quot;2.The White Paper on Local Government in England makes the same point inthese words: &quot;The Government therefore intend that the reorganised system shouldeverywhere be based on two forms of operational authorities. They donot, however, see the relationship between the two as implying that someauthorities are answerable to others. The Governments concern has been to settle how functions can best be operated; some need wider areas; ofadministration, while others are best dealt with by authorities more closely in touch with local conditions. It would be quite wrong to use the terms&apos;upper&apos; and &apos;lower&apos; tier authorities&quot;3.So, in Great Britain as a whole, the new two-tier structure is intended to have in effect the characteristics of a one-tier structure. Thus there is intended to be only one local government level of authority for executive and administrative action in any particular function. And when local government has to deal withcentral government presumably each tier will deal direct with the appropriateorgan of central government in those matters in which it is &quot;autonomous&quot;.Which means, therefore, that the question of an intermediate level of govern-ment between local authorities and central government is not ruled out by the excessive proliferation of levels argument. For most purposes we have a singletier structure of local government which contains in effect two different types of unitary authorities4.148. In the last analysis, though, whether we need an intermediate tier ofgovernment between local and central government must depend on whether there are enough important functions of government which fulfil some or all of the following conditions: (a) they cannot be performed by the enlarged local authorities;(b) they cannot be performed by central government;(c) they could with advantage be shed by central government;(d) they would be better performed at an intermediate level rather than by central or local government.These are the questions considered in the rest of this chapter.1 Reform of Local Government in Scotland (Cmnd. 4583), paragraph 18. Our underlining.2 The Reform of Local Government in Wales, paragraphs 6 and 8.  ,3 Local Government in England (Cmnd. 4584), paragraphs 14 and 15.4 This conclusion may to some extent be undermined by the &quot;Agency Arrangements&quot;provided for in Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972. But it is too early yet to knowhow much use will be made of this particular section and how precisely it will work.
149. The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England(The Redcliffe-Maud Commission) came to the &quot;firm&quot; conclusion that &quot;localgovernment, however organised, needs to include a new representativeinstitution with authority over areas larger than any city region, not unlike the eight areas of the present regional economic planning councils&quot;1. Andthey reached this conclusion even though the size of the sixty-one new localgovernment units recommended consisted of fifty-eight each falling within abroad population range of 250,000 to 1 million, and three with a broadpopulation range of 2 million to 3 J million. Thus although the Redcliffe-Maudunitary authorities were to be only slightly smaller on average than the sixMetropolitan Counties and the thirty-nine non-Metropolitan Counties theCommission did not believe they were anywhere near big enough to undertakeall the functions of local government. For these other functions, the Redcliffe-Maud Commiss;on considered that eight Provinces were necessary with areasranging in size from 3,600 square miles to over 10,000, and with populations of between 2 million and 17 million nearly all very substantially larger thanthe new units of local government set up by the 1972 Local Government Actfor England and Wales, and nearly all very substantially larger, too, than thenew units in Scotland.150. The main local government function which Redcliffe-Maud consideredcould be satisfactorily performed only at this provincial level was the deter-mination of &quot;the provincial strategy and planning framework within which themain authorities must operate. The eight Provinces would also replace thepresent regional economic planning councils and collaborate with centralgovernment in the economic and social development of each province&quot;2.This provincial level was also to have responsibilities in the fields of further education and specialist education. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission left itto the Commission on the Constitution to consider whether this provinciallevel &quot;should be called on to assume functions now concentrated in an over-worked system of central government&quot;3.151. The Minority Member of the Royal Commission, Mr. Derek Senior,in his Memorandum of Dissent also saw the need for a provincial level ofgovernment even though his proposed units of local government were to be rather larger than those proposed by Redcliffe-Maud. Thus Mr. Senior, basinghimself on the city-region idea advocated thirty-five regional authorities withinwhich there were to be 148 district authorities. And over these &quot;city-regions&quot;Mr. Senior saw the need for five Provincial Councils. Mr. Senior&apos;s justification for this is best put in his own words: &quot;The need for an intermediate or provincial level of government activityarises from the existence of problems which cannot be comprehended(and therefore cannot be solved) except by bodies operating at that level problems which stand in the way of the proper discharge by both central and local government of their respective responsibilities. I therefore agreewith my colleagues that some kind of provincial organisation is necessary1 Local Government Reform. Short Version of the Report of the Royal Commission on local Government in England. June, 1969, page 7.2 Local Government Reform. Short Version of the Report of the Royal Commission on local Government in England, page 9.3 Royal Commission on Local Government in England, 1966-9, Volume I, paragraph 439.
to bridge the gap to take a synoptic view of the combined effects of departmental policies over as wide an area as possible, to bring localneeds and aspirations to bear on decisions that have to be made nationallybut cannot rationally be made from Whitehall, and to give local planning authorities a long-term strategic context for structural plan-making&quot;1.152. So, on this basis and with his proposed city-regions and districtssubstantially bigger than their counterparts now being set up under the 1972Local Government Act, Mr. Senior considered there was a need for a provinciallevel to discharge mainly local government functions which could not be performed at any other level. Mr. Senior lists these provincial level functions as follows: (a) &quot;its most important task would be to resolve the long-term planningproblems presented at provincial level by demographic projections,technological innovations, economic trends and the functional invest-ment programmes of government departments, nationalised industries and other agencies problems which cannot be comprehended at anyother level and thereby to enable local authorities to produce soundlybased structural development plans with real meaning and capacity tobear on development&quot;2;(7j) &quot;to advise the central government on the implications for the well-being of the people of the province, of developing government policies and intended legislation before they reach a stage at which re-thinkingbecomes too difficult&quot;3;(c) to assist central government &quot;in preparing and revising the provincialcontribution to a medium-term (four or five years) national plan for the promotion of economic growth, in formulating [the] medium-term programme of capital investment and in exercising control over the location of employment&quot;3;(d) &quot;to monitor the progress of the provincial economy and exert a mana-gerial influence on it by drawing attention to the mutual repercussions of the current policies and short-term programmes of all major public and private employers and providers of services, and seeking to promoteconcerted action among them consistent with the objectives of theprovincial strategy&quot;3;ie) to help local authorities to interpret the significance for them of theprovincial strategy3;(/) &quot;to provide a forum of confrontation between the differing prioritiesof local and central government and between public and private enter-prise in all matters affecting the social and economic well-being of theprovince as a whole&quot;3.1 Royal Commission on Local Government in England, 1966-9, Volume II. Memorandumof Dissent by Mr. D. Senior, paragraph 454.2 Op. cit., paragraph 481.3 Op. cit., paragraph 483.
If Mr. Senior is right, it would follow that there is even more need now for aprovincial level than he envisaged since the different units of local government now being set up are substantially smaller than Mr. Senior himself proposed.153. It does not, of course, necessarily follow that because both the majority and minority on the Royal Commission on Local Government in Englandstrongly advocated a provincial level that there is in fact such a need. But prima facie this recommendation, based as it is on three years&apos; work and muchdetailed research, does establish at least a strong presumption in favour of sucha level. Clearly they have demonstrated that there are important functionsof local government which can be satisfactorily performed only at this inter-mediate level. Is this enough, though, to justify such a tier? Are there enoughfunctions which need to be performed at this level to justify its creation? or could the functions that need to be performed at this level be carried out bysome sort of co-operative arrangements between the different local authoritieswithout the need to set up a new level of government? Before answeringquestions like these, it needs to be appreciated that in many respects we already have a provincial level of government. It consists essentially of two different types of organisation the direct outposts of central government and thevarious ad hoc authorities. These are outlined separately in the following sections.The provincial level of government we already have: the outposts of centralgovernment154. The oldest outpost of central government is the Scottish Office. Set upin 1885, its responsibilities and staff have greatly expanded over the years.It is now responsible for the central administration in Scotland of agricultureand fisheries, education, health, economic planning, local government, townand country planning, new towns, housing, roads, transport and environmental services, the police, fire services, criminal policy, the prisons, organising andstaffing Scottish courts, liquor licensing, betting, gaming and lotteries, theprotection of animals and wild birds, etc.1 Under the Secretary of State ithas the duty of helping to work out for all these a policy that will both meetScottish requirements and be fundamentally consistent with what is proposedin England and Wales. The Scottish Office also keeps an eye on the activitiesof the central government departments which operate in Scotland and whichare referred to in the next paragraph. The size of the Scottish Office staff isabout 6,300; and its annual expenditure on services within the responsibilityof the Secretary of State and administered directly by him or indirectly throughlocal authorities to whom he makes grants now amounts to over  1,400 million.1 These are all taken from headings and details in the Written Evidence from the scottish office to the Commission on the Constitution published in 1969. The document itself summarises the main fields covered by the Scottish Office as follows: &quot;agriculture and fisheries; land use planning, with housing, roads, water supplies and electricity; local passenger transport by sea, and since 1968 by road; education and social work services; health and welfare services, and services relating to law and order;and general matters affecting local authorities, including the administration of non-earmarked grants to the authorities and issues relating to the structure of localgovernment&quot; (paragraph 9).
155. Naturally, the central government departments whose responsibilitiesare covered by the Scottish Office do not operate in scotland. But other centralgovernment departments do have their Scottish outposts. These include: (a) The Department of Employment. It is responsible for the administrationof the following services in Scotland: (i) Provision of employment services through 150 employment exchanges and other local offices in Scotland.(ii) Vocational Training of Adults at Government Training Centres.(iii) The Youth Employment Service, which is operated in some areas by the Department and in others by education authorities.(iv) Employment and Training of disabled people.(v) Development of Industrial Training.(vi) Prevention and Settlement of Industrial Disputes.(vii) Provision of an advisory service to industry on manpower and productivity questions.The department also has a Factory Inspectorate in Scotland which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the laws relatingto the safety, health and welfare of workers employed in factories, shops,offices and certain other premises. Factory inspectors in eleven districtoffices are available for consultation on these matters.(b) The Department of Trade and Industry. It is responsible for: (i) the old Ministry of Power functions in Scotland including closeliaison with the National Coal Board, the Scottish Gas Board,the British Steel Corporation. This division is also responsiblefor the safety, health and welfare of miners and quarry workers and operates through an inspectorate. It also has examiners fortesting gas and electricity meters;(ii) the old Ministry of Technology functions maintaining close links with such industries in Scotland as mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding, etc.;(iii) the old Board of Trade functions e.g. the promotion of exports,the administration of location of industry policy (with substantialdelegated powers to grant industrial development certificates)including applications for financial assistance under the local employment Acts. These latter functions are now mainly concen-trated in the departments Scottish Industrial Development Office2.There are also more specialised functions which belonged to theold Board of Trade which are also separately administered byD.T.I. outposts in Scotland; these include responsibilities for civil Aviation, Marine Survey (e.g. surveying ships to ensurecompliance with safety regulations), and Mercantile Marine(e.g. functions under the Merchant Shipping Acts in connectionwith the engagement and discharge of seamen and fishermen).1 Except the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It is responsible throughout great Britain for the operational control of epidemic diseases of animals and for food supply,price and defence planning.2 This followed the setting up in March, 1972, of an Industrial Development Executiveunder the Minister for Industrial Development, one of the second-tier Ministers in theDepartmental Headquarters in London.
(c) The Department of the Environment. It is responsible for the oldMinistry of Transport duties in Scotland in connection with the licensing and testing of vehicles and drivers under the Road Traffic Acts. It also hasresponsibilities for the licensing (through the Traffic Commissioners)of bus services and goods vehicles. It is also responsible for ports,railways, road freight, public building and works and defence lands.(d) The Department of Health and Social Security. Its Scottish outpostdeals only with Social Security (the Scottish Office is responsible for health see paragraph 154). It is responsible for the administration ofwar pensions and allowances, family allowances, national insurance,industrial injuries insurance and related schemes, and supplementary benefits. &quot;The Scottish Controller&quot; is in charge of the Departments&apos;Scottish outpost and under him and his staff are 131 local offices,twenty-two public caller offices and fifteen local Advisory Committees.The total staff of the above outposts in 1970 was of the order of 11-12,000.156. In Wales there is an outpost structure of central government very similarto the one developed for Scotland and outlined in paragraphs 154 and 155 above.Thus the Welsh Office is now responsible for the central administration in wales of town and country planning, economic planning, housing, water,sewerage and radio-active materials, environmental services, other local govern-ment matters, roads, health and welfare, primary and secondary education, andcertain other functions; and this involves ensuring that the various policies in all these fields are executed with due regard to the particular needs and interests of Wales. The Welsh Office also participates in the formulation ofnew policies in these matters and in the preparation of new legislation. In prac-tice the prepatory work is done mainly by the larger Whitehall departments with appropriate consultations with the Welsh Office. Finally, as in Scotland,the Welsh Office under the Secretary of State also has the responsibility for&quot;overseeing&quot; the work of other Government departments in Wales &quot;to see thatthey co-ordinate&quot;1. The size of the Welsh Office staff in 1972 was 990; and nearly one-half of the identifiable expenditure of government departments and local authorities in Wales in 1971-1972 fell within the responsibility ofthe Secretary of State.157. In addition to the Welsh Office as an outpost of central governmentin Wales a number of departments of central government whose responsibilitiesare not covered by the Welsh Office also have their outposts and staff there.These include the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Departmentof Employment, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Departmentof the Environment (for certain transport matters and for certain functionsof the old Ministry of Public Building and Works), and the Department ofHealth and Social Security (for social security matters). In 1969 these outpostsin Wales of central government had a non-industrial staff of between 8-9,000.158. The outposts of central government are not, of course, limited to scotland and Wales. They have their counterparts now in the English regions.As was pointed out in Chapter I, one of the main developments in british The Prime Minister, 24th July, 1965.
Government, particularly since the Second World War, has been the extentto which the central departments of government have found it necessary toset up their own regional and local structures. It is not a tidy picture, but ithas two essential characteristics: (a) while nearly all the major departments concerned with &quot;home affairs&quot;have established regional outposts to handle some parts of their admini-strative responsibilities, there is no uniformity about the number ofregions into which Departments have divided England for these purposes.Thus the number of regions into which England has been dividedranges from fourteen to two;(b) no English region contains any counterpart of the Scottish or welsh office and their Secretaries of State, i.e. an organisation and a minister with a range of executive and administrative (and to some extent,policy-making) functions which cover the responsibilities of more thanone of the central departments of government.The main elements of this English regional structure are outlined in the following paragraphs.159. The following main departments of government have now set up regional,and sometimes local, offices to which a great deal of work is devolved fromdepartmental headquarters: The Department of the environment the Department of Health and Social security the Home office the Lord Chancellor^ department the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the Department of Trade and industry the Department of Employment.Of the major &quot;home&quot; departments, only the Treasury, the Civil Service Depart-ment, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Departmentof Education and science  have no regional structure.160. The general principle on which departments have devolved functions to their regional and local offices is that policy matters and the formulation ofpolicy are dealt with at departmental headquarters while the administration and implementation of policy and the attendant casework (e.g., the approvalof local government house-building schemes for subsidy, decisions on grants to local authorities for schemes of general area improvement, decisions on whether a particular firm should get financial assistance under the scheme of selective assistance to industry, etc.) is handled and decided at the departmentsregional office. Any departmental executive functions are also usually devolvedto its regional or local structure (e.g., the Road Construction Units of theDepartment of the Environment, the Social Security Offices of the Departmentof Health and Social Security).1 The Departments Inspectorate of Schools is in fact organised on a regional basis, andto provide the Inspectors with executive and clerical support the department maintainsoffices in nine regional centres and some forty other local centres. But, apart from the inspector, the department has no regional structure to which any of its administrative,regulatory or other functions are devolved.
161. The extent of this devolution of functions by departments to theirregional or local outposts is, perhaps, best measured in terms of the size ofstaff involved. In England on 1st January, 1970, there were 411,627 non-industrial Civil Servants. Of these 135,592 were employed in departmentalheadquarters while 276,035 were employed in the departments&apos; regional or local offices.162. Though the main &quot;home&quot; departments of central government thus havean extensive regional and local office structure, one of its essential characteristics,as mentioned in paragraph 158, is that there is no uniformity about the numberof regions into which England has been divided. And here not only are theredifferences between departments, there are also differences within departments.Thus, the Department of Health and Social Security has itself a number ofdifferent regional structures. It divides England into ten regions to provide an administrative liaison service between the departments headquarters and the bodies hospital authorities, executive councils and local authorities which provide services for which the Secretary of State has central responsibility.It divides England into six regions for general practitioner purposes and into two regions for its dental service responsibilities while its Regional social work Service operates from nine regional offices. At the same time the Depart-ment divides England into ten regions for social security administration withsome 600 local offices. Similarly, the Department of the Environment operatesthrough eleven different regional structures. For example, it has a Traffic AreaOrganisation (dealing with the licensing of road passenger services and road haulage services) which divides England into eight and a half regions (half ofone of its nine English regions includes the Northern half of Wales); its road construction Unit Organisation divides England into six &quot;regions&quot; (which itcalls &quot;areas&quot;); its District Audit Organisation divides England into somefourteen districts; its responsibilities for housing, trunk roads (apart from theRoad Construction Units), traffic management and regional economic planningare all carried out in a unified regional structure (known as D.O.E. regional offices) based on the eight economic planning regions1. The Department ofAgriculture divides England into seven regions, and thus operates throughseven regional offices; so does the Department of Employment. The HomeOffice runs its prisons through four regional offices (and had seven regional offices for the responsibilities of its Children&apos;s Department). So the picture that emergesis a great proliferation of different regional structures; and even when there appears to be some uniformity about the number of regions into which Englandhas been divided by some Departments (e.g., the &quot;seven regional basis&quot; of boththe Department of Agriculture and the Department of Employment), the boundaries of the Department of Agriculture Regions are very different fromthe boundaries of the Department of Employment Regions.163. Some co-ordination of the different departmental regional structuresand activities described in paragraphs 158 to 162 above is provided by the regional Economic Planning Councils and Boards. These date from December,1964, when the Government divided England into eight economic planning1 These economic planning regions were set up in 1964/5 and are dealt with atparagraphs 163 and 164 below.
regions1 and set up in each region an Economic Planning Council and anEconomic Planning Board. The Economic Planning Councils are advisorybodies and have no executive powers. By their terms of reference they arerequired to assist in the formulation of regional plans, to advise on the steps necessary for implementing the plans and to advise on the regional implications of national economic policies. The members of the Economic Planning Councilswere originally appointed (normally for a three-year period) by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs; they are now appointed by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment. The Economic Planning Boards consist of the senior civil servants of the main departments in each region which are concerned inany way with economic planning. The Boards have no formal terms of reference.Their main task is to co-ordinate the regional economic planning work of thedepartments and, through a common secretariat in each region, to co-operate with the regional economic planning council in developing a long-term planningstrategy.164. The Department of the Environment has the &quot;leading responsibilityfor regional policy&quot;2; so it provides the Chairmen of the eight economic planning Boards. These Chairmen are the eight Regional Directors (of Under-Secretary rank) who head the Departments main regional outposts-the eightD.O.E. Regional Offices whose responsibilities cover Roads and Transportation,Planning and Housing. But these Regional Directors have no authority overthe other members of the Planning Boards -usually and mainly the regionalrepresentatives of the Departments of the Environment, Agriculture, C.O.I.,Education, Employment, Health and Social Security, Trade and Industry andthe Civil Aviation Authority; authority over these officers can, of course, beexercised only by their respective departmental headquarters. Nor do the regional Directors of the Department of the Environment have any authority over those D.O.E. regional officials who work in the D.O.E.&apos;s other ten separateD.O.E. regional structures (e.g., Works Organisation, Road Construction Units,Mobile Crane Depots, Material Testing Laboratories, District Audit Organisa-tion, Rent Assessment Panels, Ancient Monument Organisation, and theAlkali Inspectorate); these D.O.E. organisations in the regions report to, andare thus under the control of, the appropriate Directorates at the D.O.E.Headquarters. There are limitations, too, on the Regional Directors authority over the different functions within his own Regional Office. Thus, although he isnominally responsible for all the work of his Regional Office, and the wholestaff of the Office is answerable to him, nevertheless important sections of his staff preserve direct links to their appropriate senior professional officers at theDepartments Headquarters. For example, the work of each Regional office is organised into three main groups, namely, Roads and Transportation;Planning; and Housing. The Roads and Transportation group is headed by the divisional Road Engineer who, though &quot;under the command of the RegionalDirector&quot;3 has a &quot;direct professional link to the appropriate senior professionalofficer at Headquarters&quot;4.1 Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside, the East Midlands, East Anglia, the South East,the South West, the West Midlands, and the North West.2 White Paper on the Reorganisation of Central Government (Cmnd. 4506), paragraph 31.3 Department  of the Environment  Circular  58/71   dated  22nd  October,   1971.paragraph 14.4 Op. cit.
165. It is clear, therefore, from paragraphs 158 to 164 that there has beena substantial development of the outposts of central government in the english regions. It is on a scale comparable with the similar developments in Scotlandand Wales outlined in paragraphs 154 to 157 above. But it differs from Scotlandand Wales in that: (a) while Scotland and Wales, in spite of their differences in size and population are each regarded as one unit for virtually all the outpostsof central government, England has been divided into a varying numberof different regional units for different purposes;(b) there is no single organisation in an English region with the authority and ambit of responsibilities of the Scottish and Welsh Offices thoughthe populations of the English regions match and frequently exceed those of Scotland and Wales.These differences are significant when we consider how we need to developEnglish regional government in the future. They must not, however, be allowedto obscure the fact that in the English regions, no less than in Scotland andWales, we already have (as paragraphs 158 to 164 have shown) a very substantialprovincial level of government decision-making a level intermediate between local government on the one hand and Whitehall and Westminster on the other.The provincial level of government we already have: the various ad hoc authorities166. Besides the various outposts of central government, there is anothergroup of organisations which operate at this intermediate level of government.These are the various ad hoc authorities like the Gas, Electricity and hospital boards, the Coal Board, the River Authorities, the Airport Authority and soon. As was pointed out in Chapter I, there has been a great proliferation ofthese bodies particularly since 1945. Some have taken over duties which were previously frequently performed by local government (e.g. the provision ofpublic utility services like gas, water and electricity). Others have been set upto handle some of the new responsibilities assumed by central government(e.g. the provision of a national health service, running the coal and steel industries, etc.). Some perform executive functions which are mainly com-mercial and industrial (e.g. the Post Office and the Electricity Boards); otherexecutive bodies provide personal or social services (e.g. the Hospital Boards);while some are mainly advisory (e.g. the Economic Planning Councils).Altogether there are now some fifty of these ad hoc bodies with reponsibilitiescovering the whole of Britain; and they employ a very substantial administrativestaff1.167. The executive ad hoc bodies (like the Coal Board, the Hospital Boards,etc.) were set up in their present form mainly in the cause of managerialefficiency. It was believed that the state could carry out these functions mostexpeditiously only if they were entrusted to specially nominated (rather thanelected) individuals who must be able to operate without being subjected tothe detailed control of central or local government.1 Figures are not available on the total administrative staffs employed by the ad ad hoc authorities.
168. Nearly all the executive ad hoc authorities have found it necessary toset up a &quot;regional&quot; structure and devolve substantial amounts of authorityto their regional outposts. Naturally, the different ad hoc authorities do nothave a uniform &quot;regional&quot; pattern. Thus, the National Coal Board dividesBritain into seventeen areas; the Gas Industry operates through twelve &quot;Area&quot;Boards, the Electricity Industry through fourteen, the G.P.O. through ten&quot;regional outposts&quot;.169. The present trend in the organisation of government appears to betowards an extension of, and refinement of, ad hoc authorities. Some of the impetus has come from the way part of the Fulton Report on the Civil service has been interpreted. It is believed by many to have recommended that sub-stantial areas of Civil Service work should be &quot;hived off&quot; from the centralgovernment machine and be entrusted instead to &quot;autonomous public boards and corporations&quot;1. It was as a direct result of this that the Civil aviation authority came into existence on 1st April, 1972. In this general context it isinstructive to consider the most recent proposals for the extension and develop-ment of the ad hoc authority system the proposed reorganisation of theNational Health Service and the creation of the new Water Authorities. Theyillustrate current government and departmental thinking about setting upad hoc authorities at an intermediate level between central and local government.They show the preference for entrusting executive responsibilities to speciallynominated bodies rather than to democratically elected ones. They show afurther withdrawal of functions from local government, and this even thoughthe design of creating enlarged local authority units was to enable them totake on new functions not to shed existing ones. And, finally, they are a furtherillustration of the way the regional boundaries of the various ad hoc bodies are becoming ever more various and lacking in uniformity.The National Health Service170. As from 1st April, 1974, the Government propose to bring together the following services to be administered under a unified National health service Administration: (a) the hospital and specialist services now administered by the regional hospital Boards, Hospital Management Committees and Boards of governors;(b) the family practitioner services now administered. by the executive councils;(c) the personal health services now administered by local authoritiesthrough their health committees;(d) the school health service.171. The personal health services which under 170 (c) above will be taken away from local authorities are as follows: ambulance services; epidermio-logical work, including general surveillance of the health of the community;1 What the report actually recommended was an early and thorough review of the questionof &quot;hiving off&quot;, and this was accepted though the review was undertaken by the C.S.D.rather than by an outside body. Report of the Committee on the Civil Service, 1968(Cmnd. 3638), Volume I, paragraphs 188-191.
family planning; health centres, home nursing and midwifery; maternity and child health care; medical, nursing and supplementary arrangements for theprevention of illness, care and after care; and vaccination and immunisation.Under 170 (d) local education authorities will lose their present responsibilities for school medical and dental services.172. To administer this new unified National Health Service, the Governmenthas decided that in England a two-level organisation is necessary in additionto the central Department. Thus the Government is setting up fourteen regional health Authorities; and within each Regional Health Authority will be anumber of Area Health Authorities. In this organisation it will be the function of the Department of Health and Social Security to &quot;settle national healthpolicies, objectives and priorities&quot;1; and the Department will decide capital and revenue allocations to the Regional Health Authorities. The regional health Authorities &quot;will have a regional planning responsibility which will include settling priorities when there are competing claims between areas;&quot;they will also have some executive functions including the design and con-struction of new buildings, purchasing, the provision of a blood transfusionservice. The Regional Health Authorities will allocate money to the area health Authorities to meet the cost of area services, including the cost of community Health Councils. The Area Health Authorities will both plan and operate the health services .173. The boundaries of the fourteen Regional Health Authorities as far as can be ascertained do not match those of any other ad hoc authority nor arethey conterminous with those of any other departmental regional structure.They have been determined mainly by the need for each Region -(a) to have a University medical school within its boundaries;(b) to be big enough for satisfactory planning, but not too large for theco-ordination and supervision of the Area Health Authorities;(c) &quot;to be suitable for the exercise of regional executive functions&quot;3.174. The intention is that the boundaries of the Area Health Authoritiesshould (outside London) be identical with those of the local authorities responsible for personal social services. Thus (outside London) the intention is that the boundary of each Authority will match that of the appropriatenon-metropolitan county, or metropolitan district4. This uniformity with localgovernment boundaries is, however, weakened by the fact that within each area Health Authority &quot;the day-to-day running of the services will be basedon&quot; districts. &quot;Each district will form the natural community for the planning and delivery of comprehensive health care&quot;. But the boundaries of these districts (which will usually have a population of between 200,000 and 500,000)&quot;will not necessarily correspond to the boundaries of a local governmentdistrict&quot;5.1 National Health Service Reorganisation: England. August, 1972 (Cmnd. 5055),paragraph 37, and paragraphs 80-83.2 Op. cit., paragraphs 37 and 44.3 Op. cit., paragraph 84.4 Op. cit., paragraph 53.5 Op. cit., paragraph 45.
175. Each Regional Health Authority and Area Health Authority will be run by a board consisting of a Chairman and about fourteen other members.The Secretary of State for Social Services will appoint the Chairmanof each Area Authority; four of the other members of each Area authority will be appointed by the matching local authority, one or two by the Universitymedical school in the region, and the remainder by the Regional health authority. So it is only at Area level that elected local authorities will be as of right built into the scheme; and even then, they will be able to appoint (or indirectly elect) only a quarter of the Area Authority.176. It is recognised that this management structure must in planning and running the health services &quot;be in a position to know the views taken of them(i.e., the health services) by the communities for whom the services are provided&quot;1. The health authorities &quot;must also take full account of thoseviews in the decisions they make&quot;2. The White Paper recognises that thereare two ways of providing for this &quot;expression of local opinion. It can be doneindirectly by including in the membership of the health authorities local peopleserving in a representative capacity. Or it can be done more directly, throughbodies specially set up for this purpose, with direct links to the authorities.The Government prefers the second course. It allows each of the interests management and the community to concentrate on its own special function,avoids a confusion between the direction of services and the representation ofthose receiving them, encourages a constructive interplay of ideas and makespossible the expression of a wider cross-section of local opinion than is feasiblewhere the authority itself contains members serving as representatives&quot;3.177. Accordingly, to represent the views of the consumer, community health councils are to be established one for each district in each Area health authority. Each Community Health Council will consist of some twenty tothirty members &quot;with particular interest in health services&quot;/4) Half the members will be appointed by the local government district council or councils coveredby the health district; the rest will be appointed by the Area Health Authority,&quot;mainly on the nomination of voluntary bodies concerned locally withthe National Health Service and some after consultation with other organisations&quot;4.178. Four points are particularly worth emphasising about these community health Councils which are intended to have some sort of influence over, orbe some sort of check on, the decisions of the Area Health Authorities: (a) half their members are to be nominated by the Area Health Authoritiesthey are supposed to influence or check;(b) their expenditure is to be controlled and provided by the Area health authorities;1 National Health Service Reorganisation: England. August, 1972 (Cmnd. 5055),paragraph 105.2 Op. cit., paragraph 105.3 Op. cit., paragraph 106.4 Op. cit., paragraph 107.
(c) their staff is to be provided by the Area Health Authorities;(d) they will have no power. Their job will be to represent to the Area health authorities the interests of the public in the health service; for their part the Area Health Authorities are expected to consult the Councilson the Area Health Authorities&apos; plans for Health Service developments and changes. In all this, the only sanction is the publication of reports.Thus the Community Health Councils will publish annual reports andthe Area Health Authorities will be required to publish replies recordingaction taken (or not taken) on issues raised in the annual reports1.179. It will not be the job of the Community Health Councils to investigateindividual complaints. This is to be the function of a Health Service Com-missioner (Ombudsman). His terms of reference will cover the whole of theNational Health Service, but he will not investigate complaints which in hisopinion relate to the exercise of clinical judgment by doctors and other staff,and he will not deal with complaints for which statutory procedures already exist (e.g., those about general medical and dental practitioners, pharmacistsand opticians, which will continue to be dealt with under the service committeeprocedure), or which he thinks the complainant could reasonably pursuethrough the courts or before some tribunal. The complainant will have directaccess to the Health Service Commissioner unlike the Commissioner for administration who can be approached only through a Member of Parliament.The Health Commissioner, however, will not investigate a complaint until heis satisfied that the health authority concerned has had a reasonable opportunityto investigate it and reply to the complainant who, despite this, is stilldissatisfied.180. Paragraphs 170 to 179 above summarise the new Health Service arrange-ments proposed for England2. The arrangements for Scotland and Wales are broadly similar with one exception. This is that for Scotland and Walesthere is to be no Regional Health Authority. The fourteen Area Health boards in Scotland will be directly responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland;and the eight Area Health Authorities in Wales will be directly responsible tothe Secretary of State for wales.The water authorities181. It is the Governments intention to reorganise the Water Service inEngland, Scotland and Wales with effect from 1st April, 1974. The objective of the reorganisation is to achieve comprehensive water management includingthe provision of water and the disposal of sewage since most of the watersupplied ultimately returns to the rivers as effluent.182. As far as England is concerned, the responsibility for water services at present lies with over 1,400 separate bodies. These include twenty-two riverauthorities (which are responsible for managing the water resources of riverbasins as a whole, including land drainage, fisheries and pollution control)1 Op. cit., paragraphs 109-112.2 The Summary, as will be evident, is based on Cmnd. 5055. It has not been possible tomodify this section to take into account any changes in the final Act of Parliament.3 Op. cit., paragraphs 175 et seq.
whose areas lie wholly in England, and another three which straddle the Anglo-Welsh border, 160 water undertakers (who are responsible for providing andsupplying water to consumers) and over 1,200 sewerage authorities (mainlycounty borough and county district councils). There is also a network of canalsand river navigations amounting to almost 2,000 miles, separately administered by the British Waterways Board.183. This structure, the Government believe, makes it difficult to take a comprehensive and long-term view of all the relevant aspects of water manage-ment and impedes successful and cost-effective action to safeguard water supplies and protect the environment. Accordingly, the Government proposesto establish nine Regional Water Authorities to replace virtually all the diversepublic authorities referred to in paragraph 182z. The new Regional water authorities will take over the water conservation, water quality control,navigation and recreation functions of the present river authorities, and thewater supply and sewage disposal functions at present performed by localauthorities. They will also take over the responsibilities of the British WaterwaysBoard for canals and river navigations3.184. The main activity of each Regional Water Authority will be the pro-vision of water and the reclamation or disposal of used water. In its own planning and operations it will be required to take account of the needs of navigationand recreation, and also of land drainage and sea defence, fisheries and the conservation of amenity and wild-life, consulting with other interested bodieswhere appropriate. It will be under a specific statutory obligation to maintain,and where possible, improve, the quality of the rivers and canals in its area.It will also have certain primarily regulatory functions, for example, in thedischarges of effluent4.185. As far as finance is concerned the Government expect that apart fromExchequer grants for specific purposes, the revenues to enable each waterauthority to discharge its main functions should come from charges for theservices they provide.186. It is envisaged that the nine Regional Water Authorities will &quot;need tomaintain close liaison with&quot; the eight regional economic planning councils5.And in this connection it is interesting to note that only two Regional water authorities each fall entirely within the area of a single Regional economic planning Council (and in each case the Water Authority is not conterminouswith the area of the Planning Council in which it falls); and each regional economic Planning Council (with one. exception) covers an area which, from1 Circular 92/71 from the Department of the Environment: Reorganisation of Water andSewage Services. 2nd December, 1971, paragraphs 9 and 11. The whole of the description thatfollows is based on this Circular; it has not been possible to take into account any changes inthe final Act of Parliament.2 The thirty-one Statutory Water Companies (i.e., private sector water companies) whichat present supply about 22 per cent, of the water consumed will not be taken over, but willcontinue to act as agents for the Regional Water Authorities.3 Op. cit., paragraph 22.4 Op. cit., paragraph 25.
a water point of view, is the responsibility of at least two Regional water authorities.187. The precise composition of each Regional Water Authority has notyet been settled. But the Government propose that each Authority &quot;should be composed of a substantial proportion of members appointed by local govern-ment, together with members appointed by Ministers&quot;1. It is not yet known whether the Ministerial appointees will be in a majority on each RegionalWater Authority; but if the National Health Service reorganisation is anyguide, they undoubtedly will be.188. As with the Regional Health Authorities, the Regional Water authorities will have a direct relationship with central government. While there must be anational strategy for the development of water resources, the government do not think that this &quot;makes it necessary to interpose a national body between ministers and the small number of strong Regional Water Authorities they propose&quot;2. There will, however, in the Governments view, be &quot;a need for a body to speak for the industry as a whole and to provide central services for itsbenefit&quot;. So the Government propose there should be a statutory Water Councilto perform these functions. It will consist of &quot;a Chairman, appointed by ministers, together with the Chairman of the Regional Water Authorities, and additional members chosen by Ministers as having special knowledge ofindustrial, agricultural, amenity, recreational and other matters. It will be specifically charged with the duty of promoting efficiency in the industry by comparing practices and performances in the different authorities and helpingauthorities to profit from each other&apos;s ideas and experiences&quot;2.189. As far as consumer interests in the running of the Regional WaterBoards are concerned again the National Health Service pattern is being followed. Thus &quot;it is proposed that within the area of each Regional WaterAuthority there should be one or more consumer councils reflecting the various interests involved, including local authorities, major users such as industryand farming, and amenity and recreational interests. It is envisaged that the regional Water Authority will be required to report annually to the consumercouncil on its plans; and to consider, and reply to, comments by the councilon these plans and on any matters affecting consumers&apos; interests. If the councils dissatisfied with the reply it will have direct access to Ministers. There will beconsultations about the constitution of these consumer councils&quot;3.190. As far as Wales is concerned, the pattern is very much as for England.The Welsh counterpart of the English Regional Water Authorities is to be the welsh National Water Development Authority; it will have broadly the samefunctions and responsibilities as an English Regional Water Authority. It willbe subject to the control of the Secretary of State for Wales in major mattersof policy. It should, however, be noted in this general context that: (a) The ambit of the Welsh National Water Development Authority will not cover the whole of Wales and will also extend beyond Wales. Thus: (i) it will not be the Regional Water Authority for the Upper SevernBasin within Wales which will be part of the Severn/Trent RegionalWater Authority;1 Op. cit., paragraph 42.2 Op. cit., paragraph 51.3 Op. cit., paragraph 43.
(ii) it will be the Regional Water Authority for parts of Cheshire and asubstantial part of Herefordshire.(b) The composition of the Welsh National Water Development authority has not yet been determined. The Government is delaying a decision onits composition until the Commission has reported.(c) Whether or not there is to be a Consumer Council will not be settleduntil a decision has been taken about the composition of the WelshNational Water Development Authority.191. In Scotland, there is to be an interesting contrast. Instead of an ad hocboard on the English or Welsh model, the responsibilities for water supply,sewerage and river purification will be in the hands of local government atregional authority level (i.e., the Scottish counterparts of the English metro-politan and non-metropolitan counties). So the ten Scottish regional authorities(with populations ranging from 156,000 in the South West Region to 2,562,000in the West Region) will have responsibilities for comprehensive water manage-ment, including the provision of water and the disposal of sewage, which arebeing denied to their much larger English counterparts. This is because the boundaries of the ten Scottish Regional Authorities are largely conterminouswith the boundaries required for hydrological purposes. There is no suchmatching of hydrological and local government boundaries in England andWales.General conclusion192. The preceding paragraphs have shown that we already have a very substantial intermediate level of government between the local authorities onthe one hand and Whitehall and Westminster on the other. It is a tier whichis clearly not going to diminish of its own accord when the enlarged units oflocal government begin to operate on 1st April, 1974. But given the will, could we get rid of this tier and what would be the consequences of doing so ?193. Clearly, there are only three ways of getting rid of this level of govern-ment. One is for the different units of local government to take over thefunctions now being performed at this intermediate level. Another is for thefunctions to be reabsorbed by the central government departments in Whitehall.Thirdly, we might consider that many of the intermediate level functions areunnecessary anyway and could be abolished. Though a very detailed examinationmight well identify some functions which fall into this last category, there canbe little doubt that the vast number of decisions which are now made in theoutposts of central government and in the &quot;regional&quot; organisations of thead hoc authorities have got to be made somewhere or other in our governmentalmachine. So only the first two alternatives or a combination of them offer a possible solution.:.194. As far as the first alternative is concerned, it is difficult to see how the enlarged local authorities could efficiently absorb more than a mere handfulof the functions now concentrated at this intermediate level.
195. Virtually none of the functions performed in England by.the regionaloutposts of central government1 could be handed over to individual localauthorities in a way which would make it possible for the departments concerned to abolish their regional organisations. This is because for the most part theraison detre of government departments carrying out these functions and making this large number of decisions at this intermediate level is the need tocomprehend a wider area of the country than is covered by one individuallocal authority. And, as far as Scotland and Wales are concerned, the sameargument leads to the obvious conclusion that not enough of the functions ofthe Scottish and Welsh Offices and the other outposts of central governmentin Scotland and Wales could be absorbed by local authorities to enable theseoutposts of central government to be abolished even if their abolition were considered desirable.196. It might be argued that there is more scope for local authorities to absorb or re-absorb a substantial part of the other main ingredient of thisintermediate tier the various &quot;regional&quot; ad hoc authorities. The English and welsh local authorities might, for example, take over the functions of the RegionalWater Authorities thus following the Scottish pattern; but it would clearly be at the expense of efficiency and would cut across natural hydrologicalboundaries. As far as the proposals to reorganise the Health Service are con-cerned, the Scottish, Welsh and English local authorities could certainly takeover the functions of the Area Health Authorities. But that would still leave very substantial intermediate local health functions which are to be performed bythe English Regional Health Authorities and by the Scottish Office and the welsh Office. The English non-metropolitan counties, the Welsh counties andthe nine Scottish Regions are simply not big enough to take these over in their entirety. The fact is that the raison d&apos;etre for the &quot;regional&quot; organisation of the health and water services is that there are important functions and problems tobe handled and solved which inevitably transcend local government boundaries.And this, for the most part, is also the raison d^etre of the regional structure ofthe other ad hoc authorities.197. Just as the great bulk of the intermediate level functions of the outpostsof central government and of the ad hoc authorities cannot be absorbed bylocal government, so it would make no sense for them to be re-absorbed bythe central government departments in Whitehall. The purpose of developingdepartmental regional structures has been to lighten the load on Whitehall andto try to ensure that decisions are taken by those with a more intimate knowledgeof the day-to-day problems involved; similar purposes are behind the develop-ment of regional ad hoc executive bodies. Clearly it would be wrong to reversethese trends and concentrate government authority in all these matters backin Whitehall.198. So, in the end we need to recognise that we have this very substantialintermediate tier of government and decision-making for one very importantreason. It is quite simply that there are a large number of important problems1 i.e., the regional outposts of the Department of the Environment, the Department ofHealth and Social Security, the Home Office, the Lord Chancellors Departments, the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Departmentof Employment and Productivity.
and functions which cannot be satisfactorily handled except by bodies operatingat this level. So the question we have to face is not whether we need an inter-mediate level, but what is the best way of running the one we have. For, as is evident from the preceding paragraphs, the present organisation and operationof this tier of government is open to very considerable criticism particularlyin the light of the objectives and principles of reform set out in Chapter IV.199. The first and most obvious criticism is the proliferation of differentregional structures and different regional boundaries within England.200. As far as the outposts of central departments are concerned they nowoperate in at least twenty different regional structures all with different regionalboundaries. The single element of coincidence is that one of the eleven Regionalstructures of the Department of the Environment its main Regional Officestructure covering housing, trunk roads, traffic management and regional economic planning is exactly conterminous with the boundaries of the eighteconomic planning regions. But the other eighteen or so regional structures are all based on different regional boundaries.201. The regional organisation of the various ad hoc authorities adds afurther dimension of overlap. They all have their own different regionalboundaries, and when the health and water services have been reformed theposition will be that in no single instance will the regional boundaries of anyone ad hoc authority coincide with those of any other; nor will they coincide with the regional boundaries of any departmental regional structure or withany of the eight economic planning regions.202. The first need, therefore, is to rationalise the jungle of boundariesat this intermediate level of government in England. The objective shouldbe to produce one set of standard regional boundaries to which all departments and ad hoc authority regional structures should, if possible, conform. This hasbeen broadly achieved for Scotland and Wales. The difficulties in the way of achieving it for the regions of England should not, therefore, be insuperable.Certainly, a single uniform regional structure is a sine qua non for efficientregional planning. Without it we are in danger of repeating the mistake we made in the nineteenth century, when we developed a proliferation of separatebodies for individual services boards of guardians, health boards, schoolboards, improvement commissioners, and so on. They all had their differentboundaries until in the end they disappeared as separate entities when their functions were absorbed by the multi-purpose local government authorities.203. The second weakness of the English regional structure of governmentis that there is no centre of power in any region where decisions can actuallybe taken in the light of a full review of all the problems of the area. The contrasthere is with Scotland and Wales. Decisions can be, and are, taken in the scottish and Welsh Offices, for example, about the right balance of expenditure in thosecountries as between housing, hospitals, roads, schools and so on. As a resultthere is no doubt that Scotland and Wales are better governed, and with moresensitivity to their needs, than any comparable region in England. The need,therefore, is for similar centres of power and decision-making in the english regions.
204. The third major criticism of this large intermediate level of governmentis that it is not subject to adequate democratic control. This applies to Scotlandand Wales as well as the English regions. And it applies, too, to both the majorcomponents of government which form this intermediate tier the outposts of central government and the ad hoc authorities.205. As far as the ad hoc authorities are concerned, the deficiencies from thepoint of view of democratic control and accountability are obvious: (a) their members are nominated and not elected;(b) even when their nominated membership includes local governmentcouncillors (usually in a minority), the electors in the area can hardlythrough the ballot box hold these councillors responsible for the decisionsof the ad hoc authority concerned;(c) the nominal accountability of these bodies to a Minister or parliament is too remote for their regional decisions to be subject to democraticscrutiny or control by the people in the area most affected by them;(d) where there are consumer councils, they have no power over the decisionsof the ad hoc authority with which they are associated.In short, the people in the area most affected by a particular ad hoc authority&apos;spolicies or plans have no satisfactory means of holding its board accountable to them or participating in its decisions.206. As far as the outposts of central government are concerned, these are,of course, much more subject to ministerial control than the ad hoc authorities.And in that sense there is in theory, therefore, detailed ministerial account-ability to Parliament. But there are obvious weaknesses: (a) There is no Minister in any English region to control, oversee, and beaccountable for the multitude of decisions which civil servants make atthis level.(b) Although in theory civil servants in the English regional outposts are controlled by their Ministers in London who are responsible to Parlia-ment, the Ministers, in practice, cannot exercise any detailed supervision over the large number of decisions made in their name. They simply donot have the time. The most they can cope with is to look (often cursorily)at that small portion of the work of regional offices which is drawn totheir attention by Questions in the House of Commons, letters fromM.P.s, or delegations from local authorities and other organisations.(c) Even in the Scottish and Welsh Offices which are under direct rnini-sterial control, there must be doubts whether their officials are sufficientlyaccountable to the people of Scotland and Wales. Certainly a formerPermanent Secretary in the Welsh Office gave it as his opinion that thesituation left civil servants with too much power.(d) In any event, whatever the extent of ministerial control over the regionaloutposts of central government, the responsibility and accountabilityis to the central institutions of government and not to the people in thearea of the country most intimately affected or concerned.1 Minutes of Evidence I: Wales, page 8 et seq.
So, under present arrangements the people in the different parts of Britain do not directly participate in or control the decision making process of the outposts of central government even though these outposts are frequently accepting orrejecting proposals from elected local authorities. In practice, therefore, thelarge scale devolution of decision making by the central departments ofgovernment to their regional outposts means, particularly for the regions of England, government by bureaucrats.207. We have then, and need an intermediate level of government but reformsare necessary to meet the criticisms set out in the immediately preceding paragraphs. The next step, therefore, is to consider what modifications arenecessary to our system of government as a whole both to meet these particularcriticisms about our intermediate tier of government and to achieve the general objectives and needs set out in the previous chapters.(
A SCHEME FOR DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLIES IN SCOTLAND,WALES AND THE ENGLISH REGIONSIntroduction208. Chapter V demonstrated that we already have a very substantial tierof government and decision-making at an intermediate level between the localauthorities and the central government in Whitehall and Westminster; it iscomposed of the outposts of central government and of the regional organisa-tions of the various ad hoc authorities. Chapter V then reached the conclusionthat this intermediate level of government is not going to disappear. It isfulfilling a very real need. This is quite simply because there are a large numberof important problems and functions which cannot be satisfactorily handledexcept by bodies operating at this level. But Chapter V also reached theconclusion that at this intermediate level: (a) we need in England to rationalise the jungle of boundaries and replace them if possible by one set of standard regional boundaries to whichall departmental and ad hoc regional structures would conform;(b) we need in England to create a centre of power in each region comparable with the Scottish and Welsh Offices, so that decisions can be taken onthe wide range of different functional problems about schools, hospitals,roads, housing, etc., which, together, comprise regional policy and regional strategy;(c) we need in Scotland and Wales and in the regions of England to devisearrangements so that the people in these areas can participate in thedecision-making process and hold those who take decisions fullyaccountable; it should be democratic government, not bureaucraticgovernment.209. To meet the points outlined in paragraph 208 above the approach inthis chapter is to put forward a solution based on the creation of democraticallyelected assemblies to control the intermediate level of government. And here and in the following chapter this is dove-tailed into the changes we have tomake in our system of government as a whole following our membership ofthe Common Market and bearing in mind the grievances and demands of thepeople set out in Chapter II; it also takes full account of the principles and objectives outlined in Chapter IV.General outline of the scheme210. There is no point in setting up assemblies without power. Mere &quot;talkingshops&quot; are more conducive to frustration and delay than to good government.In any event, able men and women can hardly be expected to serve in bodies which are impotent. So any scheme for democratically elected assembliesmust give them real power and authority. That is the essence of this proposal.It envisages the setting-up of six or seven democratically and directly elected assemblies and Governments one for Scotland, one for Wales and one for
each of, say, five English Regions1 and devolving to them very substantialpowers.211. These Assemblies and Governments will: (a) take over the control of, and responsibility for, virtually all the outpostsof central government referred to in Chapter V. Thus, for example, theScottish and Welsh Offices will be detached from Whitehall and West-minster and be placed instead under the full control of Scottish and welsh Assemblies and Governments; and the same would happen tothe other outposts of central government in Scotland and Wales (e.g.the outposts in Scotland and Wales of the Department of Employment,etc.). Similarly, as far as the English regions are concerned, nearly all theoutposts of central government like the Department of the EnvironmentRegional Offices, etc., would be completely detached from their depart-mental headquarters and &quot;hived-off&quot; to be under the control of english regional Assemblies and Governments;(b) take over the functions of the non-commercial, non-industrial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas. Thus, for example, the functions ofthe projected Regional Health Authorities in England would be trans-ferred to the Regional Assemblies and Governments; so would thefunctions of the projected Regional Water Authorities. Similarly inScotland and Wales; the Scottish and Welsh Governments and Assemblieswould take over the functions and responsibilities of all the non-commercial, non-industrial ad hoc authorities operating there;(c) be given some supervisory responsibilities in respect of the variouscommercial and industrial ad hoc authorities (e.g. the Gas Boards,Electricity Boards, etc.);(rf) be responsible for devising policies for the general welfare and good government of their respective areas within the framework of thelegislation and overall policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and government and within the framework too, of any regulations anddirectives j emanating from the European Commission in Brussels. Inthis j general context their duties will not be limited to any specificfunctions or duties conferred on them by Parliament; they will also have a residual competence to act (subject to the kind of consultations with the U.K. Government outlined in paragraph 222 below) for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas;(e) have the power to make &quot;ordinances&quot; or byelaws to give effect to their policies and decisions;(/) have some independent revenue raising powers and sufficient financial&quot;independence&quot; of central government to give them the degree of freedom in carrying out their functions which is here envisaged.212. There will \ be no change in the functions of local governmentauthorities; they will remain broadly as set out in the Local Government Act1972 which covers England and Wales and the Local Government (Scotland)1 The case for five English regions as opposed to the eight recommended in the redcliffe-Maud Report is set out in paragraph 215 of this Chapter; it is also developed inmore detail in Chapter VIII.
Bill. Local authorities, though, will lose their present day-to-day administrativecontacts with the departments of central government; they will deal insteadwith the Government and Assembly in their area. In this connection, it isimportant to stress that they will themselves be directly represented in thisintermediate level of government in accordance with the &quot;inter-locking&quot; principleoutlined in paragraph 132 of Chapter IV; the nature and extent of this repre-sentation is set out in more detail in paragraphs 254 and 255 below.213. The scheme involves far-reaching changes in the structure, organisationand responsibilities of central government. Thus: (a) The following Departments will (with minor exceptions) lose theirregional outposts and local offices (which, of course, will be taken over by the Assemblies and Governments in the areas concerned): (i) The Department of the Environment;(ii) The Department of Employment;(iii) The Department of Health and Social Security;(iv) The Department of Trade and Industry;(v) The Home Office;(vi) The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The main functions of these departments in future will be to evolve newgeneral policy and monitor the operation of existing policies; they willlose their present responsibilities for the day-to-day detailed administra-tion of policy which will be taken over by the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments.(b) Members of Parliament will have a much larger share in the policy-making process than they have at present. This is set out in some detail in Chapter VII.(c) Though not necessarily essential to the scheme, it is envisaged that the composition of the House of Lords will be reformed to give some placesto key members of the Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments.This will enable them to have a share in the central policy-makingprocesses and will thus give effect at this level to the &quot;inter-lockingprinciple&quot; referred to in Chapter IV. It will also help to provide acountervailing force to the natural centralising tendency of any UnitedKingdom Government which otherwise might not be able to resist the temptation to usurp functions better performed at the intermediate level of government.(d) There will be mechanisms to provide at all levels of government morescope for the redress of individual grievances than exists at present.214. The proposed scheme outlined in the preceding paragraphs is a practicalexpression of the principles set out in Chapter IV. In particular it will havethe following main advantages: (a) by detaching the outposts of central government from Whitehall and byrelieving the main departments of government of their day-to-daycontacts with local authorities, this will greatly reduce the burden ofMinisters, departments and M.P.s;
(o) it will enable Ministers and M.P.s to have a bigger and more powerfulrole in the central policy-forming processes and will thus increasedemocratic control at that level;(c) the &quot;freeing&quot; of Ministers and Parliament from much of their detailedadministrative oversight within the United Kingdom will enable them to devote more time and attention to decision making in Brussels and theEuropean institutions of government. When, in the future so manycrucial policies are to be determined by the European Commission andthe Council of Ministers, this will inevitably absorb a great deal of thetime of United Kingdom Ministers and Parliament;(d) it will enable the people of Scotland, Wales and the different regions ofEngland to devise their own policies for, and adapt the general policies of the United Kingdom Government to, the special needs of their areas;(e) it will enable the people of Scotland, Wales and the different regions ofEngland to bring under their democratic control or supervision muchof the bureaucratic decision-making which now takes place in the out-posts of central government and in the ad hoc authorities;(/) it will provide fuller means than are available now for safeguardingindividual rights and for dealing with individual grievances.The extent to which these advantages will be realised can be seen from themore detailed exposition of the scheme set out in the rest of this chapter andin the following chapter.the scheme in detail: the number of assemblies and their functions215. It is envisaged that there will be seven Assemblies and their respective governments one for Scotland, one for Wales and, say, five for the regions of England. The case for five regions for England instead of the more usuallysuggested eight is considered more fully in Chapter VIII. Broadly, it isthat:-(a) the concept of eight regions made sense with the plethora of localauthorities which existed before the present reorganisation; it madesense, too, in the context of the Redcliffe-Maud proposals for sixty-oneunitary authorities. But now that our largest units of local governmentare to consist of the G.L.C. and forty-five counties it would provide amore rational and balanced management structure to group them intofive regions (or even four);(b) it is likely to be easier to fit the various ad hoc authorities into a four or five regional structure than into an eight regional structure.216. The Scottish, Welsh and English Regional Governments and Assemblieswill all have identical powers and broadly similar structures. In each case theGovernment will be responsible to, and be part of, the Assembly, and willhave six main types of function: (a) Policy-making functions.(b) Executive and Administrative functions including the control of thenon-industrial, non-commercial ad hoc authorities.(c) &quot;Agency functions&quot; on behalf of central government.
(d) Responsibilities for the ad hoc authorities.(e) Making appropriate ordinances to carry out the duties at (a) to (c)above.(/) Inspectoral and default functions.These different types of function are set out more fully in the following para-graphs. It might also be advantageous for these intermediate level governments to be given certain quasi-judicial functions; but this would need a separatestudy before a final decision was made on this point. The type of quasi-judicial functions that might be involved here is also set out more fully below.The policy-making function217. All the different Assemblies and Governments will have as their primaryfunction the responsibility for devising policies for the good government andgeneral welfare of the people in their respective areas. This will involve threedifferent types of activity: (a) adapting the legislation and policies of the United Kingdom parliament and Government to the special needs of their areas;(b) recommending to the United Kingdom Government and Parliamentsuch additions to, or changes in, existing legislation and general policiesas appear to be necessary or desirable;(c) producing policies for their areas on matters and issues not covered by united Kingdom legislation or explicit United Kingdom policies.The ingredients of these three different types of policy making are set out inthe following paragraphs together with an indication of the different problems,processes and procedures which each involves.218. To enable the different Assemblies and Governments to adapt the policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government to the special needs of their respective areas it is clearly of crucial importance that generalUnited Kingdom policies should not be prescribed in so much detail by Parlia-ment that such adaptation becomes impossible. The different Assemblies and governments must be left with a substantial area of manoeuvre if their powerto devise their own policies within the framework of general United kingdom legislation is to be meaningful and substantial. The ways of solving this problemare outlined in Chapter VII below. Here the main purpose is to indicate brieflyhow substantial and extensive this range of intermediate level policy-makingcould be. For example, the various Assemblies and Governments would beable to: (a) draw up and regularly modify as necessary a strategic plan for thefuture physical, social and economic development of their area. Thegeneral welfare of any area in the future will be vitally dependent onthe development of their policies for land-use and economic planningwith attendant powers to plan or run their transport systems and todetermine within their area the location of industry, holiday areas,housing estates and new towns;(b) decide on the &quot;right&quot; balance of industry for their areas and so operatewithin the framework of the United Kingdom Distribution of Industry
policy to attract and control the siting of the sort of mix of the different types of industry which they believe is in their interest. In this connection,of course, the United Kingdom legislation would have to prescribeuniform cash inducements for all areas, and determine, too, any areas orregion in which industrial expansion was to be prohibited. But thiswould still leave wide scope for Assembly policy-making;(c) decide what for them from year to year was the right balance of functionalspending in their areas as between roads, hospitals, schools, housing,water, sewerage, etc.;(d) use their financial powers over a public expenditure and taxation to try to ensure that their respective economies were neither &quot;underheated&quot;with excessive unemployment in their area, nor &quot;overheated&quot; withexcessive demand. The way this might operate is set out in Appendix B;(e) decide their own priorities in the implementation of different Acts ofParliament. Thus, for example, they would be able to decide whether itwas in the best interests of their areas to make the fullest possible useof the 1969 Housing Act (which provided for housing improvement grants) at the expense of, say, building new council houses. In this general connection it is interesting to note that in recent years it has beenthe policy of the Welsh Office to put more emphasis on the provision offlats and houses for old people than on the provision of new houses forall. It has also been the policy of the Welsh Office to push Welsh localauthorities hard to clear derelict land (as provided for in the IndustrialDevelopment Act 1966 and the Local Employment Act 1972), but not so hard to spend money on applying the &quot;clean air&quot; provisions of theClean Air Act 1956. These are examples of one type of policy decisionto be taken by the Assemblies envisaged in this scheme;(/) make important policy decisions within the framework of differentActs of Parliament. For example, in the field of education, if UnitedKingdom Government legislation lays down that all state school educa-l tion shall be on comprehensive lines, it could be left to the different areas to decide between the different types of comprehensive system; and,indeed, an Assembly might in fact want to experiment, trying one typein one part of its area and a different type in another.The examples at (a) to (f) above are very far, of course, from being an exhaustivelist of the way the various Assemblies and Governments could devise their ownpolicies within the framework of the general policies and legislation of theGovernment of the United Kingdom. But they are enough to show that theAssemblies and Governments would have very substantial, wide-ranging and important responsibilities here. The welfare and good government of the people in their areas would be very much in their hands.219. As was pointed out in paragraph 217 the Assemblies and governments would also recommend to the United Kingdom Government and Parliamentsuch additions to, or changes in, existing legislation and general policies as appear to be necessary and desirable. For example, if in the view of a particularAssembly the United Kingdom&apos;s legislation and policy on housing neededmodification if the housing problems of that area were to be properly tackled,then the area Government would make the appropriate proposals for change
to the United Kingdom Government. Since the area Governments will be very substantial bodies with real political weight, the central government will,therefore, have to give most serious consideration to their representations.220. The third type of policy making which will be the concern of the variousAssemblies and Governments is more difficult to define. It arises from the basicresponsibility of each area Government for the good government and generalwelfare of the people within its boundaries. Inevitably there will be occasions when an Area has special needs or special aspirations which are not cateredfor either implicitly or explicitly by United Kingdom legislation or general policies. The Area Assembly will therefore have the residual power to deviseand implement (subject to the procedures and safeguards set out in para-graph 222) what it considers to be the appropriate policy for its own area.The precise role of the Welsh language in the life of Wales is a possible example;the Welsh Government and Assembly would devise the policy it wants and itwould then be implemented in Wales by an ordinance passed by the welsh assembly, and without the need for any legislation by the United kingdom parliament. The present separate criminal law of Scotland is another example.But there will be many matters, too, which affect the English regions as well asScotland and Wales. A particular English region, or Scotland or Wales, might,for example, want to apply higher standards to the treatment of effluent in itsarea than is provided for by United Kingdom policies, and be prepared to paythe extra cost; in such a case, and subject to the safeguards and proceduresset out below, it will have the power to do so by its own ordinance and withoutthe need for Parliamentary legislation.221. This residual power to promote the good government and generalwelfare of the people in their respective areas could be very substantial andwide-ranging; it could thus encourage the people to seek to develop and achieve their special aspirations. But there are dangers, too. Unless proper controls and procedures are followed it could result in two highly undesirable consequences: (a) it could produce a very large amount of litigation where an ordinancemight be thought to be in conflict with a United Kingdom statute or statutory instrument and thus be ultra vires;(6) policies adopted by a particular Area government might have undesirableand unacceptable repercussions on neighbouring Areas or for UnitedKingdom policies generally.222. The procedure most likely to obviate the difficulties set out in para-graph 221 involves requiring the different Assemblies and Governments to consult with the United Kingdom Government before promoting any ordinancesto give effect to policy making of the kind referred to in paragraph 217 (c)above and expounded more fully in paragraph 220. Thus an Area Governmentwould submit to the United Kingdom Government its proposed ordinancestogether with an explanatory memorandum; and the prior approval of theUnited Kingdom Government would be required before these draft ordinancescould be put before the Area Assembly for final decision. Though to some people this may seem an excessive restriction on the freedom of action of an intermediate level government, it needs to be stressed that in practice the extentof the restriction will almost certainly turn out to be much less than might
appear in theory. This is because the various Assemblies and governments will be large and powerful bodies with their own substantial political weight;the United Kingdom Government, therefore, will need to have a very compellingcase to be able to resist the reasonable requests of any one of them.Executive and administrative functions223. All the various Assemblies and Governments will have a very wide range of executive and administrative functions. They will be the naturalconsequence of (a) the policy-making functions outlined in paragraphs 217 to 222 above;(b) taking over all the outposts of central government departments referredto in paragraphs 211 (a) and 213 above;(c) taking over the functions of the non-commercial, non-industrial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas (set1 out more fully in paragraphs 233et seq.).Some indication of the extent and variety of these administrative and executive functions is set out in the following paragraphs. There, they are described inthe context of Wales and as the responsibilities of a Welsh Government and assembly; that makes it easier to paint a clearer picture of just what is involved.But Scotland and the English Regions would all have the same range of administrative and executive responsibilities1.224. The Welsh Government and Assembly would take over all the presentoutposts of central government in Wales in accordance with paragraphs 211 (a)and 213 above. This involves taking over both the Welsh Office and also the welsh outposts of those Great Britain Departments (except Defence, customs and Excise, and Inland Revenue) which have established offices in the principality.225. In taking over the Welsh Office, the new Welsh Government and assembly would therefore take over administrative and executive responsibilities which include the following: (a) Housing. The Welsh Office has the responsibility for administering theHousing Acts, the Rent Acts and the Leasehold Reform Act. this involves the consideration of local authority housing schemes forsubsidy and loan sanction and the exercise of quasi-judicial powers2contained in the compulsory purchase and slum clearance provisionsof the Housing Acts and the payment of all grants and subsidies relevant to housing.(b) Water, sewerage and radio-active materials. Here the Welsh Officefunctions include the approval of schemes affecting water conservation,river regulation and capital works for the improvement of supply anddistribution systems; and where it is considered expedient to secure1 The Scottish Assembly and Government would in fact have a still wider range of administrative functions because of the special nature of Scottish law.2 The question of quasi-judicial powers, of course, needs further consideration. see paragraphs 216 and 247.
a more efficient water supply, the Welsh Office can reorganise Welshwater undertakings into more efficient units. The Welsh Office is alsoresponsible for the approval of schemes by local authorities for sewerage and sewage disposal and the awarding of grants for such schemes1;it also handles applications for permission to use radio-active materialsor to dispose of radio-active waste.(c) Other Local Government matters. The Welsh Office is responsible forthe approval of proposals from local authorities to raise loans to buildswimming pools, sports halls, schools and other educational institutions,police houses, community centres, crematoria and council offices, and toprovide cemeteries, refuse tips and playing fields.(d) Local Government Reorganisation. The Welsh Office is responsible for implementing in Wales the new Local Government Act 1972.(e) Roads and Transport. The Welsh Office is responsible for roads andtrunk roads in Wales. This includes the construction, improvement andmaintenance of trunk roads and the allocation of grants to local autho-rities for the construction and improvement of principal roads. The welsh office exercises all those functions connected with roads, including thecontrol of road traffic, which in England are exercised by the Ministerof Transport.(/) Health and Welfare Services. This includes the development of hospital services in Wales, the allocation of finance for the hospital building programme, the development of policies in the local authority health and welfare services such as vaccination, mental health, care of the agedand health centres2.(g) Town and Country Planning. This includes the approval of development or structure plans of the Local Planning Authorities, the designation ofnew towns in Wales and the establishment of development opportunities for them.(A) Primary and Secondary Education. Here the Welsh Office exercisesbroadly the same functions in Wales as the Department of Educationexercises in England. This includes giving approvals for local authorityschool building programmes, etc.(/) Miscellaneous functions including responsibilities for the NationalParks, recreational provision, the clearing of derelict land, arts andculture, forestry, ancient monuments and tourism.Clearly, the above executive and administrative functions are very extensive.They involve the control of expenditure which amounted to just over  400million in 1971/72.226. Besides taking over the administrative and executive responsibilities ofthe Welsh Office, the Welsh Government and Assembly would also take overthe executive and administrative functions of the other main outposts of centralgovernment in Wales (except Defence, Customs and Inland Revenue). Thus1 These water and sewerage responsibilities will, of course, be altered when the proposedreorganisation of water and sewerage services is put into effect.2 There will, of course, be modifications here when the present proposals to reorganisethe health service have been put into effect.
the following departments which have established offices in Wales would transferthem to the Welsh Assembly and Government: The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the Department of Education and science the Department of employment the Home office the Department of Trade and industry the Department of Health and Social Security.The outposts of these Departments in Wales are mainly concerned withadministering the various policies which have been centrally determined. some general indication of what is involved in this is given in paragraph 227 below.227. The administrative and executive work carried on in Wales by theoutposts of the central government departments listed in paragraph 226 above isvaried, detailed and substantial. Together, the non-industrial staffs of these arevery much larger than the staff of the Welsh Office itself. In 1969 they totalledabout 9,000 compared with less than 800 in the Welsh Office.Their duties include the following: (a) The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The staff in the welsh outpost has the responsibility for administering the grant andsubsidy schemes and for providing advisory and veterinary services forfarmers and growers in Wales; they have a substantial delegated authorityto make decisions in individual grant and subsidy cases. The staff also has administrative responsibilities in relation to infestation control, thewages and conditions of agricultural workers and the marketing ofhorticultural products; they also deal with local authorities about their duties concerning the provision and improvement of small-holdings(Part III of the Agriculture Act 1970).(b) The Department of Education and Science. The staff in the Welsh outpostare responsible for dealing with day-to-day matters concerning further education, teacher training and other matters concerning teachers, grants to responsible bodies, the youth service, and grants to voluntary youth organisations and for village halls and community centres in wales.(c) The Department of Employment. Its staff in Wales is under a Controllerwho is responsible to Headquarters in London for the execution of thedepartments policies and agency functions; these include the operationof the network of area and local offices, Government Training centres and Industrial Rehabilitation Units. The local offices help to find jobsfor individuals and help firms to find employees. They can make grants and loans towards costs incurred when workers move from one area toanother. The staff also provide a Youth Employment Service and haveresponsibilities for industrial training and retraining which includesoffering employers a variety of training services at reasonable costs, andoffering individuals who want to prepare for new employment freefull-time training with maintenance allowances.1 Its responsibilities for primary and secondary education in Wales were transferred tothe Welsh Office in 1970.
(d) The Department of Trade and Industry. The staff in Wales are verymuch involved in dealing with industry and local authorities. Theyadminister various types of financial assistance available to industryand have important duties in relation to regional industrialdevelopment and export promotion.(e) The Department of Health and Social Security. The staff in Wales are primarily concerned with administering the National Insurance Scheme,the Family Allowance and Family Income Supplement and Supplement-ary Benefit schemes through their local offices. This involves a large amount of individual case-work and decision making and the running of appeals systems.The descriptions set out above are intended to be illustrative rather thancomprehensive and, for the most part, they refer to the situation in 1969. Theyare intended to indicate the wide range of administrative work and decisionmaking which takes place in these various outposts of central governmentdepartments in Wales affecting individuals, firms, farmers, voluntary bodies,local authorities, etc. And they involve the control of a very substantial degreeof public expenditure which greatly affects the prosperity and lives of the peopleof Wales.228. A Welsh Government and Assembly then, with the policy-makingfunctions outlined in paragraphs 217 to 222, taking over the administrative and executive responsibilities of the Welsh Office (outlined in paragraph 225) andof the other outposts of central government in Wales (outlined in paragraph226) would thus take control of, and create, a very substantial administrativemachine. So, too, would the Assemblies and Governments in Scotland and theEnglish regions as they assumed the same wide range of executive andadministrative functions for their respective areas. Indeed, Scotland and theEnglish regions would in fact all be concerned with a much bigger governmentoperation than their Welsh counterpart since Scotland has twice the populationof Wales, and the English regions on average would have nearly twice thepopulation of Scotland.Agency functions229. An essential feature of this scheme of devolution is that none of themain Departments of central government (except Defence, Customs and excise and Inland Revenue) would have outposts in Scotland, Wales and theEnglish Regions; nor would these central departments normally have any direct and day-to-day administrative contacts with local authorities, individuals ororganisations in the different parts of the United Kingdom. As indicated inparagraphs 223 to 228 above, those administrative and executive functions willbe taken over by the Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments whichwould assume full responsibility for them. However, in the provision of, or administration of, certain services the case for administrative uniformitythroughout the whole of the United Kingdom might be so strong that in thesecases the intermediate level governments ought to be left with little or no areaof administrative discretion in their decision making. In these instances the intermediate level governments would act as the agents of central government
in the provision of, or administration of, the services concerned1. The adminis-tration of prisons and social security benefits are two possible examples where this agency concept might operate; and the various implications of the conceptwill become evident in the general discussion of these examples in the following two paragraphs.230. As far as the administration of prisons is concerned, it could be argued that there must be absolute uniformity throughout the whole of the UnitedKingdom. Thus the same detailed rules governing prisoners&apos; behaviour, and privileges (e.g. receiving and writing letters, exercise, use of transistors, etc.),and standard of food should not vary between the same type of prison indifferent parts of the United Kingdom. In this instance, therefore, the HomeOffice would maintain its present responsibilities not only for the generalUnited Kingdom penal policy but also for producing the detailed rules and regulations governing the day-to-day operation of prisons. If this case is sus-tained (though there could be contrary arguments), then the intermediate level governments would act as agents of the central government for the administra-tion of the prisons in their area. Thus the central government would financeprison administration by a separate ear-marked grant to each intermediate level government. The intermediate level government would have the respon-sibility for seeing that the detailed instructions and regulations about prisonswere properly applied by the prisons in their area. And individual case-workinvolving prisoners&apos; complaints, etc. would, in the last analysis, go back to theHome Office and the Home Secretary if it could not be settled within anydiscretionary authority the Home Office saw fit to give to the intermediate level governments.231. The provision of the various social security benefits is another service which, it might be argued, should be administered in a uniform way and subjectto uniform detailed rules throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. If thisis accepted, then this is another case in which the intermediate level governments would act as the agents of central government. And certainly, apart fromsupplementary benefits, there&apos;s a strong case for uniformity throughout theUnited Kingdom in the amounts of cash benefits and the precise rules governingentitlement; there could be little, if any, independent administrative discretionfor intermediate level governments here. And in any event, there are obviousadvantages in the individual contribution records being maintained at onecomputerised centre covering all United Kingdom citizens. Even so, in acting as agents of central government and applying detailed central governmentrules in the administration of the various social security benefits, the inter-mediate level governments could with advantage be left a good deal of discretionon such questions as the siting of social security offices in their areas, theirhours of opening, the type and quality of staff to be provided. So, in this example,the Department of Health and Social Security would remain responsible not only for general social security policy but also for prescribing in detail the amounts of benefit and the precise rules governing eligibility; and while a lot of theindividual case work would be handled by the intermediate level government within the same rules and the same discretionary authority as is now allowed1 Where the service concerned is not primarily for the inhabitants of that particular area(e.g., immigration controls) would be another category of function for which the agencyconcept might be appropriate.
to the departments regional offices, nevertheless the Minister would still remainultimately responsible to Parliament for all decisions made about individual cases. The Department of Health and Social Security would also, of course,provide the intermediate level governments with all the funds paid out in cash benefits. As far as the costs of staff, administration and offices are concerned,there would be a specific central government grant for this based on what theDepartment of Health and Social Security believed was reasonable office and staff facilities for the area concerned. If an intermediate government wishedto provide more social security offices with better staffs than allowed for in the specific grant, it would be able to do so from its own financial resources or atthe expense of some other service it was providing. Equally, it would also beable, if it so wished to spend less on social security offices than was expected by the Department in which case the surplus part of the specified grant couldbe used for other purposes by the intermediate level government concerned.232. This concept of a subordinate authority acting as an agent of centralgovernment is not, of course, a new one. Local authorities perform certainfunctions now as agents of government departments; examples are the building of some roads and the issue of certain licences. The Northern Ireland Ministryof Agriculture acted as the agent of the Whitehall Ministry in the administrationof agricultural price support measures. In West Germany, too, some federallaws are administered by the Lander as agents of the federal government.However, since in the context in which we are considering it, its purpose is toreduce the discretionary authority of the intermediate level government for theservice concerned, it should be used as sparingly as possible.Responsibilities for the ad hoc authorities233. The responsibilities which the Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments and assemblies will have for the ad hoc authorities will vary according to the functions of the authorities. This is again best illustrated by reference to the ad hoc authorities operating in Wales. But it applies also, ofcourse, to Scotland and the English regions.234. There are at least fifty ad hoc authorities now operating in Wales.They include such bodies as the Welsh Hospital Board, the Wales Gas Board,the Broadcasting Council for Wales, the Glamorgan River Authority, the mid-Wales Development Corporation, the Welsh Council and the WelshArts Council. Together they perform a wide variety of different functions.But they all have one essential characteristic in common; they are all nominated,not elected, bodies.235. The different responsibilities which it is suggested the Welsh Governmentshould have for these ad hoc authorities will be determined by the functionsthey perform. Classifying them according to their primary function, the ad ad hoc authorities can be grouped into five different categories: (a) Those which are mainly executive providing personal or social services(e.g., the Welsh Hospital Board). Here the funds are derived mainly from government rather than mainly from the &quot;consumers&quot; of the service.They are not expected to operate on a commercial basis.(b) Those which are mainly industrial or commercial (e.g., the Wales gas board, the South Wales Electricity Board). They are, of course,
&quot;executive&quot; bodies in that they provide services. But they are expectedto operate on a commercial basis. Their revenue from sales is expectedto cover the cost of all or most of the service provided.(c) Those which are mainly advisory (e.g., the Welsh Council, the SportsCouncil for Wales).(d) Those with appellate functions (e.g., the Rent Assessment Panel for wales, Rent Tribunals).(e) Those designed for Consumer Protection (e.g., Transport Users&apos;Consultative Committee for Wales, Electricity Consultative Council).236. As far as the non-commercial executive authorities are concerned(paragraph 235 (a) above), these would be completely taken over by the WelshGovernment which would thus, for example, assume direct responsibility forthe running of the Welsh Hospital and Health Service within the framework of the United Kingdom Health Service policy. With the projected reorganisation of the Health Service described in Chapter V1, the &quot;Regional Health Authority&quot;responsibilities to be conferred on the Secretary of State for Wales wouldinstead be conferred on the Welsh Government and Assembly; and the eightArea Health Authorities would then become directly responsible to thedemocratically elected Government of Wales.237. The relationship between the Welsh Government and the industrial or commercial ad hoc authorities (paragraph 235 (b) above) must be conditionedby the fact that these authorities are in effect the regional organisations of nationalised industries which are expected to operate on a United Kingdombasis and which are responsible to a United Kingdom Minister and Parliament.It would not make sense, therefore, to break them up into independent regionalentities to be separately controlled by intermediate level governments bearing that mind too, the possible effect of this on profitability of each industry as awhole. However, in accordance with the principles enunciated in Chapter IV,the Welsh Government and Assembly must be able to have some voice in thedecisions of the commercial ad hoc authorities which operate within itsboundaries. This could be achieved as follows: -(a) While the United Kingdom Government would continue to beresponsible for the appointment of the Chairman and a proportion ofthe Board Members, the Welsh Government could have the power toappoint the rest.(b) Each board might be required to submit an annual report to the WelshGovernment which would be subject to scrutiny and debate in the welsh assembly.(c) The Welsh Assembly could set up a special committee to subject these various ad hoc authorities operating in Wales to periodic scrutiny; the analogy here would be Parliaments Select Committee on the nationalised industries.(d) The Welsh Government would not have the power to give directions tothe various ad hoc authorities; but it would be able, of course, to make representations both to the United Kingdom Headquarters of the industry
concerned and to the appropriate United Kingdom Ministry wheneverit believed an ad hoc authority was not following policies in the best interests of Wales.Arrangements and procedures along the lines of (a) to (d) above would undoubtedly go a long way towards ensuring that these commercial andindustrial authorities were properly responsive to the needs and views of thepeople of Wales.238. The various advisory ad hoc authorities (paragraph 235 (c) above)would be appointed by the Welsh Government to which, of course, they wouldchannel their advice. It might well be that the functions of some (if not most)of them could be taken over by committees of the Welsh Assembly with suchco-opted members as may be necessary. Certainly, for example, the job of the welsh Council which now advises the Secretary of State for Wales, ought to bedone by a committee of the Welsh Assembly (with co-opted members as necessary) which would make its recommendations to the Welsh assembly and Government.239. As far as the appellate bodies are concerned (paragraph 235 (d) above),their members could be nominated by the Welsh Government and an annual report on their work might be submitted to the Welsh Assembly.240. The members of the Consumer Protection bodies (paragraph 235 (e)above) could also be appointed by the Welsh Government. Besides the irrepresentations to the nationalised industry concerned, they should also beable to present their views to the Welsh Assembly; and their voice would be strengthened by the arrangements set out in paragraph 237 above.241. The arrangements outlined in paragraphs 233 to 240 above should ensure that the functions of the ad hoc authorities now operating in Walesare either brought fully under the democratic control of the Welsh people or are carried out with a much greater sensitivity to the views of those affectedby them. Applying similar arrangements to Scotland and the English regions would, therefore, mark a major advance in the cause of democracy.Making ordinances242. The Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments and Assemblieswill have power to make ordinances which, in many respects will be similarto the bye-law making power of local authorities. Under the Local Government(England and Wales) Act, 1972, district councils and London borough councils&quot;may make bye-laws for the good rule and government of the whole or anypart of the district or borough as the case may be, and for the prevention andsuppression of nuisances therein&quot;1. Before these local authorities can makebye-laws they have to give at least one month&apos;s public notice and before thebye-law becomes effective it has to be approved by the appropriate departmentof central government. Local authority bye-laws can, of course, be challengedin the Courts on grounds of ultra vires.1 Local Government (England and Wales) Act 1972, Section 235.
243. The precise nature of the ordinance-making power to be conferred on theScottish, Welsh and English regional governments has to be considered againstthe two broad categories of business for which it will be required. An inter-mediate level government may need to make ordinances: (a) to implement the legislation and policies of the United KingdomGovernment and, where necessary, to adapt them to the special needsof its area;(b) to give effect to its residual power to produce policies for the good government and general welfare of the people in the area on matters and issues not covered by United Kingdom legislation or explicit UnitedKingdom policies.The ordinance-making power and procedures of intermediate level governments will need to be different for each of these categories. They are, therefore, dealtwith separately in the next two paragraphs.244. Much of the policy making which falls into the category at 243 (a) above will not, of course, require ordinances as will be evident from the examplesgiven in paragraph 218 above. And since the limited number of ordinanceswhich may be required are by definition within the range of policy options oradaptations envisaged by the relevant United Kingdom statute, then there seemsno reason why ordinances of this kind should need the prior approval of theUnited Kingdom Government. Provided, therefore, that the intermediate level governments give adequate public notice of their proposed ordinances of this type, they should become effective from the date they are approved by theAssembly. They will, of course, be open to challenge in the courts on grounds of ultra vires.245. As was pointed out in paragraph 221 above, the residual powers of intermediate level governments to produce policies for the good governmentand general welfare of the people in their areas could be very substantial. thus it was suggested in that paragraph that an unrestricted power to pass theappropriate ordinances could result in excessive litigation as well as have otherconsequences which would not be conducive to the good government of theUnited Kingdom as a whole. Accordingly, it was there envisaged that ordinancesfalling into this category would require the prior approval of the UnitedKingdom Government before they became effective. It must again be stressed,however, in this context that this requirement is not likely to be an undulysevere restriction on the freedom of action of the intermediate level governments.This is because they will be large and powerful bodies with their own substantialpolitical weight; the United Kingdom Government, therefore, will need to havea very compelling case to be able to resist the reasonable requests of any oneof them.Inspectoral and default functions246. An important function of an intermediate level government will be toensure that the various local authorities are adequately fulfilling their statutoryduties where they are the executive arm for implementing United Kingdompolicies. Accordingly they will have inspectoral functions similar to those now exercised by central government. And they will also need general default powers;
the model here could be the default power conferred on the Minister of Educa-tion by the 1944 Education Act. There, default power is conferred on theMinister in the following terms: &quot;If the Minister is satisfied, either upon complaint by any person interestedor otherwise, that any local authority . . . have failed to discharge any duty imposed upon them by or for the purpose of this Act, the minister may make an Order declaring the Authority to be in default in respect ofthat duty, and giving such directions for the purpose of enforcing theexecution thereof as appeared to the Minister to be expedient; and suchdirection shall be enforceable, on an application made on behalf of theMinister, by mandamus.&quot;So the intermediate level governments would have similar default powers with regard to all obligations laid on local authorities either by themselves orby the central government.Quasi-judicial functions247. United Kingdom Ministers are now frequently the ultimate point ofappeal in various disputes where the decisions of local or ad hoc authorities arechallenged by individuals or other parties affected. For example, the Secretaryof State for the Environment decides various kinds of appeal against decisionsof local planning authorities, including appeals against the refusal of planning permission; he decides, too, appeals against any refusals by river authoritiesto allow discharges to be made into rivers or streams. Similarly, theSecretary of State for Education and Science is the point of appeal in any dispute between a local education authority and a parent over the particularschool his child should attend. Since one of the objectives of the changes toour system of government being proposed in this chapter is to reduce the burdens on United Kingdom Ministers and the central departments of govern-ment, this is a strong argument (even were there no other) for relieving them ofquasi-judicial functions of this type so that they can have more time to con-concentrate on major matters of policy. This whole question, therefore, ought to be reviewed to determine whether at least some of these functions could be handedover to the intermediate level governments; and consideration could also begiven to providing for an appeal beyond that level to some special adminis-trative appellate tribunal.the scheme in detail: the main institutions of the intermediate levelgovernments248. The main new institutions of each intermediate level government willbe an Assembly, an Executive and an Ombudsman. Details about their powers,the composition of the Assembly and their working relationships are set put inthe following paragraphs. It is an important part of the scheme that the workingrelationship between the Executive and the Assembly should follow the presentlocal government model rather than the Whitehall/Westminster system. This is because one of the main objectives of the scheme is to provide the fullest possiblescope for participation in the decision-making processes. Thus the minorityparty or parties must be able to have a proportionate share in the shaping of theExecutive^ policies and decisions. So we must avoid a situation at this level ofgovernment in which the majority party for the time being takes total control
of the Executive (as in the Whitehall/Westminster model) and also cuts off the minority from direct access to civil servants and government departments.The Assembly249. There will be a single chamber Assembly of about 100 members. Theywill be elected on the single transferable vote system of proportional representa-tion. This is so we can be sure that minorities will be fully represented which isparticularly important in those areas where recent voting patterns suggestone party could be in a &quot;perpetual&quot; majority.250. The election of members of the Assembly will be for a fixed term of four years1. The leader of the majority party in the Assembly will be designated&quot;Chairman of the Executive&quot;. The proceedings of the Assembly should beopen to the press (including radio and television) and the public.251. Members of the Assembly would not necessarily be expected to devotethe whole of their time to Assembly duties. However, calls on their time would eventually be much greater than is now involved in membership of localgovernment authorities. Accordingly, members of the Assembly should be paidan &quot;attendance allowance&quot; for each day spent on Assembly business includingattendance at meetings of the Assembly&apos;s committees. The &quot;attendance allow-ance&quot; should be such that those members whose Assembly and Executive dutiesamounted to a full time occupation would in effect be in receipt of an appropriateprofessional salary. The &quot;Chairman of the Executive&quot;, who would certainly be fully engaged on intermediate level government business, would have anadditional allowance or salary to mark his special responsibilities.The Executive252. The Executive of each intermediate level government will consist of anumber of functional departments or divisions staffed by the authority&apos;s owncivil servants (see paragraph 260 below). There will be departments or divisions for such functions as Finance, Education, Health and Social Security, the environment, etc. In effect there will be a functional department or divisionmatching each of the main departments of central government in those fieldsfor which the intermediate level government has responsibility.253. Each department or division will be controlled by a committee drawn from the membership of the Assembly. The Chairman of each Committee willbe nominated by the majority party and the Vice-Chairman by the chiefminority party. The party composition of each committee will reflect the balanceof party strengths in the Assembly as a whole. The relationship between eachcommittee and its department or division will be broadly similar to that which now exists in local government. In this context it is important that the minorityon a committee should have the same access to the department&apos;s or divisionsofficials as the Committee Chairman and members of the majority party.1 Any necessary by-elections would, of course, have to take place on either the alternativevote system of proportional representation or on the relative majority system now used in central and local government elections.
254. It is an important part of the scheme that some of the elected membersof the County Councils and District Councils in the area should also sit as members of the functional committees of the intermediate level authority.This is to give effect to the &quot;inter-locking&quot; principle referred to in Chapter IV.Clearly, it is of crucial importance that the decisions taken by intermediate level governments should have full regard to the problems and interests of localauthorities. And the best way of ensuring this is to have some of the keyrepresentatives of those local authorities on the intermediate level functionalcommittees.255. The proposal in paragraph 254 to give effect to the &quot;inter-locking&quot;principle is in fact similar to the practice now adopted by many county councils.They have co-opted as additional members of their functional committeesrepresentatives from the non-county boroughs and from the urban and rural districts. It appears to have worked well. To apply the pattern to the intermediate level governments along the lines suggested in paragraph 254, perhaps the right course would be to give the counties and districts the right to nominate up to a quarter of the membership of each of the intermediate level governmentsfunctional committees; no doubt the counties and districts would then decide which of their own functional committee chairmen should be chosen to servealso on the appropriate intermediate level functional committees.256. It will also be open to an intermediate level government to co-opt as members of its functional committees any person it believes has the qualifications and experience to assist the committees in their work.257, In the interests of democratic control it is important that the proceedingsof these functional committees should normally be open to the press (includingradio and television) and the public.258. In addition to the functional committees referred to in paragraph 253above, each intermediate level government will also normally have an ExecutiveCommittee or Policy Committee. This will consist of the Chairman of theExecutive and the Chairmen of the main functional Committees. The PolicyCommittee or Executive Committee will in effect be the Cabinet of the inter-mediate level government. Its main function will be to provide a forum wheremembers of the majority party can frankly discuss alternative policies. Theappropriate officials of the intermediate level government would attend meetingsof the Executive or Policy Committee to offer professional advice and comment on the feasibility of alternative strategies. It is important that the reports and advice of these officials should be available to the minority parties as well.259. If there is to be a reform of the House of Lords along the lines envisaged in paragraph 213 (c) above, then the Chairman of each intermediate levelgovernment would also be a member of the reformed Second Chamber at westminster and so would the Chairmen of their functional committeestogether with a proportion of the members of the minority party or parties.It is envisaged that altogether some twenty-five members of each intermediate level government would, as long as they were members of that government,also be members of a reformed House of Lords. And they would reflect theparty balance of their respective governments. The case for this and the purposesit would serve are set out in Chapter VII.
260. Each intermediate level government will have its own Civil Service. Itssalary structure and grades will match the U.K. pattern. It will be open for civil Servants in an intermediate level government to apply for posts in White-hall, with other intermediate level governments, or with any local authorities(and vice versa). The analogy here is with local government, where broadlythere is a national uniformity in grades and salaries; the onus is on individualsto shape their own careers by seeking different posts in different authorities atappropriate times. Making it possible for officials to move in this way betweenthe three main levels of government should help to provide more experienced,and therefore more responsive, administration than might otherwise be possible.The Ombudsman261. The scheme of devolution which is being outlined in this chapter has two main objectives. Primarily it is designed to counter the serious erosion which hastaken place in the extent to which we as a people govern ourselves; and the institutional system so far developed should make a major contribution to that end. The achievement of this first objective, however, will not be enough in itselfto meet a second defect in our present system of government set out in the analysisin Chapter I the inadequacy of the existing means of investigation and redresswhere an individual has a grievance or complaint about his treatment at thehands of bureaucracy. So in each intermediate level government there will need to be an Ombudsman. He will need wider powers and terms of reference thanthose of the present British Parliamentary Commissioner. Here the model mightwell be the New Zealand Ombudsman. This would mean that for the Ombuds-man associated with each intermediate level government :-(a) there would be provision for direct access to him by members of thepublic (this would be in contrast to the present situation in centralgovernment where, of course, only M.P.S can refer a complaint to theOmbudsman);(b) he would not be limited to the question of &quot;maladministration&quot;. TheNew Zealand Ombudsman can report on &quot;unreasonable&quot; actions by government departments; each intermediate level government Ombuds-man should have similar terms of reference and thus should be able to look at the merits of a decision and to recommend redress where any decision seems to him to be unreasonable in the light of all the factspresented.And the ambit of each Ombudsman&apos;s responsibilities will need to cover notonly individual complaints against the intermediate level government itself,but also against the local authorities in the area and all those who are concernedwith the provision of public services including, for example, the health serviceand the police. Here, it simply needs to be stressed that when public officialsinevitably have an increasingly important role to play in the running of acomplex modern state, the individual needs a powerful watchdog which canbark and bite on his behalf if he feels his rights have been infringed or hiscomplaints have been inadequately and unsympathetically dealt with. In this general context an Ombudsman at intermediate government level is a crucialelement in securing the willing consent of the citizen to the acts of government.
the scheme in detail&apos;. financial considerations262. We now turn to the question of finance. Clearly it is crucial to devise a financial scheme to match the political and constitutional scheme presented in the earlier sections of this chapter. The essential objective of such a financialscheme must be to give each intermediate level government as much financial independence from the U.K. Government as is possible while at the same time: (a) maintaining the essential economic unity of the United Kingdom;(b) enabling the U.K. Government to manage the U.K. economy with thetwin objectives of promoting economic growth and maintaining asatisfactory balance of payments.263. In fact there are a number of different possible financial schemes that could accompany our proposals for democratic Assemblies in Scotland, wales and the English regions. The financial proposals put forward by the majorityof our colleagues offer possible ingredients. One of us1 puts forward for publicconsideration the scheme set out in Appendix B; it envisages a high degree ofeconomic planning so that intermediate level governments can make thefullest possible use of their resources. Here, however, we present in more general terms a scheme which might provide a framework for a more neutral approach.We deal separately with income, expenditure and procedures. A separate note on the general problems of devising the appropriate financial model is at appendix A2.Income264. On the income side, one firm guide-line follows from the spirit, if notnecessarily from the letter, of our political and constitutional proposals. Thisis that, even if it is technically possible to finance intermediate level governmentssimply by a grant from the United Kingdom Government (and still leave themcompletely free to determine their own patterns of expenditure), we neverthelessbelieve that these governments should have some independent revenue raisingpowers. The possession and exercise of these powers will, we believe, fosteramong the people in these areas both a sense of independence of centralgovernment and a sense of extra involvement in their own affairs. We also thinkit is important that their independent sources of revenue should be flexibleenough to enable the income of intermediate level governments to grow in line with their expenditure responsibilities.265. &quot;Candidates&quot; for inclusion in a list of taxes which could both be raisedindependently of the United Kingdom Government by each intermediate levelgovernment and which would have a flexible yield are: (a) A supplementary income tax on individuals resident or working in itsarea.(b) A low-rate ad valorem retail sales tax in addition to nationally leviedexcise duties and VAT.(c) Taxes on vehicles and fuel consumption such as the vehicle excise duty and petrol tax, which could be transferred from the central government.1 Lord Crowther-Hunt.2 Appendix A is by Professor Peacock.
266. In addition to having independent taxing powers, an intermediate level ofgovernment might also receive a share of taxes levied by the United KingdomGovernment. For example, it might be allocated a fixed percentage of a particulartax such as the income tax.267. Independent and shared taxes do not take account of the differing fiscalcapacities of intermediate level governments to finance their own spending.Consequently, these levels of government will be entitled to receive income byway of a general grant from the U.K. government. The grant will be basedon an equalisation formula which will reflect both their fiscal capacity and alsothe differential cost of providing the services they undertake.268. An intermediate level of government will also be able to raise loans.It might also be given taxing and subsidy powers which enables it to improve the allocation of resources in its area, such as tax and subsidy measures designedto control pollution and to regulate the use of the transport system. Finally,intermediate levels of government could have the power to raise revenue bylotteries and by levies on betting and gaming.269. Subordinate public authorities in the area of each intermediate levelgovernment i.e. local authorities and all those concerned with the provisionof public services (except the nationalised industries) will derive their income from their own revenues (e.g. rates) and from the intermediate level governmentwhich, as far as the local authorities are concerned, will distribute moneyalong the lines of the present rate support grant system. These subordinatebodies will have no direct financial dealings with the United KingdomGovernment.Expenditure270. Much of the expenditure in the area of an intermediate level governmentwill, of course, be by the various local authorities. But there will also be a gooddeal of direct expenditure by the intermediate level government itself on such services as health, water and trunk roads, etc. Figures illustrating the relativemagnitudes of likely expenditure at these two levels are given in Appendix A.271. In our view, the main ingredients of the expenditure side of any financialscheme must be: (a) the local authorities must have the maximum freedom to determinetheir own spending patterns;(b) the United Kingdom Government must not normally control the pattern of functional spending in the area of an intermediate level govern-ment; this should be left to the determination of the intermediate levelgovernment. The central government should have ultimate control onlyover the total amount of spending by intermediate level governments;(c) the United Kingdom Government should have no direct financialdealings with any local authorities nor with any other bodies or authoritiesbelow the intermediate government level.The general procedures which would be needed to give effect to this are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Procedures272. Each year each intermediate level government would carry out itsown Public Expenditure Survey (on the lines of the present United KingdomP.E.S.C. exercise). Thus, for example, the Education Committee of an inter-mediate level government would estimate the expenditure it needs in the nextyear for its educational policies with provisional estimates for the succeedingfour years. These estimates (as with P.E.S.C.) will include both current and capital expenditure. In the course of producing these estimates the Chairmanof the Education Committee would, of course, have detailed discussions withthe local authorities in his area so that he is fully aware of their needs. Naturally,the Chairman would also have discussions with the Department of education and Science in London, but it is important that the United Kingdom Ministerof Education should not normally have the power to impose his views on theChairman of any intermediate level education committee. All the other inter-mediate level chairmen of the different functional committees would build up their estimates in a similar way. The intermediate level government would then consider the estimates of its functional committees and finally agree on thetotal proposed expenditure and its provisional allocation between the differentfunctional committees.273. The intermediate level government would then submit its estimates tothe U.K. Treasury indicating what proportion of the forecast expenditure willbe met by: (a) the income derived from the U.K. Government by way of the equalisationgrant;(b) the income derived from the independently levied taxes;(c) loans;(d) the income derived from the intermediate level governments&apos; share of u.K. taxes.274. In finally approving the Estimates of the intermediate level governments the U.K. Government would need to satisfy itself that: id) the aggregate demand on real resources is acceptable;ib) there is no objection to the broad distribution of that demand among thedifferent economic categories (e.g. that it will not put an impossiblestrain on U.K. road making industry);(c) that the proposed functional spending pattern will enable an intermediate level government to carry out the various responsibilities placed on it bythe United Kingdom Government.275. The U.K. Government will have the power to: id) impose a global percentage cut on an intermediate level governmenfsestimate of expenditure;ib) insist that a greater proportion of proposed expenditure be met fromrevenue.It will then be for the intermediate level government to make its own decision as to how this should be reflected in the pattern of its functional expenditure
and in the taxes under its own control. The central government would not normally be expected to seek to alter the pattern of functional expenditureproposed by an intermediate level government.Financial conclusion276. As we have said there are a number of possible financial schemes which could fit our proposals for democratically elected Assemblies in Scotland,Wales and the English regions. The immediately preceding paragraphs have outlined one possible approach which would give the intermediate level govern-ments the degree of financial independence they require if they are to achieve their full potential. The financial schemes put forward by the majority of our colleagues also offer possible ingredients. Here, though, we wish to emphasise that we fundamentally oppose one of the ingredients they suggest their concept of an independent Exchequer Board to determine the allocation of financial resources between central and intermediate level governments; we see that asthe removal from the democratic process of an issue which, perhaps above all others, should be the product of democratic accountability. Finally, we believethat the financial scheme put forward in Appendix B should also be seriously considered. It has been specially designed both to give intermediate level governments the maximum possible degree of independence and at the sametime involves a very high degree of economic planning at both the central and intermediate levels of government. In the end the choice to be made heredepends as much on political values as on economic and financial judgment.general conclusion277. It is important to stress that the democratically elected Assemblies and governments proposed in this chapter would not mean the creation of yet another tier of government in the United Kingdom. Essentially they would bea means of subjecting to democratic control a tier of government that already exists. At the same time they would undoubtedly develop a powerful momentumof their own as they set about providing for the general welfare and good government of the people in their areas; they have a latent potential whichcould reinvigorate our whole governmental system.278. It is also important to stress that we do not expect the whole of thescheme we have outlined in this chapter to be fully implemented in a singleoperation. In our view it would need to be developed by stages and over anumber of years. We set out our specific proposals for a phased implementation of our scheme in Chapter VIII The Mechanics of Change.279. Though the proposals we have put forward in this chapter are in ourview an essential ingredient of any scheme of reform to meet the various require-ments set out in previous chapters, they will not by themselves be enough.1 We make no specific recommendation about Northern Ireland. The scheme hererecommended could be extended to include Northern Ireland. Alternatively, the scheme in theGovernments Northern Ireland Bill could easily be dove-tailed into the overall structure ofgovernment here proposed. In fact, under either alternative the people of Northern ireland would probably have in practice substantially the same amount of devolved power thoughthe two schemes appear to be very different from each other.
We also need to make important changes in central government. In part,these changes are the necessary consequence of the scheme we have devolped in this chapter. In part, too, they are needed to adapt our central institutionsto cope with the full implications of our membership of the Common Market.Fundamentally, though, we cannot counter the legitimate discontents outlined in Chapter II and achieve the objectives summarised in Chapter IV without making important changes in the way we conduct our business at Whitehalland Westminster. The changes needed here are set out in the next chapter.
THE NEW ROLE AND STRUCTURE OF PARLIAMENT AND THECENTRAL    INSTITUTIONS    OF    GOVERNMENT-AND    OTHERDESTRABLE CHANGES IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMIntroduction280. If we are to counter the decline in the extent to which we as a peoplegovern ourselves and meet the other major criticisms which have been outlined in earlier chapters, far-reaching changes in the institutions of central govern-ment are at least as important as the creation of democratic assemblies inScotland, Wales and the English regions. There are four main reasons for this: (a) The devolution of power to Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments will inevitably have profound consequences for the opera-tion of the central machinery of government.(b) We need, anyway, substantially to reduce the burdens on central govern-ment if it is to operate efficiently and effectively.(c) Our central institutions of government will have to be modified if theyare to cope adequately and democratically with the full implications ofthe new Common Market dimension.(d) Without substantial changes in our central institutions of government it will not be possible to meet the principles and objectives outlined in chapter IV and to give the people or their representatives the full share in major policy making which they rightfully demand in a mature moderndemocracy.281. Though there are, therefore, four main reasons for reforming ourcentral institutions of government, they all have the same basic objective. we need to restore to Parliament, and in particular to the elected representatives ofthe people, the power to control the Executive. This involves very much morethan the post-facto scrutiny and criticism of policy decisions. It means that parliament must have a full share in the formative stages of major policy making.The rejuvenation of Parliament, therefore, is the focal point of the changeswe need to make in our central machinery of government. However, this can best be seen in its proper perspective if we deal first with the changes in thecentral Executive which must follow both from the scheme of devolution out-^ lined in Chaper VI and also from the implications of United Kingdom member-ship of the Common Market.The United Kingdom Executive282. As was pointed out in Chapter III all our main departments of govern-ment will have added responsibilities as a result of Common Market member-ship. Initially, of course, the new burdens will be greater in some departmentsthan others. But, as we move towards the &quot;European Union&quot; set as the &quot;majorobjective&quot; for this decade1, there can be little doubt that every major depart-ment will become more and more involved in the Brussels scene.1 The Parish Communique, 20th October, 1972. See Chapter III, paragraphs 91 and 92.
283. It may well be necessary to follow the French example and create within our central machinery of government a new organisation to co-ordinate thework of departments on Community questions1. If we do have a new &quot;mini&quot;department of this kind2, it should probably become part of a Prime-MinisterialDepartment which is now so much needed if the Prime Minister is to have adequate Civil Service backing to match that of his Cabinet colleagues. The otherconstituent parts of such a Prime Ministerial Department could be: (a) The Central Policy Review Staff with its responsibilities for long termstrategic thinking and evaluation of long-term policy options.(b) The present Cabinet Office staff.(c) The Civil Service Department.id) Part of the Treasury.A change along these lines would produce the strong central core of governmentwhich is needed not only to secure British interests in the Common Market, butalso to produce effective co-ordination in all matters between our majorfunctional departments of government.284. Whether or not the central core of government develops along the linesenvisaged in paragraph 283 there is no doubt that increasingly in the future themain concern of the chief functional departments of central government willbe with major policy making in a European context. It is here that the scheme outlined in Chapter VI for democratic Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions dove-tails into the new demands of the Common Marketdimension. For one essential feature of the scheme is that the main &quot;home&quot;departments will shed a substantial part of their current responsibilities.285. This load-shedding will, as was pointed out in Chapter VI, mainly affectthe following departments: Environment, Employment, Education, Health and social Security, Trade and Industry, Agriculture and Fisheries, and the HomeOffice. There are four main types of current departmental activity which willbe shed: id) Direct controls over local authorities by loan sanctions, approval ofschemes, approval of education plans, housing plans, etc. All necessarycontrols over local authorities will be assumed by Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments.ib) Responsibility for all executive ad hoc authorities operating in Scotland,Wales and the English regions (except the nationalised industries).(c) Responsibility for direct executive and administrative action withinScotland, Wales and the English regions e.g., for administering agri-cultural grant and subsidy schemes, and for providing and runningsocial security offices, employment exchanges, transport licensing authorities, road construction units, etc.1 See Chapter III, paragraph 109.2 And we can perhaps already see it in embryo in the special co-ordinating responsibilitiesgiven to Mr. John Davies in November, 1972.3 This is in line with the thinking of Sir Richard Clarke in his book &quot;New Trends inGovernment&quot;.
(d) Possibly some quasi-judicial functions e.g., as the ultimate point ofappeal in disputes between individuals and public authorities1.286. It needs to be re-emphasised here that an essential feature of the schemeis that the home departments referred to in paragraph 285 will lose completelytheir regional organisations and regional and local offices. And as far as Scotlandand Wales are concerned, not only will the present Scottish and Welsh Officesbe taken over by the new Scottish and Welsh Governments, so also will any ofthe other outposts of central government in Scotland and Wales now maintained by any of the departments listed in paragraph 285. This means that the central departments of government listed in paragraph 285 will no longer: (a) have any of their present voluminous contacts with local authorities or individual citizens2;(b) carry out any direct executive or administrative functions in Scotland,Wales or the English regions.Their future internal contacts will be almost entirely with the intermediate level governments.287. After the load-shedding described in paragraphs 285 and 286, thesecentral departments of government will then have the following main responsi-bilities and functions: (a) to consider what changes are necessary in existing United Kingdompolicies to meet present and likely future needs. This will inevitably involve a wide range of consultation which must include: (i) the European Commission and other Common Market organisations;(ii) members of the United Kingdom Parliament;(iii) the governments of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and theEnglish regions;(iv) the appropriate pressure groups, both national and international;(b) to promote the appropriate legislation and statutory instruments to giveeffect to Common Market or United Kingdom Government policy decisions;(c) to approve (or otherwise) ordinances from the Scottish, Welsh, and english regional governments proposed under their residual power&quot;to promote the good government and general welfare of the people&quot;in their respective areas3;(d) to ensure that the Governments of Scotland, Wales and the english regions are giving proper effect to Common Market and United Kingdompolicies.288. To carry out the functions in paragraph 287 above, it will be necessaryfor the departments concerned to: (a) maintain their existing inspectorate functions or establish new ones.For example, the Department of Education&apos;s Inspectorate of Schools1 See Chapter VI, paragraphs 216 and 247. See also paragraph 308 of this Chapter.2 There may be minor exceptions to this.3 See Chapter VI; in particular, paragraphs 221, 222 and 242 to 245.Ill
would continue much as at present. It would be under the direct controlof the Department of Education and Science. Its reports, however, inaddition to going to the Department would also to go the Scottish,Welsh and English Regional Governments who would have theresponsibility for any remedial action. H.M. Factory Inspectorate would operate in a similar way under the Department of Employment. Thuseach department would have important inspectorate functions withinthe area of its responsibility; and this would give it direct knowledge ofthe effectiveness or otherwise of existing policies without the presentgreat burden of case-work;(b) require the Scottish, Welsh and English Regional Governments tosubmit for approval their strategic development plans (up-dated, say,every five years), covering such things as economic growth, populationmovements, educational provision, trunk roads, port and airportdevelopment, etc.;(c) require the Scottish, Welsh and English Regional Governments to act asagents for the administration and provision of those specialist services where executive and administrative autonomy clearly cannot be fullydevolved from Whitehall. Examples of the type of specialist serviceinvolved here include: (i) The Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Department ofTrade and Industry.(ii) The Civil Aviation Division of the Department of Trade andIndustry.(iii) The prison and immigration services of the Home Office.In these and similar instances the departments concerned would make special arrangements with the various intermediate level governments.289. So far in this outline of the new structure and functions of the UnitedKingdom Executive no reference has been made to the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales. Since their present departments will be taken over by thenew Scottish and Welsh Governments, it might well seem logical to believe thatthe two Secretaries of State could have no place in the new system. After all,the Heads of the Scottish and Welsh Governments will be in regular contact with the Prime Minister and other United Kingdom Ministers on major policyquestions; and the chairman of the various Scottish and Welsh functionalcommittees will also be closely involved with their counterpart United kingdom ministers on policy and administrative matters. However, there is obviouslymuch to be said for having a United Kingdom Minister in the Cabinet chargedwith the special responsibility of safeguarding and promoting Scottish and welsh interests at this level of decision making. This might be thought to be ofparticular importance in the future given United Kingdom Common Marketmembership and the fact that Scotland and Wales have no right to appointEuropean Commissioners and cannot seat any representatives on the Councilof Ministers. Accordingly, one of the &quot;non-departmental&quot; Ministers in theUnited Kingdom Cabinet e.g. the Lord Privy Seal, or the Lord President of council, or the Paymaster General or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,should be charged with a special responsibility for Scottish Affairs and, if this were thought appropriate, also given the title of Secretary of State for Scotland;
a second non-departmental minister could be given similar responsibilities for wales. It would then be appropriate for a third non-departmental Minister inthe Cabinet to become specifically responsible for the interests of the differentEnglish Regions at this highest level in the United Kingdom Executive.The United Kingdom Parliament290. Chapter III outlined the implications for Parliament of United kingdom membership of the Common Market. It concluded that Parliament would need to develop the capacity to take a proper share in the decisions which UnitedKingdom Ministers will take in Brussels. This will place a great additional burden on those who serve at Westminster. At the very least it means that parliament must be able to consider all the proposals coming from the european commission to the Council of Ministers for a decision. This can be done only through one or more select committees. For when faced with these various proposals, Parliamentarians must be able to question United kingdom ministers and Civil Servants on the full implications of what is involved sending, too, for outside witnesses and experts as may be appropriate. And all this must take place in time for Parliaments considered conclusions to be put to, and discussed with, United Kingdom Ministers before they are called on totake final decisions in the Council of ministers. And Parliament must also be involved with United Kingdom Ministers in working out the details of legislation or statutory instruments needed to give effect to Common Market directives.291. Ideally there is also a case for Parliament being consulted by theEuropean Commission when it is still formulating the proposals it will event-ually lay before the Council of Ministers. After all, at this stage the commission has consultations with all the various national and international pressuregroups which may be affected by its proposals; and Commission officials will undoubtedly be having informal contacts with United Kingdom Civil Servants.So, at least until the European Parliament is directly elected and given realpowers, there is a strong case for United Kingdom Parliamentarians beinginvolved at this stage in Brussels policy making.292. Whatever Parliaments eventual role in Common Market policy making,it must in any event have a bigger part in general United Kingdom policymaking. In a modern democracy it is not enough for the great majority of the elected representatives of the people to be limited, for the most part, toessentially negative carping criticism of, and post facto investigation of, depart-mental decisions which they have had no chance to shape. This means, therefore,that Parliamentarians must be able to make their contribution to policy makingwhile policies are still being worked out in departments and before ministerial decisions have been taken. This is in line with the Report from the House ofCommons Select Committee on Procedure in 1967 which said that &quot;the house should be brought in at an earlier point in the legislative process so as toallow discussion by Parliament of subjects and details of potential legislationbefore the Government finally prepare a bill.&quot; And this was endorsed by theSecond Report from the Select Committee on Procedure in 1971, whichrecommended that &quot;regular use should in future be made of pre-legislation See Chapter III, paragraphs 101 et seq.2 H.C. 539 Report, paragraph 11. Our underlining.
committees when appropriate in the form of joint committees, to considermatters with a view to consequent legislation&quot;2. And the Select committee made this recommendation because, as they put it, &quot;a strong case has beenmade to Your Committee for regular use of such &apos;pre-legislation committees&apos;to enable Parliament to exercise influence on the Government at an early stage in the process of decision-taking on legislation&quot;2.293. The development of Parliaments capacity to have this much larger share in policy making envisaged in paragraphs 290 to 292 will mean thatM.P.s in the future will have four pre-eminently important responsibilities: (a) to share with the Government in the formulation of policy, pass thenecessary legislation and approve statutory instruments;ib) to investigate the operation of existing legislation and policies and propose any necessary changes;(c) to scrutinise the governments public expenditure and taxation proposals&quot;considering the policies behind the figures&quot;8;id) to audit the nation&apos;s accounts.294. To fulfil their responsibilities at paragraph 293 above, it will benecessary for M.P.s to: id) organise themselves into functional committees matching the maindepartments of central government. The functional committees will: (i) be associated with departments in the policy forming process and before any Bill is presented to the House of Commons;(ii) consider and investigate proposals from the European Commissionto the Council of Ministers which fall within their sphere ofresponsibility. The appropriate House of Commons functionalcommittee will discuss these with the United Kingdom departmental minister concerned before he is called on to take a decision in theCouncil of Ministers;(iii) investigate the operation of existing policies and legislation in theirrespective spheres and make any necessary recommendations forchange;ib) develop the role of the Public Expenditure Committee as is now broadlyenvisaged. Its sub-committees will need to work closely with the functional committees referred to at (a) above and there may be a case for some overlapping membership here. It needs to be stressed, however,that the functional committees at (a) above do not make the public expenditure Committee unnecessary, or vice versa; all have their special roles to play;(c) set up a Public Taxation Committee so that the House can operate in taxation matters broadly as it is proposing to operate in the area of1 i.e., with members of the House of Lords participating as well.2 Second Report from the Select Committee on Procedure, Session 1970-1, dated28th July, 1971, paragraph 8.3 This phrase is taken from the Governmenfs Green Paper on House of CommonsCommittees and is with reference to the role of the new Select Committee on public expenditure. Select Committees of the House of Commons, October, 1970 (Cmnd. 4507),paragraph 20.
public expenditure. It might be that the Public Expenditure committee could, in addition to its present duties, also take on the functionsenvisaged here for the Public Taxation Committee; in which case itcould in effect also become a functional committee with its responsibilitiesmatching those of the Treasury;(d) broaden the terms of reference of the Statutory Instruments Committee.The Statutory Instruments Committee should be able to consider the merits of a particular statutory instrument and not be limited, as ineffect it is now, to a consideration of whether or not it is ultra vires.It could be, of course, that the over-all objective of this proposal mightbe better achieved by the abolition of the Statutory Instruments Com-mittee and instead, bringing all statutory instruments within the purview of the appropriate functional committees referred to at (a)above;(e) develop the work of the Public Accounts Committee to make it muchmore of an efficiency audit.All the Committees outlined above will, of course, need to be adequatelyserved by professional and expert staffs who will need access to the appropriated departments of government.295. If M.P.s in the future operate along the lines envisaged at paragraphs 293and 294 above this will enable them to participate in policy making in themeaningful way demanded by a mature democracy. They will, however, be unable to shoulder the vast additional burdens involved unless: (a) they shed some of their present day-to-day errand running on behalfof their constituents e.g., investigating Mrs. Snooks&apos; complaint abouta hospital or the way she was treated in a Social Security Office. Thiswill, in fact, happen under the scheme of democratic devolution out-lined in Chapter VI since much of their present individual case-workwill, become the responsibility of the Scottish, Welsh, and english regional Governments;(b) M.P.s become full-time and are paid a proper salary. The &quot;new&quot; house will not be able to afford to &quot;carry&quot; the present proportion of M.P.swho are so busy with other jobs that they have little or no time to devoteto the committee work of the House.296. With M.P.s in the future having this much bigger and more crucialrole in the processes of government than they have at present, it is no part ofthis over-all scheme for the democratisation of our system of government toreduce the number of Scottish and Welsh M.P.s in the House of Commons.It might be thought to be logical, given the democratic Assemblies outlined in chapter VI, for Scotland and Wales to have the same proportionate representa-tion in the House of Commons as the English Regions. However, there doesseem to be a very strong case for leaving Scotland and Wales with their presentslight &quot;over-representation&quot; as some recognition of their feeling about specialnational characteristics and interests.
Possible case for the reform of the House of Lords297. It is not essential to the new scheme of government so far outlinedthat there should be a reform of the House of Lords. But there are two reasonsfor giving serious consideration to modifying the composition of the upper house though not to altering its existing powers. The first of these is to giveeffect to the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; referred to in paragraph 132 of Chapter IV;and the second is to provide in a rather different way for the more effective and satisfactory working of the scheme of devolution envisaged in Chapter VI.Each of these points is dealt with separately in the following paragraphs.298. As far as the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; is concerned, it will clearly be an advantage if representatives of the Scottish, Welsh, and English regional governments can directly share in the policy-making processes at the UnitedKingdom government level. They will, of course, be in regular contact with united Kingdom ministers, as was emphasised in paragraphs 287 and 289 above;but this will not provide them with an official forum in which they can actuallyparticipate in the U.K. level decisions which will obviously have a majorimpact on the affairs of their respective governments. However, if a proportionof those directly elected members of the Scottish, Welsh, and English regional governments were also members of the House of Lords, this would enable themto participate in the United Kingdom legislative process and to contributedirectly their expert knowledge of their own governments problems to policymaking at the United Kingdom level; moreover, they would also be seen to beso contributing. This, then, is a possible additional way of helping to ensurethat the central government takes its decisions with full appreciation of theproblems of the intermediate level governments; and it will also give therepresentatives of the intermediate level governments a national and publicplatform on which to make their voices heard.299. The second reason for reforming the composition of the House of Lordsis to provide in a rather different way for the more effective and satisfactoryworking of the scheme of devolution envisaged in Chapter VI. For the maximumbenefits to be gained from such a scheme, it is clearly important that the centralgovernment should leave the intermediate level governments with the widest possible scope for their own activities. This means that they must not be toocircumscribed in their policy making by detailed controls from the centre andby Parliamentary legislation which leaves them inadequate opportunities for independent initiative. Given the fact that ultimate power in all matters remainswith the United Kingdom Parliament and Government (except in so far as theyare bound by Common Market decisions) there is no absolutely certain way of ensuring that intermediate level governments will be left with the scope they need any more than there is now of ensuring that local authorities are not too much controlled and constricted by Whitehall and Westminster. For allcentral governments whatever their political complexions and intentions there is a natural tendency to centralise. It is to provide a countervailing force to this natural centripetal pull that a reform of the composition of the House ofLords could be useful. But before outlining the nature of this reform and theway it could operate, it is important to see this particular problem in its properperspective.
300. The objective here is to try to ensure that the intermediate level govern-ments have the widest possible freedom of manoeuvre in devising and imple-menting the policies they believe best meet the needs of their areas. So we haveto provide some restraints on the central government to try to ensure that itwill not pre-empt, or control in too much detail, functions which are best per-formed at the intermediate level. This is not a new problem. In essence it is thesame problem which we have now in the relationship between central govern-ment and local government. And though there is today no institutionalmechanism to prevent the central government from unduly circumscribing theactivities of local authorities, the fact is that local government is left with verymajor responsibilities and very substantial areas of independent manoeuvre even if they are not as wide as might be ideally desirable. So provided a centralgovernment believes in the concept of a substantial devolution of power todemocratically elected intermediate level governments and accepts that there are important functions that can best be performed at this level then, on the analogy of local government, the scheme could work reasonably satisfactorilywithout any institutional restraints on central government activities. But it willwork better if there are such restraints. And, indeed, the scheme as outlinedso far provides three very powerful restraints which will inevitably inhibit anycentral government which seeks to make policy, legislate or operate centralcontrols in so much detail that the initiative and independent area of manoeuvreof the intermediate level governments are unduly circumscribed. They are: (a) the main home functional departments of central government will nothave regional or local offices1; and it is essential to the scheme that theyshould not have these outposts. This lack of regional and local outpostswill in itself be a powerful deterrent to a central government which wastempted to exercise itself responsibilities best performed at the inter-mediate level;(b) the departments of central government will have no direct contacts with local authorities; they will deal only with the intermediate level govern-ments. When central government cannot itself directly oversee in detailhow local government operates, this will be another factor inhibiting it from prescribing policies and controls which are too detailed;(c) the intermediate level governments will be major political forces in theirown right much bigger and more powerful than most of today&apos;s localauthorities. Once set up, therefore, they will develop a great deal ofpolitical weight. The central government will not find it easy to subjectthem to unjustified detailed controls.301. In the light of the restraints outlined in paragraph 300 above it mightwell be thought that it is unnecessary to provide for any further institutionalchecks on the operations of central government for the successful working ofthe scheme of democratic devolution outlined in Chapter VI. This is undoubtedlyso. But it is equally true that the scheme would operate even more beneficiallyif the composition and function (but not the powers) of the House of Lordswere altered so that it, too, could become a countervailing force against the1 See paragraph 213 of Chapter VI and paragraphs 284 to 286 in this Chapter. The Depart-ments concerned are: Environment, Employment, Health and Social Security, Trade andIndustry, Education and Science, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Home Office.
natural centralising tendencies of any United Kingdom Government. Theproposed reforms are outlined in the following paragraphs and they wouldgive effect, too, to the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; discussed at paragraph 298 above.302. As far as composition is concerned, the present nominated life peers would remain and it would be open to any government of the future to nominatesuch further life peers as it wished. The present hereditary peers could alsoremain if this was thought desirable. To these existing types of peer, it wouldbe necessary to add a new element. The new element would consist of membersdrawn from the majority and minority parties in the Scottish, Welsh, and english Regional assemblies. Thus the following would be added to the existingcomposition of the House of Lords: 25 Members from the Scottish Assembly25 Members from the Welsh Assembly20 Members from each of the five English Regional Assemblies150 TotalThese members, drawn from the different subordinate Assemblies, wouldreflect the party balance in each Assembly. They would clearly include theChairman of the Welsh Executive, the Chairman of the Scottish Executive andtheir English Regional counterparts. They would also include the chairmen of the main committees of each Assembly.303. The new members of the House of Lords drawn from the differentsubordinate assemblies would remain Members of the House of Lords as longas they held their seats in the Assembly from which they were drawn, and for as long as the parties in their Assemblies wished them to be their representatives at Westminster.304. The reformed House of Lords would have all its existing functions plusone new one. The new function would be to scrutinise all legislation and statutory instruments with the object of confining legislation to broad and major questions of policy and thus seeking to ensure that the functions and operations of the intermediate level governments were not unnecessarilylimited.305. The proposals in paragraphs 302 to 304 are an adaptation of the WestGerman system of government. The West German Second Chamber (the bundesrat) consists of forty-one members all of whom are appointed by, anddrawn from, the Land Governments. And in West Germany, any measurepassed by the Lower House the Bundestag which affects the interests and duties of the Lander has to get the approval of the Second Chamber, the bundesrat.306. It is not suggested here that our reformed House of Lords should infuture have the same power as the House of Commons in anything that affected the duties of the United kingdom&apos;s  intermediate level governments. But itshould be ready to exercise its present delaying power over any central govern-ment legislation or statutory instruments which a majority of the reformed house of Lords believed unduly limited the intermediate level governments.
307. If the House of Lords were reformed along the lines suggested inparagraphs 302 to 305 above, this would have four main advantages: (a) it will give effect to the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; and enable intermediategovernments to participate directly in central policy making;(b) it will introduce a still further check on the centralising tendencies ofany government;(c) it will provide a national platform for the representatives of the inter-mediate level governments;(d) it will add prestige and incentive to membership of intermediate levelassemblies when some of their members are also members of the Houseof Lords.But such a reform is by no means essential to the successful operation of thescheme of democratic devolution outlined in Chapter VI.Other aspects of United Kingdom Government308. It may be there is a case for setting up a Constitutional Court as aseparate division of the High Court. As Sir Leslie Scarman has pointed out asfar as the Common Market is concerned, &quot;it is certain that the courts will haveto assume the burden of interpreting and applying [Common Market] legislation which may be in conflict with statutes made by Parliament&quot;1. And it is alsocertain that similar cases will arise on whether actions of intermediate level governments are ultra vires both vis-a-vis Common Market legislation and united Kingdom legislation. In this context it needs to be emphasised thatcourt adjudications of this constitutional kind will hardly be a fundamentalinnovation in our legal system. The courts for a long time have been involvedin similar cases as far as the actions of local authorities are concerned. And inthe second half of the nineteenth century the Privy Council, for example, wasregularly acting as a kind of Supreme Constitutional Court in constitutionalconflicts between the Provinces and the Federal Government in Canada.But though there are plenty of precedents for our courts being involved inconstitutional matters, it is likely in the future that they will have a substantially greater burden of work here than in the past. Experience may then indicate thedesirability of setting up a separate High Court Division to deal with this kindof case. And if that is to be the line of future development, it could well be thatthis same division could also assume the function of Supreme Court of appeal from all our various Administrative Tribunals. But all this is something finallyto be determined in the light of our actual experience of the consequences ofCommon Market membership and of the operation of the intermediate level governments described in Chapter VI.309. This memorandum makes no recommendations about two major questions about our constitutional arrangements which were raised in ourevidence. It was advocated by some witnesses that there should be a form of proportional representation for elections to the United Kingdom Parliament;and we were also urged to consider some restriction on the Prime Ministersvirtually unfettered power to call a general election at the time when he thinks1 Sir Leslie Scarman. Address to the Royal Institute of Public Administration on &quot;the impact of a Changing Society on Law and Administration&quot;. June, 1972.
he has the best chance of winning. As far as the latter is concerned, it wouldseem desirable to have some experience first of how fixed term elections operate in the United Kingdom at the intermediate level of government before con-sidering this as a possible innovation at the United Kingdom level; and, inany event, we ought to see how the new system as a whole operates beforeinterfering with a Prime Ministerial power about which the pro and conarguments appear at present to be fairly evenly balanced. As for proportional representation, this has been recommended for the intermediate level govern-ments and there are two arguments for not recommending its extension toelections for the United Kingdom Parliament at this stage: (a) there is a case for seeing first how it operates in the United Kingdom atthe intermediate level; ,(6) at central government level, and particularly with a Westminster Cabinetmodel system (in contrast to the committee system of government at the intermediate level) there is a strong case for having party politicalresponsibility as clear cut as possible. Indeed, it can be argued that atthis level elections (and therefore the whole democratic process) can bemeaningful only if it is possible to hold one party and its leaders clearlyresponsible for the sum total of the governments policies. A system ofP.R. at this level would almost certainly lead to coalition governments and thus destroy the clear cut nature of political responsibility as we nowknow it.310. Finally, it might appear that this memorandum is also making no recommendation on the question of open government the objective of &quot;opendecisions openly arrived at&quot;, as it was put in paragraph 136 of Chapter IV.This is not so. In fact much more open government will be the inevitableconsequence of implementing many of the institutional recommendations in chapters VI and VII. For example, the following will do much to lift the veilswhich now shroud so much of the policy-making process: (a) the new role for House of Commons Committees which, it is assumed,will for the most part operate in public as Select Committees mostlydo now;(b) the committee operations of intermediate level governments which mustbe in public unless the Assemblies determine otherwise;(c) the national public platform which the leaders of the intermediate level governments will have in the reformed Second Chamber.This might not make all processes of government open to public view but itshould enable us to know most of what is going on during the formative stages of policy making and so give us a full opportunity to make our voices heard.And what is more, the various institutional changes we are recommendingshould also make government more responsive to the voices they hear.The political parties311. It is not the tradition in the United Kingdom to regulate by law theoperations of our political parties. Indeed, part of our constitutional traditionhas been to ignore their existence completely. Thus, for example, not until the
1970 General Election did party labels actually appear on the ballot forms.However, in any schemes for the reform of our system of government we must recognise that political parties are, and will be, the chief motivating force of our main governmental institutions. They are, and will be, principally responsiblefor producing and sponsoring the politicians to operate the system at all levels.Thus, since authoritarian or oligarchically controlled parties could fatallydistort the working of democratically designed institutions, any scheme for constitutional reform must also concern itself with the operations of our political parties.312. In Britain, our main political parties have, of course, gradually developed a tradition of internal democratic government and practice. And it is not our intention to suggest that urgent reforms are necessary here if the basic institu-tional changes we are recommending are to bear full democratic fruit. But thereare features about the contemporary working of our political parties to whichwe think some attention should be given. These are set out in the following paragraphs.313. At present the selection of candidates for Parliamentary (and local)elections is essentially the task of a small number of people in each constituencyparty association. In most constituencies the ascendancy of one party or anotheris well-established and therefore these people who choose the party&apos;s candidateare really choosing that constituency&apos;s M.P. (or councillor). It, therefore, seems desirable to consider whether we should seek by law to regulate the nomination of party candidates and provide that candidates bearing the banner of a party should be selected by a process that enables the ordinary subscribing membersof that party&apos;s organisation in the constituency to choose by ballot betweenaspirants for the nomination. And the law might insist that this process shouldtake place in respect of every election, even when the sitting M.P. (or councillor)wishes to stand again and his constituency party&apos;s executive wishes him to do so.Alternatively, the possibility of a form of party primary election might beconsidered. In any event, the objective here must be to enable all who want todo so to have a share in choosing their party&apos;s candidates. This basic part ofour democratic system must not fall under the control of cliques or oligarchies.314. Secondly, there is the question of political campaigning. To a veryconsiderable extent the vitality of our system of government depends on fair and equal competition between the parties. For a hundred years or so electorallegislation, the practicalities of a large electorate, and the development of the climate of opinion have purified this competition from the corruption andintimidation that would distort the formation of public opinion at and betweenelections. But competition between the major parties is still affected seriouslyby important differences between them in respect of resources (although itcould well be argued that their resources differ in kind more than in effect). Inany event, there are a number of factors about election campaigns to which, inthe interests of fair and equal competition between our political parties, attentionought to be given: (a) The present legislation on campaign expenditure does not deal with thevery considerable publicity campaigns undertaken by the major partieswhen a dissolution is expected but well before it is announced. Serious
consideration needs to be given to whether campaign expendituresshould be regulated between elections as well as during the period afterthe dissolution and also to how such a scheme for limiting expenditurescould be devised.(i) The allocation of time on radio and television is decided effectively byagreement between the three major parties on a national basis and in-volves considerable injustice to smaller parties however serious theymay be and regardless of their special significance in a particular partof the country. Consideration needs to be given to the possibility of theallocation of broadcasting time being made by an impartial body aBroadcasting Council on the analogy of the Boundary Commissions.And such a body might be instructed to make separate allocations at theUnited Kingdom level and in Scotland, Wales, and the English regions.315. Finally, it is also evident that our major parties lack the capacity when in opposition to subject government policies to adequate and sufficientlydetailed political scrutiny; nor have they the capacity to work out coherent and fully practical alternative programmes which will stand the test of the rigours ofpublic office. The basic deficiency here is lack of information. A party out of office simply has not the resources to match the wealth of departmental informa-tion available to the government. No doubt the proposals made earlier in this chapter for the development of the Committee system in the House of commons and supplementing the professional staffs of the House of Commons will go some way to providing back-bench members of all parties with much more information both from government departments and from outside experts.Even so, the parties in opposition will still not be adequately equipped for alternative policy formation on the scale now demanded in a modern democracy.To meet this deficiency we think there is a case for making public funds and/orprofessional staff available for parties in opposition so that they can mounttheir own research programmes. It is, in our view, vital to the health of the body politic that poli ical parties should have the resources to enable them tocarry out the research effort now required in the modern state if they are tooffer the electorate the alternative, practical and fully worked out policies whichare the essence of democratic choice.316. It needs to be recognised that the suggestion we are making inparagraph 315 is hardly novel. Western Germany and Canada, for example, aretwo countries which provide public funds for their political parties. Quite apartfrom the assistance this can give to an adequate research effort which is a vitalparty requirement in a modern democracy, it could also be an important meansof ensuring that our parties will not be unduly dominated by the special interests which in some cases now provide so much of their income.
THE MECHANICS OF CHANGEIntroduction317. Clearly the changes in our system of government recommended in chapters VI and VII could not all be introduced immediately and at once.Even if they could, such haste would hardly be wise. A constitution like ourswhich is the product of centuries of evolution, should be modified over theyears, not overnight. So the proposals in Chapters VI and VII are in fact a programme for a generation. They indicate the general direction in which weshould move if we are to create the greater opportunities we need to governourselves. But in seeking to achieve these long term objectives it is prudent tohave a practical strategy in mind for implementing these proposals a phasedapproach which can be tested at each stage in the hard school of practical experience. It is the purpose of this chapter to outline such a strategy.318. The suggested strategy envisages three phases. The first would essentiallybe a period of public debate; at the same time there would be a detailed studyby the government to determine the right boundaries for the intermediate level governments. The second phase would be to set up the intermediate level governments and give them a limited range of responsibilities. The third phaseinvolves a gradual addition to their range of responsibilities. Throughout therewould be appropriate changes in Whitehall and Westminster. The mainingredients of each phase are broadly sketched below.Phase I.  The period of study and planning319. Before any government commits itself to the general scheme outlined in Chapters VI and VII, there must clearly be a period of public debate. the objectives, principles and practicality of this scheme must be tested alongside the various other proposals for constitutional change made by our colleagues.M.P.&apos;s, political parties, the representatives of local government and all groups and individuals with an interest and concern in how we are governed would clearly be in the forefront of the debate. If in the end it is clear that there is substantial support for democratically elected assemblies in Scotland, wales and the regions of England the government would take a decision to proceedto Phase II of the scheme.320. During the period of public debate it would be prudent for the govern-ment to begin the necessary detailed studies on boundary questions. Here, ofcourse, there is no real problem as far as Scotland is concerned; its boundariesare mainly self-evident. But for Wales and the different regions of Englandthere are difficult political and socio-geographic problems to be overcome beforethe right decisions can be made. In this section we can do no more than indicatebroadly the nature of these problems and suggest the general way they shouldbe tackled.321. It is clearly important in deciding on the boundaries for Wales and thevarious English regions to assume that eventually the Welsh and english regional governments will assume the full range of functions suggested in
Chapter VI. This means that initial boundaries, and sizes of population shouldbe appropriate for the performance of all these functions even though manyof them might not in fact be undertaken until well into Phase III. The problemhere is that the ideal boundaries and population size for one sort of functionare not necessarily the same as for another. This is the justification, of course,for dividing England into fourteen regions for administering the Health Serviceand nine regions for the provision of water. But, as we have seen, the concept of creating an ideal sized region for each particular function produces inEngland and Wales a large number of different and overlapping regionalboundaries and patterns; and this is a major obstacle to comprehensiveregional planning, efficient overall administration, and to effective democraticcontrol. So we must seek to create a number of standard regions each of whichwould be capable of handling satisfactorily all the intermediate level functionsof government referred to in Chapter VI even though each region would notnecessarily be the ideal size for any one of them considered separately.322. As we saw in Chapter V, the number of regions into which Englandhas been divided for departmental administrative purposes ranges fromfourteen to two. As far as the ad hoc authorities are concerned, their numberof regions varies from about four to seventeen. On the surface of it it wouldseem easier to contain all these different structures in a small number of largeregions than in a large number of small ones; this is broadly because it is usually easier and makes more sense to join two existing regions together for adminsitrative purposes than to split an existing region into two or moreparts. So that could be a useful working hypothesis at the beginning of thegovernment^ study to determine the boundaries of Wales and the rightnumber of English regions. But there are other more fundamental factors whichwould have to come into such a study. These are briefly indicated in the followingfive paragraphs.323. A crucial consideration must obviously be basic facts of physical and social geography. This is particularly important as far as the comprehensivemanagement of water is concerned which, under the scheme, would be a regional responsibility. This means that a river basin or a collection of riverbasins should be a major factor in determining regional boundaries. Detailedstudies suggest that if hydrological factors alone are taken into account Englandcould be divided into either fifteen or five units. Moreover these areas deter-mined by hydrological factors can hardly be faulted from the standpoint of social geography (i.e. the work and recreational patterns in the daily lives ofthe people) or from the point of view of those functions the regional authorities would undertake on behalf of those who live and work there; this is becausethe relation the hydrologically determined areas bear to population patternsis very close indeed for the simple and obvious reason that nearly all our major concentrations of urban settlement developed around river crossings onwhich highways converged.324. If hydrological considerations and the facts of social geography point to the possibility of dividing England into between five and fifteen regions, thenext step in the government study would be to consider which of this range
of regional possibilities would be most appropriate for the various otherresponsibilities these intermediate level governments will eventually undertake.Clearly, there will be conflicts to be resolved here. For example, it might wellbe that the ideal regional pattern for the Health Service could be either thepresently proposed fourteen regions or an amalgamation of these into seven;in contrast the ideal number of regions for the Department of the Environmentspresent housing, trunk roads and traffic responsibilities might be its existingeight regions, but the study might show that these could be satisfactorilyhandled on a five or ten regional basis. And, of course, when possible regionalpatterns for all the other functions are carefully considered no doubt a largenumber of possible permutations and combinations will emerge.325. Another important factor in determining the eventual regional patternwill obviously be existing local government boundaries. Clearly when the redcliffe-Maud Report recommended an eight regional pattern, this madepractical, managerial sense on the basis of the proposed sixty-one unitaryauthorities (i.e. an average of seven or eight unitary authorities per region).Mr. Derek Senior&apos;s suggestion for five &quot;provinces&quot; made similar managerialsense on the basis of thirty-five top tier local authorities and 148 second tierauthorities (i.e. an average of seven top tier authorities per province). Underthe new local government reorganisation the two tier structure in England isto consist of: (a) the G.L.C., six Metropolitan Counties and thirty-nine non-metropolitancounties forty-six authorities altogether1(b) within the forty-six authorities at (a) above, thirty-two boroughs in theG.L.C., thirty-six Districts in the six Metropolitan Counties and296 districts in the thirty-nine non-metropolitan counties1.Purely on &quot;management&quot; grounds it might make more practical sense toorganise (a) and (b) above into a four or five regional structure (with aboutnine counties per region) as opposed to an eight regional structure with only some five counties per region. Of course, London and the South East poseobvious and special problems of their own; and it might in the end make senseto consider this as one special region. But whatever the special boundaryconsiderations affecting London and the South East, the basic problem posedby the new structure of local government is to consider what sort of regionalpattern would be most appropriate for it bearing in mind the factors inparagraphs 323 and 324 above. This, of course, is on the assumption that thenew county and district boundaries makes sense in planning terms; if they areill-designed for this, as many people believe, then clearly different considerations would arise.326. There is then the question of regional identity and regional feeling.Clearly it would be best if regional boundaries were coterminous with regionalor national loyalties. And this must obviously be an important factor in determining the boundaries of Wales. Nor would it be unimportant in Englandsince our Attitude Survey has shown a perhaps unexpected degree of regional
feeling in the different parts of the country. But two points need to be stressedin this general context: (a) a sense of regional loyalties and identity are not essential to the successfulworking of this scheme though they would help;(b) the example of West Germany suggests that those Lander whichafter the War were no more than the product of lines arbitrarily drawn on a map by the Allies have over the years developed a sense of identitynot dissimilar from that of a Land like Bavaria with its special roots inhistory and tradition.Still every effort should be made to match boundaries to loyalties. And thiswould point to a clearly identifiable Scotland and Wales, together with a larger number of small English regions rather than a small number of larger ones.327. Financial and economic factors will also be important in determiningEnglish regional boundaries. Each area needs to be big enough and to have enough resources to give it the best possible chance of comprehensive andbalanced economic development. And since we envisage each intermediate level government having some independent revenue from its own taxing powers,this points in the direction of larger areas rather than smaller areas.328. The best practical resolution of the different considerations in para-graphs 323 to 327 above probably points in the direction of having the clearly defined boundaries for Scotland and Wales shown on the map at Appendix Etogether with, say, the five English regions which the map also broadly indicates.As paragraph 326 suggests, a solution along these lines might not be idealfrom the point of view of English regional loyalties; but it would not representany serious violation of provincial identities if this finally appeared to be thebest solution in the light of all the other considerations in these paragraphs.In this general context it is important to stress that there is a natural tendency for most of the various factors outlined in paragraphs 323 to 327 above topoint broadly in the same direction. This is because they are largely concernedwith providing services for conglomerations of people whose settlement and work and leisure patterns have been broadly determined by the facts ofgeography. Still, there will obviously be important conflicts to be resolved.And clearly the government will be involved in a great deal of work, consulta-tion and study in Phase I before final and precise details can be worked out,and proposed, on these boundary questions.329. It would be in keeping with the spirit of the proposals in Chapters VIand VII if members of the House of Commons were closely associated withthe government in the general study of boundary and other questions referredto above. For these important constitutional issues it would probably be appropriate for the House of Commons to set up a special committee whichwould be in close consultation with the departments of government and other organisations and individuals concerned as the governments study proceeded.And Parliament would also be considering, during Phase I, how best to organiseitself to play the enlarged role envisaged for it in Chapter VII. Here, of course,it would be able to operate in the light of some practical experience of theconstitutional implications of United Kingdom membership of the common market. And it would be able to consider these both alongside the long-term
objectives set out in Chapters VI and VII and also against the more immediatechanges involved in the responsibilities of central government from thebeginning of Phase II.Phase II. Creating the new authorities; their initial functions330. The beginning of Phase II would be marked by the government&apos;s decision in principle to move in the general direction of the scheme outlined in Chapters VI and VII. At that point it would also have settled the boundaries of Scotland and Wales and determined the number of, and boundaries of, the regions it proposed to create in England. The Government would then begindrafting the necessary legislation to set up Assemblies for Scotland, wales and the English regions based on direct elections (under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation), with some co-option from localgovernment.331. A crucial decision at this stage will have to be taken about the initialfunctions to be conferred on the intermediate level governments. It would beimpractical (even if desirable) to endow them at once with the full range of responsibilities suggested in Chapter VI; too much legislation would have tobe re-written too quickly for that. And anyway there is much to be said for proceeding with caution in introducing changes which, in total, amount to a radical reconstruction of our whole governmental system. Equally, however,there is no point in setting up Assemblies which would have little to do. It issuggested, therefore, that from the moment the Assemblies are set up theyshould be given major responsibilities in the following fields: planning,health, water management, the police, traffic, culture and recreation, education and housing. Virtually all these would be functions which are now carried outeither by the outposts of central government or by nominated ad hoc authorities.A more detailed indication of what would be involved in this initial range of responsibilities is given in the following paragraphs.332. Clearly, one of the most important functions of an intermediate levelgovernment is to draw up a strategic plan for its area. This would, of course,involve much more than the traditional &quot;town and country planning&quot;. It would include economic and social planning as well. So each area would work out its long-term strategic plan which would cover such things as: (a) the proposed balance between different types of industry and the balance between industry and agriculture;(b) the projected population distribution;(c) the requirement for social investment in housing, urban renewal,educational building, roads and transport, etc.Producing such a strategy would involve considering all the planning problemspresented by likely demographic projections, technological change, the invest-ment programmes of the nationalised and major private industries, and thegeneral economic, cultural, educational and environmental changes needed toproduce a prosperous and balanced use of the area&apos;s resources both for thebenefit of those who live and work there, and also, of course, to contribute to the health and prosperity of the United Kingdom as a whole.
333. Naturally an intermediate level government would draw up its strategicplan in full consultation with all the local authorities in its area. There wouldalso be discussions with central government as the strategy took shape; andthe plan would not, of course, come into effect until it was approved by theUnited Kingdom Government. But once that approval was given it wouldbe the responsibility of the intermediate level governments to put the plansinto effect. The plans would be regularly up-dated to take account of changing circumstances.334. The second major function which should at the outset be conferred on the intermediate level authorities is in respect of the Health Service. before these authorities can be set up, the Health Service will have been reorganisedalong the lines set out in Chapter V1. Important responsibilities will havebeen conferred on fourteen nominated Regional Health Authorities in Englandand on the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; the intermediate level governments should take over these responsibilities completely. Thus the ad hocnominated English Regional Authorities would disappear; and the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would hand over their corresponding duties to scottish and Welsh Assemblies.335. The intermediate level authorities should also at the outset take over(along the lines of paragraph 334 above) the functions of the nine english regional Water Authorities and of the Welsh National Water development authority being created under the new Water Bill. And the Scottish assembly would become responsible for co-ordinating the corresponding water andsewage responsibilities which in Scotland have been conferred on the largerunits of local government (instead of on the nominated ad hoc water authorities as in England and Wales).336. It would also make sense if, at the outset of this second phase, thesedemocratic intermediate level governments were given control of the police service thus eliminating all need for joint police authorities. And with thepolice service, for technical reasons, would go the fire service and the mainresponsibility for traffic management. And the concept of &quot;major responsibilityfor traffic management&quot; would also involve taking over the work of the passenger Transport Authorities.337. Although it is not essential to the successful implementation of Phase ii of the scheme, it would nevertheless be advantageous and attractive if the intermediate level governments were given the responsibility of creating the opportunities for the most fruitful use of leisure. Thus they could take overthe functions of the sports councils, arts councils and tourist boards, etc.These nominated ad hoc authorities have been created largely because of the lack of elected authorities covering a wide enough area for their particularpurposes; the intermediate level governments would cover a wide enougharea.338. We also suggest that as from the beginning of Phase II the intermediate level governments should have important functions in the field of education.Clearly, in this respect, it would not be too difficult to confer on the Scottish1 See page 73, et seq.
and Welsh governments the main educational responsibilities now exercised by the Scottish and Welsh Offices; these include primary and secondary schools,nursery schools and further education covering technical, agricultural and arteducation. The English regional intermediate level governments could be givensimilar responsibilities. In this context a more detailed indication of part of thisrange of educational responsibilities which, at the outset of Phase II, might begiven to English regional intermediate level governments is given in Appendix C;there, an analysis of the 1944 Education Act suggests which powers the Actnow confers on the Minister could with advantage be devolved to the regions.339. Also from the beginning of Phase II the intermediate level governments should have important functions in the field of Housing. The pattern to befollowed here could be broadly the one recommended for education in para-graph 338. Thus the existing housing functions of the Scottish and Welsh Officescould be transferred to the new Scottish and Welsh governments. For example,the Welsh Office now has the responsibility for administering the housing acts, the Rent Acts and the Leasehold Reform Act; that involves considerationof local authority housing schemes for subsidy and loan sanction and thepayment of all grants and subsidies relevant to housing. These functions couldbe transferred to the new Welsh Government. The English intermediate level governments could be given similar responsibilities. A more detailed illustrationof what some of these housing responsibilities might include is given inAppendix C; there, an analysis of the 1969 Housing Act suggests which powers under that Act now exercised by the central government might with advantage be devolved to the regions.340. There is one further major responsibility which it would seem wise togive to intermediate level governments from the beginning of Phase II. This isthe residual power for the good government and general welfare of the people in their areas; it is outlined in paragraphs 220 to 222 of Chapter VI. This wouldendow the intermediate level governments with a wide-ranging general com-competence and give them a real sense of responsibility for all that happened intheir boundaries. At the same time the nature of the suggested central controls over the exercise of this power would ensure that any new initiatives were takenonly after mature and careful deliberation.341. To carry out this initial, but substantial, range of functions, the inter-mediate level governments would need the appropriate financial powers and resources. It would seem reasonable to give them at the beginning of Phase IIthe full range of taxing powers envisaged in Chapter VI; it would be up to the intermediate level governments to decide whether to exploit these to the full,or keep some in reserve, as it were, to meet the additional responsibilities ofPhase III. At the same time the &quot;equalisation&quot; grants received initially from central government would be calculated in relationship only to the functionsthat have at that time been assumed. In all this, the financial procedures to befollowed from the outset would be those outlined in paragraphs 262 et seq. of chapter VI.342. Besides setting up the intermediate level governments with these initialfunctions, the central government would also in Phase II be gradually develop-ing its own organisation and operation along the lines set out in Chapter VII.
Again it would be wise to proceed slowly and flexibly particularly since thefull institutional consequences of our Common Market membership will become clear only gradually. But it would be in keeping with the spirit of the schemeif a House of Commons Select Committee or Committees were closely associatedwith the formative stages of the Governmenfs plans for conferring the initialrange of functions on the intermediate level governments. And it would alsoprobably be useful if from the moment the intermediate level governments werecreated some of their members could be given some form of membership ofthe House of Lords.343. If the functions and responsibilities outlined in paragraphs 332 to 340above were conferred on intermediate level governments at the beginning ofPhase II, this would mean that right from the outset these governments wouldbe playing a major role in the development of their areas. They would be seen by the voters, therefore, as important centres of power; and they would attractto their service those substantial groups of citizens who are anxious to play apart in the democratic control of public affairs. At the same time the legislativeeffort to set up these governments with an initially limited range of responsi-bility would be manageable within a normal governmental programme without unduly limiting other important legislative measures a government wished to put before Parliament. Certainly this would be a much more manage-able operation than to seek to endow these intermediate level governments atonce with the full range of responsibilities envisaged in Chapter VI.Phase HI. The development of the full potentialities of intermediate levelgovernments344. The final phase would stretch over a number of years. It involvesin the end closing all the regional outposts of the following departments of central government: The Department of the Environment.The Department of Health and Social Security.The Home Office.The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The Department of Trade and Industry.The Department of Employment.Their functions, responsibilities and staffs would be taken over by the inter-mediate level governments.345. Obviously, it is not possible to indicate here the sequence and prioritiesof that take-over. It would partly depend on the practical experience of inter-mediate level governments and their views on what further responsibilitiesshould be devolved to them at the earliest possible date. A major factor,however, would be the central governmenfs own priorities for legislativechange. Thus, for example, when the central government considered the time had come for major changes in the social security system, the legislation required for that would provide the opportunity also for devolving to inter-mediate level governments (either completely or on an agency basis) the functionshitherto done by the outposts of central government now concerned with social security. And one would expect a similar process to be followed for windinglip the remaining outposts of central government.
346. At the same time the responsibilities of the remaining non-industrial,non-commercial ad hoc authorities would also gradually be transferred to the intermediate level governments. And these governments would also beestablishing and developing closer links with the nationalised industriesoperating in their areas; the type of link envisaged here is set out inparagraph 237 of Chapter VI.347. As far as the organisation and operation of central government isconcerned, this will, of course, be being constantly adapted in the light of thepractical experience of the developing devolution of Phases II and III. Andthe necessary changes will also be determined by institutional developments inthe Common Market and by expansions in the ambit of Common Marketresponsibilities. So it would be unwise to prescribe precisely which of the changes envisaged in Chapter VII should take place in Phase III. The most that can be done, therefore, is to reiterate the main objectives here which weare seeking to meet. These are: (a) to enlarge the role of Parliament in the major policy-making processes;(b) to enable the United Kingdom Government and Parliament to par-anticipate fully in, and exercise the necessary checks on, decision makingin Brussels;(c) to reduce very substantially the present burdens on Whitehall andWestminster.Conclusion348. Obviously, no precise time-table can be laid down for the completionof each of these three Phases. Indeed, apart from the actual creation of the intermediate level governments and their endowment with an initial range of functions the different phases will merge imperceptibly into each other. and since governmental institutions must always be evolving to meet the newneeds and aspirations of our people there is clearly a sense in which Phase iii will never end. But with the cumulative evolution of Phase II and Phase III-with an increasing devolution of functions from Whitehall and Westminsterto the different nations and regions of the United Kingdom and with Parliamentplaying a much bigger role in policy making in both London and Brussels,power will gradually be returned to the people and their representatives. Therewill be much more opportunity and encouragement for all of us to help shapethe decisions which affect our lives. Government will be more obviously basedon the consent of the governed. In short, we shall be developing a systemworthy of a mature democracy.
POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS TO OUR PROPOSALS349. We began our Memorandum of Dissent by drawing attention to thedecline in the extent to which we as a people now govern ourselves. We thenpresented the case for greatly enlarging the share of the people in the processes of decision making. In Chapters VI and VII we outlined our scheme to achieve this major objective, to adapt our system of government to the consequences of Common Market membership, and to meet the other discontents with, andweaknesses in, our system of government as revealed by the written and oral evidence and the various research studies. In Chapter VIII, we set out thephased approach we recommend for the implementation of our scheme. now we consider whether there can be any substantial objections to our proposals.350. A possible argument against our scheme could be based on doubts about the viability of a system based on the separation of powers between thecentral and intermediate level governments in the way we have proposed. this might seem the more serious if it is believed that there is no principle on whichthis division of powers could be securely founded. There are two main points to be made in reply to this type of criticism; they are set out separately in thefollowing paragraphs.351. On the question about principle, we have in fact set out a number of basic principles on which the division of functions between all levels of govern-ment should be based and not just between the central government and intermediate levels. Thus, we have argued first of all that an essential ingredientof such a division must be the recognition that legislative sovereignty in all matters must remain with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament(except in so far as it is affected by Common Market membership); there canbe no autonomous enclaves within the United Kingdom. Secondly, within thatoverriding principle we have said that the decisions made at central governmentlevel must be limited to those which cannot, without proven detriment to efficiency and to the economic and political unity of the United Kingdom bemade at a lower level. (The implication here being that the central governmentshould mainly restrict itself to broad and general policy making.) And this second principle also obviously applies to the intermediate level governments as well. For, as we have also stressed, the third principle which should help todetermine the proper functions of the different levels of government is that decisions should be made as near as possible to those affected by them.352. We have not suggested in Chapters VI, VII and VIII, that the applicationof these principles will be easy. Nor have we sought to minimise the practical problems that will have to be overcome in the implementation and successful operation of our scheme. In particular, we have drawn attention to the factthat in theory, at any rate, it would be possible for the central government to operate in such a way that the responsibilities we propose for the intermediate level governments would become so truncated as to leave them with no worth-while role. This in essence is what any doubts about the &quot;viability&quot; or1 See Chapter IV particularly paragraphs 116, 122, 131.
&quot;practicality&quot; of the scheme really add up to. We dealt with this problem insome detail in Chapter VII1. There we pointed out that this problem of dividingfunctions and responsibilities between an all-powerful central government onthe one hand, and lower level subordinate authorities on the other, is hardly anew one; in essence it is the same problem we have now in the relationship between central government and local government. And though there is todayno institutional mechanism to prevent the central government from undulycircumscribing the activities of local authorities, the fact is that we do have a&quot;viable&quot; separation of powers between them. We also pointed out in thoseparagraphs that other important features of our scheme as a whole would makeit much more difficult for the central government to usurp the proper functions and responsibilities of intermediate level governments than it is today for centralgovernment to usurp local authority responsibilities. In our view, therefore, anydoubts about the viability or practicality of our schemes can be summarilydismissed.353. So, too, can the argument that there is not room in Britain for the&quot;insertion&quot; of another tier of government between the local authorities on theone hand, and Whitehall and Westminster on the other. Hitherto this has beenthe main argument usually deployed against ideas of regional government.But if any seek to condemn our scheme in this way, then they fail to understandboth what we have proposed and also what exists at present. As we pointed outin Chapter V (where we specifically dealt with this problem) we already have this intermediate level of government between the local authorities andWhitehall and Westminster; and it is not going to disappear. It consists, wepointed out in that chapter, of two different types of organisations the outpostsof central government and the regional organisations of the various ad ad hoc authorities. And in terms of numbers of officials employed it is a much more substantial level than the central government itself. The essence of our schemeis to rationalise, and to subject to democratic control, this tier that already exists and will continue to exist. Thus we are not proposing the insertion of anew tier.354. In our view, there are in fact only two substantial arguments that canbe deployed against the scheme we have devised and which have to be refuted.These arguments are that (a) there are not sufficient people in Britain who are available, willing and able to undertake all the work involved in being members of theAssemblies of the intermediate level governments;(6) our scheme will involve a plethora of elections in Britain which theBritish people do not, and will not, want. Without our scheme each individual will now be called on.to vote in elections at no less than three different levels for district or metropolitan district councils, forcounty councils or metropolitan councils, and for the WestminsterParliament. And there may even be elections at parish level as well.So it might be argued, therefore, that to call on people to vote in elections for yet another level to elect assemblies for Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions condemns the scheme out of hand; it would bedemocracy run riot.1 Paragraphs 297 et seq.
355. We believe that all the evidence suggests there is in fact no substanceto the argument at paragraph 354 (a) above. We are led to this conclusion bythe following facts: (a) the II million people in Northern Ireland have over the years beenable regularly to provide the men and women to fill something like 1,300council seats and seventy-eight seats in Stormont. On this basis it wouldbe surprising indeed if, say, the 3  million people in the English regionwith the smallest population could not find in their midst the men andwomen needed to fill the 2,000 or so district and county seats and the100 strong regional assembly;(b) the Attitude Survey showed that some 10 million people aged eighteenand over thought they had the ability to be councillors. In fact, inScotland, England and Wales there are opportunities for less than 25,000people to serve in this capacity. On the basis of these figures it wouldbe surprising if there were not enough candidates for the 700 seats atintermediate government level;(c) the recent local government reforms have reduced the number of electedcouncillors in England and Wales from 34,080 to 22,400; and in Scotlandfrom 3,450 to 1,550. At least some of the 14,500 councillors who havebeen made redundant would no doubt be available for the 700 seats in the intermediate level assemblies;(rf) general evidence suggests that there is a growing reservoir of peopleready and fitted to serve in an elected office provided the bodies on whichthey serve have real power;(e) there is never any shortage of people wanting a seat in the House ofCommons. On this analogy -and membership of an intermediate level government being for some an obvious stepping stone to West-minster we do not believe there will be a shortage of suitable candidates;(/)&apos; there are other European countries with more elected representativesper head of the population than we have. It would, therefore, be surpri-sing if we as a people were less anxious to share in the running of ourown affairs than, for example, the people in Western Germany.356. It might be thought that there is more substance in the point at 354 (b)above that our scheme will involve a plethora of elections which the people as a whole will not want. There are two main observations we wish to makeabout this. Each is developed separately in the following paragraphs.357. To avoid setting up directly elected assemblies to control the intermediate level of government which exists and is going to continue to exist, we sought to devise a completely different scheme. This different scheme is based on theidea of modifying and extending the existing institutions of central government and in particular Parliament and the main Whitehall Departments to subjectthis intermediate level of government to greater democratic control and toenable people in the different parts of Britain to have a greater share in thedecisions made at this level. The scheme we devised for this is presented at appendix D. Although, in our view it has much to commend it, nevertheless we do not believe it will go as far as our scheme in Chapters VI and VII to
meet the main causes of our present discontents. And certainly, by its verynature, it can hardly make a major contribution to reducing the present burden on central government which, in this Memorandum, we have identified as a major objective. However, we thought it right to present this entirely alternative scheme so that it could become part of the Phase I general public discussionenvisaged in Chapter VIII. But we feel confident that it will not commandas much public support as our scheme for democratic Assemblies to controlthis intermediate level of decision making. In other words, we do not believe this is a suitable alternative to the scheme for democratically elected intermediate level governments. Nor do we see any other way of subjecting the existingintermediate level of government to greater democratic control.358. If we are right in the conclusion we reach in paragraph 357, we still haveto meet the main &quot;plethora of elections&quot; criticism at paragraph 354 (ft) above. and here we think it has to be admitted that we cannot be certain that elections forintermediate level governments would produce an enthusiastic mass turn-outof voters. Indeed, it might seem fairly obvious that this would not be the case certainly in the first instance. But on this we offer the following observations :-(a) any scheme for Assemblies in Scotland and Wales only would involvethe people in those parts of Britain in this same &quot;plethora of elections&quot;.If there is justification for believing that the people in Scotland and wales would welcome this increase in democratic opportunity, then we find it difficult to believe that the people in England would not be similarlymotivated;(ft) even if elections to intermediate level governments attracted no morethan 30-40 per cent, of the electorate (as in local government elections now), it is in our view better to have this intermediate levelof government responsible to, and controlled by, those democraticallyelected by this relatively small proportion of the electorate than to remain as now without this degree of democratic control and participation;(c) as the intermediate level governments gradually develop their fullpotentialities, we are confident that people generally will come to realisehow crucial the decisions of these bodies are to the general welfare of their area. At that point, we would be very surprised indeed if therewas continued electoral apathy.359. Finally, on this &quot;plethora of elections&quot; argument it is also important,we believe, not to be too insular. So we need to recognise that it is naturaland normal in many democratic countries to provide the people with moreopportunities for voting than is now the case in Britain. This is true of theUnited States, France, Italy and West Germany, to mention only a short list.As far as West Germany is concerned many people vote for more levels of operational authorities than in Britain. And, moreover, in recent years, theproportion of the electorate voting at these different levels has regularly been of the order of 70 to 87 per cent. This, in our view, is what naturally happensin a democratic country when authorities with real power are being elected.And we cannot believe that the people of Britain are less inspired by democraticvalues than their counterparts in Western Germany.
360. We conclude, therefore, that the possible objections surveyed this inEpilogue cannot be sustained against the manifest advantages of the recom-mendations we have made in Chapters VI and VII. The scheme we have therepresented will: (a) counter the serious erosion which has taken place in the extent to whichwe as a people govern ourselves;(b) reduce very substantially the present burdens on Whitehall andWestminster;(c) enable the United Kingdom Government and Parliament to participatefully in, and exercise the necessary checks on, decision making in brussels ;(d) provide adequate means for the redress of individual grievances;(e) provide equality of political rights and obligations for people in all parts of the United Kingdom.We believe that if we wish to restore democracy in Britain and provide for thepeople a real share in the decisions that affect their lives, we can do not less than is proposed in Chapters VI and VII; and we can do no more, if we want to main-tain the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom.Crowther-Hunt.Alan T. Peacock.10th October 1973.
ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE FINANCE of intermediate LEVEL GOVERNMENTSBy Professor Alan PeacockI. introduction. The important question raised by the changes in the public financesproduced by the scheme for intermediate level government is whether other policy aims would become more difficult to fulfil. These other aims have theircounterpart in budgetary measures which are designed to promote:(a) efficiency in the use of resources both to satisfy community needs now and in the future;(b) economic stability both nationally and regionally so that extremes of inflation and unemployment can be avoided;(c) a satisfactory distribution of the fruits of economic growth.2. The analysis proceeds on the basis of two important sets of assumptions:(a) It is assumed that the entire range of government services at present provided would continue in being. This needs further explanation.It is arguable that a Commission with such wide terms of referenceought to have considered whether or not the scope of government services at present offered is &quot;right&quot; and that these are provided in themost efficient way, quite apart from considering which level of govern-ment should provide these services. For example, there is considerablecontroversy about whether any layer of government should own house property to rent and, if it does, whether the rents should be subsidisedor whether tenants rather than property should attract subsidisation.Quite apart from the normative judgments which the commission might have made on this kind of issue, a scheme of the kind recommendedmight leave considerable scope for regional governments, within thenational policy framework, to vary their methods of financing services.Thus, even if discussion of the &quot;proper&quot; scope of government services is avoided, ideally political &quot;models&quot; of devolved governments shouldbe presented which would predict how each region would act, given the devolved powers, and how its actions would be reflected in the size and composition of its budget. Developing such models would be an immenseand unrewarding task, and it seems more sensible to offer illustrationsof budgetary patterns which assume that much the same range ofgovernment services would be provided as hitherto but which, by beingdevolved, would be adapted more closely to the needs of those for whom they have been created.
(b) No attempt is made to pass any final judgment on the desirability ofthe aims of economic policy alongside the aim of closer involvement of citizens in the exercise of political power which is reflected in the financialrecommendations. Nor is any attempt made to &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;trade off&quot;the aims against one another. At one extreme there will be those who willbe concerned if any of the economic policy aims become more difficultto fulfil, given the scheme in Chapters VI and VII; at the other therewill be those who will argue that dissemination of political power is so important an element in our national welfare that the price, in termsof the other aims of policy which may become more difficult to fulfil,is worth paying. Nevertheless, it will be necessary from time to time toemphasise the fact that any final judgment on the merits of the schemerests on the value system of the observer and not simply on technicaldesiderata.3. A scheme of intermediate government finance which follows the&quot;instructions&quot; of the political model is now presented (section II). The schemeis then tested for compatibility with the economic policy requirements listed in paragraph 1 above (section III).II. Determining the fiscal powers of regional governmentsExpenditure4. The main changes in expenditure powers, following the scheme outlined in Chapters VI and VII are:(a) The United Kingdom Government will no longer directly control the pattern of functional spending on some important services, notably in the social field. This will be left to the intermediate level ocgovernment.(b) The United Kingdom Government will no longer have direct financialdealings with any local authorities or any other bodies of authoritiesbelow the intermediate level of government. The local authorities will still be left with the maximum freedom to determine their own spendingpatterns, but will now receive financial support over and above their local sources of revenue from the intermediate level of government.5. It may be useful at this juncture to obtain a general idea of the orders of magnitude of the division of expenditure by layer of government. Dr. Kinghas prepared a full analysis of expenditure on current and capital account byregion for the year 1968-69, and has used this information in order to showwhat effect devolution would have had on the balance of expenditure by layerof government, if devolution of expenditure to regions were in operation inthat year, and there had been no incentive for regions to alter either its patternor amount. His categories of devolved services do not exactly corresponds to ours, but the differences are minor and so we use his figures with practically no modification.

Table 25.2. Estimates for 4 (6) exclude transactions between central government and inter-mediate government.6. According to this calculation the &quot;impact&quot; of a devolved system ofexpenditure would be to make intermediate governments directly responsiblefor nearly 30 per cent, of total current spending and with powers to influenceabout the same percentage of local government expenditure. Nearly 37 percent, of current central government expenditure and close on 35 per cent, ofcapital expenditure would be transferred to regional control.7. However, it is important to note that built in to this calculation are two important implicit assumptions. The first is that regional services, andparticularly social services would be provided with the same financial resourcesas obtained in 1968/69. As Dr. King shows, there were considerable differences in expenditure per head between regions for the different services provided.These variations reflect both different standards of service and differences inthe regional cost of providing them. The implicit assumption in the estimated expenditure is that the devolved governments would have at their disposalfunds which were at least equivalent to the actual regional differences in taxburdens; it is further implied that either regions would have to redistributerevenue between themselves or that the central government would provideequalising grants to poorer regions. Even with the more flexible system proposed,it is clear that its provisions would require an equalisation scheme, a matter which is considered at several points later in this Appendix.8. The important point remains that intermediate governments could bein control of a large proportion of expenditure, roughly equivalent to thepresent proportion controlled by local governments. With power to vary the proportions of expenditure within a defined expenditure total the necessaryconcomitant to improved regional participation in collective decision-making-they could in principle introduce some significant changes in the overallallocation and distribution of national resources. Moreover, as they would inaddition be responsible for the distribution of grants to local governments,they would be strategically placed to influence the finances of the third layerof government.
Revenue9. The essential feature of the scheme is control at the intermediate layer ofgovernment over expenditure so that regional views on relative priorities canbe more fully expressed. Why, then is it necessary for intermediate governments to have any revenue-raising powers ? There are two reasons:(a) unless intermediate governments can lay claim to sources of revenueas a matter of right, they will be left with little bargaining power withcentral government and, indeed, will be in an inferior position to localauthorities who will retain the local rate as an important source ofrevenue; and(b) the granting of revenue raising powers offers an important incentive to participation in the process of government at the intermediate level.As the Board of Inland Revenue states in blunt fashion such powerserves to &quot;provide a meaningful financial discipline for expendituredecisions by the local community&quot;1. At the same time, they give theopportunity for regions to develop new services and improve old ones,subject to agreement with the central government on the overall total.Furthermore such revenue raising powers can have a wider purposethan simply the transfer of resources to intermediate government use.Intermediate governments might be allowed to experiment with revenuemeasures which, as well as being sources of finance, help to use and develop regional resources efficiently without having &quot;spillover&quot; effects on other regions.The granting of independent sources of revenue does not, of course, preclude the operation of an equalisation system which takes into account regionaldifferences in standards of living and the differential regional cost of providing services.10. The recognition of the need for independent sources of revenue doesnot necessarily mean that intermediate governments need to have independenttax administrations with control over both the type of taxes to be levied andtheir rates. To give effect to the criteria put forward in paragraph 9, however,a mixed system seems appropriate. The bulk of finance would be in the formof revenue transferred from the centre which would be raised through thecentral government tax administration. Each region would be entitled to a percentage of nationally-raised taxes fixed according to a pre-determinedformula which would reflect the fiscal potential of that region. Where appro-priate, regions would, in addition, receive further support through theequalisation system. In addition, each region would have independent taxingpowers, but the particular taxes which they would be allowed to levy wouldbe agreed with the central government and would be the same in all regions.Regions would have power over the determination of the tax base and ofthe rates of tax, but the total yield of these taxes would be indirectly controlled by the central government through the latter&apos;s control over the total expenditurein each region.11. The finance received from the central government would consist,therefore, of tax revenue collected at the centre on behalf of intermediate1 Memorandum of Evidence of Board of Inland Revenue, paragraph 40.
governments and of an equalisation grant, where appropriate. So far as theformer is concerned, we have to find a source of revenue which can easily be identified by regional source, and which is flexible in yield, so that the revenueis likely to grow as regional expenditure responsibilities grow. No tax completelyfulfills this requirement, personal income tax being about the nearest equivalent.However, for our purpose there is no need for an exact calculation to be madeof the yield by region. A specific percentage of the income tax would be allocated to regions and could be divided among them according to the regional propor-tion of the income tax base, or even according to regional income per headmultiplied by the total population of the region. Simplicity of division wouldbe bought at the cost of removing any precise connexion between regionalrevenue yield, and the regional tax base and would entail, with a progressivetax system, the introduction of an element of equalisation, as it were, by the back door. Furthermore, it can be objected that the richer the region the greater the bargaining power of the region with the centre, whichever suggested methodof allocation is used. There is no complete answer to these objections, but even if individual regional bargaining positions may be unequal, as measured by their revenue entitlement, regions as a whole would be protected by theiroverall entitlement to a proportion of personal income tax. Of course, if therewere major changes in the revenue potential of the income tax as a result,for example, of tax harmonisation in E.E.C., the whole position of the relation between regional revenue yields of national taxes and the rights of regions to a&quot;cut&quot; of nationally-raised revenues would have to be reviewed again.12. Clearly, if intermediate governments are to carry out the services whichare to be entrusted to them, poorer regions would face revenue deficits, if theyhad to rely solely on their rights to a share of income tax. If they were forcedto make up the difference by local revenue sources, the poorer regions of thecountry would be likely to be faced with higher tax regional burdens per headthan the rich. Some intermediate governments would be faced with revenuedeficits. The problem would be even more difficult for those regions which hadboth a relatively low income per head and also relatively high unit costs ofservice. As already mentioned, the introduction of some form of equalisationgrant is envisaged as a way of dealing with these problems. The technical basis for equalisation grants is fully discussed in the Memoranda of Evidence ofboth Miss Dawson1 and Dr. King2, and it will be clear from these sourcesthat there are several schemes of equalisation which would fit with this financialsystem. Here it seems best to concentrate on one major issue. If the total amount of expenditure for each region is laid down by the central government,then the amount of revenue to be raised is determined. The more power the intermediate government has over sources of revenue, the greater incentive itwill have to minimise the amount of revenue raised regionally, if the differencewere to be made up by the central government. In such circumstances, the centralgovernment is bound to lay down revenue targets for each region as a pre-condition for the provision of equalisation grant, otherwise it loses controlover the total grant available to regions. Some standard of fiscal capacity hasto be determined and, with relative prosperity of each region in mind, this might be a target revenue based on the income per head of the region, although1 Miss Diane Dawson, Revenue and Equalization in Australia, Canada, West Germany andthe U.S.A., Research Paper No. 9.2 Dr. David King, op. cit.
other standards are commonly used. On the other hand, the more control exercised by the central government over the rates of tax of assigned revenues,the less necessary it is to invoke a standard of fiscal capacity. In the extreme case where the central government merely transfers back to regions the yield,in whole or in part, of taxes paid by its citizens, then all it need do is to make up the difference between the transferred revenue and the total.&quot;permitted&quot;expenditure in each region. The expenditure base would be the determining factor in deciding whether or not a region received revenue in addition to taxesraised in the region, but collected and distributed by the central fisc. In view ofthe fact that it is important for regional government to collect some part of theirrevenue themselves, then any equalisation scheme will have to embody some&quot;target&quot; revenue for each region which will be based on its relative prosperity.13. The choice of taxes which would be administered by regions is a difficult one. The need to foster regional interest in the political process suggests thatif expenditure primarily benefits residents in regions, then regional taxes shouldbe paid by residents and borne by them, i.e., they should not be capable ofbeing shifted on to inhabitants of other regions. If these criteria operated, itwould not necessarily follow that we can identify taxes which meet them, whichare easy to administer by an intermediate government and whose yield can be closely geared to local discretionary expenditure requirements. A further com-plication which is relevant to the problem of predictability of yield is the extentto which variation in tax rates of devolved taxes between regions in response to differing preferences for discretionary expenditure would encourage residentsin the higher taxed regions to avoid payment either by purchase of goods inlower taxed regions or by seeking residential qualifications which reduced theirtax liabilities.14. A simple way round some of the difficulties appears to be to allow the intermediate governments power to precept on the local rate, but this wouldbe wholly inappropriate in the scheme, despite the apparent consistency ofsuch a method of finance with the &quot;interlocking principle&quot;. The local rate isregarded as a highly regressive tax and to add the finance of intermediategovernment to the rate burden would certainly raise howls of protest. Secondly,local authorities would not only have to incur the obloquy of raising ratepoundages but they would have little say in the amount of revenue to be raised.Thirdly, intermediate governments would have to rely on a source of taxationwhich is ill-adapted to the purpose of influencing the regional allocation of resources. Finally and conclusively-the local rate would not serve theimportant purpose of forging a direct link between the regional taxpayers andthe regional Assemblies and Governments which represent them.15. If one were to follow the advice of the Revenue Departments, then inter-mediate layers j of government could only be left with a hotch-potch of unim-portant taxes such as taxes on betting and gambling1. However, these departments, understandably, start from different premises. First of all, theyexamine regional sources of revenue purely from the standpoint of &quot;adminis-trative and technical feasibility&quot; and, while it must be accepted that there is nopoint in introducing taxes which would not be tolerated by regional communitiesbecause they were open to evasion and abuse, one is not obliged to accept that1 See, for example, Memorandum of Evidence of Board of Customs and Excise, passim.
higher administrative costs, than would otherwise obtain were taxes raisednationally, represents an overriding objection. This depends on one&apos;s judgment of the benefits of greater control by regions over their own affairs, including alimited tax administration, against the costs of doing so. Secondly, their analysis of taxes is primarily concerned with the problem of transferring existing sources of revenue to regional governments, and with revenue-raising considerationsonly in mind.16. The number of possible schemes of independent sources of revenue leviedby a regional tax administration which would meet the criteria put forwardearlier is most certainly large, but is narrowed down considerably if one buildsinto the system taxes which have a regulatory function. There is much to besaid for trying to devise a tax administration in which the revenue raising andregulatory functions could be sensibly combined, as would be the case withthe taxing and regulation of transport. There are two taxes which could be operated by regional governments without undue administrative and technicalcomplication. The first would involve the transfer of the tax on driving licences to intermediate governments. The present revenue from this source is very small,but there is no reason why, following European practice, the licence fee shouldnot be increased considerably. Further, there appear to be no overridingtechnical obstacles to the introduction of a low-rate supplementary levy onpetrol which could be paid by garages on delivery by tankers and then recovered from the motorist. There seems little in the objection that this might lead to&quot;shopping around&quot; by motorists for low-duty areas, not merely because of the search costs involved, but also because of the strong incentives by regionsthemselves not to be far out of line in their rates of levy for fear of revenue loss.There would in any case be a strong incentive for intermediate governments,with major responsibilities for transport networks within their borders, to keep a close eye on the number and type of licence holders and on garage and other facilities for motorists, so that evasion could be reduced. It might also simplifyadministration if transport taxes were collected by the regional transport authorities, who, under the control of the intermediate governments and in association with local financial authorities might wish to introduce regulatorycharges designed, for example, to prevent road congestion in urban areas oreven to improve and develop motorways by toll charges. Again, one has tobear in mind that the E.E.C. is committed at present to the harmonisation oftransport network finance which would require growing emphasis on directcharging for road use, but it is far from certain that, if such a system were introduced, that it would require the control of transport systems by a centraltransport authority.17. The suggestions contained in paragraph 16 would not preclude con-sideration of other revenue sources, particularly if these are designed to developservices peculiar to a region and for which central government approval isgiven. For example, regional finance of tourist development might partly takethe form of charges for recreational facilities and low-rate taxes on hotel andother accommodation. Regions might also be given powers to run lotteries and,as the Customs and Excise Department concedes, could levy the taxes on betting and gambling.
18. As Table 1 shows, capital expenditure could represent a substantial proportion of intermediate government expenditure. How would such expendi-ture be financed? As Dr. King suggests, the intermediate governments couldbe left to meet capital expenditure mainly from borrowing and possibly fromsurplus revenue, but on the assumption that loan charges would be includedin any provisions contained in the equalisation formula. It is an open questionhow far borrowed funds should be obtained from the central government orfrom the capital market. As the central government would have to approve the total expenditure of regional authorities, as well as agree the proportions of revenue from different sources, it would not only have advance notice butalso indirect control over regional borrowing requirements.19. In general, it would be expected that intermediate governments would follow &quot;traditional&quot; financial rules for subordinate governments which wouldrequire them to meet current expenditure out of current revenue and capitalspending out of borrowing, it being left to the central government to vary these rules in the light of national objectives of economic policy. It should still bepossible to allow intermediate governments the right to carry forward currentsurpluses in order to allow flexibility in the timing of current expenditure or touse such surpluses to vary the mix of spending between current and capital account.III. Devolution and the aims of economic policy20. Before commenting on possible conflicts between the fiscal consequences of transfer of power to regions and other aims of policy reflected in objectives of economic policy, it must be stressed that this task has been hindered by the inability to present even a simple set of &quot;social accounts&quot; which would give some indication of the importance of the flows of income and expenditure ofthe various regions within the whole economy. Even if one could delineateexactly the English regions which would come into being, it would be impossible,given the data available, to provide an expenditure breakdown corresponding to the responsibilities of each intermediate layer of government. Furthermore,as implied in paragraph 5 above, if one wished to specify the composition of regional expenditure, one would have to make a prediction or a set of alternativeassumptions about the spending patterns of each region, based on hypothesesof political behaviour. Likewise, such hypotheses would be necessary in orderto specify the form and the yield of the independent taxes which intermediategovernments might be allowed to employ. Inevitably, therefore, the analysis of the &quot;side-effects&quot; of a regional system of public finance which follows isspeculative and can only point out the major issues which would requireinvestigation if intermediate governments were created with the powers allottedthem in our scheme.Allocation of resources21. The efficient allocation of resources is a major concern of moderngovernments, and has several dimensions. The first is that government must seek to provide accepted standards of service at minimum cost. The cost per unit of output will depend on two important factors-the quantity of services provided by a particular government department or agency, and the efficiency
in the provision of those services. The second is that in some circumstancesgovernment intervention may be the only method by which resources canbe allocated efficiently within the private sector, a familiar example beingthe problem of pollution where private firms (and also public enterprises) mayhave to be prevented from producing &quot;bads&quot;, in whole or in part, such asnoxious fumes, alongside their production of goods. Thirdly, governments may seek with public support to intervene in the allocation of resources throughtime by influencing the amount and form of both public and private investment,usually with economic growth in mind. The circumstances under which govern-ments should intervene and the method of intervention must obviously be thesubject of considerable controversy, but it is assumed that the need for inter-vention through the system of public finance is established.22. The conventional wisdom supports the view that devolution of theoperation of government services will make efficient allocation of resourcesmuch more difficult than in the case of a centralised system. The reduction inthe scale of operation of services such as health and education may result in higher costs per unit, while intermediate governments will not have theexperience and may lack the incentive to promote efficiency in their operation.Secondly, monitoring the effects of economic change on the environment cannotbe left solely to intermediate governments, because of &quot;spillover&quot; problemsbetween one region and another. Thus if river pollution takes place in oneregion, but causes environmental damage in another, it may be difficult for the region suffering the damage to put pressure on the government of the &quot;polluting&quot;region to act, and, at the very least, costs of inter-regional governmentalnegotiation may be high. Similarly, if regions are left to operate tax and subsidymeasures to influence private investment and to influence the amount and composition of public investment, understandably they will think in regional and not in national terms. Inter-regional fiscal competition may producemigration patterns in labour and capital which are not considered desirablefrom a national point of view.23. Some of these arguments of the alleged inadequacies of regional govern-ments can be contested, and in any case evidence to support them is very limited. Measuring the relation between the level of output and cost per unit of service is also an extremely tricky business1, mainly because of the difficultyof standardising for the quality of output produced by governmental organisa-tions. Even if some of the arguments have substance, our financial proposalsplace few hindrances in the way of central action to promote efficient allocation of resources outside and inside government and point towards ways in whichcentral and regional governments might co-operate in achieving this aim. Asthe scheme does not require legislative devolution, one of the major instrumentsfor control over resource allocation the legal definition of property rights is left in central government hands. Environmental damage, for example, maybe controlled by appropriate legislation as well as by tax and subsidymeasures2.1 Cf. S. P. Gupta and J. P. Hutton, Economies of Scale of Local Government Services,Royal Commission on Local Government in England, Research Studies, No. 3, 1968.2 Of course, the relative merits of fiscal and non-fiscal methods of controlling pollutionare still a matter of dispute. See Royal Commission on the Environment, Third Report, 1972.
24. With a devolved system of government it will in fact be more difficultto deal with &quot;spillover&quot; effects of the kind described, but it should be possibleto devise machinery for inter-regional co-operation where the appropriate means for counteracting these effects is through regional budgetary measures.At the same time, there are positive advantages in endowing intermediategovernments with regulatory tax and subsidy powers to improve resourceallocation where the results are predominantly felt within the region, e.g., thereduction of costs associated with traffic congestion.25. The promotion of efficiency of resource use within the public sectormay even be improved as a result of more regional control over finance. In thefirst place, it must not be forgotten that the measurement of efficiency cruciallydepends on the tastes and preferences of those whom the services are designedto benefit and as the main purpose of the scheme is to give the public moresay in the operation of public services, in this sense services should be betteradapted to suit them. Secondly, it is true that regions may vary in the skillin which they organise services but the central government could still exercisesome supervisory powers over their mode of operation including, for example,methods of project appraisal. The very fact that central government would be relieved of the necessity to watch over the day-to-day administration of services would enable it to concentrate on the more appropriate function of devisinga general strategy for minimising the resource inputs which intermediategovernments require.26. As already demonstrated, the independent taxing powers of regionsin the scheme are limited and, though regions would have a right to the yield of centrally-raised taxes, they would have no direct control over tax rates.The central governments powers to influence resource allocation in the private sector by taxation would be changed very little. Nevertheless, there is thepossibility that intermediate governments might use their power over theirown purchasing policies in ways designed to influence the location of firms.There could be no positive objection to this, but always provided that inter-mediate governmental expenditure was cost-effective. With central governmentmonitoring of efficient provision of services, it should be possible to avoidpossible abuse of a region&apos;s right to conduct its own spending policy.Stabilisation and demand management27. Demand management designed to achieve the twin objects of controllinginflation and preserving a high level of employment throughout the economy and in such a way as to avoid balance of payments crises is the major concern of the Treasury. It is therefore not surprising that the Commission soughtand received from the Treasury detailed memoranda on the effects of devolutionon this aspect of national policy. In general, one is bound to agree with theTreasury that demand management policy (in the wide sense which includescontrol over private as well as public expenditure) will be easier to carry out themore the decisions on the rates and yield of major taxes are concentrated in thehands of the central government, and the greater the influence of the treasury See in particular Memorandum of H.M. Treasury on The Scope for Further delegation of Fiscal and Economic Powers and Memorandum of H.M. Treasury on The Scope for regional Devolution of Expenditure.
over both the total amount and the economic composition (expenditure on goods and services on current and capital account, transfer payments, andpurchases of existing assets) of spending by all layers of government. However,this line of argument prompts one to ask the question why it happens to bethe case that major countries with devolved systems of government manageto be at least as successful (and in some cases more successful) at stabilisingtheir economies with high rates of employment and a lower rate of inflation and, furthermore, how far one can accept the conclusion of various fiscalexperts that our budgetary policy in the 1960s de-stabilised rather than stabilisedthe economy1. A plausible answer might be that British policy aims are more extensive and more difficult to achieve than those of other governments and thatfiscal devolution in the 1960s would have merely added to the problems of promoting these aims. This matter would have to be investigated furtherif any form of fiscal devolution worth the name were to be contemplated.Still, the Treasury evidence only gives one side of the picture, and does not, forexample consider how far, if devolution were a reality, alternative policyinstruments to promote demand management might be developed or improved,e.g. monetary management.28. Despite reservations about the line of argument pursued by theTreasury, it is soon apparent that the scheme for devolution of public financegoes a long way towards satisfying the Treasury criteria for adequate control for demand management purposes. No major tax associated with demand management policy would be devolved, the central government would stillapprove the size of regional spending and would have full information on expenditure plans which might fall outside its direct control.29. While it is accepted that control over the total budget of the public authori-ties may be necessary for stabilising the economy as a whole, we have to considerwhether intermediate governments could have any part to play in regulatingincomes and employment within their own borders by fiscal means. Intermediategovernments have clearly more limited means at their disposal for this purpose,for unlike the central government, they cannot finance deficits by monetaryexpansion. With no tariff barriers and a common currency, any expansionarymeasures which they may be able to institute will have spillover effects on other regions. General refiationary measures in Scotland may increase English as wellas Scots incomes, causing perhaps limited expansion of employment in theformer area and upward pressure on prices in English areas of high employment.If regional purchasing policies in a depressed region are carefully chosen inorder to maximise employment within the region, a policy conflict may develop.In the short run, regional incomes and employment may be increased, but inthe long run the cost of public services may be higher than it would otherwise have been if an intermediate government had bought from efficient firmsregardless of their location.30. The power and the incentive to regulate the regional economy for stabilisation-tion purposes would be limited in the system, given the budgetary meansavailable, but this does not mean that an intermediate government need have1 See, for example, Richard and Peggy Musgrave, &quot;Fiscal Policy&quot;, Britain&apos;s economic prospects, Washington, 1968, and Bent Hansen (assisted by Wayne Snyder), Fiscal Policy inSeven Countries, 1955-65, O.E.C.D., Paris, 1969.
no part to play in stabilisation policies designed to affect conditions in itsjurisdiction. Indeed, the scheme of devolution presupposes that regions wouldbe responsible for the detailed execution of central government policy designedto improve economic conditions in the regions. Thus if the existing range offinancial inducements to firms to choose sites in areas of high unemploymentwere continued, regional administrations need not merely be spending agents of the central government, but could be given the power to decide on priorities in grant allocations, subject to overall guidance from the centre. It would alsobe desirable for intermediate governments to be consulted on the siting of central government projects, e.g. defence establishments, which are likelyto have an impact on the regional economy.The distribution of incomes31. As Dr. King1 shows, under some financial schemes which would be compatible with executive devolution, ability to vary the rates of tax and the size and composition of particular kinds of spending, notably social services,could have a significant impact on the real income of households on all categories of the income scale. His examples, however, relate to a degree offiscal independence which is far greater than is envisaged here. On the incomeside of the account, independent fiscal powers of intermediate governments would be limited to the institution of taxes which would not yield a large enough proportion of their revenue to exercise a significant effect on income distribution. In principle, the equalisation grant system could produce a major change in the inter-regional and also personal income distribution, but such changes could only be instituted if the central government itself wished to change its distributional objectives, using regional finance as a vehicle for doing so.32. It is the essence of the scheme that regions should be given as muchfreedom as possible in the allocation of their expenditure, once their totalspending had been agreed with the centre. It is therefore conceivable that changes in the composition of spending on social and economic services might take place which would alter their distributional impact from that whichobtains under the present centralised system of provision. As argued inparagraph 20 above, predicting precisely what changes in the composition of spending would take place would be extremely hazardous and, in addition,there are formidable difficulties encountered in measuring the distributionalimpact of government spending. It seems reasonable to suppose that politicalpressures on regional governments through their assemblies would preventchanges in spending patterns which were consciously designed to affect adverselythose at the lower end of the income scale. The fact remains, nevertheless, that unless the central government is empowered to enforce minimum standards foreach major economic or social service in the regions, it may have to introducecorrective fiscal and other measures to offset the effects of regional patterns of spending. The problem would then be one of finding measures which wereselective enough in their impact in order to offset undesired changes withinregions.1 Dr. David King, op, cit., Part One, I, IV.
IV. Conclusion33. It has been constantly emphasised in this Appendix that once it is accepted that greater public involvement in political decision making is an end in itself,and to the extent that this requires devolution of power, difficulties in imple-menting other policy aims may be regarded as a price worth paying. In so faras it has been possible to present a detailed financial system which would operate in every region, it has been shown that these difficulties may not be soformidable as they may appear at first sight. The central government could stillexercise firm control over the allocation of resources and be in a position to operate a demand management policy on much the same sort of lines as atpresent. Regions could influence distributional patterns through alterations inthe composition of public expenditure, but political pressures seem likely toprevent them doing so in a way which would adversely affect those with mostto lose from any such alterations. Regions with fiscal independence of the kinddescribed may even help to achieve other national policy aims more effectively.With the &quot;interlocking principle&quot; in mind, regions could play a positive partin resource allocation by their more direct access to knowledge of the public&apos;stastes and preferences for particular government services and through theirspecialised knowledge of economic and social conditions within their jurisdic-tions.
A FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCHEME1introduction1. The object of this Appendix is to present a scheme of financial and economic arrangements which complements the constitutional system set out in Chapter VIand facilitates the fulfilment of the principles on which that system is based.2. The central proposal in that chapter is that a number of intermediate level Governments should be created. These would be democratically controlled and would:(a) take control of, and responsibility for, the &quot;outposts&quot; of central govern-ment, such as the D.O.E. regional offices, and the non-commercial adhoc authorities such as the Regional Health Authorities, in their areas;(b) have some supervisory responsibilities for the commercial and industrialad hoc authorities;(c) . devise policies for the good government of their respective areas withinthe framework of the legislation and the overall policies of the U.K.Parliament, with which they would be &quot;inter-locked&quot; rather than havingindependent legislative powers of their own.In short, all relevant administrative activity at the intermediate level would bebrought together, co-ordinated by, and made the responsibility of, directly elected intermediate authorities. The central task of this Appendix is to settleon the set of financial and economic powers with which these authorities shouldbe endowed.3. A number of questions present themselves immediately. To what extentshould the Intermediate Level Governments (referred to hereafter as I.L.G.s)be permitted autonomously to vary the amount and the pattern of theexpenditures? Where would their revenue come from? Should they be giventhe power to levy their own taxes ? If so, what types of taxes would be appro-priate, and at what rates should they be levied ? What should be the nature ofthe relationship between each I.L.G. and the central government? How can the inescapable need of certain intermediate areas for financial help from thecentre be accommodated without undue restriction on the independence of the intermediate authorities concerned? And how can the degree of financial andeconomic independence which is undoubtedly required at the intermediate level, if the intentions of the system of constitutional reform which has been proposed are to be realised, be reconciled with the requirement that thecentral government should continue to be responsible for the management ofthe national economy, and should continue to have the means to fulfil this responsibility ?1 See Chapter VI, paragraph 263.
4. These are formidable problems. In seeking a general solution to them,however, a starting point is provided by the set of principles enunciated in chapter IV:-(a) Changes in our system of government should not weaken the economicand political unity of the United Kingdom.(b) Decisions made at central government level must be limited to thosewhich cannot without proven detriment to efficiency be made at a lower level, and each level of government must be subject to democraticcontrol.(c) Levels of decision making should be &quot;inter-locked&quot; so that officials and representatives at one level of government are able directly toparticipate in the decision-making process of the immediately superiorlevel.(d) Economic resources should be directed in such a way that all partsof the U.K. have the means of enjoying equality of standards in serviceslike health and education, and presumably also in opportunities for employment.5. The financial and economic scheme set out in this Appendix is designed to embody the principles set out above. To meet the first two principles^the schemeseeks to endow the I.L.G.S with the maximum degree of financial and economicindependence consistent with the continued ability of the central governmentto manage the U.K. economy as a whole, and to retain responsibility for thegeneral level of employment, the national economy&apos;s rate of growth, and thestate of the balance of payments. The procedures which are suggested are consistent with the third principle, whilst the fourth has an essential role ingoverning expenditure at the intermediate level.6. The financial and economic scheme set out in this Appendix not onlymatches the requirements of the constitutional model and embodies theprinciples outlined in paragraph 4 above, it also produces distinct economicand financial benefits of its own: (a) First, the suggested system of financial and economic arrangementsprovides the I.L.G.S with a considerable degree of independence.It is proposed that they be permitted, subject to minimal supervisionfrom the centre, to determine the pattern of their expenditures.Further, each I.L.G. is given the responsibility of planning thefuture development of its area, and is provided with the means, afternegotiation with the central government in accordance with principleat paragraph 4 (c) above, to see that the provisions of its plan are fulfilled. And, thirdly, each I.L.G. is given the power to levy its own taxes,and to influence the rates at which these taxes are set. By the judicioususe of the powers of expenditure and taxation granted to it, the I.L.G.may by its own efforts alter the rate of growth and the level of unemploy-ment in its area.(b) Secondly, the central governments ability to manage the national economy and achieve the major goals of domestic economic policy full employment, a faster rate of growth, a satisfactory balance ofpayments is enhanced more than it is impaired by the scheme of
regional finance set out here. The economic case for the type of devolution-tion proposed in this Appendix is that the setting up of a number of intermediate authorities, together with a system of regional finance and expenditure, creates new opportunities to improve the efficiency ofeconomic management. In essence, the case is that:(i) Inroads may be made into the problem of regional unemploymentby utilising the techniques of demand management at the intermediate level. It is explained in paragraph 29 that the difficulties which this might be expected to create for the Treasury in its attempts tocontrol the pressure of demand over the economy as a whole couldadequately be overcome. If the differences in unemployment ratesin different parts of the country were significantly reduced, theTreasury&apos;s task of overall demand management would becomeeasier, and for the first time there might be something like full employment in all parts of the U.K.(ii) The setting up of a number of I.L.G.S responsible for planning thedevelopment of the intermediate areas, in consultation with thecentral government, makes possible the creation of a fully viablesystem of national planning. Such a system would put the U.K. onthe road to achieving many of the goals which the old national plan defined but had not the means to attain. Then the nation&apos;sseemingly immutable &quot;underlying rate of growth&quot;, which has been so low for so long, might begin to rise.7. It is claimed then that the financial and economic scheme which is putforward in this Appendix to complement the system of constitutional reformproposed in Chapter VI is capable not only of providing the intermediate level governments which have been suggested with considerable independencefrom the central government, but also of enhancing the ability of the centralgovernment to achieve the objectives which it pursues at present and for whichit will continue to hold responsibility: full employment, a solution to the regional problem, a more efficient allocation of resources, a more rapid rateof economic growth.general outline of the scheme8. It is necessary to give a general outline of the proposed financial andeconomic system before considering its various provisions in detail. This is because the main aspects of the scheme planning responsibilities, expenditurecontrol, revenue powers, techniques of demand management are inter-related,and it is necessary to understand the relationship of each to the whole systembefore the reasons behind the particular arrangements proposed can be appreciated. What follows, then, is a summary statement of the scheme: a full discussion of it is given in the next section.9. The starting point is planning. Each intermediate level government wouldbe required to draw up a set of projections of the likely development of its areaover the next five years, assuming the continuation of &quot;present policies&quot;.
Estimates of the demand for each of the public services under the control ofthe I.L.G. would be made on the basis of projections of likely demographicchanges and industrial developments. The I.L.G.S would then enter into negotiations with the Treasury and establish a set of &quot;reasonable standards&quot;of service for each of the categories of expenditure education, health, water and so on for which they were responsible. Estimates of the cost per headof meeting these standards in each area would then be made, whereupon thetotal amount of expenditure on each category of public expenditure adminis-tered by each I.L.G. would be fixed. Hence the total expenditure of each I.L.G.on public services in its area would be fixed, and the &quot;demand effects&quot; of this,or the claim on the area&apos;s resources represented by this could be estimated,over the period of the plan. Given the totals, each I.L.G. would be permitted to determine the pattern of its expenditures as it wished. Decisions about thiswould be taken in the course of an Intermediate Expenditure Survey procedure,which each I.L.G. would follow, and which would be similar to the public expenditure Survey which takes place at national level at present. When theI.L.G. had settled on the allocation it desired, the Treasury would again be consulted with the object of ensuring that the sum of I.L.G. expenditureintentions did not represent too severe a demand on any particularly scarceresources. Totals and allocations then finalised, projections of actual I.L.G.expenditure could be published for the next five years, and the five-year forecasts of expenditure would be rolled forward every year against the background of the regional development plans, the procedure for finalising which has still to be described.10. How is the expenditure of each I.L.G. to be financed? The proposal isthat it should be financed partly from a mix of supplementary taxes levied inthe intermediate area itself, and partly from an equalisation grant from thecentral government. The particular mix of taxes which is desirable is discussed in the next section. The rates at which the taxes should be levied and the size of the central government grant to each I.L.G. would be fixed in the followingway. Attention would first be focussed on the area with the lowest level of public expenditure per head, which in the present situation would also be the mostprosperous area, the South East. A decision would be reached that perhapsthree-quarters of its expenditure, the total of which has already been fixed inthe manner described, should be met from its own resources, say by supple-mentary taxes on income, sales or value-added, and the rates of these taxeswould be set in the negotiations to provide a revenue of this amount. The ratesof nationally levied income tax and VAT would be adjusted downwards tothe extent necessary to leave the level of demand for the goods and services ofthe South East unaltered, i.e., full employment in the South East would bemaintained. As a working hypothesis, these rates of national and supplementaryI.L.G. taxation would be applied to all the other areas, which could thenrequire the central government to grant them sufficient money to bridge the gap between the revenue gleaned from these sources and the agreed totals of intermediate expenditure.11. At this point, it is possible to take advantage of the opportunities for regional stabilisation created by the establishment of a system of regional finance.Returning to the development plans which had been drawn up initially, on the
assumption of the continuation of present policies, modifications to those planswould be made by the I.L.G.s in the light of the decisions as to the total andpattern of intermediate expenditures, and estimates of the likely growth of demand in each area over the planning period would be made, in the light ofthe decisions about tax rates. Undoubtedly, but to varying degrees, areas otherthan the South East would find that their resources were to be under-utilisedand that they were to suffer some degree of unemployment the regionalproblem which is so familiar over the planning period. A decision would thenbe taken, again in consultation with the Treasury, as to the desirable &quot;average&quot;or &quot;trend&quot; rate of unemployment, abstracting from cyclical movements, and a figure such as 2 per cent, might be fixed upon for an &quot;average&quot; year. Each I.L.G.would then be given the choice either of pitching its supplementary tax ratesbelow those of the South East in order to stimulate demand in its area, or ofincreasing public expenditure, or of opting for a combination of both things,according to which course was the most appropriate under the particular circumstances. If there was a general deficiency of demand, for instance, altera-tion of tax rates would be desirable, whereas if unemployment was highlylocalised, public expenditure directed to the areas concerned might be the answer. Which course was followed would be a matter for the I.L.G. itself todecide, although it might wish to make use of the expertise available to it inthe Treasury, and the budget deficit required to reduce regional unemployment to 2 per cent, would be financed by a grant from the central government madespecifically for this purpose a &quot;supplementary stabilisation grant&quot;.12. The effects of these decisions would be incorporated into the I.L.G.sdevelopment plans, which would now assume their final form. The wholeplanning exercise would be repeated every three years, although the projectionseach time would cover a five-year period: this would ensure that there were always at least three planned years to serve as a background to the IntermediateExpenditure Surveys which would be carried out each year. For each planningexercise, new equalisation formulae would be produced, standards presumablybeing revised upwards as the economy grew, and new expenditure totals fixed.Supplementary tax rates and differentials would be reassessed, but the object would be to alter these as infrequently as possible so as to interfere with theTreasury&apos;s attempts at national demand management as little as possible. Theprincipal problem associated with attempts to manage the pressure of demand at the intermediate level is the &quot;spill-over&quot; problem-changes in the level of demand engineered in its own area by any one I.L.G. would to some extent-spill over into the other intermediate areas in an unpredictable fashion, therebymaking it extremely difficult for the other I.L.G.s to formulate sensible demand management policies of their own, and for the Treasury to manage the economy as a whole. However, as is explained in detail in paragraph 29, this problem canbe substantially overcome. The central suggestion there set out is that a reason-ably stable differential structure of intermediate level tax rates and expenditurepolicies should be established which would adjust the levels of demand and activity in the different areas, equalising as far as possible the rates of employ-ment in each. Changes in the structure, once established, would be madeinfrequently, and in a properly co-ordinated manner. The Treasury would thusremain free to pursue national policies of demand management, as it does at
present, and regulate the growth of demand for the economy as a whole, buton the basis of a differential system of intermediate level payments.13. Finally, it should be pointed out that the system outlined here is entirelyconsistent with the principles set out in paragraph 4. The economic unity ofthe U.K. is not weakened: the Treasury retains the means to manage thenational economy. The I.L.G.S are given the maximum freedom consistent withthis: they are given control over the pattern of their expenditures, the ability to plan the future of their areas and significant influence over the rates ofsupplementary taxation which are levied. The procedures suggested accord withthe third principle, the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot;, and the fourth plays the keypart in the establishments of expenditure totals for each area, from which allelse follows.details of the scheme14. Now that the general outline of the scheme has been set out it is possibleto consider each of the main categories of concern in detail, and to explain thereasoning behind the recommendations.Planning15. The intermediate area plans are omnipresent in the procedure outlined in the previous section. The process begins with a set of estimates of thedevelopment of the area &quot;on present policies&quot;; these estimates are modified as the relevant decisions about expenditure allocation, taxation and stabilisationare taken by the I.L.G.s; and at the end of the day there exists a complete and comprehensive intermediate area plan. It is worth enquiring what the nature and aims of a plan of this type should be, and highlighting the advantages of a planning mechanism of the type which is being suggested.16. The purpose of the intermediate level plan is to ensure that expenditure at the intermediate level is allocated more rationally, and matches regionalneeds when projections of the likely development of the private sector of the intermediate economy are taken into account. At present, as is illustrated at length in Chapter V, governmental and more general administrative activity iscarried on at the intermediate level by a multiplicity of different bodies the regional &quot;outposts&quot; of central government departments, planning councils,and ad hoc bodies both commercial and non-commercial. There is a clearneed to co-ordinate their work, and the most rational context in which to do this is within the framework of a comprehensive intermediate area plan. Inaddition to co-ordinating the work of these bodies, it is also necessary to rationalise the plethora of measures designed to counter the &quot;regionalproblem&quot;. A more effective way of dealing with this has of course been putforward in the previous section but it might still be very helpful to retain thevarious inducements to investment and employment in the regions for use inconjunction with the I.L.G. economic plans. Financial inducements might beselectively employed, although grants and allowances would have to be available on the same terms and at the same rates in the different areas; and the physical1 When changes in the differential system did have to be made, spill-over effects would beminimised by a judicious choice of tax instruments and use of public expenditure forstabilisation purposes; again: this is explained in detail in paragraph 29.
inducements which have been used- the provision of &quot;advance factory units&quot;,the siting of new towns, the establishment of training centres, and so on, arethe essence of planning, and would no doubt comprise the section of the planfinanced from the &quot;supplementary stabilisation grant&quot; from the central govern-ment referred to in paragraph 11.17. An I.L.Gs.&apos; economic plan is a method of co-ordinating and rationalisingthe various types of expenditure made at the intermediate level. More than this,however, it sets out the likely economic development of the whole area, andsets spending plans in the context of this. What should the nature of such a plan be ? It is clear that it should not be a highly detailed document, providingtargets for industries and sectors as did the old National Plan. It should be concerned more broadly with strategies of area development, attempting to foresee what types of action would be necessary at the intermediate level tocover a series of possible eventualities. Forecasts should be built up on a variety of different assumptions and the plan should be as flexible as possible to enableaction to be adjusted to circumstances as they unfold. The approach of thelatest Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 5178) is instructive. There, althoughquite precise estimates of Public Expenditure are set out for the next five years,the figures are set in the context of different assumptions about the rate ofcreation of resources over the medium term, and no attempt is made to provideprecise forecasts of movements in the main economic aggregates. An inter-mediate economic plan, then, would take close account of the likely economic developments in the area concerned, but would not stand or fall on the basisof precise forecasts or targets; it would be concerned with strategies and retainsufficient flexibility to accommodate the contingencies arising in an uncertainfuture.18. The series of intermediate area plans would become a system of national planning as soon as an attempt was made to co-ordinate them at the centre,as would necessarily be the case. Individual I.L.G.S would not be permitted to make indiscriminate claims on scarce resources without due regard for theneeds of other areas. Many important alloeative decisions could only be taken at national level where the relative needs of different regions could be judgedand where the total demand for resources could be brought into line with the capacity of the nation to produce them. There must necessarily be consultation between intermediate authorities and the central government (in accordancewith the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot;). It is suggested here that the procedure wouldbe that the I.L.G.S would have the responsibility for drawing up their plans,for identifying problems and proposing solutions to them the initiative would rest with them but that the central government would have the responsibilityfor reconciling competing claims on resources and in the last resort could have the power to cancel particular I.L.G. proposals altogether. However,lest this should give rise to concern, it should be remembered that the I.L.G.S,as directly elected bodies with a mandate from the electorate to pursue specificpolicies, would be in a very strong bargaining position in negotiations with theTreasury.19. The I.L.G. plans would therefore be drawn up in consultation with thecentre, where they would be co-ordinated, and reconciled with the assessment of the progress of the economy as a whole in the medium term, the amount of
resources available in total for public expenditure, investment, and so on.The concept of national planning which emerges is a novel one. It is planning&quot;from the ground up&quot;, and therefore quite different in kind from the oldNational Plan, which was imposed on the economy from on high and thereforebore no relation to what was happening therein. The National Plan failedbecause it lacked the means of implementation. The system of national planning,on the other hand, which emerges from the co-ordination of a number of inter-mediate plans, themselves drawn up in the face of likely developments in theprivate sector of the economy, and taking account of the reaction of the public sector to them, is in contrast a fully viable planning mechanism, and provides the means for a more rational allocation of resources than this country hasenjoyed before. Considering the wider implications, it provides the means to achieve the goals which the National Plan failed to achieve, not the least ofwhich is a more rapid rate of economic growth.Expenditure20. At present, the Governments expenditure policies are administered andexecuted at the regional level by departmental regional offices, through regional boards of various types, and in vague and tenuous conjunction with the regional planning councils. Under the proposals set out in Chapter.VI the I.L.G.s,being empowered to co-ordinate and administer these expenditure policies,would become responsible for at least half of the central governments presentexpenditure on supply services.21. According to the procedure set out in paragraph 9, a set of &quot;reasonablestandards&quot; of service for each of the categories of expenditure for which theywere responsible would be established by the I.L.G.s in negotiation with theTreasury. These, together with estimates of the cost per head of meeting thesestandards in each area, would fix the totals of expenditure to be undertaken bythe various I.L.G.s. It may be asked why this procedure in particular should befollowed in fixing the totals of I.L.G. expenditure. The answer is that it is inaccordance with principle (d) of paragraph 4 of this Appendix, which statesthat &quot;economic resources should be directed in such a way that all parts of theU.K. have the means of enjoying equality of standards in services like health and education&quot;. It does not say that all parts of the U.K. should necessarilyenjoy equality of standards, but should have the opportunity of estabhshingsuch standards if they so desire. Now an alternative procedure would be forthe central government to stipulate &quot;minimum standards&quot; which had to be observed throughout the country. However, there is little doubt that this would lead the central government to scrutinise the intermediate authorities&apos; affairsfairly closely, and would therefore detract from the avowed aim of giving theI.L.G.s as much independence from the central government as possible,consistent with the continued ability of the central government to manage theU.K. economy as a whole. Under the procedure set out in paragraph 9 the totals of public expenditure in each intermediate area are defined and fixed,which is highly convenient from the Treasury&apos;s point of view for the management of the domestic economy; secondly, the I.L.G.s have freedom to allocate the totals of expenditure as they wish between different categories, free from the scrutiny from the centre which the alternative proposal would entail; and thirdly, there is no reason to believe that the procedure as set out in this Appendix
will lead to unacceptable inequalities in the standards of service provided indifferent intermediate areas; after all, the I.L.G.S are subject to democraticcontrol and therefore will be responsive to any grievances arising on this score.22. Having established the desirable method of fixing the totals of I.L.G.expenditure, it is necessary to enter a qualifying note. It is probably the case that the relevant figure for control purposes is not the total of I.L.G. expenditurein &quot;cost&quot; terms, to use official parlance i.e. the total amount of money whichis actually spent but in &quot;demand&quot; terms-i.e. the demand for goods and services to which this expenditure gives rise. These two figures are not identical.In so far, for instance, as transfer payments are saved by people, or flow backto the government in taxes, they do not lead to an increase in the demand for goods and services produced by the economy. Various types of public expendi-ture give rise to &quot;leakages&quot; from the flow of spending of this kind, but to different extents, which is to say that different types of public expenditurecause the level of demand for goods and services to rise by different amounts.Now it is the demand effect of public expenditure which the Treasury is primarilyinterested in in connection with its stabilisation policy, the object of whichis to equate the level of demand in the economy with the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services, thereby producing full employment.Therefore, when total expenditure has been fixed for a particular I.L.G., itwill not in fact be appropriate for that authority to reallocate its expenditure between different categories and maintain the same total of expenditure &quot;in cost terms&quot;; it will have to maintain the total &quot;in demand terms&quot;, which mayentail some alteration of the money outlay. This is really just a technical matter.No issue of principle is involved. Each I.L.G. is still perfectly free to allocateits expenditure as it wishes, but the total it is required to maintain if it does sois not the most obvious one.23. The freedom of the I.L.G.S to allocate a significant proportion of thenation&apos;s resources as they wish should not be under-emphasised. Within thegiven totals, the decisions on which the annual Intermediate ExpenditureSurveys are based are their decisions, and their expenditure is allocated inaccordance with their priorities which may well differ from those of the nation as a whole.Taxation and stabilisation24. In the general outline of the scheme, it was suggested that the expenditureof each I.L.G. should be financed partly from a mix of supplementary taxes leviedin the intermediate area itself, and partly from a grant made by the centralgovernment. Each intermediate level government would:(a) levy a supplementary income tax;(b) levy either a supplementary VAT, or a sales tax;(c) receive the proceeds of the whole of the vehicle excise duty and petrol&apos; duty levied in the area;(d) receive a grant from the central government based on an equalisationformula of the type already discussed.It is envisaged that the independent revenue provided by (a), (p) and (c) would amount to more than half of the money required to finance the expenditure
of the I.L.G., and that (d) would follow quite automatically in whatever amountwas required to bridge the gap between the agreed expenditure total and thesum total of the independent revenues.25. The rates at which these taxes would be levied would be decided firstin the manner described in paragraph 10, the initial objective being, as described in that paragraph, to fix them at rates which would enable the most prosperousregion, at present the South East, to derive a fixed proportion, perhaps two-thirdsor three-quarters of its required revenue from these sources. The desired pro-portion would first be stipulated. Exactly what it would be is not important,but it is suggested that it should significantly exceed half of required revenue.This proportion then given, and the revenue from (c) being given also, the ratesbeing fixed by the central government, the only remaining task is to choose the rates at which to levy the supplementary taxes, of which there would be two. It is preferable for reasons connected with stabilisation policy which areexplained below, that these should be income tax and value-added tax, butincome tax and an intermediate sales tax would be an alternative combination,though second-best. The decision, then, which has to be reached at this pointconcerns the desired balance of direct and indirect taxation in the area, whichaffects directly the distribution, of income in the community. Now the distribu-tion of income is clearly a matter which should be decided by the centralgovernment. Discussion of the distribution of the national product between different sectors of the community is the essence of the political debate. Itdivides the political parties at the most fundamental level, and the decision asto the desirable distribution of the national income is perhaps the most basicone taken by the central government. It is proposed here, therefore, that thecentral government should continue to retain responsibility in this area, andthat the ratio of supplementary income tax revenue to supplementary VATrevenue should be the same as that of national income tax to national VAT.This principle is sufficient to fix the supplementary rates of income tax andVAT. A supplementary rate of income tax at 10 per cent, together with a supplementary rate of VAT of 3 per cent., levied by the I.L.G. of the SouthEast, together with the revenue from vehicle excise duty and petrol duty in theSouth East, would provide at least three-quarters of the revenue required bythe I.L.G. of the South East. National rates of income tax and VAT would belowered accordingly. Then, following the procedure set out in paragraph 10,as a working hypothesis these rates of taxation would be applied to all other areas. If no adjustments for stabilisation purposes were required, the rates would be finalised, and the central government would be required to granteach area whatever further revenue were needed to finance the agreed total ofits expenditure.26. It has been suggested that it might be very difficult to levy a supplementaryVAT at the intermediate level. If it did indeed prove administrativelyimpossible, then it would be necessary for each I.L.G. to levy a retail sales tax.This would give a high yield at relatively low cost. The procedure for fixingits rate would be identical to that described in the previous paragraph and thenational rate of VAT would have to be reduced in the same way to compensate for the imposition of the sales tax. But for more general economic reasons, a supplementary intermediate level V.A.T. is to be preferred, for reasons whichemerge from the discussion of stabilisation policy which follows.
27. According to the procedure set out in paragraph 11, when the basic rates of supplementary taxation had been fixed in this way, it would then bepossible to take advantage of the new opportunities for the stimulation of growth in the intermediate areas and the elimination of regional unemploymentprovided by the establishment of a system of regional finance. Many I.L.G.S would find that associated with the rates of expenditure and taxation whichhad been decided was the likelihood of a fairly high &quot;average&quot; or &quot;trend&quot;rate of unemployment, i.e., abstracting from cyclical movements of output.It was suggested in paragraph 11, therefore, that after consultation with theTreasury, each I.L.G. might:(a) set its rates of supplementary taxation below those prevailing in theSouth East in order to stimulate demand;(b) increase its expenditure in ways most likely effectively to reduce therate of unemployment in its area;(c) do a combination of both these things;according to which course of action was most appropriate in the particular circumstances.28. The clear objection to allowing I.L.G.s to alter the rates of taxationwhich they levy in their areas, is that it may make the task of the Treasury inits attempts to manage the national economy and in particular the general level of demand more difficult. Intermediate economies would be very open,which is to say that a large part of the incomes earned in any intermediatearea is spent on goods produced in other intermediate areas. Hence the demandeffects of tax changes in one particular area cannot be contained within that area. For instance, if the Scottish I.L.G. were to lower the supplementaryrate of income tax in Scotland with the result that the rate of expenditure ofthe citizens of Scotland increased, many of the extra goods purchased wouldbe made in the different areas of England with the result that economic activitywould be stimulated in England, instead of in Scotland. This type of effect is known as a &quot;spill-over&quot; effect, and because spill-over effects would clearly be very difficult to trace out through the whole national economy, the general management of demand would become very much more difficult, and it wouldbe difficult also for each I.L.G. to know how to react to try to maintain theright level of demand in its own area in the face of other I.L.G.s&apos; efforts to stimulate demand in theirs, and the consequent spill-over effects.29. The system proposed here has been designed so as to minimise thevarious difficulties to which a regionally differentiated policy of demand management and stabilisation would give rise. It does so in the following ways: (a) Differential rates of I.L.G. supplementary taxation would be settled in the general planning exercise which has been described. The ratesdecided on would then be fixed and immutable until the next planningexercise, three years later. There is thus no question of I.L.G.s changing the rates of supplementary taxation frequently and at will, which wouldmake it very difficult for the Treasury adequately to control the general level of demand in the economy. It could be decided, indeed, to fixdifferentials in supplementary tax rates for six-year periods, to minimise
27. According to the procedure set out in paragraph 11, when the basic rates of supplementary taxation had been fixed in this way, it would then bepossible to take advantage of the new opportunities for the stimulation of growth in the intermediate areas and the elimination of regional unemploymentprovided by the establishment of a system of regional finance. Many I.L.G.S would find that associated with the rates of expenditure and taxation whichhad been decided was the likelihood of a fairly high &quot;average&quot; or &quot;trend&quot;rate of unemployment, i.e., abstracting from cyclical movements of output.It was suggested in paragraph 11, therefore, that after consultation with theTreasury, each I.L.G. might:(a) set its rates of supplementary taxation below those prevailing in theSouth East in order to stimulate demand;(b) increase its expenditure in ways most likely effectively to reduce therate of unemployment in its area;(c) do a combination of both these things;according to which course of action was most appropriate in the particular circumstances.28. The clear objection to allowing I.L.G.s to alter the rates of taxationwhich they levy in their areas, is that it may make the task of the Treasury inits attempts to manage the national economy and in particular the general level of demand more difficult. Intermediate economies would be very open,which is to say that a large part of the incomes earned in any intermediatearea is spent on goods produced in other intermediate areas. Hence the demandeffects of tax changes in one particular area cannot be contained within that area. For instance, if the Scottish I.L.G. were to lower the supplementaryrate of income tax in Scotland with the result that the rate of expenditure ofthe citizens of Scotland increased, many of the extra goods purchased wouldbe made in the different areas of England with the result that economic activitywould be stimulated in England, instead of in Scotland. This type of effect is known as a &quot;spill-over&quot; effect, and because spill-over effects would clearly be very difficult to trace out through the whole national economy, the general management of demand would become very much more difficult, and it wouldbe difficult also for each I.L.G. to know how to react to try to maintain theright level of demand in its own area in the face of other I.L.G.s&apos; efforts to stimulate demand in theirs, and the consequent spill-over effects.29. The system proposed here has been designed so as to minimise thevarious difficulties to which a regionally differentiated policy of demand management and stabilisation would give rise. It does so in the following ways: (a) Differential rates of I.L.G. supplementary taxation would be settled in the general planning exercise which has been described. The ratesdecided on would then be fixed and immutable until the next planningexercise, three years later. There is thus no question of I.L.G.s changing the rates of supplementary taxation frequently and at will, which wouldmake it very difficult for the Treasury adequately to control the general level of demand in the economy. It could be decided, indeed, to fixdifferentials in supplementary tax rates for six-year periods, to minimise
the spill-over disturbances produced by changes in tax rates, but a three-year review might be quite practicable. Essentially, then, the aim is notto create a system which would produce frequent and spontaneouschanges in rates of taxation, but to establish one which encompasseddifferential rates of taxation, subject to change infrequently and in aco-ordinated fashion. It would be hoped in this way to establish a stabledifferential structure of intermediate level rates of taxation, which wouldequalise the pressure of demand on resources throughout the economy,leaving it to the Treasury, through its manipulation of national ratesof taxation, to decide in general what that pressure should be. The&quot;spill-over&quot; problem is therefore substantially solved by the generalnature of the approach.(b) However, tax changes will periodically have to be made, and it is here that the virtues of a regional system of VAT stand out most clearly.The fiscal changes which reduce the spill-over problem to a minimumare those which stimulate the exports of the area in which they aremade. To the extent that the area exports are increased to other areasin the country, the effect of increasing imports from those areas iscancelled out. Spill-over is nullified, and the increase in demand is confined to the area where the tax change was made. Now, if an I.L.G.facing the prospect of unemployment in the area for which it was respon-sible were to reduce its supplementary rate of VAT, thereby reducingcosts of production relative to those prevailing in other areas, it would achieve all the beneficial effects of a regional devaluation, and its exports would increase to counterbalance the increase in area imports whichwould accompany the rise in internal area demand. This would thereforebe the ideal type of I.L.G. fiscal adjustment, leading to minimal inter-ference with the business of managing the economy as a whole. It is recommended therefore that each I.L.G., in addition to levying a supplementary income tax, should also levy a supplementary VATto which advantages are attached which would not be shared by a retailsales tax.(c) It is also recommended in paragraph 11 that each I.L.G. should be ableto deploy part of its expenditure for stabilisation purposes. There area number of advantages in this. In the first place, where unemployment is localised, directing expenditure to the area concerned is a more appropriate and effective measure than increasing the general levelof demand in the area by reducing taxes. Secondly, in so far as overthe years the fiscal system becomes constrained by &quot;harmonising&quot;regulations emanating from Brussels, public expenditure may have tobecome the principal instrument of demand management. Thirdly,however, in relation to the particular problem under consideration in this paragraph, public expenditure may be employed for stabilisationpurposes with minimal regional import effect. It could be used to pur-chase goods and services provided from within the area concerned,thereby leading to a much smaller spill-over to other areas than taxchanges which might be used alternatively to bring about an equivalentincrease in internal area demand.
30. The procedure would be therefore that a regionally differentiated structure of supplementary VAT rates and of supplementary income tax rates, associatedwith alterations in the levels of I.L.G. expenditures for stabilisation purposes,would then be established in negotiation with the Treasury, which would be concerned to co-ordinate the demand management policies of the I.L.G.Sand produce a rational and effective system of intermediate payments. If itwas the case that the ideal tax for these purposes, the supplementary VAT,was administratively too difficult to operate, then the various I.L.G.S would still be free to fix differential supplementary rates of income tax and the retailsales tax, again in consultation with the Treasury, and following the argumentspresented in paragraph 29, sections (a) and (c), demand management at the intermediate level would still be a perfectly viable and practical proposition,and the resulting structure of payments would be highly effective in eliminating the regional problem. With unemployment rates reasonably equal in thedifferent intermediate areas, the Treasury would continue to be free to managethe pressure of demand over the economy as a whole.31. The money required to finance the deficits incurred by the 1.L.G.S in pursuit of stabilisation policies agreed with the Treasury, would be providedby the central government in the form of &quot;supplementary stabilisation grants&quot;specifically for this purpose.conclusion32. It has generally been believed that the establishment of intermediate level authorities in this country with a significant amount of financial andeconomic independence from the central government would seriously impair the ability of the central government to achieve the major objectives of national economic policy full employment, an efficient allocation of the nation&apos;resources, a satisfactory rate of economic growth; in short, that it wouldmake the management of the national economy much more difficult.33. The financial and economic system set out in this Appendix would providethe Intermediate Level Governments which have been proposed with a consider-able degree of financial and economic independence from the central government,whilst at the same time improving the ability of the central government to achieve its aims for the whole economy.34. The impact which the constitutional reforms proposed in Chapters VIand VII, when complemented by the scheme of financial and economic arrange-ments recommended in this Appendix, would have on the efficiency of govern-ment and the allocation of resources, the level of employment and the regionalproblem, and the overall rate of economic growth, should not be under-estimated. The proposed system of flexible economic planning at the inter-mediate, and out of this at the national, level would put us on the road toachieving as a nation many of the goals which the old National Plan set itselfbut had not the means to attain. The effective utilisation for the first time ofthe techniques of demand management at the intermediate level would transformthe situation of the less prosperous regions. For the first time, there would be something approaching full employment throughout the United Kingdom, andthe seemingly immutable &quot;underlying rate of growth&quot;, which has been somiserably low for so long, could begin to rise.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF EDUCATION AND HOUSING functions between THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT UNDERTHE SCHEME OUTLINED IN CHAPTER VIgeneral introduction. To test the viability of the scheme proposed in Chapter VI, it seemedprudent to make a number of detailed case studies. Two of these are presentedhere. They cover certain aspects of Education and Housing. They illustrate indetail the changes in the conduct of education j and housing policies whichwould follow from the creation of democratic assemblies in Scotland, wales and the English regions. They also list some of the education and housingfunctions which, under the scheme, the intermediate level governments wouldtake over from central government. - fj2. For ease of presentation, this Appendix has been divided into two parts.Part I deals mainly with feasibility problems. It shows how two Acts ofParliament would have to be redrafted to fit the scheme for democraticallyelected intermediate level governments; and it illustrates how the currentoperations of central government would change as a result of devolving someof its present housing and education functions to the intermediate level governments. Part II then draws together and presents in the form of a listthe various housing and education functions which, after a redrafting of thetwo Acts would, in future become the responsibility of the intermediate level governments.PART I. THE PROBLEMS AND IMPLICATIONS OF REDRAFTINGTWO ACTS OF PARLIAMENTintroduction3. The scheme for democratic Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the english regions proposed in Chapter VI leaves Whitehall and Westminster with ageneral legislative policy making role in all matters for the whole of the UnitedKingdom. It is thus quite distinct from the scheme of legislative devolutionfor Scotland and Wales recommended by the majority of our colleagues;under that scheme the United Kingdom Government would not be able to legislate at all on the wide range of subjects including housing, education,land, agriculture, etc. in which legislative power would be devolved to Welshand Scottish Parliaments. Nevertheless, it is an important part of the schemerecommended in Chapter VI that while the United Kingdom Government willcontinue to legislate and make general policy for the whole of the UnitedKingdom in all matters, it should do so in such a way as to leave the inter-mediate level governments with the widest possible scope for adapting thosepolicies to the special needs of their respective areas. There are various essential
ingredients in the scheme which will contribute to this end. For example, themain Whitehall departments will lose their regional outposts, the new provincialauthorities will be major political forces in their own right and they could have their own direct representation at Westminster1; together these will undoubtedly be a powerful constraint on any central government which soughtunduly to circumscribe the projected responsibilities of intermediate levelauthorities.4. The precise balance which needs to be achieved here between the respon-sibilities of the central government and those of the intermediate level authorities will best be reached gradually and pragmatically as will the similar precisebalance between the respective responsibilities of intermediate level governments and the local authorities. Some of the guiding principles for striking thosebalances have been set out in Chapter IV. Here in this part of the appendix the purpose is to illustrate by two case studies one in Education, the other in housing -how two Acts of Parliament would have to be redrafted to work  the scheme in Chapter VI. It illustrates, too, certain changes which, over theyears, will need to take place in the way we now make policy and legislate in whitehall and Westminster.education5. This case study is essentially based on an examination of the 1944Education Act. Its main concern is to show:(a) What functions undertaken by the Minister of Education under thatAct could and should be devolved to the intermediate level governments.(b) What problems would be involved in redrafting the Act to produce this new division of functions.(c) What consequences such a redrafting would have for:(i) the problem of ensuring that the central governments generaleducational policies are fully carried out in the territories of thevarious intermediate level governments;(ii) the present educational responsibilities of local authorities;(iii) the financial arrangements between Whitehall and the intermediate level governments;(iv) Ministerial responsibility and the work of the Department ofEducation;(v) the role of M.P.S and Parliament.6. In determining the functions to be devolved from the Ministry ofEducation to the intermediate level governments it needs to be emphasizedthat the purpose of the division is to:(a) leave the central government with the responsibility for major policymaking;(b) to reduce as much as possible the present burdens on central government;(c) to give intermediate level governments the maximum scope for adaptingthe policies of the central government to the special needs of their areas;1 These constraints are discussed in more detail in Chapter VII, paragraphs 297 to 307.

It illustrates, too, certain changes which, over theyears, will need to take place in the way we now make policy and legislate in whitehall and Westminster.education5. This case study is essentially based on an examination of the 1944Education Act. Its main concern is to show:(a) What functions undertaken by the Minister of Education under thatAct could and should be devolved to the intermediate level governments.(b) What problems would be involved in redrafting the Act to produce this new division of functions.(c) What consequences such a redrafting would have for:(i) the problem of ensuring that the central governments generaleducational policies are fully carried out in the territories of thevarious intermediate level governments;(ii) the present educational responsibilities of local authorities;(iii) the financial arrangements between Whitehall and the intermediate level governments;(iv) Ministerial responsibility and the work of the Department ofEducation;(v) the role of M.P.s and Parliament.6. In determining the functions to be devolved from the Ministry ofEducation to the intermediate level governments it needs to be emphasizedthat the purpose of the division is to:(a) leave the central government with the responsibility for major policymaking;(b) to reduce as much as possible the present burdens on central government;(c) to give intermediate level governments the maximum scope for adaptingthe policies of the central government to the special needs of their areas;1 These constraints are discussed in more detail in Chapter VII, paragraphs 297 to 307.
id) to devolve from central government to intermediate level governments as much as possible of the administrative decision-making now carriedout at departmental headquarters or in their regional outposts.Problems involved in redrafting the 1944 Education Act to match the scheme in chapter VI7. Four main groups of problems are involved in redrafting the 1944Education Act to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 6 above. they arise because:(a) the Act lays down both major and minor policies;(b) while some major and minor policies are sometimes specified in theAct in great detail and with great precision, others are outlined ingeneral terms only, with the Minister of Education left to fill in thedetails either by statutory instruments or by a system of Ministerial&quot;approvals&quot; and circulars;(c) some of the main policies pursued under the Act are not actuallycontained in the Act, nor are they the product of the various statutory instruments which the Act authorises the Minister to make;id) the Act imposes on the Minister a number of functions which can best be classified as administrative, executive or quasi-judicial.The problems posed by the points (a)-(d) above are illustrated in the following paragraphs. In some cases their solution calls for very little alteration in existingpractices. But others involve far-reaching changes in the way in which we nowconduct our affairs; which indicates how radical and far-reaching the full implications of the scheme proposed in Chapter VI really are.8. As fair as the mixture of major and minor policies is concerned, a range ofexamples will suffice. Thus:(a) The Act lays down that &quot;public education shall be organised in threeprogressive stages to be known as primary education, secondary education and further education; and it shall be the duty of the local educationauthority for every area ... (to) secure that efficient education throughoutthese stages shall be available to meet the needs of the population of their area&quot;. In fulfilling this duty local authorities have, among other things,to have regard to &quot;the need for securing that primary and secondary education are provided in separate schools&quot;. (Clause 8.)(b) &quot;In this Act the expression &apos;compulsory school age&apos; means any agebetween 5 years and 15 years, and accordingly a person shall be deemedto be of compulsory school age if he has attained the age of 5 years andhas not attained the age of 15 years and a person shall be deemed to be over compulsory school age as soon as he has attained the age of 15years&quot;. (Clause 35.)(c) &quot;No fees shall be charged in respect of admission to any school main-tained by a local education authority, or to any county college, or inrespect of the education provided in any such school or college&quot;.(Clause 61 (1).)
(d) &quot;When it appears to a local education authority that a registered pupilat any school maintained by them is unable by reason of the inadequacy of his clothing to take full advantage of the education provided at theschool, the authority may provide him with such clothing as, in theopinion of the authority, is necessary for the purpose of ensuring thathe is sufficiently clad while he remains a pupil at the school&quot;. (Clause 51.)And . . . &quot;the authority shall require the parent to pay to the authority in respect thereof such sums, if any, as in the opinion of the authorityhe is able without financial hardship to pay&quot;. (Clause 62.)(e) &quot;A local authority may pay the reasonable travelling expenses of anypupil in attendance at any school or county college or at any suchcourse or class as aforesaid for whose transport no arrangements aremade under this section&quot;. (Clause 55 (2).)(/) &quot;The minutes of the proceedings of the managers or governors of any country school or voluntary school shall be open to inspection by thelocal education authority&quot;. (Clause 21 (3).)Clearly in any redrafting of the Education Act there could be a good deal of argument as to whether some of the policies of the kind laid down above wouldbe better left to the discretion of intermediate level governments, or even localauthorities. If the central government concerns itself too much with &quot;minor&quot;policy questions the. scope of intermediate level governments might be undulycircumscribed. On the other hand, if the central government includes in itslegislation only the most major policy questions, this might result in the adoptionin different parts of the United Kingdom of a multitude of differences on matters which in the interests of the-political and economic unity of the United Kingdomthere ought to be much more uniformity. It is, in essence, the same problem which the central government faces now in any Act of Parliament which givesfunctions and responsibilities to local authorities; so it can hardly be thought to be insuperable as the majority of our colleagues seem to think. The main principles to be applied here to determine the relative spheres of central and intermediate level governments have been set out in various parts of our report; they can be summarised here as follows: (a) central government should limit itself to determining those issues ofpolicy on which it is essential for the economic and political unity of theUnited Kingdom that there should be absolute uniformity throughoutthe whole of the United Kingdom;(b) in the interests of efficiency and democratic control the present load oncentral government must be reduced as much as possible;(c) governmental and policy decisions should be made as near as possibleto people affected by them always provided that such decisions will affect only those within the ambit of the authority which takes them;(d) the essential role of intermediate level governments is to handle and take decisions on problems which can be best comprehended and, therefore,solved at that level.The application of these principles is, in the last analysis, a political question.So in any redrafting of the 1944 Education Act to devolve as much as possible from central to intermediate level governments and give the latter the greatest possible scope for adapting central government policies to the special needs of
their areas, there would clearly be a considerable amount of discussion between these different levels of government. And since the intermediate level govern-ments would have a very substantial political weight of their own, one would expect in the end that a mutually satisfactory political bargain would be struckbroadly in line with the principles enunciated above. But whatever bargainswere made here, the intermediate level governments would still, as later partsof this Appendix show, be left with substantial educational responsibilities.9. A more complex group of problems is presented by the point at 5 (b)above the fact that both major and minor policies are sometimes outlined inthe Act in general terms only, with the Minister of Education being left to fillin the details either by statutory instruments or by a system of Ministerial&quot;approvals&quot; or circulars. There are really two quite separate problems here.The filling in of details by statutory instruments has implications for the scheme outlined in Chapter VI which are very different from those which arise from thesystem of Ministerial approvals and circulars. It is best, therefore, to considereach separately.10. The following are typical examples of where the Act lays down policies in fairly general terms leaving the details to be filled in subsequently by regulations:(a) (i) &quot;The Minister shall make regulations defining the several categories of pupils requiring special educational treatment and making provision as to the special methods appropriate for the education of pupils of each category,(ii) The arrangements made by a local education authority for thespecial educational treatment of pupils of any such category shall,so far as practicable, provide for the education of pupils in whosecase the disability is serious in special schools appropriate for the(I category;; but where this is impracticable, or where the disabilityis not serious, the arrangements may provide for the giving ofsuch education in any school maintained or assisted by the localeducation authority&quot;. (Clause 33 (1) and (2).)(b) &quot;The Minister will make regulations prescribing the standards to whichthe premises of schools maintained by local authorities are to conform,and such regulations may prescribe different standards for suchdescriptions of schools as may be specified in the regulations&quot;.(Clause 10 (1).)The problem which arises here is in essence the same as that discussed inparagraph 6 the need to have intermediate level governments with a large enough area of independent manoeuvre in adapting the policies of the centralgovernment to the special needs of their area. In this connection there couldobviously, for example, be a good deal of argument as to whether the centralgovernment should concern itself with the amount of detail in prescribingpolicy as appears to be envisaged in (6) above; thus some may think it shouldbe left to intermediate level governments to prescribe building standards-or to local governments. But whatever view is taken here (and it is dealt within a slightly different connection in a later paragraph), there is no insuperable difficulty here. The regulations referred to at (a) and (b) above are in fact
statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure; thusthey would, in the end, be the product of a political bargain between theperhaps conflicting interests of the different levels of government. And it needs to be remembered here that, as in the case of the political bargaining in para-graph 8, the intermediate level governments would actually have some of theirrepresentatives in one of the chambers of the central legislature; and this wouldenable them to have a direct share in the final decision in addition to the naturalinfluence on it which would arise from their regular and direct contacts withthe central executive. So it would be reasonable to expect that the politicalbargain here would leave intermediate level governments with very worthwhileresponsibilities. Indeed, because of their major political weight and theirinbuilt representation at the centre, they would be much more likely to beable to safeguard their interests here than in the comparable situation todaywhen local authorities seek to safeguard their &quot;independence&quot; of centralgovernment but without the strengths and advantages which intermediate level governments would have.11. On the question of policy making by Ministerial approvals and circulars,this is where the scheme requires radical changes in existing practices. This is best illustrated by a further consideration of Clause 8 of the 1944 education act which was referred to in a rather different context in paragraph 8 (a)above. There it was pointed out that this Clause lays down that &quot;publiceducation shall be organised in three progressive stages to be known as primaryeducation, secondary education and further education; and it shall be the dutyof the local education authority for every area . . . (to) secure that efficienteducation throughout these stages shall be available to meet the needs of thepopulation in their area&quot;. In fulfilling this duty local education authoritieshave, among other things, to have regard to &quot;the need for securing that primary and secondary education are provided in separate schools&quot;. Curiously enough,though, the Act does not provide for the Minister to issue regulations (as itdoes with regard to special schools at paragraph 10 (a) above) to fill out thedetails of the policy for organising the country&apos;s education in the &quot;threeprogressive stages&quot;. Instead, it is left to a system of &quot;approvals&quot;. Thus, everylocal education authority had to submit its development plan to the Ministry&quot;in such form as the Ministry may direct showing the action which the authorityproposes should be taken for securing that there shall be sufficient primary and secondary schools available for their area and the successive measures by whichit is proposed to accomplish that purpose&quot;. (Clause 11 (1).) If the Ministerapproved the plan, he then made an &quot;Order&quot; setting out the details of what he had approved. If the local education authority concerned felt aggrievedby the Order, then it had to be laid before Parliament and it could be annulledby either House within forty days of laying. And from the time of the approvalof the original development plan onwards any variations from it, or additions to it (like the establishment of a new school) have to be submitted to the Ministerto go through a similar approval system. It should be noted in this connectionthat the compulsory reorganisation of secondary education on comprehensivelines was imposed by means of a Department of Education Circular 10/65.It was not the product of any regulation laid before Parliament.1 i.e., they have to be laid before Parliament and are deemed valid unless either Houseannuls them within forty days of laying.
12. Clearly, the procedures described in paragraph 11 could not be fittedinto the scheme outlined in Chapter VI. This is because one of the objects ofthe scheme is in fact to remove from Whitehall (or its outposts) the vast loadof administrative case work involved in that kind of &quot;approvals&quot; system.So the scheme envisages that Whitehall would not have any direct day-to-daycontacts with local authorities. In any event, and quite apart from the objective of reducing the load on Whitehall, it can be strongly argued that the methodof &quot;policy making&quot; of the type described in paragraph 11 is in itself undesirablefrom the point of view of democratic control. For example, whatever one&apos;views on comprehensive education, to impose it by departmental circularbacked by Ministerial executive and administrative action is not exactly the sort of policy making one might expect in a democracy.13. So the method of policy making for primary and secondary schoolsoutlined in paragraph 11 would have to be replaced by the method the Actprovides for special schools which is outlined at paragraph 10 (a) above. Thus,for the scheme in Chapter VI, the Act would have to set out as far as possiblethe various principles local education authorities should follow in their provisionfor primary and secondary education; and it would have to empower theMinister, on the lines of paragraph 10 (a) above, to issue more detailed regula-tions to which local authorities would be required to conform. That still leaves,of course, the question of approving the schemes of primary and secondary education drawn up by the different L.E.A.s to ensure that they were in accord-ance with the policies laid down in the Act and by Ministerial regulations(which will have been subject to Parliamentary scrutiny). Under a redraftedEducation Act, this would become the responsibility of the different inter-mediate level governments. And here, of course, they would be concerned to exploit to the full the latitude left to them by the Act and its attendant statutory instruments to secure the best form of education provision in their areas tomeet their special needs. And the extent of the latitude left to them would,of course, finally be determined by the process of political bargaining described in paragraph 10.14. So far we have been largely concerned with the way the 1944 education act lays down its various policies and gives the Minister of Education certainpolicy responsibilities. The Act, however, also gives the Minister a number of functions which can best be classified as executive, administrative or quasi-judicial. So the questions now to be faced are: (a) Can these be devolved to intermediate level governments ?(b) What would be the general consequences if they were so.devolved?These questions arise, of course, because an essential objective of the scheme in chapter VI as applied to education is to leave central government with major policy-making responsibilities while handing over its other educational functions to the intermediate level authorities.15. Examples of the mixture of administrative, executive and quasi-judicial functions which the 1944 Education Act confers on the Minister of Educationinclude the following: (a) The Act establishes two Central Advisory Councils for Education (one for England and the other for Wales) to advise the Minister &quot;upon such
matters connected with education theory and practice as they think fit . . . the members of each Advisory Council shall be appointed bythe Minister&quot;. (Clause 4 (1) and (2).)(b) As was pointed out in paragraph 10 (b) the Minister makes regulationsprescribing the standards of school buildings. When a proposal for anew school has been approved by the Minister as part of an L.E.A.&apos;sdevelopment plan, the L.E.A. &quot;shall submit to [the Minister] in such form and such manner as he may direct specifications and plans of school premises, and the Minister, on being satisfied that the schoolpremises will conform to the prescribed standards, may approve thespecifications and plans&quot;.(c) The Minister can exempt a school from complying with his buildingregulations. &quot;If the Minister is satisfied with respect to any school that having regard to the nature of the site or to any existing buildingsthereon or to other special circumstances affecting the school premisesit would be unreasonable in that case to require conformity with therequirements of the regulations in any particular respect, he may direct that the school premises shall be deemed to conform to the prescribedstandards if in lieu of conforming to the requirements of the regulations in that respect they conform to such other requirements as may be specified in the direction&quot;. (Clause 10 (2).)(d) The Minister has to approve a schoofs articles of government. Thus:&quot;Every county secondary school and every voluntary secondary schoolshall be conducted in accordance with articles of government made inthe case of a county school by an order of the local education authority and approved by the Minister, and in the case of a voluntary schoolby an order of the Minister; and such articles shall in particular determine the functions to be exercised in relation to the school by the localeducation authority, the body of governors and the head teacherrespectively&quot;. (Clause 17 (3) (b).)(e) The Minister can make orders varying a trust deed. Thus: &quot;When itappears to the Minister that any provision included or proposed to beincluded in the instrument of management, rules of management,instrument of government, or articles of government, for a countyschool or a voluntary school is in any respect inconsistent with theprovisions of any trust deed relating to the school, and that it is expedient in the interest of the school that the provisions of the trustdeed should be modified for the purpose of removing the inconsistency,he may by order make such modifications in the provision of the trustdeed as appear to him to be just and expedient for that purpose&quot;.(/) The Minister determines the number of governors for every voluntarysecondary school. Thus: &quot;The instrument of government for everyvoluntary secondary school shall provide for the constitution of a bodyof governors of the school consisting of such number of persons theMinister may after consultation with the local education authoritydetermine&quot;. (Clause 19 (2).)(g) The Minister is given a number of quasi-judicial functions. For example:&quot;A child who has under arrangements made by a local educationauthority become a registered pupil at a special school shall not be
withdrawn from the school without the consent of the authority; butif the parent of any such child is aggrieved by a refusal of the authorityto comply with an application made by the parent requesting suchconsent, he may refer the question to the Minister who shall give suchdirection thereon as he thinks fit&quot;. (Clause 38 (2).)The above examples are fairly representative of the miscellaneous group of administrative, executive and quasi-judicial functions which the 1944 education act confers on the Ministers. And it seems fairly clear that while the appointingfunction at (a) would obviously remain with the Minister, there would be no major problem in redrafting the Act to confer the other functions on the intermediate level governments. The problems that would arise from so doingare considered below.Conclusion on the feasibility of redrafting the 1944 Education Act to fit the division of functions envisaged in the scheme of government in Chapter VI16. It seems fairly clear that there would be no insuperable difficultiesin redrafting the 1944 Education Act to fit the projected division of functions between the central and intermediate level governments. Policy would be clearlylaid down in the Act and in any regulations the Act empowered the Ministerto make. Political bargaining as envisaged in paragraphs 8 and 10 together withthe institutional constraints referred to at the end of paragraph 3 and developedmore fully in Chapter VII (paragraphs 297 to 307) should result in the inter-mediate level governments being left with enough freedom of manoeuvre to adapt United Kingdom educational policies to the special needs of their areas.But however detailed Ministerial regulations turned out to be, there would still be a very substantial devolution to intermediate level governments sincethe Act could undoubtedly be redrafted to transfer to them the mass of case-work (e.g. approvals of L.E.A. school building schemes, etc.), which now haveto go to the Minister.17. While devolution of this kind is, then, clearly as far as the 1944 education act is concerned, a practical proposition, we still have to consider what conse-quences this would have for:(a) the problem of ensuring that the central governments general educationpolicies are fully carried out in the territories of the various intermediate level governments;(b) the present education responsibilities of local authorities;(c) the financial arrangements between Whitehall and the intermediate level governments;id) Ministerial responsibility and the work of the Department of Education;(e) the role of M.P.S and Parliament.These, of course, were some of the issues raised in paragraph 5 above andthey are dealt with separately in the next five sections.1 Paragraph 18 et seq.
The problem of ensuring that United Kingdom education policy is fullyimplemented by the intermediate level governments18. Under the proposed division of functions the Department of Educationwould lose:(a) the knowledge it now has about the activities of local education authori-ties which comes from the submission of their proposed educationalschemes and school building projects etc., to the Ministry;(b) the power to approve or alter the various proposals submitted as at (a)above.However, the Department of Education would still be able to ensure thatregional governments were fully complying with national education policy by means of the Inspectorate and the Ministers default powers.19. The 1944 Education Act imposes on the Minister the duty &quot;to causeinspections to be made of every educational establishment at such intervalsas appear to him appropriate . .. and for the purpose of enabling such inspec-tions to be made on behalf of the Minister, inspectors may be appointed byHis Majesty on the recommendation of the Minister&quot;. (Clause 22 (2).) Forthe scheme in Chapter VI, the Inspectorate would continue to be appointedby, and be responsible to, the Minister. In addition to their present dutiesthe Inspectors would report to the Ministry on cases where government policy was not being carried out.20. At this point the Minister would be able to use his present default powers.Under the 1944 Act this default power is conferred on the Minister in thefollowing terms: &quot;If the Minister is satisfied, either upon complaint by any personinterested or otherwise, that any local authority, or the managers or gover-nors of any county school or voluntary school, have failed to dischargeany duty imposed upon them by or for the purposes of this Act, theMinister may make an order declaring the authority, or the managersor governors, as the case may be, to be in default in respect of that duty,and giving such directions for the purpose of enforcing the executionthereof as appear to the Minister to be expedient; and any such directionsshall be enforceable, on an application made on behalf of the Minister,by mandamus&quot;. (Clause 99 (1).)21. It would appear, therefore, that enforcement of national policy in thedifferent regions would, under the proposed scheme, present no great difficulty;and it would not be necessary to erect any special system of administrative law.Implications for the present educational responsibilities of local authorities22. Under the scheme the intention is that the present educational responsi-bilities of local authorities would remain substantially unaltered. But therewould be a change in the way those responsibilities are exercised. This is becausethe local authorities would, for the most part, cease to have direct contacts withWhitehall. Thus, where under the 1944 Act local authorities now regularlyhave to submit schemes to, and get approval from, the Department of Education
and Science (paragraph 15 above), the decisions on those matters would underthe redrafted Act be taken by the intermediate level governments. And thiswould have some very considerable advantages to local authorities. Thus:(a) the decisions would be taken by people who were nearer to the localauthorities and more aware of their special problems than the officials in Whitehall;(b) the decision would be taken by an intermediate level governmentseducation committee on which the local government authorities wouldhave their representatives in accordance with the inter-locking principleenunciated at paragraph 132 of Chapter IV. (For the application ofthis principle, see paragraph 254 of Chapter VI.) Thus the representativesof local government would actually share in taking the decisions ontheir various plans and schemes;(c) the balance of power between a local authority and its intermediate level government is much more even than the present balance between a local authority and central government. Thus it might well be the case that the new, more powerful units of local government would be able toexercise a greater degree of independence of their/ intermediate level governments than is likely to be achieved in their future relationships with Whitehall. And their inter-locking membership of the intermediate level governments education committee would also help in this respect.Local authorities, then, could well gain substantially from the removal of the nowpowerful, remote, insensitive hand of Whitehall.Implications for educational financial arrangements23. This, is dealt with here in outline only since the general proceduresinvolved are set out fairly fully in Chapter VI. In that chapter it was envisaged that each region would draw up annually a five-year rolling programme of proposed educational expenditure. This would, of course, be based on detailed discussions with the local authorities in their area. And clearly the intermediate level government would also have regular discussions with the Department ofEducation about its general plans for educational provision; but the Depart-ment of Education would have no veto on these unless they were clearly in contravention of central government policy. After these discussions, the intermediate level government would present its total expenditure programme(i.e. housing, health, roads, etc., as well as education) to the Treasury. TheUnited Kingdom Government would then have the power to impose, afterappropriate discussions, a reduction in the total expenditure programme whenit was clear that the intermediate level governments were together proposing to use more resources than, for various reasons, could actually be madeavailable. But it would be left to intermediate level governments to determine the size of their own expenditure on education within the overall total ofexpenditure for all purposes approved by central government. The scheme would obviously leave intermediate level governments with a useful degree oflatitude in determining their own priorities.
Implications for Ministerial responsibility and the work of the Department ofEducation24. Clearly, the redrafting of the 1944 Education Act would have profoundconsequences for the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility. The Secretary ofState for Education and Science would no longer even be nominally responsiblefor the great mass of executive decisions now made in his department since,under the proposed scheme, the bulk of these would now be made by thevarious intermediate level governments. This would greatly lighten the burden on the Minister. Thus he would be able to give more time to important majoreducational policy questions (including those arising from our Common Marketmembership)1. And he would also be able to have a more effective role inthe central governments collective decision-making machinery (i.e. the cabinet and its committees, etc.) than any departmental minister can manage at present when his burdens are so great that he has all too little time to master the full implications of the proposals of other departmental Ministers which are submitted for collective decisions.25. Since the great mass of case work would be removed from the Departmentof Education, it could be argued that the Department would be less wellequipped than now to promote new policy making. This is because the needfor new policy is so frequently the product of experience with case work.Certainly, there would be less detailed knowledge in the Department of whatwas happening in each local education authority. On the other hand, there isno doubt that the different intermediate level governments handling the casework would quickly become aware of new policy needs and would put theDepartment under considerable pressure to produce any necessary policy changes. No doubt, too, the Inspectors&apos; reports would keep the department in close touch with educational reality.Implications for the role of M.P.s and Parliament26. The role of M.P.s would be substantially altered by the new division of responsibilities between the different levels of government. They would bemuch less concerned than now with individual or local authority complaintson educational questions. This is because the case work concerned would infuture be determined by intermediate level governments and would thus become the responsibility of the elected representatives of those governments.So instead of dissipating so much of their time and energies on these matters,M.P.s would be able instead to take a bigger share in the central governmentsmajor policy-making including service of the House of Commons education committee. (The functions of that Committee would be as set out in para-graph 294 of Chapter VII.) And they would be able, too, to take on theadditional responsibilities which are involved in our membership of the common market and set out in Chapter VII2.General conclusion on redrafting the 1944 Education Act27. There is no doubt that the 1944 Education Act could be redrafted to match the scheme of government proposed in Chapters VI and VII. The1 See in this connection Chapter III, paragraph 88 et seq.2 Paragraph 290 et seq. See also Chapter III, paragraph 103 et seq.
division of responsibilities between the Central Government on the one handand the intermediate level governments on the other, in accordance with the objectives of the scheme and the principles set out in paragraph 6 and 8 above,presents no insuperable difficulties. Equally, there is no doubt that it wouldresult in a great lightening of the load on central government and give inter-mediate level governments a major role in educational matters; this can beseen clearly in Part II of this Appendix which gives a comprehensive list ofthe educational functions which, on a redrafting of the Act, would be taken away from the Department of Education and Science and given instead tointermediate level governments. Before listing those functions, however, this appendix next examines one aspect of the central governments housingresponsibilities to see what problems might arise if some of them were devolvedto intermediate level governments.housing jj28. This case study is essentially based on an examination of the 1969Housing Act. And as with the examination of the 1944 Education Act, its main concern is to show:(a) What functions now conferred on the Ministry of Housing (now in theDepartment of the Environment) could and should be devolved to the intermediate level governments in accordance with the general principles and objectives of this scheme of government.(b) What problems would be involved in redrafting the Act to producethis new division of functions.(c) What consequences such a redrafting would have for: (i) the problem of ensuring that the central governments generalhousing policies are fully carried out in the territories of the variousintermediate level governments;(ii) the present housing responsibilities of local authorities;(iii) the financial arrangements between Whitehall and the intermediate level governments;(iv) Ministerial responsibility and the work of the Department of the environment;(v) the role of M.P.s and Parliament.29. The purpose of devolving housing functions from Whitehall to inter-mediate level governments is set out in paragraphs 6 and 8 above. Broadly,the main concern is, in the interests of democratic control, to lighten the load on central government and to move decision making as near as possible tothose most closely affected. Thus the role of central government should belimited to determining those issues of policy on which it is essential, in theinterests of the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom, that thereshould be absolute uniformity throughout the whole of the United Kingdom.The rest should be pushed down to intermediate level governments or to localauthorities bearing in mind that the essential role of intermediate level governments is to handle, and take decisions on, problems which can best becomprehended, and therefore best be solved at that level.
Problems involved in redrafting the 1969 Housing Act to match the scheme in chapter VI30. The 1969 Housing Act in effect requires local authorities to make grants towards the cost of improving housing and converting houses into flats. TheAct also empowers local authorities to improve general amenities in certain areas (to be designated as &quot;improvement areas&quot;). The problems in redraftingthe Act to devolve as much as possible to intermediate level governments andto leave them with the maximum scope for adapting the main policies of theAct to the special needs of their respective areas are broadly the same as thoseoutlined above in respect of the 1944 Education Act. This is because the housing act like the 1944 Education Act:(a) lays down both major and minor policies;(b) sometimes specifies both major and minor policies in great detail andwith great precision, but also outlines other policies in general termsonly, leaving it to the Minister to fill in the details either by statutory instruments or by a system of &quot;specifications&quot; or special &quot;directions&quot;;(c) gives the Minister very considerable administrative and executive responsibilities which involve a lot of case work.The problems posed by the points at (a) to (c) above are illustrated only brieflyin the following paragraphs. This is because detailed investigation showed themto be basically the same as those posed by the 1944 Education Act which havebeen dealt with more extensively above.31. As far as the mixture of major and minor policy is concerned, fourexamples will suffice:(a) &quot;Grants shall be payable by local authorities in accordance with thefollowing provisions of this Part of this Act towards the cost of worksrequired for:(i) the provision of dwellings by the conversion of houses or other buildings;(ii) the improvement of dwellings; or(iii) the improvement of houses in multiple occupation by the provisionof standard amenities;when the provision or improvement is by a person other than a housingauthority&quot;. (Clause 1 (1).)(b) &quot;(1) The amount of an improvement grant shall be such amount asmay be fixed by the local authority when they approve the applicationfor the grant but shall not exceed:(i) one-half of the approved expense of the works, nor(ii) subject to subsection (3) of this section, the limit imposed bysubsection (2) of this section.(2) The limit is the amount, or, if the application relates to more thanone dwelling, the aggregate of the amounts, applicable under thefollowing paragraphs, that is to say: -(i)  1,000, or such other amount as may be prescribed, if the dwellingis improved by the works or is provided by them otherwise thanmentioned in paragraph (ii) of this subsection; and
(ii)  1,200, or such other amount as may be prescribed, if the dwellingis provided by the conversion of a house or other building consistingof three or more storeys&quot;. (Clause 5.)(c) &quot;(1) An improvement grant may be paid after the completion of theworks towards the cost of which it is payable or part of it may be paidin instalments as the works progress and the balance after the completionof the works&quot;.&quot;(2) When part of an improvement grant is paid in instalments theaggregate of the instalments paid shall not at any time before the com-pletion of the works exceed one half of the aggregate cost of the worksexecuted up to that time&quot;. (Clause 6.)id) The maximum amount of grant for the installation of a wash hand-basinis fixed at  10 and for a &quot;water closet&quot; at  50. (Schedule I.)Clearly in any redrafting of the Housing Act there could be a good deal of argu-ment as to whether some of the policies of the kind illustrated above would bebetter left to the discretion of intermediate level governments or even localauthorities. And on the face of it one might well believe that while (a) above is obviously a central government matter, (b) might well be left to the discretion of the intermediate level governments who in collaboration with their localauthorities will have the best view of the balance of needs in their areas and(c) and id) could be left to the discretion of individual local authorities withina total maximum grant figure for all amenities and improvements per singledwelling determined at intermediate government level. In any event the problems to be solved here and the principles to be applied in their solution are the sameas those surveyed in paragraph 8 above in respect of the 1944 Education Act;and clearly one would expect a similarly satisfactory solution to be reached.32. On the question of the various regulations, &quot;specifications&quot; and&quot;directives&quot; which the Act empowers the Minister to make to &quot;fill out&quot; thevarious policies laid down in the Act, again the problems are basically, the sameas those surveyed at paragraphs 9-13 above. Thus the Act empowers theMinister to:(a) produce regulations (of varying degrees of importance) some subjectto the affirmative resolution procedure in Parliament, and others subjectto the negative resolution procedure (examples are given in Section b of Annex V to this Appendix);ib) produce some regulations and to &quot;make specifications&quot; and to give general or special &quot;directions&quot; which are not subject to parliamentary control. (Examples are given in Section C of Annex V to this Appendix.)For the Minister to operate as at ib) above without Parliamentary approvalwould be made impossible in our redraft of the Act (see the parallel situationin Education outlined in paragraphs 11-13 above); and the solution here would follow the education pattern proposed in paragraph 13. As far as (a) above isconcerned, both the problems and the solutions are broadly the same as for education, surveyed in paragraph 10 above.33. As in the 1944 Education Act, the 1969 Housing Act gives the Ministervery extensive administrative and executive functions. These are listed in
Annex IV to this Appendix. For the most part they involve the Minister in avery great deal of case work. As in the parallel case in Education these couldfor the most part be devolved to intermediate level governments as indicatedin the Housing Section of this Appendix.General conclusion on redrafting the 1969 Housing Act to fit the division of functions envisaged in the scheme of government in Chapter VI34. As with the 1944 Education Act, there would be no insuperable difficultiesin redrafting the 1969 Housing Act to fit the projected division of functions between the central and intermediate levels of government. Policy on whichthere must be uniformity throughout the United Kingdom could be clearlylaid down in the new Act and in any regulations the Act empowered the Ministerto make. Political bargaining as envisaged in paragraphs 8 and 10 abovetogether with the institutional constraints referred to at the end of paragraph 3and developed more fully in Chapter VII (paragraphs 297 to 307) should resultin the intermediate level governments being left, in accordance with theprinciples in paragraph 8 above, with enough freedom of manoeuvre to adaptthe housing policies in the Act to the special needs of their areas. But howeverdetailed Ministerial regulations about policy turned out to be, there would still be a very substantial devolution to intermediate level governments since the Act could undoubtedly be redrafted to transfer to them the mass of case-work which now has to go to the Minister.35. The consequences of such a redrafting for the present housing respon-sibilities of local authorities, for the financial arrangements between Whitehalland the intermediate level (governments, for Ministerial responsibility and thework of the Department of the Environment and for the role of M.P.s and parliament are again broadly the same as the consequences of redrafting the1944 Education Act surveyed in paragraphs 22 to 26 above. It is, therefore,unnecessary to set them out in detail here. But it is worthwhile drawing attentionto two omissions in the present Housing Act which would have to be rectifiedin the redraft. They are dealt with separately in the next two paragraphs.36. The first omission affects the problem of ensuring that, after devolvinga substantial number of housing responsibilities to intermediate level govern-ments the housing policies of the central government are fully implementedat both the intermediate and local authority levels of government. Unlike the1944 Education Act, the 1969 Housing Act does not contain a &quot;default&quot;clause. It will be recalled that under the 1944 Education Act the Minister, inthe last analysis, can ensure that an L.E.A. fully implements the policies laiddown in the Act by making an order &quot;declaring the local authority is in default... and giving such directions for the purpose of enforcing the executionthereof as appear to the Minister to be expedient; and any such directions shallbe enforceable, on an application made on behalf of the Minister, bymandamus&quot;. It seems clear that in redrafting the 1969 Act the Minister would need to be given the &quot;default&quot; power to be operated in the last resort againstintermediate level governments; and intermediate level governments wouldalso need the same power for application against local authorities.37. The other omission from the 1969 Housing Act affects the question of individual grievances. For example, the Act does not appear to provide any
means for resolving a dispute which may arise between an applicant for animprovement grant and the local authority concerned. This contrasts with the1944 Education Act when, as was illustrated in paragraph 15 (g) above, theMinister of Education is cast in the role of ultimate arbitrator in variousdisputes which may arise between individual citizens and local educationauthorities. An essential feature of the system of government outlined in chapters VI and VII is to provide adequate means for the redress of individual grievances against all kinds of authority. So, any redrafting of the 1969 housing act would need to provide for an individual aggrieved by a local authoritydecision the means of appeal either to an intermediate level government or toan Ombudsman or, perhaps, to an administrative tribunal.38. In the last analysis, then, a redrafted Housing Act could result in agreat lightening of the load on central government and could give intermediate level governments a major role in housing matters. This can be seen clearly inPart II of this Appendix which gives a comprehensive list of the housingfunctions which on a redrafting of the Act, would be taken away from theDepartment of Environment and given instead to intermediate level governments.^y-M&amp;immj^  vi-p-;:: &apos;,:  Mm        ?iifi    i I; \\   .     , ;i jv.i;PART H. FUNCTIONS TO BE DEVOLVED TO INTERMEDIATE level governments BY REDRAFTING THE 1944 EDUCATION ACT ANDTHE 1969 HOUSING ACTintroduction39. The aim in this section of the Appendix is to give some idea of thefunctions which could be devolved to intermediate level governments byredrafting the 1944 Education Act and the 1969 Housing Act. It seemed prudent to present it in as pessimistic a manner as possible. This is because if we assume that the central government will devolve the absolute minimum to provincial governments and we then find that even that minimum nevertheless turns out to be quite substantial this will greatly reinforce the case for this particularscheme of devolution. Accordingly, therefore, this part of the Appendix assumes that the United Kingdom Government will leave intermediate level governments with very little scope to adapt central policies to the special needs of their areas.In other words, it is assumed that the redrafted Acts would lay down bothmajor and minor policies much as at present, and would give the appropriateMinisters power to elaborate these by subsequent statutory instruments.40. It follows from making the highly pessimistic assumptions of paragraph 39that the functions to be taken over by intermediate level governments would bedrawn from three categories :-(a) the mixture of administrative and executive functions referred to atparagraphs 15 and 33 above;(ft) the quasi-judicial functions referred to in paragraph 15;(c) the rule making functions referred to in paragraphs 10 and 32.
These are listed separately below. Section A deals with the three categoriesas far as Education is concerned; Section B deals similarly with the 1969Housing Act.section a. education41. The mixture of administrative and executive functions which the 1944Education Act confers on the Minister of Education is very substantial indeed.The full list is given in Annex I to this Appendix. For the most part these functions are concerned with approving or supervising the plans and activitiesof local education authorities. Since an essential part of the scheme is that, forthe most part, the Department of Education would be relieved of direct day-to-day contacts with local authorities these approval or supervisory responsibilities would, therefore, have to be devolved to the intermediate level governments.To these there might be added some of the quasi-judicial functions the Actconfers on the Minister (the full list is given in Annex II to this Appendix);and perhaps there might also be devolved some of the Ministers rule makingpowers (the full list is given in Annex III to this Appendix). But even if nothingfrom these second and third categories of ministerial responsibilities wasdevolved to intermediate level governments, nevertheless intermediate level governments would have a major role to play in education. They would havethe responsibilities summarised in the next paragraph.42. On the basis of the limited and pessimistic assumptions made in para-graphs 39 and 41 above, the intermediate level governments would have thefollowing educational functions (mostly explicitly devolved from the Depart-ment of Education) :-(a) drawing up, in consultation with the local authorities, a five-yeareducational development plan covering the area&apos;s needs for primary,secondary and further education. The plans would include estimates of current and capital costs. They would be up-dated each year. Naturallythe whole operation would involve discussions with the Department ofEducation to whom the general proposals would be eventually submitted;(b) general supervision of the local education authorities in their area toensure that they are efficiently fulfilling both their responsibilities underthe 1944 Act (as redrafted) and also under the area&apos;s five-year develop-ment plan. This will involve among other things:-(i) approval each year of each local education authority&apos;s educationaldevelopment plan for primary and secondary education;(ii) approval each year of local education authority schemes for pupilsrequiring special educational treatment;(iii) approval each year of local education authority schemes for further education; and perhaps the assumption of some direct executive responsibility for the provision of facilities for further education in their areas;(c) maintaining the register of independent schools, arranging for theirinspection and taking any necessary executive actions after an inspector^report;
id) producing such ordinances as may be necessary either to: (i) implement the legislation and policies of the United KingdomGovernment and where possible to adapt them to the special needsof their areas; or1(ii) give effect to their residual power to promote the good govern-ment and general welfare of the people in their area on educationalmatters1;(e) recommend to the Department of Education such changes in the generaleducation policy of the U.K. Government as appear to be needed.Clearly the above functions are substantial even though this comprises aminimum list only. Equally clearly, they are also functions that are best andmost advantageously performed at this intermediate level of government.And their devolution to intermediate level governments would greatly relieve the burdens on the Minister of Education and his Department./section b.    housing43. Before listing the housing functions which, as a redrafting of the 1969Housing Act, could be devolved to intermediate level governments two pointsneed to be emphasised: id) the 1969 Housing Act covers oiitly a small part of the United kingdom governments housing policies. Thus when this section lists the housingfunctions that could be devolved, this is very far from being the full range of housing functions which could become the responsibility of intermediate level governments. It is referring simply to housing res-responsibilities under the 1969 Act. A redrafting of all the other Actsconcerned with housing would obviously add very substantially to the list;ib) as in education, we are making the pessimistic assumptions put forward in paragraph 39 above. Thus the functions) to be devolved by centralgovernment would be drawn from two categories only:(i) the mixture of administrative and executive functions referred toat paragraph 33 above.(ii) the rule-making functions referred to in paragraph 32 above.The Act does not confer any quasi-judicial functions on the Minister.44. The mixture of administrative and executive functions which the 1969Housing Act confers on the Minister are substantial. The full list is given in annex IV to this Appendix. For the most part these functions are concernedwith approving or supervising local authority housing responsibilities whichare imposed on them by the Act. Since an essential part of the scheme of devolution proposed in Chapter VI is that, for the most part, the Departmentof the Environment will be relieved of direct day-to-day contacts with localauthorities, these approval or supervisory activities would, therefore, have tobe devolved to the intermediate level governments. To these might be addedsome of the Minister^ rule-making powers (the full list is given in Annex V1 See Chapter VI, paragraph 243 et seq.
to this Appendix). But even if nothing from this second category of ministerialresponsibilities was devolved to intermediate level government, neverthelessthey would have a major role to play in the operation of this particular Act.They would have the responsibilities summarised in the next paragraph; and,as will be apparent this would make a significant reduction in the burden onthe Department of the Environment.45. On the basis of the limited and pessimistic assumptions made in para-graphs 39 and 43 above, the following functions involved in the operation ofthe 1969 Housing Act would be devolved to intermediate level governmentsafter redrafting the Act: (a) within the framework of its strategic plan for its area1 an intermediate level government would determine the balance of resources it proposedto make available as improvement, etc. grants to municipally andprivately owned properties as against the competing claims for expenditure on other housing responsibilities, health and hospitals,roads and schools, etc. This would be a five-year programme updatedannually;(b) an intermediate level government would draw up, in consultation with local authorities, a five-year plan for designating &quot;general improvementareas&quot; (i.e., areas where &quot;living conditions ought to be improved by theimprovement of the authorities of the area or of dwellings therein or both&quot;)2. The plan would be a phased programme for action and would include annual estimates of expenditure. It would be updated annually;(c) intermediate level governments would be responsible for the general supervision of local authorities in their area to ensure that they wereefficiently fulfilling their responsibilities under the 1969 Housing Act(as redrafted) and also under the areas&apos; five-year development plan.This would involve among other things (i) approval each year of each local authority&apos;s general plans for implementing (a) and (b) above;(ii) approval of local authority applications for standard grants and improvement grants in respect of municipally owned property(these approvals are at present done by the Ministry);(iii) exercising the Ministry&apos;s present supervisory functions in respectof local authorities improvement areas. These are set out in detail in Annex IV;(d) intermediate level governments would produce such ordinances as maybe necessary either to -(i) implement the policies of the redrafted Housing Act and where possible to adapt them to the special needs of their areas or,(ii) give effect to their residual power to promote the good governmentand general welfare of the people in their areas on housingmatters3.1 See Chapter VIII, paragraph 332.2 1969 Housing Act, Clause 28.3 See Chapter VI, paragraph 243 et seq.
(e) intermediate level governments would recommend to the Departmentof the Environment such changes in the housing policies laid down inthe redrafted Act as may be necessary.Clearly, the above functions are reasonably substantial-even though this is aminimum list and relates only to one small part of the large field of generalhousing policies. Equally clearly, they are functions that are best and mostadvantageously performed at this intermediate level of government. And theirdevolution to intermediate level governments would bring welcome relief at thecentre.general conclusion46. This detailed study of the 1944 Education Act and the 1969 Housing Actshows: (a) there would be no insuperable difficulties in redrafting these two acts of Parliament to fit the scheme of government outlined in Chapters VIand VII;(b) the devolution of functions to intermediate level governments would be substantial;(c) there would be a corresponding and substantial reduction in the load on Whitehall and Westminster.Fundamentally, of course, this devolution of functions is based on the principles and objectives set out in Chapter IV. As such it is apparent from these two casestudies that in education and housing we would have the strong prospect ofbeing much more democratically and, indeed, efficiently governed than we arenow.
ADMlMSTRATjyE/EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS CONFERRED ON THEMINISTER OF EDUCATION BY THE 1944 EDUCATION ACT but which WOULD ON REDRAFTING THE ACT BE CONFERRED ONINTERMEDIATE LEVEL GOVERNMENTSIntroductory note. Paragraph 41 above refers to the mixture of administrative and executive functions which the 1944 Education Act now confers on the Minister ofEducation and Science but which would, under the system of government proposed in Chapter VI, be devolved to intermediate level authorities. Thepurpose of this Annex is to give a full list of these functions. There are forty-twoof them. It might well be argued that some of these ministerial functions should either be abolished completely or handed completely over to local authoritieswithout the intervention of an intermediate tier; I have marked with an asteriskministerial functions that could be considered for inclusion in these lattercategories.List of ministerial administrative/executive functions which would be conferred on intermediate level governments2. To ensure that: (a) local education authorities in their area provide sufficient schools andother educational facilities to fulfil the purposes of the Act;(b) such schools and other educational facilities are organised and operated in accordance with the provisions of the Act and such regulations(subject to the approval of Parliament) as the Minister is empowered tomake under the Act.3. To approve every L.E.A.&apos;s estimate of the immediate and prospectiveneeds of its area for primary and secondary education and its educational&quot;development plan&quot; to cater for those needs. The intermediate level governmentwould consider any objections to a development plan and would make in theplan &quot;such modifications, if any, after consultation with the local educationauthority as it considers necessary or expedient&quot;.4. After approving the development plan the intermediate level governmentwould specify the county schools and voluntary schools which it is the dutyof an L.E.A. to maintain.5. Any L.E.A. proposal to establish a new school, to maintain as a countyschool any school or any voluntary school would be submitted to the inter-mediate level government. The intermediate level government would then actbroadly as at paragraphs 3 and 4 above.6. Where proposals for the establishment of a new school have been approvedby the intermediate level government (I.L.G.), the I.L.G. would require theL.E.A. (or voluntary body) concerned to submit plans and specifications ofthe proposed new premises to see if they conform to prescribed standards.
7. The Act provides for voluntary schools to be &quot;controlled schools&quot;,&quot;aided schools&quot; or &quot;special agreement schools&quot; with different regulationsapplying to each category. Voluntary schools would negotiate with the I.L.G.to be put in the appropriate category.8. When the managers or governors of an aided school or special agreementschool are unable or unwilling to carry out their obligations they would applyto the I.L.G. to change their status.9. If a special agreement school has repaid its grant from an L.E.A. it would apply to the I.L.G. for its special agreement status to be ended.*10. Where any county school or voluntary school needs to move to a newsite, either because the existing site is unsuitable for necessary expansion or modification or because of population movements, application must be madeto the I.L.G.11. For every county school and every voluntary school, the Act requiresthere shall be &quot;an instrument providing for the constitution of the body ofmanagers or governors of the school&quot;. It would be for the I.L.G. to approvethese instruments of government. If the provision included in an instrument of government is inconsistent with any trust deed, the I.L.G. would have thepower to vary the trust deed accordingly, if it thought fit. Presumably, theI.L.G. would also have to approve any requests for subsequent changes ininstruments of government it had already approved.*12. The I.L.G. would decide in the case of every voluntary school thenumber of persons who should constitute its body of governors.13. The Act empowers the Minister of Education to make regulations(which have to be laid before Parliament) defining the several categories of pupils requiring special educational treatment and making provision as to thespecial methods appropriate for the education of pupils of each category.The arrangements made by a local education authority for the special education of pupils of any such category shall, so far as practicable, provide for theeducation of pupils in whose case the disability is serious in special schoolsappropriate for that category. It would be for the I.L.G. to approve all localauthority proposals for special schools and for the education of all these categories of children who in accordance with the regulations of the WhitehallMinister of Education are required to have special educational treatment.14. Each L.E.A. has to &quot;secure the provision for their area of adequate facilities for further education, that is to say: (a) full-time and part-time education for persons over compulsory schoolage; and(b) leisure-time occupation in such organised cultural, training and recreational activities as are suited to their requirements, for any personsover compulsory school age who are able and willing to profit by thefacilities provided for that purpose&quot;.
It would be for the I.L.G. to approve an L.E.A.&apos;s scheme for further education and any subsequent amendments to it along the same general lines as for primary and secondary education (as set out at paragraph 3 et seq. above).*15. The I.L.G. would be empowered to vary the hours during which anL.E.A. requires a young person to attend for compulsory further education in the light of any abnormal hours the young person is required to work inhis job.16. Under the Act it is the duty of every Local Education Authority to ensurethat the facilities for primary, secondary and further education provided fortheir area include adequate facilities for recreation and social and physical training. Accordingly, with the approval of the I.L.G., a Local EducationAuthority may &quot;establish, maintain and manage, or assist in the establishment,maintenance, and management of camps, holiday clubs, playing fields, playcentres, and other places (including playgrounds, gymnasiums, and swimmingbaths, not appropriated to any school or college)&quot;, for the use of those for whom primary, secondary or further education is provided by the authority,and &quot;may organise games, expeditions and other activities for such persons,and may defray or contribute towards the expenses thereof&quot;. (Clause 53 (1).)17. A Local Education Authority under the Act would have to make such arrangements for the provision of transport and otherwise as they consider necessary or as the I.L.G. may direct for the purpose of facilitating the attendance of pupils at schools or county colleges or at any course or classprovided in the pursuance of a scheme of further education enforced for their area, and any transport provided in pursuance of such arrangements shall beprovided free of charge. (Clause 55 (1).)*18. If a Local Education Authority is satisfied that by reason of anyextraordinary circumstances a child or young person is unable to attend asuitable school for the purpose of receiving primary or secondary education,it would have power with the approval of the I.L.G. to make special arrange-ments for him to receive such education otherwise than at school. (Clause 56).19. Under the Act it is laid down that no fees shall be charged in respectof admission to any school maintained by a Local Education Authority or toany County College or in respect of the education provided in any such school or college. However, where any pupil in attendance at any such school orcollege is provided with board and lodging at the expense of the Local EducationAuthority, fees shall be payable in respect of the board and lodging notexceeding such amounts as may be determined in accordance with scalesapproved by the I.L.G. (Clause 61.)20. Where plans for any building required for the purposes of any school or other educational establishment are approved by the I.L.G., it may byorder direct that any provision of any local act or of any byelaw made under such an Act will not apply in relation to the building or shall apply in relationthereto with such modifications as may be specified in the order. (Clause 63 (2).)
21. If any question arises whether any alterations to the school premisesof a county school or a voluntary school would amount to the establishmentof a new school, that question shall be determined by the I.L.G. (Clause 67 (4).)22. If the I.L.G. is satisfied either on complaint by any person or otherwise,that any Local Education Authority or the managers or governors of any country or voluntary school have acted or are proposing to act unreasonablywith respect to the exercise of any power conferred or the performance of any duty imposed by or under this Act, the I.L.G. may, notwithstanding any enactment rendering the exercise of the power or the performance of the dutycontingent upon the opinion ot the Authority or of the managers or governors,give such instructions as to the exercise of the power or the performance ofthe duty as appear to it to be expedient. (Clause 68.)23. When in any matter referred to the I.L.G., the I.L.G. believes the exami-nation of a pupil by a duly qualified medical practitioner would assist the determination of the matter in question, then the I.L.G. can require the parentto submit his child to such an examination with a fine of up to  5 on summary conviction for refusal to comply. (Clause 69 (2).)24. The I.L.G. shall appoint one of its officers to be Registrar of IndependentSchools; and it shall be the duty of the Registrar of Independent Schools tokeep a register of all independent schools, which shall be open to public inspecttion at all reasonable times. The registration of any schools shall be provisionalonly until the I.L.G., after the school has been inspected on its behalf underprovisions of part 4 of the Act, gives notice to the proprietor that the registrationis final. (Clause 70.)25. If the 1L.G. is satisfied that it is in possession of sufficient information with respect to any independent school or any class of independent schools and the registration of that school or the schools comprised in that class is unnecessary the I.L.G. may therefore by order exempt such school or schoolsof that class from registration and any school so exempted shall be deemedto be a registered school. (Clause 70.)26. If at any time the I.L.G. is satisfied that any registered or provisionallyregistered school is objectionable upon all or any of the following grounds:-(c) that the school premises or any part thereof are unsuitable for a school;(b) that the accommodation provided at the school premises is inadequateor unsuitable having regard to the number, ages, and sex of the pupilsattending the school;(c) that efficient and suitable instruction is not being provided at the schoolhaving regard to the ages and sex of the pupils attending thereat;(d) that the proprietor of the school or any teacher employed thereinis not a proper person to be a proprietor of an independent school or to be a teacher of any school as the case may be,the I.L.G. shall serve upon the proprietor of the school a notice of complaintstating the grounds of complaint together with all particulars of the mattercomplained of, and unless any of such matters as stated in the notice are in the
opinion of the I.L.G. irremediable, the notice shall specify the measures necessary in the opinion of the I.L.G. to remedy the matter complained of andshall specify the time, not being less than six months after the service of the notice,within which such measures are thereby required to be taken. (Clause 71.)27. It shall be the duty of the I.L.G. to cause inspections to be made of everyeducational establishment at such intervals as appear to it to be appropriate.(Clause 77 (2).)28. Every Local Education Authority shall furnish to the I.L.G. such particu-lars as it may from time to time require of the arrangements made by theauthority in the exercise of their functions relating to medical inspection and medical treatment; and the I.L.G. may give to any such authority such directions as to the discharge by the authority of those functions as appear to it to be expedient. (Clause 79.)29. A Local Education Authority may, with the approval of the I.L.G.,make such provisions for conducting or assisting the conduct of researchas appears to the Authority to be desirable for the purpose of improving the educational facilities provided for their area. (Clause 82.)30. A Local Education Authority may with the consent of the I.L.G. providefinancial assistance to any University or University College for the purposeof improving the facilities for further education available for their area.(Clause 84.)31. Under the Act a Local Education Authority has to appoint &quot;a fit person to be the Chief Education Officer of the Authority&quot;. A Local EducationAuthority, however, shall not make such an appointment except after consulta-tion with the I.L.G., and for the purposes of such consultation an Authorityproposing to make such an appointment shall send to the I.L.G. particularsshowing the name, previous experience, and qualifications, of the persons from whom they propose to make a selection. If the I.L.G. is of the opinionthat any person whose name is so submitted to it is not a fit person to beChief Education Officer of the Authority, it may give directions prohibiting his appointment. (Clause 88.)32. A Local Education Authority may be authorised, by means of an order made by the Local Authority and confirmed by the I.L.G. to purchase compul-compulsorily any land, whether situated within or without the area of the Authority,which is required for the purposes of any school or college which is, or is to be,maintained by the Local Authority, or otherwise for the purposes of its functions under this Act. (Clause 90 (1).)33. Every Local Education Authority shall make to the I.L.G. such reports and returns and give to it such information as it may require for the purposeof the exercise of its functions under the Act. (Clause 92.)34. The I.L.G. may cause a local enquiry to be held for the purpose of theexercise of any of its functions under this Act. (Clause 93.)
35. If the I.L.G. is satisfied, either upon a complaint by any person interestedor otherwise, that any Local Education Authority, or the managers or governors of any county school or voluntary school, have failed to discharge any dutyimposed by or for the purposes of this Act, the I.L.G. may make an orderdeclaring the Authority, or the managers, or the governors, as the case may be,to be in default in respect of that duty, and give such directions for the purposeof enforcing the execution thereof as appear to the I.L.G. to be expedient;and any such directions shall be enforceable, on an application made onbehalf of the I.L.G., by mandamus. (Clause 99.)36. The I.L.G. shall make provisions: (a) for the payment by it to Local Education Authorities of annual grants in respect of the expenditure incurred by such Authorities in the exerciseof any of their functions relating to education, other than their functionsrelating to the medical inspection and treatment of pupils;(b) for the payment by it to persons other than Local Education authorities of a grant in respect of expenditure incurred or to be incurred for thepurposes of educational services provided by them or on their behalfor under their management or for the purposes of educational research;and(c) for the payment by it for the purpose of enabling pupils to take advantagewithout hardship to themselves or to their parents of any educationalfacilities available to them, of the whole or any part of the fees and expenses payable in respect of children attending schools of whichfees are payable and of sums by way of scholarships, exhibitions, bursariesand other allowances in respect of pupils over compulsory school age,including pupils undergoing training as teachers. (Clause 100.)37. The I.L.G. shall pay to the managers or governors of every aided schooland of every special agreement school maintenance contributions equal toone-half of any sum expended by them in carrying out their obligations under paragraph (a) of sub-section 3 of section 15 of this Act in respect of alterationsto school buildings and repairs to the school premises: provided that no main-tenance contributions shall be payable under this section in respect of any expenditure incurred by the managers or governors of a special agreementschool in the execution of repairs or alterations to the execution of which provision is made by the special agreement relating to the school. (Clause 102.)38. Where the I.L.G. authorises the transfer of any voluntary school to anew site or directs that a voluntary school or schools proposed to be establishedrhall be established in substitution for a school or schools to be discontinued,then, if the school to be transferred or any school to be established is to bemaintained as an aided school or a special agreement school, the I.L.G. maypay to the managers or governors of the school in respect of any sums expendedby them in the construction of the school a grant not exceeding one-half thereof,etc. (Clause 103.)39. Clause 104 of the Act would give power to the I.L.G. to make grants inrespect of aided schools, and special agreement schools, established for the accommodation of displaced pupils.
40. Clause 105 of the Act would give the I.L.G. power to make loans to aidedschools and special agreement schools in respect of initial expenditure.41. The I.L.G. would have the power to authorise the establishment of ajoint education board as the Local Education Authority for the areas of twoor more councils.42. Any two or more Local Education Authorities may with the approvalof the I.L.G. concur in establishing a joint education committee for the con-sideration of questions of common interest to them.43. On the question of an agreed syllabus of religious instruction whenevera Local Education Authority is of the opinion that any agreed syllabus for thetime being adopted by them ought to be reconsidered, the Authority shall causeto be convened for that purpose a conference constituted in accordance with various provisions laid down in the fifth schedule of the Act. If the conferenceconvened for the reconsideration of any syllabus unanimously recommendthat the existing syllabus should continue to be the agreed syllabus or that anew syllabus be adopted in substitution therefore, the Authority may giveeffect to the recommendation of the conference. But if the Authority reportto the I.L.G. that the conference are unable to reach unanimous agreement or ifit appears to the I.L.G. that the Authority have failed to give effect to the unanimous recommendation of the conference the I.L.G. shall appoint toprepare a syllabus of religious instruction a body of persons to draw up an&quot;agreed syllabus&quot; which the Provincial Government will then impose on theLocal Education Authority concerned.Concluding note44. The Minister of Education would not lose all his administrative/executive functions. For example the following executive functions would clearly staywith the Minister: (a) &quot;In the execution of the duties imposed on him by this Act, the minister shall, in particular, make such arrangements as he considers expedient for securing that there shall be available sufficient facilities for thetraining of teachers for service in schools, colleges and other establish-ments maintained by local education authority and for that purpose theMinister may give to any I.L.G. (instead of Tocal authority&apos; whichis the body mentioned in this clause of the Act) such directions as he thinks necessary requiring them to establish maintain or assist anytraining college or other institution or to provide or assist the provisionof any other facilities specified in the direction. When by any directiongiven under this section an I.L.G. is required to perform any such functions as aforesaid, the Minister may give such directions to other.L. Governments requiring them to contribute towards the expenses incurred in performing those functions as he thinks fit&quot;. (Clause 62.)(ft) &quot;The Minister shall secure that for the purpose of considering the remuneration of teachers there shall be one or more committees approvedby him consisting of persons appointed by bodies representing (I.L.G.s)Local Education Authorities and teachers respectively, and it shall be
the duty of any such committee to submit to the Minister, whenever theythink fit or whenever they may be required by him so to do, such scales of remuneration to the teachers as they consider suitable; and whenevera scale of remuneration so submitted is approved by the Minister, hemay by order make such provision as appears to him to be desirable for the purpose of securing that the remuneration paid by LocalEducation Authorities to teachers is in accordance therewith. TheMinister shall nominate the person who is to be the Chairman of any committee approved by him for the purposes of this section&quot;. (Clause 89.)And the Minister would also, of course, have detailed discussions with inter-mediate level governments about their educational development plans (seeparagraph 42 (a) of Appendix C).45. Finally, it is important to stress that the suggestions made in paragraphs 2to 43 above are intended mainly as a general illustration. More detailed study and investigation would be required before final decisions could be taken on whether all the functions in those paragraphs could be transferred to I.L.G.s.
QUASI-JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS IMPOSED ON THE MINISTER OFEDUCATION BY THE 1944 EDUCATION ACT WHICH MIGHT be devolved TO INTERMEDIATE LEVEL GOVERNMENTSIntroductory noteParagraph. 41 of Appendix C refers to the quasi-judicial functions whichthe 1944 Education Act confers on the Minister of Education. That Appendixsuggested that at least some of them might be devolved to intermediate level governments. It assumed, however, for the purpose of drawing up its overalllist of educational responsibilities to be devolved to intermediate level govern-ments (paragraph 42 above) that this would not happen. The purpose of this annex is to give a full list of these quasi-judicial functions. It will be clear from the list that since they all involve an appeal from an individual to theMinister against a local authority decision, such an appeal could go instead,either to an intermediate level government or to a newly constitutedAdministrative Tribunal. In any event, there is no reason why the Minister ofEducation should not be relieved of these duties; and it might well be thoughtthat in the interests of the liberty of the individual the central executive shouldnot perform functions of this kind.List of quasi-judicial functions which could be conferred on intermediate level governments or administrative tribunals1. Under the Act an L.E.A. can order a parent to send his child to a par-ticular school. In any dispute between a parent and the L.E.A. the appeal now is to the Whitehall Minister of Education.2. In case of disputes between a parent and an L.E.A. over whether a childshould go to, or may be withdrawn from, a special school, an appeal now goesto the Whitehall Minister of Education.3. Under the Act, certain categories of young people are exempt fromcompulsory attendance for further education. In the event of a dispute overwhether a young person falls into one of the exempt categories, the appeal isnow to the Whitehall Minister of Education.4. Under the Act and after medical examination a local authority can decide that an individual child is suffering from a disability of mind of such a natureor to such an extent as to make Mm incapable of receiving education at school.Under these circumstances it is the duty of the local authority to issue underthe Mental Deficiency Act 1913 a report that the child has been found incapable of receiving education at school. Before issuing such a report with respect toany child the local education authority has to give to the parent of the childnot less than fourteen days&apos; notice in writing of their intention to do so and ifwithin that period the parent refers to the Minister of Education the questionof whether such a report should be issued, the report shall not be issued except by direction of the Minister of Education. (Clause 57 (3).)
5. Under the Act any dispute between a Local Education Authority and the managers or governors of any school with respect to exercising any powerconferred or the performance of any duty imposed by or under the Act may,notwithstanding any enactment rendering the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty contingent upon the opinion of the authority or of the managers or governors, be referred to the Minister of Education; and anysuch disputes so referred shall be determined by him. (Clause 67 (1).)6. Any disputes between two or more Education Authorities as to which of them shall be responsible for the provision of education for any pupil, orwhether contributions in respect of the provision of education for any pupilare payable under this Act by one Local Education Authority to another,shall be determined by the Minister of Education. (Clause 67 (2).)Concluding note the Act does in fact set up an administrative tribunal to deal with two categories of disputes which may arise. This is an &quot;Independent SchoolsTribunal&quot;. The two categories of dispute which may be referred to the Indepen-dent Schools Tribunal are as follows: -(i) If the Minister of Education issues a notice of complaint that a registeredschool is objectionable on the grounds set out in paragraph 25 of annex I the notice may be referred to the Independent Schools tribunal for their adjudication.(ii) When a school has been struck off the register of independent schools and believes that it has subsequently put matters right but the Ministerrefuses to restore it to the register, the dispute can be referred to theIndependent Schools Tribunal. (Clause 74 (1), (2).)
RULE-MAKING POWERS CONFERRED ON THE MINISTER OFEDUCATION BY THE 1944 EDUCATION ACTIntroductory note the 1944 Education Act confers wide rule-making powers on the Minister ofEducation. All the rules he is empowered to make are subject to the negative resolution procedure in Parliament. It was assumed for the purpose of drawing up the broad list of educational functions to be devolved to intermediate level governments (at paragraph 42 above) that none of these rule-making powers would be devolved; but in paragraph 41 above it was suggested that some ofthem could perhaps be left to intermediate level governments. The purpose ofthis Annex is to list virtually all the rule-making powers conferred on theMinister by the Act. Those marked with an asterisk are ones which, perhapsmight be conferred on Intermediate Level Governments instead of on theMinister. They would then in effect become part of an Intermediate level governments&apos; Ordinance-making power as outlined in paragraph 243 et seq.of Chapter VI.List of rule-making powers conferred on the Minister of Education by the 1944Education Act*1. The Minister makes regulations prescribing the standards to which thepremises of schools maintained by Local Education Authorities are to conform,and such regulations may prescribe different standards for such descriptions of schools as may be specified in the regulations. (Clause 10 (1).)2. The Minister shall make regulations defining the several categories of pupils requiring special educational treatment and making provision as to thespecial methods appropriate for the education of pupils of each category.(Clause 33 (1).)3. The Minister may by regulations make provision as to the requirements to be complied with by any school as a condition of approval of the schoolas a special school, as to the withdrawal of approval from any school whichfails to comply with requirements so prescribed, and, notwithstanding that theprovisions of this Act requiring Local Education Authorities to have regardto the need for securing that primary and secondary education are provided in separate schools do not apply with respect to special schools, such regulations may impose requirements as to the organisation of any special school as a primary school or as a secondary school. (Clause 33 (3).)4. The regulations made under this section with respect to special schoolsshall be such as to secure that, so far as practicable, every pupil in attendance at any such school will attend religious worship and religious instruction orwill be withdrawn from attendance at such worship or instruction in accordancewith the wishes of his parent. (Clause 33 (4).)5. The Act empowers the Minister to raise the school leaving age fromfifteen to sixteen by a draft order in council. And unless either House of
Parliament within the period of forty days beginning with the day on which any such draft as aforesaid is laid before it, resolves that the draft be notpresented to His Majesty, His Majesty may by order in council directaccordingly. (Clause 35.)6. The Minister is given the power under the Act to determine by order incouncil, not later than three years after the date of the commencement of thispart of the Act, that it shall be the duty of every Local Authority to establish and maintain county colleges. (Clause 43.)*7. The Minister may make regulations as to the maintenance, governmentand conduct of county colleges and as to the further education to be giventherein. (Clause 43 (4).)*8. The Minister may by regulations make provision as to the form ofcollege attendance notices, as to consultation and the exchange of informationbetween different Local Education Authorities, as to the issue of certificates of exemption in respect of young persons who are exempt from, compulsoryattendance for further education, and generally for the purpose of facilitating the administration by local authorities of the provisions of this part of thisAct as to attendance at county colleges. (Clause 45 (3).)*9. Regulations made by the Minister shall impose upon Local EducationAuthorities the duty of providing milk, meals and other refreshment for pupilsin attendance at schools and county colleges maintained by them; and such regulations shall make provision as to the manner in which and the personsby whom the expense of providing such milk, meals or refreshment is to be defrayed, as to the facilities to be afforded (including any buildings or equipment to be provided) and as to the services to be rendered by managers, governors and teachers with respect to the provision of such milk, meals or refreshment,and as to such other consequential matters as the Minister considers expedient;however, such regulations shall not impose upon teachers at any school orcollege duties upon days on which the school or college is not open for instruc-tion, or duties in respect of meals other than the supervision of pupils, and shallnot require the managers or governors of a voluntary school to incur expenditure.(Clause 49.) It is interesting to note in this connection that while the Actempowers the Minister to issue regulations dealing with the provision of milk,meals and other refreshment for pupils the Act does not empower the Ministerto issue regulations controlling the duties of Local Education Authorities reproviding a pupil with board and lodging otherwise than at a boarding school or college, or with clothing; in these cases the Authority can require the parentto pay the authority in respect thereof such sums, if any, as in the opinion ofthe Authority he is able without financial hardship to pay.*10. The Minister may make regulations empowering Local EducationAuthorities to provide for pupils in attendance at any school or county collegemaintained by them such articles of clothing suitable for the physical trainingprovided at the school or college as may be prescribed. (Clause 52 (3).)*11. The Minister may make regulations as to the conduct of medicalexaminations and medical inspections for the purposes of this Act, and such
regulations may, in particular, make provision requiring that any class of suchexaminations or inspections shall be conducted by duly qualified medical practitioners having such special qualifications or experience as may be pre-scribed, or shall be conducted by a duly qualified medical practitioner selectedwith the approval of the Minister. (Clause 69 (1).)*12. The Minister may make regulations prescribing the particulars to be furnished to the Registrar of Independent Schools by the proprietors of suchschools and such regulations may provide for the notification to the registrar of any changes in the particulars so furnished and as to the circumstances inwhich the Minister may order the name of any school to be deleted from theRegister in the event of the Registrar being unable to obtain sufficient particularsthereof. (Clause 70 (4).)13. The Lord Chancellor may, with the concurrence of the Lord President ofthe Council, make rules as to the practice and procedure to be followed withrespect to the constitution of Independent School Tribunals, as to the manner of making appeals to such Tribunals, and as to proceedings before suchTribunals and matters incidental to or consequential of such proceedings, and,in particular, such rules may make provision requiring any such Tribunals to sit at such place as may be directed in accordance with the rules, and maymake provisions as to the appearance before such Tribunals by counsel orsolicitor and as to the payment to members of such Tribunals, as part of theexpenses of the Minister under the Act, of such remuneration and allowances as may, with the consent of the Treasury, be provided for by the rules.(Clause 75 (1).)14. The proprietor of every school (that is to say in the case of a countyschool or voluntary school the managers or governors thereof) shall cause tobe kept in accordance with regulations made by the Minister a Register con-taining the prescribed particulars in respect to all persons of compulsoryschool age who are pupils of the school, and such regulations may makeprovisions for enabling such Registers to be inspected, for enabling extractstherefrom to be taken for the purposes of this Act by persons duly authorised in that behalf under the regulations, and for requiring the persons by whomany such Register is required to be kept to make to the Minister, and to LocalEducation Authorities, such periodical or other returns as to the contentsthereof as may be prescribed. (Clause 80 (1).)15. The regulations made under the preceding paragraph shall prescribe the procedure by which a child may become a registered pupil and the procedure by which a child (not being a child with respect to whom a school attendanceorder is in force) may be withdrawn from any school at which he is a registeredpupil, and shall make provision for the deletion from the Register of the nameof any pupil so withdrawn. (Clause 80 (3).)*16. Regulations shall be made by the Minister empowering LocalEducation Authorities, for the purpose of enabling pupils to take advantage

ADMINISTRATIVE EXECUriVE FUNCTIONS CONFERRED ON THEMINISTER OF HOUSING BY THE 1969 HOUSING ACT BUT WHICHWOULD ON REDRAFTING THE ACT BE CONFERRED ONINTERMEDIATE LEVEL GOVERNMENTSIntroductory noteParagraph 44 above refers to the mixture of administrative and executive functions which the 1969 Housing Act now confers on the Minister of Housingbut which would, under the system of government proposed in Chapter VI,be devolved to intermediate level authorities. The purpose of this Annex isto give a full list of these functions. It might well be argued that some of theseministerial functions should either be abolished completely or handed over intheir entirety to local authorities without the intervention of an intermediatetier; I have marked with an asterisk functions that could be considered for inclusion in these latter categories.List of Ministerial Administrative/Executive functions which would be conferred on intermediate level governments. The Act limits the total amount of improvement grant in relation to onedwelling to: &quot;(a)  1,000 or such other amount as may be prescribed, if the dwelling isimproved by the works or is provided by them otherwise than mentionedin paragraph (b);(b)  1,200, or such other amount as may be prescribed, if the dwelling isprovided by the conversion of a house or other building consisting ofthree or more storeys&quot;. (Clause 5 (2).)However, the limits imposed by (a) and (b) above &quot;may be exceeded by suchamount as the Minister may approve, if the local authority are satisfied in aparticular case that there are good reasons for fixing a higher amount; and theapproval of the Minister may be given either with respect to a particular caseor with respect to a class of case&quot;. (Clause 5 (3).)2. &quot;The Minister may make a contribution towards the expense incurred&quot;by a local authority through improvement grants, standard grants or special grants. &quot;The contribution shall be a sum payable annually for a period of twenty years beginning with the financial year in which the works towards thecost of which the grant was made were completed, equal to three-quarters ofthe annual loan charges referable to the amount of the grant&quot;. (Clause 16.)3. The applications for standard grants, improvement grants or special grants which a local authority processes and decides are all from private individuals. Standard grants and improvement grants are also available to a
local authority in respect of any property the local authority itself owns; inthese cases a local authority has to apply to the Minister. Thus :-A(l) The Minister may pay an improvement contribution with respect toany dwellings if an application therefore containing such estimates andparticulars as he may require is made by a housing authority and approved by him.(2) When approving the application the Minister shall determine an amount as the allowable cost and that amount shall, subject to the limit imposed by or under the provisions of this section, be one-half of the aggregate of: (a) the amount appearing to him to be the cost proper to be incurred by the housing authority for the purposes of carrying out any worksrequired for the provision or improvement of the dwelling; and (b) thecost (if any) incurred by the housing authority in acquiring an estate or interest in any building for the purpose of converting it into any of thedwellings or acquiring any estate or interest in any of the dwellings forthe purpose of improving it.(3) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the allowable cost shall notexceed the amount arrived at by taking for each dwelling provided orimproved  1,000 or such other sum as the Minister may by order specify,unless the case belongs to a class with respect to which the Minister,on being satisfied that there is good reason for doing so, has determineda higher amount or the Minister is satisfied that in the circumstancesof the particular case there is good reason for determining a higheramount.(4) Where the dwelling is one in which the housing authority have acquiredan estate or interest for the purpose of improving it or is a dwellingprovided by the conversion of a house or other building in which thehousing authority have acquired an estate or interest for the purposeof converting it into dwellings, subsection (3) of this section shall haveeffect, with respect to the dwelling, as if  1,250 or such other sum asthe Minister may by order specify were substituted for that specified by or under that subsection.(5) The improvement contribution shall be a sum payable annually for aperiod of twenty years beginning with the financial year in which theworks required for the provision or improvement of the dwellings are completed, equal to three-quarters of the annual loan charges referableto the allowable cost. (Clause 18.)B (1) The Minister may pay a standard contribution with respect to anydwelling if an application therefore containing such estimates andparticulars as he may require is made by a housing authority and approved by him.(2) A standard contribution shall be a sum payable annually for a periodof twenty years beginning with the financial year in which the worksrequired for the provision of the standard amenities are completed,equal to three-quarters of the annual loan charges referable to theallowable cost.(3) Subject to the following provisions of this section the allowable costwith respect to any standard amenities shall be one-half of the cost
shown to have been incurred in carrying out the works required for&quot;   providing them.(4) If any of the works are not exclusively for the purpose of providing oneor more of the standard amenities, only so much of the cost of carryingout those works as is, in the opinion of the Minister, attributable to theprovision of the standard amenity or standard amenities shall be takeninto account under subsection (3) of this section.(5) There shall be a limit on the allowable cost, which shall be determined in accordance with Part III of Schedule 1 to this Act. (Clause 19.)4. As far as the improvements to local authority owned property are con-cerned: &quot;If any of the works are not exclusively for the purpose of providingone or more of standard amenities, only as much of the cost of carrying outthose works as is, in the opinion of the Minister, attributable to the provisionof the standard amenity or standard amenities shall be taken into account&quot;in calculating the amount of allowable expenditure.*5. Standard grants and improvement grants are also available under theAct to housing associations. The procedure specified here is: (a) A local authority makes an arrangement with a housing association forthe provision of dwellings by conversion or for the improvement of dwellings. &quot;The approval of the Minister, both to the making of thearrangements and to the terms thereof, may be given either generally to local authorities or to any local authority or class of local authority or in any particular case and may be given conditionally or subject to conditions&quot;. (Clause 21 (2).)(b) The Minister shall pay a contribution towards the cost of carrying outthe arrangements if an application therefore containing such particularsand estimates as the Minister may require is made by the local authority and the local authority certify, in such form as the Minister may direct,that the arrangements and the terms thereof comply with any conditionssubject to which his approval was given, and that in their opinion thedwellings will provide satisfactory housing accommodation for such period and conform with such requirements with respect to construction and physical conditions and the provision of services and amenities asmay for the time being be specified for the purposes of this section bythe Minister. (Clause 21 (3).)The Minister then determines the amount to be paid in respect of each applica-tion broadly as in paragraph 3 above. The Ministry pays the money in theform of an annual payment to the local authority-which hands it over to thehousing association. (Clauses 21 (7) and (8).)6. The Act empowers a local authority to declare a predominantly residentialarea within its boundary a &quot;general improvement area&quot;. This is where a localauthority believes &quot;that living conditions in the area ought to be improved by the improvement of the amenities of the area or of the dwellings therein or both&quot;. The local authority has to define the area on a map and then by resolu-tion declare it &quot;a general improvement area&quot;. It has to send the Minister acopy of the resolution, of the report indicating why the area should be an
improvement area and a statement of the number of dwellings in the area.It does not, apparently, require the Minister to approve any defined approve-ment area, but since certain things cannot be included in improvement areas,no doubt the Ministry will vet each local authority resolution to ensure that noprohibited area is included in an improvement area. In any event, a localauthority can reduce the size of a declared &quot;general improvement area&quot; only with the approval of the Minister.7. Where the local authority have declared an area to be a general improve-ment area, they may, for the purpose of effecting or assisting any suchimprovement, as is mentioned in section 28 (1) of this Act: (a) carry out any works on land owned by them and assist (whether bygrants or loans or otherwise) in the carrying out of any works on landnot owned by them;(b) acquire any land by agreement;(c) let or otherwise dispose of any land for the time being owned by them;and may be authorised by the Minister to acquire compulsorily any land withinthe general improvement area or adjoining that area. (Clause 32 (1),)8. Any land vested in a local authority as part of a general improvement area which is an open space or has been compulsorily acquired cannot be disposedof by the local authority without the consent of the Minister. (Clause 35.)9. Any other part of a general improvement area (other than paragraph 8above) shall not, without the Ministers consent, be sold, exchanged or let for aprice, consideration or rent less than the best that can reasonably be obtained.(Clause 35 (2).)10. The power of a local authority under section 32 (1) (a) of this Act tocarry out works on land owned by them, may with the approval of the Ministergiven (with or without limitation) either generally or in a particular case, beexercised notwithstanding that they have not appropriated the land for thepurposes of this Part of this Act. (Clause 35 (6).)11. (1) The Minister may, subject to any directions of the Treasury, pay a contribution to a local authority towards such expenditure incurred by them under this Part of this Act: (a) in carrying out works or providing any land; or(b) in making contributions to any other authority or persontowards expenses which might be so incurred by the localauthority;as he may approve for the purposes of this section on an application by the local authority made, where the expenditure is incurred incarrying out any works, before the works are begun.(2) For the purposes of this section: (a) the cost of any works shall be taken to be the amount certified by the local authority as appearing to them to be the costlikely to be incurred by them in carrying out those works; and
(b) the cost of any land acquired by a local authority under thisPart of this Act shall be taken to be the expenses incurred bythe authority in connection with the acquisition, and the costof any land appropriated by a local authority for the purposesof this Part of this Act shall be taken to be such amount asthe Minister may determine.(3) A contribution under this section shall be a sum payable annuallyfor a period of twenty years beginning with the financial year inwhich the relevant works are completed, equal to one-half of theannual loan charges referable to the expenditure approved for thepurposes of this section.(4) The aggregate of any expenditure approved for the purposes of thissection (whether on one or more applications) in respect of anygeneral improvement area shall not exceed the sum arrived at bymultiplying  100 by the number of dwellings stated by the localauthority under the preceding provisions of this Part of this Actto be in the area or, if it appears to the Minister that there will bean increased number of dwellings in the area, by that increased number; but the Minister may, for the purposes of this subsection (a) treat two adjoining general improvement areas as one; orib) treat the addition, in pursuance of section 30 of this Act, ofland to a general improvement area as the declaration of aseparate general improvement area.(5) The Minister may, with the consent of the Treasury, by ordersubstitute another amount for the amount of  100 mentioned in subsection (4) of this section, and a statutory instrument containingsuch an order shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of aresolution of the Commons House of Parliament! (Clause 37.)12. The Act imposes on every local authority the duty of carrying out aninspection of their area from time to time with a view of determining what action to take in performing their functions re general improvement areas and&quot;for the purposes of carrying out that duty their officers shall comply with anydirections the Minister may give and shall keep such records and supply him with such information as he may specify&quot;. (Clause 70.)* 13.(1) A local authority may, subject to such conditions as may be approved by the Minister, advance money to any person for the alteration, enlargement, repair or improvement of any dwelling,and the following provisions of this section shall apply with respectto an advance made under this section.(2) The principal of the advance, together with interest thereon, shallbe secured by a mortgage of the borrowers interest in the dwelling,and the amount of the principal shall not exceed the value which inaccordance with a valuation duly made on behalf of the localauthority, it is estimated that interest will bear when the alteration,enlargement, repair or improvement has been carried out.(Clause 74 (1) (2).)
*14. Re the grants at paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the maximum amounts inrespect of individual houses and specified amenities are set out in Schedule Iof the Act (e.g.,  30 for a fixed bath and shower, not more than  450 for a standard grant or contribution). However: (a) If the works comprise, in connection with all or any of the amenitiesprovided, the bringing of a piped supply of cold water into the dwellingfor the first time there shall also be allowed an amount fixed, by theMinister. The amount to be fixed shall be the amount which in theopinion of the Minister is one-half of such part of the cost proper to be incurred in carrying out the works as is attributable to the bringing ofthe piped supply into the dwelling.(b) If the works comprise the provision of a fixed bath or shower in abathroom and the bathroom is being provided by the building of a new structure or the conversion of out-building attached or to be attachedto the dwelling (or to the building of which the dwelling forms part)then, if before the application is approved, the Minister has been satisfiedthat it is not reasonably practicable to provide the bathroom in any other way there shall be substituted as the amount allowed for that amenityan amount fixed by the Minister. The amount to be fixed by the minister shall be such amount, higher than that specified in the Table set outin Part I of this Schedule, as in the opinion of the Minister is one-halfof such part of the cost proper to be incurred in carrying out the worksas is attributable to the provision of the fixed bath or shower in abathroom.(c) If the works comprise the provision of a water-closet and, in connection therewith, the installation of a septic tank or a cesspool then, if beforethe application the Minister has been satisfied that the connection of thewater-closet with main drainage is not possible or reasonably practicablethen there shall be substituted as the amount allowed for that amenityan amount fixed by the local authority or Minister. The amount to befixed by the Minister shall be such amount, higher than that specifiedin the Table set out in Part I of this Schedule, as in the opinion of theMinister is one-half of such part of the cost proper to be incurred incarrying out the works as is attributable to the provision of the water-closet.(d) The amounts to be fixed under (a), (b) and (c) above shall be fixed bythe Minister when approving the application for the contribution; butif the applicant satisfies the Minister that the works by reference to thecost of which the amount is fixed cannot be or could not have beencarried out without the carrying out of works in addition to thosespecified in the application, he may substitute a higher amount for thatfixed under those sub-paragraphs. (Schedule I to the Act.)
RULE-MAKING POWERS CONFERRED ON THE MINISTEROF HOUSING BY THE 1969 HOUSING ACTIntroductory note(a) The 1969 Housing Act confers wide rule-making powers on the Ministerof Housing. In some cases they are subject to the affirmative resolution pro-cedure; these are grouped together in Section A below. Others come under the negative resolution procedure; these are grouped together in Section B below.Section C lists rule-making powers conferred on the Minister which, apparently,are not subject to any Parliamentary approval or disapproval.(b) It was assumed for the purpose of drawing up the broad list of housingfunctions to be devolved to intermediate level governments (at paragraph 44above) that none of these rule-making powers would be devolved; but inparagraph 43 above it was suggested that some of them could perhaps be leftto intermediate level governments.(c) The purpose of this Annex is to list virtually all the rule-making powers conferred on the Minister by this Act. Those marked with an asterisk might be conferred on Intermediate Level Governments instead of on the Minister.They would then in effect become part of the Intermediate Level GovernmentsOrdinance making power as outlined in paragraph 243 et seq. of Chapter VI.List of rule-making powers conferred on the Minister of Housing by the 1969Housing ActSection A.   Rule-making powers subject to the affirmative resolutionprocedure1. The Act lays down the amount of financial contribution from the ministry to a local authority in respect of: (a) grants made by local authority to private applicants for improvements,etc., grants (Clause 16);(b) improvements etc., made by the local authority to houses etc., owned by the local authority (Clauses 18 and 19);(c) improvements made by housing associations (Clause 21).&quot;The Minister may by order vary with respect to grants, improvement contribu-tions or standard contribution made in pursuance of applications approvedafter such date as may be specified in the order ... the sum annually payable under section 16, or as the case may be, sections 18,19 or 21 of this Act.An order under this section: (a) shall not be made unless a draft thereof has been approved by a resolu-tion of the Commons House of Parliament: and(b) shall not specify a date earlier than the date of the laying of the draft,and before laying such a draft the Minister shall consult with such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned and with any housingauthority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable&quot;. (Clause 22.)
2. The Act empowers the Minister to increase the subsidy for option mort-gages set out in the Housing Subsidies Act 1967. A statutory instrument for this purpose has to be &quot;laid before and approved by the Commons Houseof Parliament&quot;. (Clause 78.)Section B.   Rule-making powers subject to the negative resolution procedure.*3. Schedule I to the Act sets out the standard amenities for which grantsshall be payable (e.g. a fixed bath or shower maximum grant  30). &quot;TheMinister may by order vary the provisions of Schedule I to this Act and anysuch order may contain such transitional or other supplemental provisionsas appear to the Minister to be expedient&quot;. (Clause 7 (2).)*4. The maximum amount of allowable expenditure by a local authorityfor the improvement or conversion of dwellings owned by them is fixed by theAct as  1,000 per dwelling, or &quot;such other sum as the Minister may by orderspecify&quot;. (Clause 18 (3).)*5. When a local authority has specially purchased property to improveor convert it, then the maximum amount of allowable expenditure for improve-ments or conversion is  1,200 &quot;or such other sum as the Minister may by orderspecify&quot;. (Clause 18 (4).)*6. The Act fixes the maximum amount of allowable expenditure by a localauthority for certain types of work in a &quot;general improvement area&quot; as notmore than a figure arrived at by multiplying  100 by the number of dwellingsin the area. &quot;The Minister may, with the consent of the Treasury, by ordersubstitute another amount for the amount of  100 and a statutory instrumentcontaining such an order shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a reso-lution of the Commons House of Parliament.&quot; (Clause 37 (4) and (5).)Section C;  Rule-making powers not subject to parliamentary approval ordisapproval7. Where improvements have been made to dwellings subject to controlledrents the local authority may issue a &quot;qualification certificate&quot; which has theeffect of moving the dwelling from the controlled tenancy category to the category of &quot;regulated tenancy&quot;. However, such a dwelling shall not become a regulated tenancy before: (a) 1st January, 1971, for a dwelling in Greater London of a rateable value of  90 or more and for a dwelling elsewhere of more than  60;(b) 1st July, 1971, for a dwelling in Greater London of  60- 90 rateable value (elsewhere  40- 60);(c) 1st January, 1972, for a dwelling of less than  60 in Greater London(elsewhere less than  40).&quot;The Minister may by order substitute as the date applicable to a dwellingof such value as may be specified in the order a date earlier than that whichwould be applicable to it&quot; under (a), (b) or (c) above; &quot;and an order under thissection may make different provisions with respect to different registrationareas&quot;. (Clause 50.)
8. The provisions of the Act &quot;shall have effect, in their application to theIsles of Stilly, subject to such exceptions and modifications as the minister may by order direct&quot;. (Clause 87.)9. The Act includes a new definition of houses in multiple occupation.Accordingly, the Act amends various previous Housing Acts to bring them into line with the new definition and the Minister &quot;may by order make similaramendments to any local Act or Act confirming a provisional order which waspassed before the commencement of this Act&quot;. (Clause 58.)
REFORM OF THE CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS OF government as AN ALTERNATIVE TO CREATING DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLIESIN SCOTLAND, WALES AND THE ENGLISH REGIONSIntroduction1. The scheme outlined in Chapters VI and VII is a logical and attractiveway of modifying our system of government to give more power to the people and to meet the very practical problems which arise from our membership in theCommon Market. But the creation of democratic assemblies in Scotland,Wales and the English regions is not the only possible solution. There is infact an alternative approach which leads to a very different kind of scheme.This alternative approach accepts the diagnosis of the main problems outlined in Chapters I to V; however, it then seeks to meet these problems by devisingchanges in our central institutions of government instead of setting up Scottish,Welsh and English regional governments.2. This alternative approach and scheme has much to commend it. However,we do not believe it will go as far as our scheme presented in Chapters VI andVII to meet the main causes of our present discontents. Nevertheless, we thoughtit right to present this entirely alternative scheme so that it can become partof the Phase 1 general public discussion envisaged in Chapter VIII. But we verymuch doubt whether it will command as much public support as our schemefor democratic assemblies presented in Chapter VI.3. The particular starting point for this alternative approach is the analysispresented in Chapter V. There it was argued that we already have a very sub-stantial tier of government and decision-making at an intermediate levelbetween the local authorities and the central government in Whitehall andWestminster. It consists, as Chapter V illustrates, of two different types of organisation the direct outposts of central government and the regional organisations of the various ad hoc authorities. Chapter V concluded that this level of government is not going to disappear. This is quite simply because there are a large number of important problems and functions which cannotbe satisfactorily handled except by bodies operating at this level; and, in any event, the Whitehall machine would become impossibly clogged if the worknow delegated to the outposts of central government was reabsorbed by depart-mental headquarters. But Chapter V also reached the conclusion that at thisintermediate level: (a) we need in England to rationalise the jungle of boundaries and replace them, if possible, by one set of regional boundaries to which all depart-ments and ad hoc regional structures would conform;(b) we need in England to create a centre of power in each region comparable with the Scottish and Welsh Offices, so that decisions can be takenthere on the wide range of different functional problems about schools,hospitals, roads, housing, etc., which, together, comprise regional policyand regional strategy;
(c) we need in Scotland and Wales and in the regions of England to devisearrangements so that the people in these areas can share in the decision-making processes and hold those who take decisions fully accountable;it should be democratic government, not bureaucratic government.4. To meet the points outlined in paragraph 3 above the approach in this appendix is to put forward a solution based not on setting up intermediate level assemblies but on modifying and extending the responsibilities of theexisting institutions of central government and in particular Parliament andthe main Whitehall departments (including their outposts). This comprehensivealternative scheme also seeks to satisfy the grievances and demands of thepeople (as set out in Chapter II), is in accordance with the principles outlined in Chapter IV and takes full account of the institutional consequences of our common Market Membership outlined in Chapter III.5. The changes here proposed for Whitehall and Westminster have thefollowing main objectives: (a) to ensure that in central policy making and administration the needs of&quot;the different nations and regions&quot; of the United Kingdom are more fully understood and considered than under existing arrangements;(b) to ensure that the representatives in Parliament from the differentnations and regions are more closely and publicly associated with,and have a bigger influence on, the central governments&apos; policy making and administrative pocesses than is possible at present;(c) to devolve from Whitehall the maximum amount of decision makingto the outposts of central government in Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions;(d) to provide means for the representatives in Parliament from Scotland,Wales and the English regions to be closely and publicly associatedwith, and have a major influence on, the activities of the outposts of central government and of the ad hoc authorities in their area.The changes needed in the organisation and operation of the central executive to achieve these objectives are outlined in the next section of this Appendix.This is followed by a section setting out the necessary Parliamentary changes.Changes in the United Kingdom executive structure of government. The first essential basis of the scheme is to develop in the central depart-ments of government the full capability necessary for appreciating the needsof the people of Scotland, Wales and the English regions and for ensuring that full account is taken of those needs in United Kingdom policy making and administration. The potential for this already exists as far as Scotland andWales are concerned. The Scottish and Welsh Offices with their detailed andintimate knowledge of their respective areas and with their Secretaries of Statemembers of the United Kingdom Cabinet already have powerful voices in whitehall. And Whitehall has a substantially complete picture both of thepublic expenditure provisions for these parts of the United Kingdom and also of their needs. So as far as Scotland and Wales are concerned the basic
organisational structure already exists. For the regions of England, thoughthe organisation exists in embryo only; the way it will have to be developedis outlined in the next paragraph.7. As Chapter V makes clear the English regional organisations of thedifferent central government departments (including the Economic planning councils and Boards) do not begin to match the Scottish and Welsh Officesas instruments for assessing regional needs and producing appropriate actionto meet them. So in England to develop the necessary basic organisationalstructure we need to: (a) rationalise the present large number of different departmental regionalboundaries and establish four or five &quot;standard&quot; English regions towhich all departments with regional organisations would conform1;(h) create in each of these, say, five English regions a single organisation with the authority and ambit of responsibilities of the Scottish and welsh Offices. These English regional counterparts of the scottish and Welsh Offices would each be headed by a Minister of State. Themain English regional outposts of the Department of the Environmentmight well form the nucleus of these new &quot;offices&quot;.8. Under the scheme the main functions of the Scottish and Welsh offices and their English regional counterparts would then be: (a) to assume responsibility in their respective areas for the administrationof agriculture and fisheries, education, health, economic planning, localgovernment, town and country planning, the new towns, housing,roads, transport and environmental services, the police, fire services,criminal policy, the prisons, organising and staffing courts, liquorlicensing, betting and gaming and lotteries, the protection of animalsand wild birds. (This is all part of the present responsibility of theScottish Office2.) Here the objective is the maximum amount of administrative decentralisation that can be efficiently achieved;(b) to help work out with the appropriate Whitehall departments policies in the different fields listed in (a) above which would meet the special requierements of their respective areas;(c) to &quot;oversee&quot; the activities of the other outposts of central governmentand of the ad hoc authorities operating in their areas. (These would include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department ofEmployment, and the Department of Health and Social Security; andsuch ad hoc authorities as the National Coal Board, the Gas and electricity Boards, the Regional Health Authorities, etc.);(d) to draw up for their respective areas the &quot;provincial&quot; strategy and medium and long-term plans within which the main local authorities would operate. This would be both physical and economic planning.It would involve considering all the planning problems presented bylikely demographic projections, technological change, and the invest-ment programmes of the nationalised and major private industries, and1 The case for four or five English regions instead of the now &quot;traditional&quot; eight is givenin Chapter VI and Chapter VIII.2 See page 66, ante.
the general economic, cultural, educational and environmental changesneeded to produce a prosperous and balanced use of the area&apos;s resourcesboth for the benefit of those who live and work there, and also, of course,to contribute to the health and prosperity of the United Kingdom as awhole;(e) to produce each year for their areas the proposed Public Expenditurepattern for the next five years. This would be a detailed breakdown forScotland, Wales and each English region of the Public expenditure survey figures now produced each year for the United Kingdom as awhole. And it would show, for example, in respect of each Englishregion the proposed spend in each of the next five years on such separateitems as Primary Schools, Hospitals, Major roads, Ports, Housing,Child Care, Fire Services, Prisons, Promotion of local employment to pick for illustration some of the items now separately shown for theUnited Kingdom as a whole in the Annual Public Expenditure white paper. It would cover current and capital expenditure; and would also include the expenditure of the nationalised industries. All this wouldinvolve major changes in the way Government Departments nowproduce and present their Public Expenditure proposals;(/) to supplement the Public Expenditure proposals by the necessaryProgramme Analysis and Review (P.A.R.). Thus the Scottish and welsh offices and their English regional counterparts would accompany theirP.E.S.C. figures with:-(i) &quot;explicit statements of the objectives of expenditure&quot; so that eachexpenditure programme can be judged against the strategy for thearea as a whole;(ii) &quot;a detailed analysis of existing programmes and of major policy options on them&quot;.This, in fact, is how the Government White Paper of 1970 proposedthat the U.K. P.E.S.C. exercise should be supplemented1. And it wouldseem sensible that the Scottish, Welsh and English regional P.E.S.C.should be supplemented in the same way.9. It needs to be stressed that under this scheme the Scottish and welsh offices would have broadly the same relationship as now with the UnitedKingdom central departments of government; and their new English regionalcounterparts would fit into this pattern.10. The scheme so far outlined is the essential ministerial and bureaucraticbasis we require if: -(a) the needs of &quot;the different nations and regions&quot; of the United kingdom are fully understood and considered in central policy making and administration;(Jb) the maximum amount of decision making is to be devolved fromWhitehall to the outposts of central government in Scotland, Wales andthe English regions.1 &quot;The Reorganization of Central Government&quot;. Cmnd. 4506. October, 1970. The phrasesin inverted commas at (i) and (ii) above are quotations from paragraph 50 of the White Paper.
However, we still have to subject this new mechanism to proper democraticcontrol to ensure that its decisions reflect the will of the people and to provide that the people&apos;s representatives have a full share in the decision-makingprocesses. This involves important changes in the role and composition ofParliament.Changes in the role and composition of Parliament11. The second essential basis of the scheme is to develop in Parliament thenecessary capacity to operate effectively not only at the central governmentlevel but also at the Scottish, Welsh and English regional level. In particularthis means that the elected representatives of the people in Parliament: (a) must have a bigger share in United Kingdom policy making and administration than they have at present; in a modern democracy it isnot enough for the great majority of the elected representatives of thepeople to be limited, for the most part, to essentially negative carpingcriticism of, and post facto investigation of, departmental policy decisionsthey have had no positive chance to shape;(b) must be closely and publicly associated with, and have a major influence on, the activities of the Scottish, Welsh and English regional officesoutlined in paragraph 8 above.And these major extensions of the present role of Parliament will, of course,be additional to the new burdens which Parliament will have to assume as aresult of Common Market membership1. The changes needed to enableParliament to operate in this way and effectively fulfil these tasks are outlined in the following paragraphs.12. To give Parliament a bigger role in general United Kingdom policymaking and to enable M.P.s to have a proper influence on the decisions which united Kingdom ministers will take in Brussels were, of course, two of the objectives of the scheme set out in Chapters VI and VII2. And the meansthere recommended to attain those objectives would be appropriate for this alternative scheme as well. Thus the House of Commons would: (a) set up functional committees matching the main departments of centralgovernment. The functional committees will (i) be associated with departments in the policy-forming process and before any Bill is presented to the House of Commons;(ii) consider and investigate proposals from the European Commissionto the Council of Ministers which fall within their respective spheres of responsibility. The appropriate House of Commons committeewill discuss these with the United Kingdom departmental minister concerned before he is called on to take a decision in the Council ofMinisters;(iii) investigate the operation of existing policies and legislation in theirrespective spheres and make any necessary recommendations forchange.1 See Chapter III, paragraphs 101 et seq., and also Chapter VII, paragraph 291 et seq.2 See in particular Chapter VII, paragraph 291 et seq.
ib) develop the role of the Public Expenditure Committee as is now broadlyenvisaged. Its sub-committees would need to work closely with the functional committees referred to at (a) above-and there may be a case for some overlapping membership here. It needs to be stressed, however,that the functional committees at (a) above do not make the public expenditure Committee unnecessary, or vice versa; all have their specialroles to play; . , .(c) set up a Public Taxation Committee so that the House can operate in taxation matters broadly as it is proposing to operate in the area ofpublic expenditure. It could be that the Public Expenditure committee could, in addition to its present duties, also take on the functionsenvisaged here for the Public Taxation Committee; in which case itcould in effect also become a functional committee with its responsi-bilities matching those of the Treasury.        &apos;       &quot;13. The proposals at paragraph 12 above should go a long way towardsenabling Parliament to increase its role in United Kingdom policy making and to have an impact on decision making in Brussels. But we still have toenable elected Parliamentarians to be closely and publicly associated with,and have a major, positive influence on, the activities of the Scottish, Welshand English regional offices outlined in paragraph 8 above. In theory, there aretwo alternative approaches here and they are outlined separately in thefollowing paragraphs. &apos;    &apos;   -14. The first alternative is to develop in the House of Commons the effectivecapacity to &quot;oversee&quot;, and be associated with, the activities of the Scottish,Welsh and English regional offices. In certain respects this would be a logicalprogression from the existing state of affairs. Thus, the House of Commonsalready devolves selected business affecting Scotland and Wales to suitablyconstituted committees (e.g. the Scottish Grand Committee, the Select Com-mittee on Scottish Affairs, the Welsh Grand Committee); and though these committees manifestly fail to give Scottish and Welsh M.P.s the influence they ought to have on the affairs of their respective parts of the United Kingdom,nevertheless, with appropriate changes they could in theory become the effectiveinstruments the scheme requires. And it would then seem logical to introduce a matching English regional committee structure. However, if we proceedalong these lines we need to be clear of the extent of the additional burden thiswould place on M.P.s. Some indication of this is given in the next paragraph.15. The basic and essential requirement if the House of Commons is todevelop the capacity to have an effective and positive impact on the workof the Scottish, Welsh and English regional offices is for it to set up, in additionto the main functional committees at paragraph 12 above, a number of areaselect committees. Thus, there would have to be a Committee for scottish affairs, a Committee for Welsh Affairs and a committee for the &quot;affairs&quot; ofeach of the five English regions. The main concern of those committees would be the activities of the Scottish and Welsh Offices and their english regional counterparts described in paragraph 8 above. Thus, for example,the Committee on Scottish Affairs would consult with, and advise, the ScottishSecretary of State on the formation of this &quot;strategy&quot; for Scotland and the medium and long-term plans (paragraph 8 (d) above); and the Committee
would also scrutinise the Secretary of State&apos;s Public Expenditure proposalsfor Scotland (paragraph 8 (e) above); here, it would, of course, &quot;not be barredfrom considering the policies behind the figures&quot;1. The Committee wouldalso be able to mount such enquiries as it thought fit into the operation ofexisting legislation in Scotland and recommend any necessary changes inpresent policies. With these wide-ranging responsibilities no doubt the Com-mittee would wish to operate through a number of sub-committees. In any event, it is envisaged that in its procedures the Committee would be able to callbefore it such outside witnesses, experts and civil servants or ministers as itbelieved necessary. Naturally, it would be useful if the Committee and its sub-committees could do much of their work in public and in Scotland; and it might in fact also hold a regular Question Time and general debates on the activitiesof the Scottish Office. The Welsh and English regional committees would naturally operate in a similar fashion. It is important to stress in this connectionthat the essential focus of these committees will be on the operation of theScottish, Welsh and English regional offices and the other outposts of centralgovernment operating in their areas; and they will cover, too, the activity ofthe nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies in their parts of the country.In contrast, the focus of the House of Commons Committees referred to inparagraph 12 will be the work of the Whitehall Departmental headquarters in London.16. Each of these area select committees would naturally be composed ofM.P.s from constituencies in the area. And if that meant, as it sometimeswould, that the Opposition had a majority on a particular Committee, that isnot a prospect to be rejected out of hand. It needs to be considered in the lightof the following two points: (a) although these committees would have a powerful influence on the affairs of their respective parts of the country, they would not themselvesbe able to force on the government of the day policies which the govern-ment were not ready otherwise to accept. They could do that only if their proposals were endorsed by the Commons as a whole;(b) these committees would provide the means for a dominant politicalgroup in any part of the country to have some influence on the affairs of its area (and therefore have some share in the processes of government)even though it was in a minority on the United Kingdom level. In thisrespect it would be a much needed influence in &quot;organising the consentof the governed to acts of government&quot;2.17. It would be an important part of the scheme that each of these areacommittees should co-opt as additional members a number of the elected representatives of the units of local government in the area. This would be a means of giving effect to the &quot;inter-locking principle&quot; referred to in paragraph 132of Chapter IV; and it would be an important means of associating local govern-ment more closely with those outposts of central government which so muchaffect their work.1 The phrase is taken from the Governmenfs Green Paper &quot;Select Committees of theHouse of Commons&quot; (Cmnd. 4507 dated October, 1970). It is part of a description of the role of the new House of Commons Public Expenditure Committee.2 See Chapter IV, particularly paragraphs 123 and 130.
18. It is clear from the preceding paragraphs that for M.P.S to play a positiveand effective role in the work of the Scottish, Welsh and English regional officeswill involve a major additional call on their time; and this would be on top ofthe very substantial enlargement of their present duties outlined in paragraph 12above. So there seems every reason to believe that however efficiently M.P.sorganised themselves they would quite simply not be able satisfactorily to cope with the total amount of work here envisaged for them; in which case theirenergies would be too dissipated to enable them to have the meaningful and positive influence on Brussels, Whitehall and the Scottish, Welsh and english regional outposts of central government which is so crucial if the general scheme outlined in this Appendix is to contain a truly powerful democratic ingredient.This takes us to the alternative approach.19. The alternative approach envisages that the main focus of House ofCommons&apos; attention in the future will be Brussels and Whitehall. Thus theHouse of Commons would primarily concern itself with carrying out thefunctions outlined in paragraph 12 above. It would then be logical to considerwhether the functions at paragraphs 14 and 15 above could become the responsi-bility of a reformed House of Lords. To give these special provincial or regionalresponsibilities (at paragraphs 14 and 15 above) to a reformed House of lords would, of course, be a natural way of developing the role of the Upper house in the future. It would be in line with the role of &quot;second chambers&quot; in otherparts of the world. Thus second chambers often specifically represent state,national, regional or provincial communities in a country where the first chamber represents the populace at large.20. If the House of Lords were to take on the provincial and regional responsi-bilities outlined in paragraphs 14 and 15, it would, of course, first be necessaryto reform its composition; this is because an essential part of the scheme is tobring a direct democratic influence to bear on the outposts of central govern-ment, So this means a reformed House of Lords must contain a directly electedelement. This could be brought about by changing the composition of the Houseof Lords, so that it would consist of: (a) a proportion of hereditary peers elected by hereditary peerage;(b) between 100 and 150 life peers nominated as now;(c) 150 elected members. Seventy-five of these could represent Scotland,Wales and Northern ireland and could be drawn from these countriesin proportion to their respective populations. The other seventy-fiveelected members could be drawn from the different English regions in proportion to regional populations. This would give Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland &quot;special&quot; representation as compared with theEnglish regions.It is envisaged that those at (c) above would be directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.1 The role of the Northern Ireland members would be determined in the light of developments in the new Northern Ireland system of government.
21. A House of Lords whose composition was reformed along the lines setout in paragraph 20 would retain its present functions. Thus it would continueto:-(a) provide a forum for full and free debates on matters of public interest;(Jb) revise public bills brought from the House of Commons in the light ofits special expertise;(c) initiate public legislation, including in particular those government bills which are not controversial in party political terms;(d) consider delegated legislation;(e) scrutinise the activities of the executive;(/) scrutinise private legislation.22. To carry out the new responsibilities outlined in paragraphs 14 and 15above the reformed House of Lords would set up eight Select Committees -one each for Scotland, Wales and Northern ireland and the five english regions. Each committee would be composed of all the elected representativesof the area concerned (who would be in a majority) together with a fewhereditary and life peers.23. The main concern of these committees would be the activities of theScottish and Welsh Offices and their English regional counterparts described in paragraph 8 above. Thus, for example, the Committee on Welsh affairs would consult with, and advise, the Welsh Secretary of State on the formulation of a &quot;strategy&quot; for Wales and the medium and long-term plans needed to giveeffect to it (paragraph 8 (d) above); and the Committee would also scrutinisethe Secretary of State&apos;s Public Expenditure proposals for Wales (paragraph 8 (e)above); here, it would, of course, &quot;not be barred from considering the policiesbehind the figures&quot;2. The Committee would also be able to mount suchenquiries asi it thought fit into the operation of existing legislation in wales and recommend any necessary changes in present policies. With these wide-ranging responsibilities no doubt the Committee would wish to operate through a number of sub-committees. For example, there might be a Public ExpenditureSub-Committee; and another sub-committee might be given responsibility forthe Development Plan and a third might be charged with some specific enquiry into a particular aspect of Welsh Affairs or into the operations of the nationalised industries in Wales. In any event it is envisaged that in its procedures the Com-mittee would be able to call before it such outside witnesses, experts, civilservants or ministers as it believed necessary. Naturally, it would be useful if the Committee could do much of its work in public and in Wales; and there might in fact be a regular Question Time and general debates on the activitiesof the Welsh Office. The Scottish and English regional committees would naturally operate in a similar fashion. It is important to stress in this connectionthat the essential focus of these Committees will be on the operations of theScottish, Welsh, and English regional outposts of central government operating in their areas; and they will cover, too, the activities of the nationalised industries See Footnote 1 on page 216.2 The phrase is taken from the Governments Green Paper &quot;Select Committees of theHouse of Commons&quot; (Cmnd. 4507 dated October, 1970). It is part of a description of thenew House of Commons Public Expenditure Committee.
and other ad hoc authorities in their parts of the country. In contrast, the focus ofthe House of Commons and its various Committees (referred to in paragraph 12)will be on the work of the Whitehall Departmental Headquarters in Londonand on proposals emanating from Brussels.24. It is an important part of the scheme that a proportion of the membersof each area committee should be drawn from the elected representatives oflocal government in their area. This is to give effect to the &quot;interlockingprinciple&quot; referred to in paragraph 132 of Chapter IV; and it would be animportant means of associating local government more closely with thoseoutposts of central government which so much affect their work. Of course,some of the members of each committee might well also be local governmentcouncillors; and this would limit the amount of co-option that might benecessary to ensure that, say, there were not less than six local governmentcouncillors on each area committee.25. Clearly, it would be useful to associate some members of the House ofCommons with the works of these &quot;area&quot; House of Lords Select Committees.Thus, for example, some of the elected M.P.S from Wales might (if they hadthe time) join the Welsh House of Lords Select Committee or its sub-committees.In this context, however, it needs to be emphasised again that the scheme as awhole envisages that the primary job of Welsh M.P.s would be to look afterthe interests of Wales at the Westminster and Brussels levels, while the mainfocus of the Welsh House of Lords Select Committee would be on the welsh office, and other outposts of central government and ad hoc authoritiesoperating within Wales.26. A Second Chamber reformed along the lines outlined above shouldalso be charged with one further responsibility in addition to those set out inparagraphs 22 and 23 above. It should be a specific part of its new role to actas a countervailing force to the natural centralising tendencies of any govern-ment. Thus in considering proposed legislation the House of Lords shouldsatisfy itself that: (a) the government was providing for the maximum amount of devolutionand decentralisation to its own outposts of government;(b) the government was devolving the maximum responsibility to thedifferent units of local government.And, of course, its area select committees in their surveillance of the operations of the outposts of central government in their areas would naturally be expectedto bring the maximum possible pressure to bear to try to ensure that in day-to-day administration the objectives as (a) or (b) were actually being achieved.27. It is essential to stress that the proposals in this Appendix for the reform of the House of Lords do not involve any increase in its power. Indeed, formallyand legally some further slight reduction is envisaged. Thus it is proposedthat:-(a) as now, the House of Lords should, in effect, have no power to reject&quot;money bills&quot;;
(b) the House of Lords&apos; present delaying power over public bills should belimited to a period of six months from the date of the disagreement with the House of Commons. Thus, for the future, a public bill originatingin the House of Commons on which there is disagreement between thetwo Houses should be capable of being presented for Royal Assent atthe end of a period of six calendar months from the date of disagreementprovided that a resolution directed that it should be presented had beendebated and passed by the House of Commons. At present, the Houseof Lords can delay a bill by one year from its second reading in the commons; so a Bill can now become law despite the Lords&apos; oppositionif passed by the Commons in two successive sessions, with not less thanone year elapsing between second reading in the first session and thefinal passing of the Bill in the House of Commons in the second session.The effect now in practice is that a Bill to which the Lords are opposedcan never be passed in less than thirteen months from the originalsecond reading of the Bill in the Commons and in some circumstances the period will be substantially longer. Thus, the recommendation beingmade here is in effect for a further slight reduction in the delayingpower; and it is in fact the proposal contained in the White Paper on house of Lords Reform which had its origins in an Inter-party conference and was presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister inNovember, 19681;(c) the present powers of the House of Lords in respect of subordinate. j; legislation be considerably reduced. The position now is that wherestatutory instruments are subject to parliamentary approval or amend-ment the power of the House of Lords equals that of the Commons;in other words the Commons has no means of overriding a decision ofthe House of Lords which conflicts with its own. Here it is proposedthat when a House of Lords decision is contrary to that of the House ofCommons, the will of the House of Commons should prevail after the instrument has been considered and voted on a second time by theCommons2, i28. The fact that the House of Lords will have significantly less power thanthe House of Commons over public and private bills and over subordinate legislation does not mean that the new House of Lords will be without thenecessary authority to carry out effectively the functions referred to in para-graphs 22 and 23 above. The essential purposes envisaged for the new Houseof Lords Committees are: (a) to give advice to responsible Ministers on Scottish, Welsh, and english regional affairs; ,(b) to scrutinise government proposals for the different parts of the UnitedKingdom by subjecting Ministers, Civil Servants and other witnessesto public questioning and examination.When Ministers and their advisers have to justify their proposals in public and through the process of rigorous and expert cross-questioning this in itself willenable the Committees of the Lords to have a powerful influence on, and share1 House of Lords Reform (Cmnd. 3799), November, 1968.2 This is in line with the proposal made in &quot;House of Lords Reform&quot; (Cmnd. 3799),November, 1968.
in, policy-making. So Committees of this kind will be able to develop a majorimpact on government decision-making without the need to endow them withthe technical power to force on the Government policies and strategies that itotherwise would not adopt.Changes in the role of the Ombudsman29. The scheme so far outlined in this Chapter should enable the people ofScotland, Wales and the English regions to have a bigger share in all the opera-tions of the United Kingdom Government. So it will do something to repairthe serious erosion which has taken place in the extent to which we as a peoplegovern ourselves. By itself, though, it will not be enough to meet the seconddefect in our present system of government set out in our report the in-adequacy of the existing means of investigation and redress where individualshave grievances or complaints about their treatment by the servants of thestate or public corporations. We need, therefore, to enlarge the operation ofthe Ombudsman. There are two main requirements here which are set out in thefollowing paragraphs.30. First, the present United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner shouldhave wider powers and terms of reference. Here the model might well be theNew Zealand Ombudsman. This would involve two specific changes: (a) there should be provision for direct access to the Parliamentary Com-missioner by members of the public; at present only M.P.S can refer a complaint to the Ombudsman;(b) the Parliamentary Commissioner is at present limited to the question of&quot;maladministration&quot;; the New Zealand Ombudsman can report on&quot;unreasonable&quot; actions by government departments. Thus, our Parlia-mentary Commissioner should be able to recommend redress whereany decision seems to him to be unreasonable in the light of all the factspresented.31. The second requirement if we are to provide for adequate means ofredress for individual grievances is to bring within the ambit of the Ombudsman&apos;sscrutiny those discretionary areas of decision making from which he is at presentexcluded. This means that local government and all the public services (e.g. the health service, the nationalised industries, the police, etc.) should all be brought within his purview. Whether the right policy here is to set up a series of separateOmbudsmen (i.e. one for local government, and another for the Health Service)as is now being done is a matter for decision in the light of experience, and this may well be the right way to proceed in the meantime provided that: (a) there is direct public access to all Ombudsmen;(b) their terms of reference cover &quot;unreasonable decisions&quot;;(c) all public services are covered.Other aspects of United Kingdom Government32. If our system of government were restructured along the lines so farsuggested in this Appendix, it would also be important to graft on to these
changes the broad proposals outlined in paragraph 308 et seq. of Chapter VII.These proposals involved considering the case for setting up a separateConstitutional Court, regulating and assisting the operations of our political parties and producing more open government. It seems unnecessary to describethese proposals a second time.Conclusion33. The scheme presented in the preceding paragraphs is basically designedto increase the power of the people while avoiding the need to set up an electedlevel of government between the local authorities and the central government ofthe United Kingdom. It would achieve this by: (a) giving the members of the House of Commons a much bigger share inUnited Kingdom policy making than they have at present;(b) enabling members of the House of Commons to have a major influence on the decisions which United Kingdom Ministers will take in Brussels;(c) reforming the operations and structure of the central departments ofgovernment and their outposts so they can develop the full capabilitynecessary for appreciating and meeting the needs of the people ofScotland, Wales, and the English regions. This involves creating english regional counterparts of the Scottish and Welsh Offices;id) introducing an elected element into the House of Lords which will: -(i) be associated with, and oversee, the work of all the outposts of central government and their responsible ministers;(ii) seek to promote the maximum possible degree of administrativedecentralisation and thus reduce the binders on Whitehall;(iii) &quot;oversee&quot; the activities of ad hoc authorities in the different partsof the United Kingdom;(e) extending the role of the Ombudsman and introducing other reformsincluding regulating and assisting the operation of our political parties.34. The scheme starts by recognising that this century has seen a vast increasein the power and activity of the executive. Effective Parliamentary control hasbeen blunted by the growing power of bureaucracy. The task of developing andrestoring proper parliamentary participation and influence is now so formidablethat it can best be achieved only if it is shared between two modern hard-workingchambers co-operating in their joint endeavours. In such co-operation eachchamber can perform those parts of the total operation for which it is bestfitted in the light of its composition and ultimate powers. In these jointendeavours the primacy of the House of Commons must, of course, be preserved;and the scheme achieves that as it seeks to give the elected representatives of thepeople the positive powers they must have in a mature and highly educateddemocracy.35. The scheme outlined in this Appendix is, we believe, worth consideringas an alternative to the scheme we have presented in Chapter VI. It should,therefore, be part of the public debated envisaged in Chapter VIII. In our view,however, the proposals in this Appendix will not go as far to meet the maincauses of our present discontents as our scheme for democratic assemblies inScotland, Wales and the English regions which we have presented in Chapter VI.
