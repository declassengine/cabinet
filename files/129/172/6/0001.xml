confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 106 COPY NO19 October 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT grant memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe environment. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment have discussed my proposals for the distribution of the newrate support grant which we shall be introducing as from 1 April 1974.(RE(73) 13th Meeting, Item 1 and RE(73) 14th Meeting, Item 2).2. Briefly, my proposals are for a new needs element formulathat would tend to give more grant to areas with above average needs to incur expenditure because of above average numbers of schoolchildren, or levels of social problems (particularly the declining areasof cities) or sparsity of population; and a new resources element thebenefits of which would be spread more widely than at present.    in practical terms, the effect is to give a rather larger share of the totalgrant to London and to the new Metropolitan areas, largely at the expenseof the areas with high resources (mainly the south eastern counties).3. The change in the percentage of grant received, at the possibledifferent levels of resources element is shown in Appendix I.    there could be a substantial loss of grant to certain counties, particularly inthe South East but also including Dyfed and Powys in Wales (though some of the losses would in any case occur simply because of reorganisation).    These losses would lead to corresponding increases in rate burdens which, in the context of stage 3, might be consideredunacceptable on top of the changes that will in any case be occurringbecause cf normal development of services and inflation.    Accordingly,I propose a transition arrangement under which domestic ratepayers inthe areas concerned would be shielded against exceptional increases inrate burden through an increase in the domestic element of rate support grant.4.        Rates next year will depend on the decisions we take about the total amount of grant to be paid, on which I shall be putting forward a separate paper.    The rate burdens in any particular authority will also depend onthat authority&apos;s decision about expenditure and about :the provision tomake for inflation.    I cannot therefore predict exactly what will happen to1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrates in any area.    But Appendices II to IV attached show what might happen in some new districts on the assumption that local authority expenditure nationally will increase by about 8 per cent including inflation(this figure is above that implied in Cmnd 5278 but below what localauthorities forecast and takes into account the transfer of responsibilityfor health services and certain student awards) and that the grantpercentage remains approximately the same as in 1973-74.    (On this basis, the national average increase in rate poundages would be8 per cent for non-domestic and 9.4 per cent for domestic ratepayers).5.        Although we cannot be absolutely sure what the position of any individual ratepayer will be next year we can through our new grantproposals, seek a more equitable distribution of rate burdens betweenareas.    And through a combination of a suitable level of grant in totaland suitable transition arrangements, we can seek to ensure that theincrease in rate burdens on individual domestic ratepayers next year&apos;s  kept in line with stage 3 policy.EXAMPLES6.        Attached are examples of the effects which my proposals wouldhave in five different districts chosen to give a spread or different circumstances.7.        Appendix II shows in summary form, on the assumptions referredto above, what rate poundages would be next year compared with thisyear.    It gives figures at the different levels of resources elementbetween which we must choose.    It also shows how, where there is a loss of grant compared with the old system, my transition proposals would modify the burden falling on the domestic ratepayer and theeffect on commercial and industrial property.8.        Appendix III then shows separately the further relief which wouldbe given to the lower value houses as a result of the change in thestatutory deduction which was approved by RE Committee and which will put right last year&apos;s miscalculation.9.        Appendix IV deals with the third part of my proposed strategy foreasing the rate burden on the less well off.    That is the new system of rate rebates we have already agreed in outline.    The new scheme willextend a system of rate rebates from its present coverage of about800, 000 to over 3 million householders.    I will be circulating a separate paper to RE Committee on final details of the scheme, but subject to theapproval of those details, Appendix IV shows how in each of the fivedistricts chosen, a married man with two children living in a house of(low) rateable value for the area, (and with earnings of either thenational average or one lower level) would be relieved of rates.confidential
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION10        The new system of grant distribution is designed to provide afairer distribution of government grants paying particular attention tothose aspects of policy which were not covered by the old system, inparticular the needs of the declining urban areas.    But any new system will have problems.    The change in the statutory deductions will give some relief but the scheme needs the further safeguards of -i.       a transitional scheme which will modify the impact on domestic ratepayers in areas which lose grant and modify the effects of water and sewerage reorganisation;ii.       the new rebate system which will help those with lowincomes.11.       Our immediate need is to decide on the division between the needs and resources elements.    I suggest a reasonable balance given London&apos;sown high resources on the one hand and Wales!s high share of grant onthe other would be to put the figure for resources element at 25 per cent.I accordingly seek my colleagues approval to the grant distributionproposals set out above (the full details were given in RE(73) 48) withresources element at 25 per cent of the total of grant (excluding the domestic element) and transitional arrangements applied through the domestic element.GRDepartment of the Environment19 October 19733CONFIDENTIAL
