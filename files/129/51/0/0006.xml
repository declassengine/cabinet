(52) 1064th April, 1952CABINETGERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs when I last brought this question before my colleagues in my memorandum c. (52) 36 of 13th February, I drew their attention to the long-term problem of meeting the costs of our forces in Germany in 1953-54 and subsequent years, whenthe German contingents of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) will beabsorbing an ever-increasing proportion of Germany&apos;s total financial contributionto defence.2. I should, however, like my colleagues to be aware of the present state of negotiations for the use of the German financial contribution to defence in 1952-53,since we may yet be faced with awkward problems even in the course of this first year after the German Contract enters into force.3. My colleagues will recall that the &quot; Three Wise Men &quot; recommended atotal German financial contribution to defence in the year July 1952 to June 1953of DM. 11-25 thousand million. During the Lisbon Conference we learnt thatthe German Federal Government had agreed to base its defence contribution onthe figure recommended by the &quot; Three Wise Men.&quot; The Federal Republic is tomake available an average amount of DM. 850 million a month (i.e., at an annual rate of DM. 10-2 thousand million) from the date of the entry into force of thecontractual relationship with Germany and of the European Defence CommunityTreaty until 30th June, 1953. This is to meet the cost of supporting Allied forcesin the Federal Republic and of the German contribution to the E.D.C. In addition,the Federal Government will meet expenditures estimated to amount to aboutDM. 1,000 million in a year on certain budgetary items of a defence character,admitted under the criteria of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,e.g., payments for Allied occupation costs in Berlin, certain military pensions, &amp;c.The date when the contractual relationship and the European Defence CommunityTreaty will come into force will depend upon the ratification of the two agreementsby all the countries concerned, but it is hoped that it will not be later than theautumn of this year.4. When I met Mr. Acheson and M. Schuman in London in February beforethe Lisbon Conference, we agreed to accept for the support of Allied forces in1952-53 a maximum figure of DM. 6-8 thousand million. This figure was basedon estimates prepared by the various Allied forces in Germany for the german financial year April 1952-March 1953. These estimates are now to be discussed in Bonn with the German Federal Government, which will undoubtedly put pressure on the Allies to effect reductions. Subject to anything which may emerge from these discussions, a rate of expenditure based on an annual sum ofDM. 6-8 thousand million, i.e., two-thirds of the total available to be spent on allied and German forces, is the amount required for the support of Allied forcesin Germany in accordance with present deployment plans, for the period betweenthe date of entry into force of the contractual relationship and 30th June, 1953.5. If we could be sure that the Deutschemark cost of building up Germancontingents in the E.D.C. would not exceed a rate of DM. 3-4 thousand million during the same period, then we should be unlikely to have any major difficultiesin getting the full Allied requirements met by the Germans up to 30th June, 1953.42094
Although the preliminary estimates made on the Allied side suggested that thetotal German contribution should be adequate to cover both the German and Alliedcosts in the first year, the Federal Government has recently circulated estimates of the costs they would incur in the first year of building up German contingentsgiving a total of about DM.9 thousand million. Expenditure at this rate in the initial stages of building up German forces seems quite unrealistic. The germans are certain, however, to argue that, if their figure is to be cut, the Allied share ofDM. 6 - 8 thousand million should also be cut, and that we should all make sacrificesto keep within the agreed total figure of DM. 10-2 thousand million.6. We have recognised that it is the responsibility of the Paris Conference onthe European Army to scrutinise the German plan underlying these estimates andto work out revised figures on a realistic basis. This work of scrutiny is proceeding in Paris with the assistance of American and British observers. If, contrary toour expectation, the Germans are able to show, to the satisfaction of the paris conference and of the Allied High Commission, that their rate of expenditurecan reasonably be set higher than we have hitherto thought possible, and if as aresult the difference between the total of Allied and German costs and the total german financial contribution to defence in 1952-53 is a substantial one, weshall be confronted with a serious situation.7. Since we are not in a position to assume any additional burdens ourselves and cannot count on help from the United States, the allocation for the UnitedKingdom forces of fewer Deutschemarks than they require for military efficiencywould present us with a serious problem of political and military priorities. Onthe other hand, if the amount available for the German contingents is less thanthe Germans require and can spend on. a realistic basis, there would be obviousdifficulties in securing German agreement to accept a slowing up in the rate ofbuild-up of their contingents within a plan accepted by the Paris Conference. Itwould not be easy to persuade them to agree that, on a wider appreciation of theneeds of Western Defence, it is better to give preference to forces already inexistence over forces of which recruitment has not yet begun and cannot begin untilthe ratification of the Treaty.8. A further complication is the attitude of the other E.D.C. Powers, Italyand Benelux. The latter have already made it clear to us in Lisbon that they want to see an early and effective German military contribution to E.D.C. and that theyare not prepared to provide any finance for this themselves. While they also wantUnited Kingdom and United States troops to remain in Germany, they are unlikely to support us in any argument which might have the effect of slowing down german rearmament, and therefore, the effectiveness of the E.D.C. The French and the americans so far have maintained a firm front with us. But the Americans are unlikely to agree that meeting the total costs of Allied forces should necessarily have priority over the build-up of German contingents.9. Until the examination of the German plan of build-up and of the costs ofthe German contingents has been completed in Paris, it is impossible to tell whether we shall be faced with the possibility of being called on to meet part of theDeutschemark costs of our forces in Germany as early as 1952-53. Our negotiatorsare, of course, doing everything possible to avoid this and I hope the problem willnot arise. But I think that my colleagues should be aware of this dangerouspossibility.A.
