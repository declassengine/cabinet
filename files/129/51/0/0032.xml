CONFIDENTIALCopy No.  63C (52) 13222nd April, 1952CABINET OFFICE:RECORD COPYCABINETITALIAN LABOUR IN THE COAL MINESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and PowerOur colleagues should know of the deadlock on the employment of Italians inthe pits. By early next month the last of the 2,381 Italians recruited for coal miningwill have arrived and their distribution will be approximately as follows:  Placed in the pits       ............... 1,208Yet to be placed from (a) Other work     ............       92(b) Divisional Training Centres......      405(c) English Teaching Centres     ......      676 1,1732. Owing to firm and growing opposition from the local branches of theNational Union of Mineworkers (N.U.M.), placings are now virtually at a standstill.Indeed, it may be difficult to retain in the pits some of the Italians already at work,for at Bullcroft Colliery, near Doncaster, 31 Italian miners have been suspendedbecause the other miners refused to work with them. While some of the miners&apos;leaders are not in sympathy with the local opposition and indeed two or threeweeks ago were individually ready to support the reinstatement of these Italians,the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers have now refused to advisereinstatement. And even if they did it is unlikely that the local branches wouldrespond to such advice.3. Our first reaction was that this was an intolerable situation. When itsuits them, as in wages negotiations, the N.U.M. insist on national agreements, but when anything awkward or embarrassing emerges, such as the present situation on Italians, the N.U.M. take refuge in a non possumus attitude and leave decisions to local option by the Lodges. Our inclination in these circumstances, was to makea stand and press the National Coal Board (N.C.B.) to insist on the reinstatementof the Italians at Bullcroft Colliery.4. But it appears that we might have to pay a heavy price. While the York-shire N.U.M. have passed a resolution disapproving of the action taken by theminers, neither they nor the National Executive of the NUM. would be at all likelyto support re-instatement of the Italians; and the N.C.B. have advised that if weinsist on re-instatement a strike is inevitable at Bullcroft and that it is likely to spread, as did the Grimethorpe strike in 1947, to other collieries in Yorkshire.Moreover, Yorkshire would on this issue have the sympathy of other areas, includ-jng Lancashire and South Wales, and the strike might spread to those areas with a loss in a fortnight or so of up to 2 million tons of coal. And in the end the N.C.B.might have to give way, as they virtually had to do at Grimethorpe. If this happened we should have gained nothing and would have lost any prospect of theincrease in coal exports which we hope to be able to provide in July.Total:2,38142158Printed for the Cabinet.

5. It goes very much against the ; grain but we cannot ignore the lesson ofGrimethorpe that when the miners, particularly the Yorkshire miners, feel that theyhave a grievance no aniount Of persuasion from &quot;their leaders&quot; or from&apos; the Govern-ment will budge them. For Grimethorpe we had the full support of the N.U.M.,who held mass meetings to try to persuade the men to return to work (but, on this,occasion&quot; we cannot count on the support of the N.U.M.). The-&apos;^holemweijgftt;-6f^the Labour Government was brought to bear on the Grirhethbfpe &quot;miners,Mr. Shinwell himself addressing a mass meeting, but with an entire lack ;bf isueeess.)The Yorkshire miners are unlikely to pay any more attention to us,6. Indeed, we cannot ignore the possibility that political influences may beat work and that the miners would welcome the chance of a row on an issue such as this on which it would be possible to let loose a torrent of emotional prejudice.There is no doubt of the dangers here and already at Bullcroft feeling is runninghigh. These miners want to fight, and many more will back them up whether or not they feel strongly about the issue. Should we accept the challenge now or would itbe wiser to wait for an occasion when we have more to gain?7. We have a lot to lose but not much to gain here. From the point of viewof output the 31 Italians at Bullcroft are neither here nor there. But it looks as though we must also give up much hope of placing more than a few of the thousandItalians remaining in the pipeline. Even a thousand men, however, pan make onlya small contribution to our problem and we must in the main rely on our own resources for the additional man-power needed to increase output; happily recruit-ment is still going well with an increase of over 10,000 so far this year. It is, ofcourse, wrong in principle that the Italians should be rejected and we realise thatthis must cause some disquiet to the Foreign Secretary and in Italy and othercountries. But there would be even more disquiet if, following a large-scale strike,we had to reduce coal exports. This position has been fully explained to O.E.E.C.countries and appears to be appreciated by them.8. Inevitably, problems will arise for the Minister of Labour in finding other employment for the Italians not yet placed and not likely to be placed in the pits.But those problems will have to be faced whatever we do and much as we should like to take up the miners&apos; challenge at Bullcroft we are forced to the conclusionthat it would be unwise to do so.:&apos;&apos; L.G.
