CABINET OFFICE ?/&apos;rJI i;. - RECORD COPY&quot;(TfilUDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 125 COPY NQ.4*M-9TH APRIL, 1952CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONALTERATIONS IN RAILWAY FARES ON 1ST MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, andthe Minister of TransportIncreases in railway fares will come into operation on 1st May underthe Charges Scheme recently confirmed by the Transport Tribunal.   Theactual alterations are set out in the Annex.   Some of the increases are substantial.2. The Transport Act places the responsibility for controlling theCommission^ charges fairly and squarely on the Transport Tribunal.3. The Scheme, while prescribing scales of passenger charges,leaves a latitude to the Commission (subject to certain permitted maxima)in a number of respects, e. g. in the raising to normal level of all charges which have so far been below it.4. The Commission are required by the Transport Act to levy such charges as to secure that their revenue is sufficient to meet their expenditure, and having regard to the greatly increased cost of labour and materials which they in common with other undertakings throughout thecountry have had to face, increases in their charges are inevitable.5,       ,     The Commission satisfied the Tribunal that the general scope ofthe increases proposed was no more than was sufficient for the dischargeof their obligations.   The increases must be regarded as a whole and anysubstantial reduction of those proposed for any large class of travellerwould entail a further increase for another class or classes.6. The particular increases which seem likely to lead to public corn-plain t are:-(a) The raising of subnormal fares to normal.(b) The general modifications in early morning fares,(c) The abolition of shift workers&apos; tickets.(d) The withdrawal of concession fares, i. e. reduced fares for particular classes of people such as commercial travellersand theatrical touring companies.7, The raising of sub-normal fares will apply to a number of ordinary,monthly return and early morning fares mainly in Scotland, and to seasonticket rates in various areas.   The increase will vary up to the maximum
of 42% permitted by the Charges Scheme.   There will be many cases wherethe increase in season ticket rates and early morning fares will be sub&quot;stantial.   The withdrawal of shift workers&apos; tickets will affect a relatively small number of users but the effect will be to increase their costs oftravel substantially.   The 42% permitted maximum does not apply to them.The withdrawal of concession fares will affect particular classes of usersonly.8. The position has been discussed informally with the Chairmanof the Commission who indicated certain proposals (shown in the Annex)which will tend to reduce complaints.   These are the extension of cheapday fares in Scotland, the selection of chargeable routes which providea reasonable service, and the availability of early morning fares up to. 30 a.m.   Reconsideration is also being given to one or two of the concession fares shown in the list for withdrawal.   The question of with -drawing the Forces (leave) concession is linked with discussions now inprogress about the fares for Forces duty travel.9. Lord Hurcomb also stated that the Commission propose to informthe public to the fullest extent possible of the impending changes throughnational and Scottish press conferences on Wednesday, 16th April,supplemented if possible by broadcast talks on the Home and ScottishRegional programmes.   In addition, posters will be exhibited at all stationsthe morning after the press conferences, and their local officers throughoutthe country will be asked to explain the local effect of the changes broughtabout by the charges scheme to the local press and local bodiesinterested.L.J.S.M.9TH APRIL, 1952.-2-
PROSPECTIVE ALTERATIONS ON 1ST MAYOrdinary and Monthly Return FaresThe present standard basis of charge for third class travel is2.44d. per mile.   In fact a very large proportion of travel is at the monthly return rate which is 1. 79d. per mile.   The Tribunal with these facts in mind have laid down a new basis of 1. 75d. per mile with latitudeto the Commission to raise this to a maximum of 2d. from 1st January, 1953.At least until the 1st January therefore there will be some reduction both inordinary fares and in monthly return fares at the normal rate.   Thereare, however, a very considerable number cf sub-normal fares (bothordinary and monthly returns) particularly in Scotland.   These can beincreased up to the normal rate subject in the case of ordinary faresto the maximum limit of 42% imposed by the Tribunal.   The Commissionintend to mitigate the effect of such increases in Scotland to a certain extent by the extension of cheap day fares at about the level of bus fares.Alternative RoutesIn many cases today fares by a direct route between two pointsalso apply to circuitous routes between those points.   This will no longer be the case, unless the difference in mileage is small.   The chargeablemileage will, however, be by a route which provides a reasonable service.Workmen1 s FaresThese will be replaced by early morning return fares (at ahigher scale).   The increase in scale ranges between 6% and 35% accordingto distance.   The effect of increasing sub-standard fares in England andWales will be small, but again there will be a number of substantial increases in Scotland.   The Scheme provides that these fares shall apply only to journeys completed before 8. 0 a. m. but, where now availableafter that time, the Commission propose to allow up to 8. 30 a. m. for at least 12 months.Shift  Workmen&apos;s TicketsAs in London these will be withdrawn.   The Commission estimate the number of users to be about   0,000, but the average daily user is only about IOjOOO.Season TicketsThe increase in scale ranges between 3% and 9% according todistance travelled, but a high proportion of existing season ticket rates aresub-standard.   Some rates will be increased by the full permitted increase of42%.   The extent of sub-standard rates is greatest in the North Eastern,Southern, Eastern and Scottish Regions.   The overall effect of the increasein scale and the lifting of sub-standard rates will be an increase rangingbetween 24% and 31% according to distance travelled. .Concession FaresSome concession fares will be continued at about the same level.Others will be discontinued.   The resultant increase in fare will be only about 10% in a number of cases but in 12 cases will be about 40%.These are anglers, commercial travellers, Commonwealth Parliamentary-1-
Association, Mercantile Marine (leave), children at training schools and ships, shipwrecked mariners, entertainers and music hall artistes (day-return only), workers on land (return), Forces (leave), Forces travellingto tournaments, etc., visitors to children at approved schools, poorchildren on holiday sponsored by voluntary bodies.   (One of the concession fares to be continued is for parties of eight or more, with oneadult for each eight in the case of juveniles.   This will be availablefor poor children on holiday.)
