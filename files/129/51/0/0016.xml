CABINET office record COPY(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 116 copy NCjoM-7TH APRIL, 1952CABINETUNITED STATES CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OFTHE KATYN MASSACREMemorandum by the Foreign secretary i circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of an inter-view between Sir Willicm Strang and the United States Ambassador.2. The Katyn Massacre of Polish officers was alleged to have been committed by the Russians and discovered by the Germans after they invadedthe U.S.S.R.   United States public opinion has always been keenly interestedin this subject and, following the growth of anti-communist feeling in the UnitedStates, the House of Representatives set up a Committee of Investigation,which has been conducting public hearings in the United States.   A member ofthis Committee, Representative 0&apos;Konski, recently arrived in this countryin order to establish whether formal hearings could be held here by the fullCommittee, which is expected to arrive towards the end of this month.   Similarhearings have been provisionally arranged in France and Western Germany.Mr. 0&apos;Konski also wishes Her Majesty&apos;s Government to co-operate with theCommittee by releasing documents and providing the names and addressesof witnesses.3. The United States Embassy later informed me that a further proposal has been made for one or two members of the Committee to take depositionsin London from witnesses in private, but that the final decision of the Committeeis not likely to be made until they all assemble in London on 14th April.   I am therefore having the issues involved studied urgently in consultation with theHome Office, and I am considering whether I should not draw the american ambassador&apos;s attention, in advance, to the political and legal implications of the various proposals which have been put forward.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,7TH APRIL, 1952.
ANNEXRECORD OF CONVERSATION WITH THEUNITED STATES AMBASSADORThe United States Ambassador called at my request this afternoon todiscuss the proposal made by a Committee of the House of Representatives of theUnited States Congress, which is investigating the Katyn massacre, that theyshould hold formal hearings in London.   He was accompanied by Mr. Courtney ofthe United States Embassy.   Sir Roger Makins was present.2. I told the Ambassador that this proposal raised some difficult issues,and that before the Secretary of State discussed it with his Ministerial colleagueshe had instructed me to find out officially from the Ambassador precisely whatwas involved.3. Mr. Gifford said that the action in question was being taken by theLegislative Branch of the United States Government.   He himself realised thatit might cause difficulties for Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and for the FrenchGovernment, who had already expressed anxiety at the proposal to holdhearings in Paris.   He had expressed his misgivings to the members of theCommittee now in London, and he thought it had now been decided that all thehearings would be held in Germany.   He would confirm this as soon as possible.4. Mr. Gifford said that it had been in any case accepted that the hearingswould not take place in the Embassy.   He supposed that there  was nothing toprevent American citizens coming to London to hold private meetings in an hotelwith anyone who wished to attend them, though he clearly recognised that this could not in fact be done without publicity.   I pointed out to Mr. Gifford thatthis was a question of a committee purporting to conduct a judicial enquiry on british soil.   It was not a private visit.5. The Ambassador agreed.   He then asked whether there would be any objection from Her Majesty&apos;s Government, assuming that the hearings were held in Germany, if the Committee were to invite and arrange to take over british subjects or persons resident in the United Kingdom to testify in Bonn.I said I would enquire and let him know.6. Finally, the Ambassador left with me an official noteasking whether certain documents and information alleged to be in the possession of Her Majesty&apos;s Government could be made available to theCommittee.   I undertook to have this note studied without delay.(Intld.)     W.S.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.,3RD APRIL, 1952.
