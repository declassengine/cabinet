/-a document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)secret.(52) 108.7th APRIL, 1952.CABINET office record COPYccpy no.CABINETTHE IRON AND STEED bill memorandum by the Minister of Health.On 20th March theCabinet approved in principle the draft Iron and Steel bill attached to C. (52) 80, and invited members of the Cabinet to convey to me,for further examination by the Steel Committee, any comments or suggestions which they might wish to make on the Bill, with a view to my making afurther report thereon to the Cabinet (C.C.(52) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 3).   I now report accordingly.2. Comments were made by the Lord Chancellor and by the Minister ofLabour as indicated in the two following paragraphs.   The Steel Committeehave discussed their suggestions with these two Ministers.3* Provisions for EnforcementThe Lord Chancellor has drawn attention to the unusual natureof the procedure laid down in Clause 40 of the Bill, for the enforcement of its provisions relating to the controls of development and prices.   This Clausedoes.not, as might be expected, make breach of these controls a criminal offence, but provides that the requirements of the Board shall be enforced byinjunction procedure, as though those requirements were a contractualobligation undertaken towards the Board by persons subject to the controls.The Lord Chancellor feels that this provision is open to some objection inprinciple and may give rise to protracted proceedings, resulting by aroundabout route in penalties for the enforcement of orders of the Courtsimilar to those which might be imposed directly if breach of the controlswere made an ordinary criminal offence.   He has, however, discussed thematter with the Solicitor-General and is satisfied that serious Parliamentaryobjection might be raised to any provision treating as a criminal offencebreaches   of regulations or orders which are to be made, not by the government or by Parliament, but by the Iron and Steel Board, which will be an independentstatutory authority.The Lord Chancellor and the Steel Committee are agreed, therefore, that clause 40 should remain as drafted.4. Training and Joint ConsultationThe Minister of Labour has suggested that, in view of the desirabilityof taking any opportunity which may offer of introducing statutory provisions which accord with the principles of the Workers1 Charter, the Bill should placeupon the Iron and Steel Board the duty not only of encouraging vocational training in the Iron and Steel Industry (as it already did in Clause 14(1)) but also
to encourage the adoption of,effective arrangements for joint consultation on questions (other than wages and conditions of service) which are of interestto both sides of the industry.   The Steel Committee agree with this suggestion and provision has been made accordingly in Clause 3(f) of the draft.5. In addition the Minister of Supply has drawn attention to two othermatters which have arisen since the Bill was last before the Cabinet.   Theseform the subject of the next two paragraphs.6. Scope of the Iron and Steel board as I informed theCabinet on 20th March, it is now proposed that theThird Schedule, setting out those activities within the Iron and Steel Industryaffected by the Bill, should be divided into two categories, viz. Category A,being the activities to come under the supervision of the Board immediately on passage of the Bill;  and Category B, being the additional activities which may during a limited period be brought under the supervision of theBoard by Ministerial Ordef requiring affirmative resolutions in both houses of Parliament.   After further discussion with the industry, the Minister ofSupply recommends that the division between these two categories of the third schedule should be as shown on the last page of the attached print.   Withthe exception of iron casting, all the activities shown in Category A are atpresent almost wholly within the nationalisation statute.   Iron casting hasbeen added to Category A (although steel founding is in Category B) because theiron casters, by a majority, wish to be included in Category A, and becausethey use very much larger quantities of raw material than the steel founders.The Steel Committee consider that the present content of this Schedule andthe division between its two parts are reasonable.   The Minister of Supplywishes, however, to have discretion to make further adjustments in it in thelight of consultations still in progress.7, Compensation for Members of the corporation the Steel Committee and the Chancellor of the Exchequer agree with asuggestion made by the Minister of Supply that provision should be made(in paragraph 17 of the First Schedule of * the Bill) for compensation to membersof the Iron and Steel Corporation whose offices will be terminated prematurelywhen the Bill becomes law.   This compensation, to be fixed by the Minister ofSupply in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might be a sum ofthe order of one-third of the salary due for the unexpired period of the member&apos;s contract of service.8. I submit, for the approval of the Cabinet, the attached revised draft of the Iron and Steel Bill, which has been amended where necessaryto take account of the foregoing points.K.C.Ministry of Health,   .W.1.7th APRIL,, 1952.
