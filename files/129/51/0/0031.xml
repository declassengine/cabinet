TRANSPORT policy presented by to parliament by Command of Her Maiesty1952-london her MAJESTY^ STATIONERY office net cmd.
TRANSPORT policy. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration ever since they took office the situation resulting from the passing of the transport act, 1947. In their view this Act has not achieved and is not likely to achieve its avowed purpose which was &apos;&quot; to provide or secure or promote theprovision of an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated systemof public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods,&quot; and &quot; to provide most efficiently and conveniently forthe needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry &quot;.2. In spite of the efforts made by the British Transport Commission andits Executives, integration of its road and rail services into a co-ordinatedwhole has made little progress, and shows little real prospect of developinginto much more than working arrangements between separate transportentities. Even if integration in its fullest sense were practicable, it wouldresult in a huge, unwieldy machine, ill-adapted to meet with promptitudethe varying and instant demands of industry.3. Experience has shown that the administration of the railways hasbecome excessively centralised under the Act, and that the Road haulage executive, with the elaborate system of depots working under its direction,cannot give trade and industry the speedy, individual and specialised servicesafforded by free hauliers before nationalisation, and could not stand up tocompetition from them.4. The Transport Act provided for area passenger transport schemes which were intended to cover the whole country, and for schemes for tradeharbours or groups of trade harbours. The efforts so far made by theCommission to promote these schemes have provoked opposition in so many quarters that it is clear that they would have little chance of surviving the elaborate procedure provided in the Act for bringing them into force.5. The Government have therefore decided that new and constructivelegislation is imperative. It is not enough merely to amend or remove the undesirable features of the Transport Act: a positive approach is neededunder which, with a minimum&apos; of centralised control, the transport systemmay be stimulated to adjust and develop itself in accordance with publicneeds, and may regain and increase the flexibility without which the demandsof trade, industry and commerce cannot be adequately met.6. The main features of the Governments proposals are as follows.Road Haulage7. Road haulage has in the past been restricted largely in order to avoidexcessive competition between road and rail. This process haslgone sofar as to deprive trade and industry of the full advantages of modern road transport and has driven traders to provide their own road transport toan extent which would not otherwise have occurred.8. The Government are convinced that the undertaking of the road haulage Executive set up under the Transport Act should revert to privateenterprise. For this purpose it is proposed that the undertaking should be divided into operable units (including a suitable proportion of small units)and be offered to the public for disposal by open tender. Units acquiredwill be given &quot;A&quot; carriers&apos; licences under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,
and will at once be freed from the 25-mile limit imposed under the transport act. Eventually this limit will ibe removed from all vehicles, and in the interim period the existing permit system will foe continued.9. In order to allow road haulage to play its appropriate and expandingpart in the transport system, provision will be made for greater latitude inthe granting of new licences under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,where need for a fuller or more convenient service is shown.10. Since the goodwill of the former businesses out of which the road haulage Excutive was formed has substantially disappeared, its undertakingis unlikely to be sold at the price at which it was bought. On the other hand,the units to be marketed will be going concerns and purchasers can beexpected to pay for the trading rights and opportunities which go with them.The Railways11. The railways are a national asset. They must remain an essential element in transport, and cannot foe allowed to fall into decay. The presentexcessive centralisation of the railways must, however, be reduced by givinggreater autonomy to areas which may follow the general pattern of thepresent regions. Scotland will be a separate area. The areas will togethercontinue to constitute a single entity for financial purposes and for thecontrol of charges.12. The existence of these separate areas should encourage a healthyrivalry between them, and give greater scope for initiative than is possible under a single centralised administration.13. It is not intended that the area organisation should be set out indetail in the Bill. It will be dealt with in a Scheme which the commission will be required to submit to the Minister of Transport for his approval.14. The Commission will foe given greater latitude to vary their chargesschemes so as to improve the ability of the railways to compete with other forms of transport. Within prescribed limits they will be free to raiseor lower their charges with subsequent approval by the Transport tribunal and subject to the over-riding powers of the Minister.Levy on Road Transport15. These proposals will affect the finances of the Commission in two ways. First, as stated in paragraph 10 above, the price realised by the saleof the Road Haulage Executive^ undertaking is likely to be less thanthat for which it was bought. Secondly, the expansion of road haulage may result in some further transfer of traffic from rail to road which cannot be offset by countervailing economies in railway operation, including the closing down of redundant capacity. The Government propose to make goodto the Commission the losses arising from these two causes. This they propose to do by imposing a levy on goods vehicles, including those of &apos; C&apos;licensees. A large proportion of the goods now carried by road is carriedunder &apos; C&apos; licences and the holders of those licences could not reasonably expect to be exempt from a levy applying to road hauliers. The levywill not, however, extend to small local delivery vans operated under&apos; C&apos; licences.16. This levy will be designed to yield initially an annual sum of  4millions. This sum will enable the loss on the disposal of the road haulage Executive^ undertaking to be amortised over a period of years
IT11and will also include some provision for loss of railway revenue arisingfrom further transfer of traffic to the roads. The extent of these lossescannot, however, be measured until the changes authorised by the Billhave taken effect. The levy therefore, while it will be limited exclusively to these purposes, will be adjusted at intervals, say of three years, bythe Minister of Transport after consultation with the Transport Tribunal.When the loss from the disposal of the Road Haulage Executive^ under-taking is known, one element in the levy will be definitely ascertainableand the period for amortising that loss can then be determined. Theremaining element in the levy need be increased only to the extent thatthe roads attract additional traffic, and therefore additional earnings, from therailways. Thus, the levy will never impose an excessive burden upon road transport and, in view of the large number of vehicles concerned, its incidenceon any particular operator will not in any event be heavy. It will be confined to the purposes stated above and will not be used for other purposes, e.g. tomake good loss of railway revenues due to a recession in trade or a failure on the part of the railways to secure reasonable economies.17. The scheme-making powers of the Commission in respect of road passenger transport and harbours (paragraph 4 above) will be repealed.18. The Governments proposals in regard to road passenger transport are limited to repealing the scheme-making powers of the Commission.They intend, however, to take an early opportunity of reviewing, in thelight of present-day conditions, the- working of the licensing system for publicservice vehicles set up under the Road Traffic Act, 1930.19. Such, in broad outline, are the main principles by which the Govern-ment will be guided in framing legislation to amend the Transport Act. Othermatters of less importance such as bringing the Commission^ goods vehicleswithin the licensing system set up by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,will also be included. The general effect of these proposals will be tore-establish a measure of competition between road and rail in long-distancejourneys. This will encourage efficiency in both. The railways will be protected by means of the levy from losses of revenue which are due to increased road competition and cannot be met by economies in operation.Trade and industry will get a better service, and the distribution of traffic between road and rail will be determined by the advantage which each hasto offer to the trader. This in the opinion of the Government should lead tobetter and cheaper transport than could possibly result from the &quot; integration &quot;contemplated by the Transport Act, which in any case would have tended to subordinate the needs of the trader to a plan, rather than to adapt transport to his needs.CONCLUSIONPRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HER MAJESTY S STATIONERY OFFICETo be purchased from york He use, Kingsway, London, w.c.2      423 OxfoP.O. box 569, london, s.e.113a Castle Street, Edinburgh, 2      1 St. Andre39 King Street, Manchester, 2     Tower Lane2 Edmund Street, Birmingham, 3      80 Chichestc1 St. Andrew&apos;s Crescent, CardiffTower Lane, Bristol, 180 Chichester Street, Belfast423 Oxford Street, london, sv.or from any Bookseller1952Price d. net printed   IN    GREAT    BRITAIN(15514)   Wt. 553-2428   105, 81   4/52   D.L.
