secret -CABINET office record COPY rrc. (52) 149 copy no.5th may, 1952cabinetIRON AND STEEL bill note by the Minister of supply in considering the legislative programme for the remainder of this session the Cabinet should be aware of the serious consequences of postponing the Steel Bill.2. The steel industry at the moment is virtually without leadership.   Theknowledge that it is to be denationalised has deprived the Corporation, whose members in any case had little standing in the industry, of almost all influence and authority.   Likewise the Federation, many of vAose main functions will betaken over by the proposed Board, is tending to mark time.   The effect of this state of uncertainty is to throw more and more on to the Government theresponsibility for decisions in regard to development, raw materials and other important questions, which the industry should be taking itself.3. Furthermore, the shorter the period between denationalisation andanother General Election, the less are the prospects that the Labour Party wiUhesitate to raise the issue of re-nationalisation.4. If the Bill could be passed by the end of this year the new Board would come into operation by next April and a beginning could be made next summer andautumn with the return to private enterprise of those parts of the industry whichare more readily saleable.   Assuming that the present Parliament lasts four years,the industry would have just three years in which to settle down under the new board.   To postpone the Bill until next Session would reduce this period to twoyears, and would certainly not give the new organisation time to take root or to prove its worth.5. It is not for me to express an opinion as to whether the postponement of theBill is unavoidable.   It is, however, my duty to point out to my colleagues thepossible effects.   First, it will be damaging to the industry in the interval, at atime when maximum production is vital.   Secondly, it will greatly prejudice our prospects of lifting the steel industry out of politics and will endanger thepermanence of our work of denationalisation.6. I attach a memorandum I have just received from Sir Ellis Hunter,the President of the British Iron and Steel Federation, which amplifies these points,D.S.Ministry of Supply, W. C. 2.,5TH MAY, 1952.
MEMORANDUM BY. SIR ELLIS HUNTER, PRESIDENT OF THEBRITISH IRON AND STEEL federation the Iron and Steel Industry views with alarm any suggestion that the Ironand Steel Bill should not be introduced and passed at the earliest possible moment.The main reasons in support of this view are as follows:-1.    IRON AND STEEL production the Economic Survey states that &quot;in the case of coal and steel, thegreatest possible increases in production are urgently needed&quot;.   The difficulties are such that it is unlikely that there will be any appreciable increase in productionthis year, and output will probably again be below that of 1950.   The solution ofthese difficulties is impaired by the continued existence of the Iron and steel corporation of Great Britain.While the Act is on the Statute Book, the Corporation has legalresponsibility for decisions affecting current output.   With its sectional authority,it is unable to advise on crucial questions affecting output, such as the distributionof raw materials between iron foundry and steel production.   Further, decisions on current matters are inevitably delayed by the lack of knowledge and experienceof the Corporation.   At present, urgent adjustments, designed to relieve the importedore shortage by securing increased use of home ore, are under discussion.   these discussions have already been in progress for nine weeks, and it is probable that itwill be many more weeks, or even months, before any decision will be in sight.Deferment of the Bill would inevitably intensify the difficulties with theCorporation.   Any attempt to remedy this position by adding members to theCorporation from the Industry would only appear to endorse nationalisation andthus render ultimate de-nationalisation more difficult.2.    development work by the Industry itself on its Second Five-Year Development Plan isnearing completion and will require early approval.   This Plan should be one of thefirst matters for consideration by the new Board.   It would be a serious misfortuneif it were to fall to the existing Corporation to take major decisions on the Plansince, in view of their limited existence, they cannot bring to bear a balanced viewof the Industry over the next five years.   If the plan were now to appear under the aegis of the Corporation, it would be hailed by the Opposition as an achievement of nationalisation.Any further delay in the long-term development planning of the industry would prejudice production in three or four years1 time.   The benefits from de-nationalisation require time to materialise and, unless an early start is made, theycould not be achieved in the life-time of this Government.3.     UNITY OF MANAGEMENT AND LABOUROne of the strongest grounds for hope of a permanent solution to the steelproblem is that, by the time of the next Election, the new form of control will havebeen working smoothly and effectively for a sufficient period to remove any case which the Labour Party might put forward for re-nationalisation.   There are clearindications that the present policy of the Unions is that, once the Bill is passed, theywill co-operate and do all in their power to secure its effective operation.Mr. Lincoln Evans, General Secretary of the Iron and Steel-Trades Confederation -the main Union in the Industry - in a recent report, said, with reference to steel
2I0!de-nationalisation, &quot;there is no reason to suppose the present Government will carry ou* ^s intentions or feel less obliged than any other Government to^ypllfil its Election pledge ....   If, therefore, the Steel Industry is de-nationalised,the Confederation, if the interests of its membership are to be safeguarded, mustconcern itself about the kind of control set up to ensure that it will be adequate for its purpose&quot;.The goodwill of the Unions in assisting the satisfactory operation of this measure, once it is passed, will redound to the credit of the Government.   Thisgoodwill would be imperilled by a postponement of the Bill, which could hardly fail to be interpreted as an indication that the Labour Party&apos;s threat of re-nationalisation had proved effective.4.    THE PROSPECT FOR DE-NATIONALISATIONThe best answer to the Strauss threat is the early establishment of theIron and Steel Board under the new Act, with the Union co-operation already mentioned.   The establishment of this Board would create an atmosphere underwhich the gradual working out of the de-vesting provisions could be successfullyconcluded by the end of this Parliament.   Any appearance of delay would be interpreted as being due tc the Strauss threat and would give confidence to theLabour Party that the threat was of real significance.A number of firms and individuals are known to have held funds in liquidform to be ready to change back into steel securities when the Bill is passed.It would be increasingly difficult for these funds to be held if the Bill were delayed.-2-
