mE C R E T__ CABINET OFF.IC.fcRECORD COPY ,C. (52) 133 COPY NO./A23RD APRIL, 1952CABINETLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Minister of health i have discussed with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip the cabinet&apos;s request at their meeting on 10th April (C. C. (52) 41st Conclusions,Minute 1) that legislative programmes should be prepared on the alternativehypotheses of passing before the end of the session either (i) an Iron and steel bill and a Transport Bill, or (ii) an Iron and Steel Bill and any stand-stillmeasure which might be required for transport;   and this memorandum is submitted with their agreement.2. A list is annexed of the Bills already enacted during the session, atpresent before Parliament or not yet introduced but considered by ministers to be essential.   The best estimate that can be made of the time needed in-theHouse of Commons to pass outstanding Bills, except for the four shown in&apos;E 1 of the Annex, for which time has not been allowed, and making allowance for other essential business, is 81 days.   It should be borne in mind, however,that the longer the session continues the greater the possibility of having to findadditional time for urgent Bills and other important business, such as generaldebates.   This is particularly the case after any Recess.3. I estimate that, under the guillotine, 14 further days in the Houseof Commons would be required for the Iron and Steel Bill.4.      - .    In addition, 20 days might be required to pass a large transport bill through the House of Commons with the guillotine for all stages after thesecond reading.   This might be made up as follows:-Second Reading -   3 daysGuillotine motion -   1 dayCommittee (on floor of House) -   12 daysReport -   3 daysThird Reading -   1 dayThese figures are very approximate but indicate the kind of time-table whichis possible.5. On the basis of the above estimates the duration of the session mightbe as follows(a)   If the Iron and Steel Bill and the principal Transport Bill are included.,Parliament would have to sit until 15th August, resume again on 9thSeptember and sit continuously till Christmas.   The Transport Bill, which cannot-1-
be ready for introduction before the beginning of August, would have to leavethe House of Commons by Thursday,, 2,0th November, in order to give the Houseof Lords one month for its consideration.   New business would have to befound to occupy the House of Commons while the Transport Bill was in theHouse of Lords and to pass many fresh Bills would add to the congestion in the lords.   Alternatively, time could be given for a series of general debateswhich might be embarrassing to the Government or the House of Commonscould go into recess during this period, though this would be contested bythe Opposition.I consider that to resume early in September after only three weeks&apos; breakand to sit continuously until Christmas would put too great a strain upon Parlia-ment and upon the machinery of Government.   But if the summer recess lastedtwo months (from 15th August to 14th October), the Transport Bill could not leave the House of Commons till 17th December.   The House of Lords would have toconsider it after Christmas and the session might have to go on till the end ofFebruary, unless that House met in January to deal with the Bill.   If thepresent session did not end until late February, the new session would be openedearly in March and there would not be time to debate the Address and completeessential Business of Supply before 31st March.Sitting on until 15th August will be unpopular on both sides of the House;but the alternative of securing a two months&apos; break by rising at the beginning ofAugust and resuming at the beginning of October would clash with theConservative Party Conference.It is perhaps worth reminding my colleagues that the change from aspring opening of Parliament to one in the early winter was made in order toget the Debate on the Address completed, to obtain the Second Readings of the major Bills of the year before the Christmas adjournment so as to give adequatetime for their consideration before financial and supply business comesforward and to avoid end-of-session congestion in the House of Lords.   our difficulties about this year&apos;s legislative programme stem from the fact that owing to an autumn election this could not be done, and the major Bills are having to follow instead of precede the financial business of the session.I therefore conclude that we cannot attempt both Bills this Session,(b)  If only one of these Bills is included.If the main Transport Bill is not proceeded with this session but theprogramme includes the Iron and Steel Bill and a stand-still Bill relating to transport (while I do not know what this stand-still Bill would consist of, I assume that it would be of one or two clauses, and take about six days at most under aguillotine) Parliament would have to sit till 15th August and resume on14th October after the Conservative Party Conference.   The necessary businesscould probably be cleared by the end of November and the new session could openearly in December.As the main Transport Bill cannot be ready until the beginning ofAugust a decision to include it and not the Iron and Steel Bill would not substantially modify the position set out at (a) above.i. My colleagues may wish to weigh up the political considerations if it isthought necessary because of this time-table to postpone till the new session -though possibly to circulate for study - both the Iron and Steel Bill and the largeTransport Bill, but to include a small &quot;stand-still&quot; Bill in regard to Transport.If this were done, Parliament might not need to sit into August, could resumeon 14th October and could close the present session some time in November.
The Government would have two major Bills ready for introductionimmediately the new session began and its record for this session could bejustified on the following rounds(i)   It would have grappled with the financial and economic situation andrestored confidence in the pound sterling.(ii)   It would have given increased pensions and family allowances, partly to meet the increased cost of living.(iii)   It would have launched its housing policy.7. It is necessary to point out that if opposition is intensified toall  Government business, as is most probable, the estimates of time for thevarious Bills which form the basis of these calculations may prove totally inadequate.   They are, however, the best that can be made at present.   until a decision is taken about these major Bills, the Parliamentary programme cannotbe drawn up in greater detail and the length of the session cannot be arranged.H.
