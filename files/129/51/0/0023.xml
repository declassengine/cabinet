confidnetial cabinet office record COPY . &amp;C. (52) 123 COPY NO. g I8TH APRIL, 1952CABINETCANADIAN MEAT PROPOSALMemorandum by the Minister of food we have been asked by the Canadians if we can help them in dealing withthe serious situation arising from the United States embargo on all importsfrom Canada of meat, cattle and pigs because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Prairie Provinces,   As a result the Canadians expect to have a surplus of about 35/40 thousand tons of beef and 35/45 thousand tons of porkin the remainder of 1952.2. Their suggestion is that we should allow the New Zealand and australian meat to be shipped to the United States up to these quantities, for replacement by an equal tonnage of Canadian beef and pork shipped to theUnited Kingdom from Eastern Canada where there is no foot and mouth disease.I understand that the Minister of Agriculture would not object on veterinarygrounds.3. The financial arrangements would still have to be settled indetail with experts whom the Canadians are anxious to send to London for thepurpose.   An essential feature of the Canadian proposal is that we should incurno dollar expense, and that we should pay no more for the Canadian meat than we should have done for that from the Southern Dominions.   There might bea small dollar gain to the Sterling Area.4. There are arguments both for and against offering to co-operate with the Canadians in working out arrangements on these lines.   As the requestraises a general question of Commonwealth relations, and the Canadian Govern-ment have instructed their High Commissioner in London to see me on the subjectltomorrow, I think that the Cabinet should consider these arguments,5. The main objections to the scheme are as follows:-(a) It has been suggested that if once the Australians and New Zealandersstart selling their meat in the United States, they will be so attracted by the higher prices and the dollar earnings that we shall suffera permanent loss of supplies.(b) After all the efforts which the Governments of Australia and NewZealand, particularly the latter, and their meat producers have been making to increase their shipments to the United Kingdom, a majordiversion of their supplies to North America at this juncture might lead to misunderstanding about the reality of our need.(c) The greater part of the Canadian surplus will probably be in the form of pork, which is less popular among consumers here than mutton, beef and lamb.
The shipping and marketing arrangements which would be needed togive effect to the diversion would be complicated, and it might bedifficult to protect our interests fully in working these arrangementsout without some friction.- 6. As against the above arguments, there are the following:-(a)    Our contracts with Australia and New Zealand already allow both countries to sell a proportion of their meat in the United States,but they have not been very successful in doing so hitherto, and theamounts they are at liberty to sell there are strictly limited.It is also doubtful whether New Zealand would be anxious to sell cowbeef in the United States in competition with North American prime beef.The Canadian beef is of better quality than the Southern Dominions;it is likely that 80-90% could be used for the ration, whereas more than half the Southern Dominion beef is suitable only for manufacturing.If we were to turn down this proposal out of hand, and the Australiansand New Zealanders - as might well happen - were to hear of it after-wards, our action might appear to them to have been high-handed.Unless we can convince the Canadians that the scheme would be materially to our disadvantage, a blank refusal to help them out oftheir difficulties when they have appealed for our help, will have an unfortunate effect on Anglo-Canadian relations.7. Oh balance, it seems to me that we should not ourselves take theinitiative in turning down a proposal on which we know the Canadian Governmentare anxious to secure our co-operation.   The scheme may prove impracticableor may be unacceptable to the Australians and New Zealanders in any event;but we shall be on much stronger ground in turning it down if we have examined it on its merits with the Canadians and the Southern Dominions,G.LL-G.Ministry of Food, S.W.1, ,8TH APRIL, 1952.(b)(c)(d)-2-
