(52) 117-7th APRIL. 1952.TEXTILE industry note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a summary of thecase put before the Minister of State for Economic Affairs on 4th Aprilby a deputation from the Cotton and Rayon Industry.COPY NO.     \0  /cabinet.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.7th APRIL, 1952.
SUMMARY OF THE CASE MADE BY A DEPUTATION OP THE COTTON ANDRAYON INDUSTRY ON kill APRILResponding to your suggestion that the Cotton and RayonIndustry Deputation should put on paper a summary of the points made verbally this morning, the following has been agreed with my colleagues:-1. The deputation authoritatively represents the views of theentire industry, all manufacturers, all merchants, all trade unions.2. The case is for the abolition of Purchase Tax on cotton andrayon products on the ground that otherwise(a) lack of confidence among &quot;operators&quot; down the line willprolong stagnation in trade and acute unemploymentthrough summer and autumn;(b) when the export markets start buying United Kingdomsupplies will be short in quantity and distorted inqualities.3. Unemployment through 1952 will diminish beyond recovery thehardly won labour force and owing to bitter memories of the 1920&apos;this may well be the final straw.    The importance of the labourfront needs no emphasis and is a major justification for so seriousa recommendation.    The gravest danger is t hat it is the key men whotend to go first to jobs where their return is less likely.km The chief obstacle to orders for the mills is lack ofconfidence among operators.    This is caused by choking of the pipe-lines and our evidence convinces us that the most potent cause ofchoking is holding back for fear of losses due to Purchase Tax.It has also become the most deadly of the anti-confidence influences.5* In a buyer&apos;s market any Purchase Tax is bound to reducedemand and increase unemployment.    Seen in the light of a buyer&apos;smarket it is clear to us such a trade as ours cannot bear 66(/btaxation or the threat of it.    It is a killing rate and it will kill.The anomalies and distortions of the D scheme will be equally fatal.&apos;6. Distortion of qualities will follow the almost universaleffort to make cloths below the D line.    Twelve months of this will leave the trade unfit to compete in export markets.    All the highvalue export markets can only be cultivated on the basis of a back-ground market at home.7. The anomalies arising are strikingly illustrated byfurnishings.   The highest utility ceiling on the same basis as theV- D was 12/2+ and over 99^ of utility furnishings were priced abovek/- per yard in 1951.    Such a situation will drive this importantsection of the industry to an almost universal debasement of quality and destroy competitive ability for exports.    Circumstancesno less serious exist in other less prominent sections of trade..8. Sir Wilfrid Eady asked how we regarded Purchase Tax at home in relation to a textile recession which is world wide.    Our reply on reflection is that production cuts which have already occurred inthe U.S.A., Japan, and elsewhere together with our own have probablycleared away the over-stocking factor.   A buying trend of some strengtmay therefore occur in the second half of the year.    The UnitedKingdom will be crippled and unable to take its share of any improvement if we are still running only a half, or two-thirds of our machinery with our production distorted.
ft). Nine months to a year passes between raw cotton and thegarment in the shop.    The spring is the season to which our industries work and plan.   A tax necessarily subject to annualBudget review means the plague of uncertainty will dominateoperators&apos; minds during the whole of the most vital period.Under such conditions safety-first will rule and in any givencircumstance only the minimum orders will be placed.10.       The future of our export trade lies in quality goods and specialities.    The D scheme encourages the manufactureof shoddy goods,and discriminates against those on which our future largely depends,11.       The idea of a tax holiday should not be contemplated under any circumstances whatsoever.   It merely prolongs the alreadydisastrous factors of uncertainty.12.       We recognise that we are open to some criticism for sayingall this now without hitherto having said as much so emphatically.Along with everybody else our thinking was unduly affected by the prolonged seller1s market.   The situation is now entirelychanged and demands a new approach.13.       We wish to emphasise that it is not the weight of taxof itself which is the main trouble but the system and theperpetual uncertainty and distortion which it causes.
