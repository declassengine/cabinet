Prime Minister from Home Secretary: Minute of 3rd April, 1952Crimes of violence can be divided into crimes of violence against the person and crimes of violence against property. Violence against the person includesmurder, manslaughter, wounding, rape, indecent assaults on females, and robbery.Violence against property includes burglary, housebreaking, shopbreaking andattempts to commit these offences.The following table shows the numbers of persons found guilty of crimes inthese two groups in 1938 and in each of the past six years:  Number of persons found guilty of:Crimes of violence   Crimes of violenceYear against the person  against property1938 ...      ............ 2,718 10,8531946 ................. 3,683 20,9691947 ............... 4,242 20,3801948 ................ 5,318 23,5801949 ............... 5,595 19,5021950............      ... 6,330 20,4801951 ................ 6,653 21,544So far as I can judge from the Press and from Questions in Parliament, thegreatest interest is in offences under Section 23 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, that is,robbery with violence, armed robbery and robbery in company with others. until september 1948, courts could impose a sentence of corporal punishment for theseoffences, and these were the only offences of violence against the person for whichcourts could impose corporal punishment on persons aged 17 or over. (Courts had power to impose corporal punishment on juveniles for a wider range of offences.)The following table shows the numbers of persons (1) aged 17 and over and(2) under 17 found guilty of offences under Section 23 (1) of the Larceny Act, 19.16,in the past six years:  Number of persons  Number of personsYear                                     aged 17 and over under 171946 ...      ............ 264 581947 ......      ......... 287 481948............... 359 891949 ............      ... 321 931950 ............... 330 1591951 ............... 199 157
