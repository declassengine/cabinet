CABINET office record COPYDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 129 COPY NO.    1 119TH APRIL, 1952CABINETFARM prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Minister of food we are glad to bt able to inform our colleagues that, with the exceptionof the point dealt with below, agreement has been reached with the leadersof the National Farmers&apos; Unions of England and Wales, Scotland and NorthernIreland on a schedule of subsidies and prices on the basis of which they have promised to put the whole weight of their organisations behind a drive forincreased production, particularly of meat, and improved efficiency.   TheMinister of Agriculture proposes to announce the general terms of the settle-ment in the House on Thursday next, 24th April, and to release the details to thePress immediately thereafter.2. The closest consultation has been maintained throughout the wholecourse of these prolonged and very difficult negotiations with the Lord president and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3,       As so often happens in negotiations of this character, the outstandingpoint is one in which the psychological, sentimental and political aspectfar outweighs its intrinsic value either to one side or the other.   It is thequestion of the price to be paid by the producer of sugar beet for the pulpwhich he buys back from the factory.   This sugar beet pulp is a valuablecattle food and is used in particular in the beet growing areas (mainly theeastern counties) for winter feeding of cattle.   For many years it was thepractice of the beet sugar factories to sell this pulp back to the farmers whosupplied the beet at a price very substantially lower than the prices of otherfeedingstuffs of comparable feeding value.   It was regarded by the beet-producingfarmers as a sort of perquisite.   Over the past few years, however, prices(like those of other feedingstuffs) have been raised from  6.12s.6d. per ton in1945/6 to  17.12s.6d. per ton in 1951/2.   The minister*r of Food in agreementwith the Lord President and the Minister of Agriculture decided in October,1951, to confirm the decision of the previous Government to allow a further increase to  19.15s. Od. per ton for 1952/3. \4.       During the course of the current negotiations on prices generallyMinisters agreed, as a very substantial contribution towards a settlement,to maintain prices of ordinary feeding-stuffs at their current levels until atleast 31st March, 1953.   It was not intended that this decision should apply tothe price of sugar beet pulp, which is normally treated separately.   The national farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales, however, have attached such importanceto this sugar beet pulp price   question that they have throughout made it acondition of a final settlement and it has now become the one outstandingquestion.
1^)5.       The Minister of Agriculture feels that this would be a small additionalprice to pay for a settlement to which there would then be no reservations.He wishes to impress on his colleagues the enormous importance of enlistingthe full and unreserved support of the farmers1 organisations in tne drivefor increased production and improved efficiency which should now be launched.He recommends strongly therefore that the decision to maintain the current level of feedingstuffs prices should apply to the price of sugar beet pulp,6.       The Minister of Food is unable to accept the farmers&apos; demand.   Thereis no difference between him and the Minister of Agriculture that on meritsthe increase is justified;  nor is there any dispute over the sum.   The settle&quot;ment with the farmers will involve appreciable further increases in retail prices over and above those contemplated in the Budget.   If the demands putin by agricultural workers for higher wages are accepted, we shaU have tofind a good deal more money still.   Against the total sum involved in thesettlement,  600,000 is neither here nor there.7,       Cn the other nand, the contract invitations to farmers sent out by the british sugar Corporation under the authority of the last Government in the autumn con-tained a specific warning of this increase in the price of pulp.   As stated above,we confirmed the increase when the Minister of Agriculture received represen-tations from a number of East Anglian Members of Parliament,   This decision was given to the House in answer to Parliamentary Questions by the Minister ofFood and his Parliamentary Secretary in November and December,   Theproposed increase is therefore public knowledge,8.       If the farmers&apos; demands were accepted, therefore, the Governmentwould have to announce publicly that they had reversed a considereddecision and were deliberately transferring a substantial sum of public money to a group of farmers, mainly large, who are widely known to be well-off,   The Minister of Food would have the greatest difficulty in defendingthis course to Parliament and to the country.   He is far from convinced thatthe farmers would break with the Government on the point.   Indeed, he believes their demand to be so ill-founded that he doubts whether theywould dare to bring it to public notice.9.       We have agreed, in the absence of the Lord President, whom we havenot so far been able to consult, and in view of the imperative needfor making a final settlement on Thursday next on the outcome of the wholeReview, to submit the question for decision by our colleagues.T.L.D.G.
