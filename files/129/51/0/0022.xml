c R E T CABINET OFFICfcc.(52) 122 RECORD COPY ,    copy no. ?I8th april, 1952cabinetANGLO-EGYPTIAN negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs&quot;With reference to my memorandum C. (52) 98 Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo has now reported that he has agreed the following text ona personal basis and ad referendum with the Egyptian Foreign Minister:-&quot;(i)   Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the RoyalEgyptian Government have decided to enter into negotiations in order to settle the differences between the two countries on the basis of the withdrawal ofBritish Forces and the substitution of alternative arrangements for the defenceof Egypt to those at present subsisting.(ii)     The two Governments will enter into conversations for the purpose ofworking out the ways and means of this withdrawal and of discussing theirrespective points of view in regard to the defence of the Canal Zone and thearming of Egyptian Forces in order that Egypt may fulfil her determinedintention to defend this area.(iii)     The two Governments agree to discuss the question of the Sudan on thefollowing basis:-The Egyptian Government having declared that His Majesty king farouk holds the title of King of Egypt and the Sudan, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment re-affirm that they will accept the unity of Egypt and theSudan under the Egyptian Crown or any other status for the Sudanresulting from the exercise of the right of the Sudanese people freelyto decide their future status, which right is recognised and acceptedby both Governments. &quot;2. The first paragraph  is identical with that which has already been agreed by the Cabinet.   The second paragraph is rather longer than the text already accepted, but the new text seems on the whole to be acceptable.  Although it makes no reference to the defence of the Middle East, it takes account of our needs,since the phrase &quot;discussing their respective points of view in regard to thedefence of the Canal Zone&quot; etc. , provides an opening for developing further our views on the Egyptian contribution to the defence of the Middle East as a whole,e.g. the base on Egyptian soil, and the joint air defence organisation.3. The third paragraph, on the Sudan, is an improvement upon any othertext that the Egyptians have been prepared to accept up to now, and indeed on the text approved by the Cabinet.   The phrase &quot;or any other status for the Sudanresulting from the exercise of the right of the Sudanese people freely to decidetheir future status&quot; makes the formula a comprehensive one which would not exclude any possible decision of the Sudanese people on the future status oftheir country.
(- \ I recommend that this text be approved without change.   Our purposeat this stage is merely to secure a form of words which does not commit usto anything unacceptable or exclude discussion of something essential.   TheEgyptian Prime minister has undertaken that this text shall be published only at a later stage and by mutual agreement with us.   A decision on this textmust be taken as a matter of urgency, because the Egyptian Prime Ministermust know by 9th April, if he is to be in a position to postpone the elections in Egypt.   It is important that the Egyptian elections should be postponed if weare to resume negotiations, and the Egyptian Prime minister has promised to postpone them, probably until the autumn, if a basis for negotiations can beagreed.5. I therefore request that the Cabinet authorise me to agree to this textsubject to an undertaking by the Egyptian Prime Minister to postpone the elections.A.E.FOREIGN OFFICE, S. W.l. ,8TH APRIL, 1952,
