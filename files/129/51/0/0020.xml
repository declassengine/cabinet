SUPPLIES OP STEEL WINDOW SECTIONS TO THECOPCO COMPANY DETROITMemorandum by -the President of theBoard of Trade and the Chancellorof the Duchy, of &quot;LancasterIn the last two days Mr, W.L, Batt who has just returned from the United States has made urgent representations to usabout a case in which a United States manufacturer of windowframes, the Copco Steel and Engineering Company of Detroit,are pressing for delivery of window sections from a UnitedKingdom firm of suppliers named Darlington and Simpson Limited.A note setting out the history of this case is attached,2.     The basic position is that about 2 years ago Copooordered 14,000 tons of sections from the United Kingdom firm.Out of this total Darlington and Simpson delivered thequantity of 14*000 tons which was all that they had guaranteedto do;    they informed Copco that deliveries would have to be suspended until additional steel supplies were available andthey have maintained that position.    The basis of the Copcocomplaint is that Darlington and Simpson have neverthelesscontinued to deliver steel sections to United Kingdomproducers of window frames who have used the steel to manufacture frames both for home and export, including exportsto the American market in competition with Copco.3*     Mr. Batt has made it clear that on merits he is still ofthe opinion that there is no reason to justify intervention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government,    But he has warned us thatCopco are in a position to make difficulties for us in theUnited States,   They have managed to organise a lobby throughthe offices of a former member of the White House entourage(Mr. Clifford Clark), and the two Republican Senators forMichigan have told Mr, Batt that they will raise the matter to our detriment in Congress in comiection with the provisionof aid to us under the Mutual Security Act,   He therefore thought it his duty to warn us of this so that we couldconsider whether some concession could be made in order to allay trouble,ho     We have considered what ought to be done in the lightof Mr, Batt&apos;s warning.   We are satisfied that there is little or no merit in the Copco case.    Indeed it is of the first importance to note that it is essentially on all fours witha great many other cases in which contracts for steeldeliveries between United Kingdom suppliers and United Statesmanufacturers are being frustrated (often by a directrefusal of an export licence) because of the steel shortage,although in most cases the United States importer has accepted the situation without protest or attempts at pressure.confidnetial cabinet office record COPY0.(52) 1208TH APRIL, 1952COPY NO.gabine&apos;
3oBut this state of affairs obviously could not continueif a concession were made to Copco*   Moreover there is thecrucially important understanding with the United Statesoil companies whereby we have agreed to supply their steelrequirements in order to assist them to meet our needs.We have had to abate our deliveries to them in the presentstringency and any concession now to Copco would appeargrossly at variance with the action which we have been obliged to take and which for their part they have accepted with good grace*5.     Essentially therefore, the question here is one ofpolitical judgment.    If we refuse to intervene, is theOopco pressure group likely to exercise such an influence in Congress as positively to endanger our aid for1952/53?    (We are clear that - quite apart from the changein the situation caused by the apprehended steel strike -our steel agreement could not be brought into jeopardy.)6.     Our view is that although the pressure group and thetwo Senators may cause us some awkward moments theirintervention cannot in the last analysis be decisive on theissue of our dollar aid.   This will be determined by whetherthe United States Congress and people consider us to bea dependable ally and not by such incidental questions as this.   Our judgment is therefore that the considerationsagainst making any concession to Copco are decisive andwe recommend that a suitable message in this sense shouldbe communicated to Mr. Batt.P.T.SWT NTONCabinet Office, S.W.1.8TH APRIL, 1952.
annex note by the Board of Trade on supplies of,steel window sections to the Copco Company.Copco Steel and Engineering Company of Detroit aremanufacturers of steel products, and in particular of steelwindow frames.    In February 1950 they placed orders withDarlington and Simpson for some 5,300 tons of windowsections (the order specified 6,000 short tons) and later in the year for a further 9*000 tons.    Copco also placedorders for other types of steel with other United Kingdommills.and with the British Iron and Steel Corporation.2.      In March 1951 Mr. Herman of Copco visited the UnitedKingdom to try to expedite deliveries of his outstandingorders.    Darlington had by then delivered over h-,000 tonsof the total llj.,300.    He appealed, for help to Sir Cecil Weirand Economic Cooperation Administration (E.C.A. ) Londonwho pressed the case very strongly on the grounds that orders had been placed before Korea and that this was genuineand continuing business:  and that Copco had turned to theUnited Kingdom for supplies as the result of selling effortsby the United Kingdom steel industry supported by government representatives in the United States (Mr. Storey, the consul-General in Detroit).    They asked that at least the500 tons of sections which Copco were urgently requiringshould be delivered.   As a result of correspondence betweenthe Board of Trade and the British Iron and Steel Federation(B.I.S.F.), Sir Cecil Weir was authorised to tell Copcothat arrangements were being made to enable Darlington to deliver this 500 tons, the arrangement being an additionalallocation of billets to the mill.    Soon afterwards it transpired that 3.I.S.F.  had allocated only 295 tons of rawmaterial to Darlington for export production for the period and that Darlington had decided not to use any of this for &apos;Copco orders.    Sir.Cecil Weir then approached the thenPresident of the Board of Trade as he felt that this was a breach of faith in which he and the Government&apos; were involved.3.      The then President agreed with this view and decided tosee Lord Braintree, the head of Darlington and Simpsons.It was agreed that on condition that an additional allocation of billets were given to Darlington and Simpsons they wouldsupply the 500 tons of sections to Copco.    The Presidentdecided that the Government was under no obligation to&quot;facilitate&quot; the supplies of any further quantity.1+.      Mr. Herman came over again and himself saw thePresident on the 31st July.    The President pointed out thatthe. supply position had deteriorated still further sincethe the 500 tons were delivered and that in the circumstances he could take no further action:    he promised to look intovarious points raised by Mr. Herman but subsequently wrote -to him and to Mr. Batt confirming that nothing more could bedone.    (Mr. Batt by the way is understood to deny that heever said, as Mr. Herman asserts, that &quot;this was a commercialdouble-cross&quot;.)
m5 0*-5.     Mr-. Herman On his return to the United States inAugust took the matter up with his Senator who approached -E.C.A.  in Washington who in turn raised the matter with theCommercial Department of the Embassy and also wrote to thePrime Minister&apos;s Adviser on Public Relations (Mr. Bacon)with whom he was personally acquainted.    Since thencorrespondence by cable and. letter has continued netween theBoard and Gopco, on the latter&apos;s protests repeated toSir H.  Shawcross and renewed at length to Mr. Thorneycroftas soon as he took office.    In October also Mr. Hermanvisited Washington and saw Mr. Steel, Mr. Rickett andMr. Empson.    An official reply was sent to these last letters to the President:    a copy of it is attached toSir Oliver Pranks&apos; letter.   Mr. Herman replied in effectthat he did not accept the Board&apos;s statement of fact andaccused Her - Majesty&apos;s Government of deliberate bad faith.In another official letter he was told on 20th December thatthe Board saw no useful point in continuing the correspondence.6.      This is not a simple case of a United Kingdom supplierfalling down on deliveries to a United States customer owingto a reduction in the export allocation.    The complicatingfactors are (l) that only one mill rolls the type of section and supplies all the United Kingdom manufacturers of windowframes;  (2) that these United Kingdom manufacturers are indirect competition with the United States customer;  (3) that lord Braintree is Chairman of Orittalls, the chief competitor,and also Chairman of Darlington and Simpson which has beennationalised.    Oopco are convinced that they have been cutoff from supplies in order that Darlington and Simpsons(which they regard as a Government enterprise) can increase or at least maintain supplies of sections to United kingdom manufacturers of window frames, and in particular to Orittall.Mr. Herman and E.g.A.  have submitted that he should receivecuts no greater than those made on supplies to the UnitedKingdom firms and they emphasise that in fact exports bythese firms to the United States have increased.    It has been explained to him that Darlington and Simpson supply window-sections to all the United Kingdom window frame manufacturers and there is no question of favouring Crittalls:    Mr. Hermanreplies that this is untrue.    We cannot ask Darlington andSimpson to cut off supplies to Orittall in order to supplyCopco leaving other United Kingdom manufacturers untouched,nor can   we cut supplies to all our own manufacturers of thehigher.conversion exports in order to maintain exports of lower conversion value (window sections are now  l\3-&amp;5h a ton,window frames average at  160).    United Kingdom manufacturers of window frames have an established and valuable export business in the U.S.A.    Unless and until it is decided to cutdown exports of all manufactured goods below a certainconversion value, window frame manufacturers are onlyfollowing Government policy in maintaining maximum exportsto the U.S.A.7.     With the introduction in October of export licensingfor individual orders of steel for the U.S.A.  a further pointarose.    Till then we maintained, with truth,  that it was leftto the United Kingdom suppliers to decide in the light oftheir total availability which orders they should fulfil,and that our intervention at the early stages of this case toarrange for additional supplies of raw materials to be givento Darlington for the Oopco order was exceptional treatment.
It is very difficult for outsiders to grasp that althoughthe Government controlled the allocation of the raw material,and although the mills have been nationalised,&apos; it did not then control the mills&apos; choice which export orders theyshould fulfil.    Since the institution of individual licensing of exports the Government does take responsibility for the choice of export orders by issuing or withholding exportlicenses.    (In fact another firm of steel makers have askedwhether a licence would be forthcoming for 105 tons of steelagainst part of an order placed by Oopco and have been told that it would not).8.      Perhaps the most difficult point of all in the case isthe question of the terms on which Darlington and Simpsonaccepted Copco&apos;s orders.    On 27th February, 1950, i.e. givedays after the date of the first order, Darlington andSimpson in a letter reporting it to the Light Rolled steel products Conference of B.I.S.F. said &quot;While the officialorder calls for 6,000 tons, we have only given a guarantee to ship h.,000 tons.    It will be entirely dependent on thehome demand as to whether the h-,000 tons figure can be exceeded but this is clearly understood by the customer.&quot;Commenting on this letter in April 1951* the company said&quot;This position has been maintained all through our dealings with the Copco Company, and has always been accepted by them&quot;.In a letter to Copco on 7th May, 1951,  the company said&quot;You will no doubt recall that we have always made itperfectly clear that the supplies for export must be subjectto the demand for the Home Market......&quot; (it is to be notedthat the Company in fact delivered in 1950 just over h,000tons against the first order.)   Mr. Herman, however, claims that it was not until 7th May, 1951 that there was anymention to him that fulfilment of Copco&apos;s orders would besubject to - the fulfilment of the home demand, and that allthe pressure up to that time was the other way.9.      Mr. Herman cabled the President that he would take legal proceedings against Darlingtons and we gathered he hasthreatened to do so against other mills.    It is, however,  tobe noted that in spite of these threats, dating back to september last, we have not yet heard that Copco hasinitiated legal action, and Darlington and Simpson have on several occasions said that they were quite satisfied about their legal position.10.    In summary,  the argument on each side is ap follows:Gopco claim that(a) they were invited in 191+8 and 19U9 both byHis- Majesty&apos;s Government (Consulate-general in Detroit) and by the United Kingdom industry(B.I.S.F.) to place their orders in theUnited Kingdom.(b) The orders were placed with the express under-standing that the business was to be continuingand that Copco would rely in future on theUnited Kingdom for the bulk of their suppliesof window sections.    In earnest of this theypaid for the cutting by Darlington and Simpsonof the special rolls required to make theirsections.(c) They broke off negotiations for supplies from an american steel mill in view of (b); in consequence,in 1951 neither this nor any other Americansource of supply was open to them.
f3(a) The President in August 1951 promised that ifwindows were in fact being exported to theU.S.A. Gopco should get a proportionate shareof sections.(e) Lord Braintree as Chairman of Darlington andSimpson and of Crittall has been responsiblefor discrimination by the former against Copcoin favour of the latter, the object being to cut out Copco1s competition with Crittall inthe American market.-  (f) her majesty&apos;s Government have deliberatelysupported, this policy, refusing to allowexports to Copco since December 1950 (exceptfor the 500 tons).(g) It is evidence of this that in 1951 exports fromthe United Kingdom to the U.S.A. both&apos;of semi-finished iron and steel generally andof finished steel windows also increasedenormously, while His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the industry were arguing that Gopcocould not have any more sections because ofsteel shortage and the home demand forsections.(h) The dollar export drive is inconsistent withrefusing several million dollars worth ofCopco&apos;s business *pn a continuing basis.(i) All in all, the situation is clearly the resultof deliberate bad faith on the part ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedKingdom industry.Taking these arguments in order, our standpoint is that(a) we admit that Copco was encouraged officiallyin the beginning to place orders in theUnited Kingdom, and Darlington and Simpsonundoubtedly welcomed the business in the hopethat it would continue.    Rearmament and the resulting steel shortage, however, completelyaltered the situation.(b) In particular the billets required for. makingwindow sections have become so scarce thatthere is not enough to meet the requirementsof our own window-making industry, both for essential home needs and for export.(c) Prom the beginning the United Kingdom assertthat they warned Copco that, after delivery of the first h,000 tons against their firstorder, supplies to them raust come second tofulfilment of the United Kingdom industry&apos;demand; the i+,000 tons were in factdelivered by the end of 1950.(d) The President in August 1951 did not promiseCopco further supplies in any circumstances.
(e) It is economic sense in present circumstances to continue the export of manufactured steelgoods, while preventing the export of semi-manufactured steel goods.    (The export valueof steel windows is on an average  160 per tonas against  14.9-&amp;5u per&quot; ton for sections).(f) The increase of exports of semi-finished ironand steel to the U.S.A.  in the first three quarters of 1951 was unwelcome and embarrass-ing to His Majesty&apos;s Government to the extent that they took steps to stop it by institutingindividual export licensing.    The increase of exports on windows to U.s.a. was justifiedunder (e);    it is to be noted, however, thatthe rate for July-September 1951 was areduction on the March?-June rate (Mr. Hermanhas based his arguments on January-Julyfigures): and that there has been a very severe reduction in October and November.(g) His Majesty&apos;s Government did not preventexports to Gopco by refusing export licencesat any time before October 1951*      Thedecision not to continue exports was Darlingtonand Simpson&apos;s in view of their shortage ofbillets and the consideration at (c) above.(h) There is no question of any improper motiveon the part either of Her Majesty&apos;s Government,Lord Braintree,  or any United Kingdom firminvolved.11.    Before leaving for the United States on the lkth March,Mr. Batt and his staff had a number of consultations with us and with Darlington and Simpson on jthis case,  as a resultof which Mr. Batt said that he was fully satisfied that no concessions ought to be made in the face of the Copcopressure.    He communicated in this sense with the M.S.A.in Washington.
