confidential .       .  ,- CABlht i  OFFICtc.(52) 146 RECORD COPY copy no.-p5th may, 1952cabinetSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS SCHEMESMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in all the fuel and power industries nationalised by the late government there have been schemes prepared for pensions for staffs, the great majority ofwhom were in various municipal or Company pension schemes beforenationalisation.   The coal and electricity schemes have been settled between the boards and the Staff Associations and Trade Unions concerned and received thenecessary statutory approval of the Minister in the time of the late Government.In the case of gas the corresponding scheme was submitted for Ministerialapproval just before the General Election.   Proposals for a new scheme toreplace the existing pensions schemes of the former main line railways and london Transport have been submitted by the British Transport Commission tothe Trade Unions but have so far not proved acceptable to the Unions.   TheCommission is awaiting Ministerial guidance on modifications which might bemade to meet the Union&apos;s objections.   In other industries, including the health service, pensions schemes for salaried staff were established soon afternationalisation.2. Meanwhile the late Government had approved a scheme for supplementary-pensions for manual workers in the coalmining industry.   And in the electricity industry where about 70% of the manual workers are in pension schemes datingfrom before nationalisation the Trade Unions are pressing for a scheme to coverall manual workers.   In gas, too, about 70% of the manual workers have pension rights dating from the old municipal and Company schemes, but the TradeUnions concerned have not so far pressed for a scheme to cover all manual workers.   In transport, agreement has been reached in confidential discussions with the Union leaders on the broad lines of a supplementary pensions schemefor wages grades, and the Commission has asked for Ministerial approval before proceeding further with negotiations.3. The late Government were reluctant to agree to an extension ofsupplementary pensions for manual workers in the nationalised industries(except coal) pending an inquiry into the whole question of supplementary pensions and the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) were informed of this.   TheT.U. C. were most hostile, refusing to agree to serve on an inquiry and I have since ascertained that they would adopt the same attitude towards a similarproposal if made by this Government.   As for the nationalised Boards, they were told that while they could continue to negotiate on claims for pensions for the wagesgrades they must understand that pending full consideration of the principlesinvolved, the Minister concerned would not be in a position to give the necessarystatutory approval to any agreed schemes that might be submitted to him.4. The proposed inquiry had not been set up by the time of the GeneralElection.   Meanwhile we have the schemes for pensions for staff in the Gas,Civil Aviation and Transport industries awaiting Ministerial approval or guidance and pressure from the Electrical Trade Union for a scheme of supplementary
pensions to cover all manual workers in that industry.   The resulting position has been discussed on the Home Affairs Committee and I am referring thismatter to Cabinet with the concurrence of the Lord President and in agreementwith the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, theMinister of National Insurance, the Minister of Fuel and Power and theMinistry of Transport, who consider that a decision on certain of these pensions schemes can no longer be delayed.5. I realise the embarrassment of refusing to deal with the proposalswhich have been discussed with the different Staff Associations and Trade unions and I agree that in so far as these are designed as part of a tidying-up process to remove anomalies without introducing new principles, they can be dealt withwithout detriment to the general situation.   I do not, however, want any stepto be taken that might result either in the extension of such schemes in thecase of manual workers or the stimulation of demands for pensions schemesfor such workers.   There might be serious repercussions throughout industry.At the same time we must be careful to avoid the impression that we havedecided as a matter of policy to agree to schemes for salaried staff but not formanual workers.I!6. Accordingly, I think it important that before schemes designed to removeanomalies are approved I should have an opportunity of consulting the T. U. C.and stressing the limited significance of any such action.   But, of course, itwould be impossible to consult the T. U. C. on this matter without some referenceto the main question of Supplementary Pensions generally.   The T.U.C. are fully aware of the attitude of the late Government and they would ask me whether we had any similar proposals.   As to that, the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, the Vlinister of National Insurance andthe Minister of Fuel and Power (the Ministry of Transport also being inagreement) feel that there would be considerable advantage in an inquiry intothe long-term social and economic aspects of the development of schemes toprovide for the aged with particular reference to schemes, both State and otherwise, for retirement and old age pensions.7. My colleagues will recall that on 4th April last (C. C. (52) 37thConclusions, Minute 4), the Cabinet considered and rejected a proposal by theMinister of National Insurance (C.(52) 95) for the launching of an inquiry intothe State&apos;s financial provision for old age.   The inquiry now proposed would beon a much wider basis and my colleagues and I have reason for thinking that we might be able to secure the co-operation of the T.U. C.8. My object in raising the matter now is to seek authority to enable me todiscuss with the T. U. C. the possibility of such a wider inquiry and in doing soto ensure that there is no misunderstanding about the limited significance ofany approval that may be given to pensions schemes that have reached an advanced stage of consideration.   In common with the other Ministers supporting thisproposal I realise that the idea of a wider inquiry would need to be worked outin detail and scrutinised carefully before the terms of reference could be approved.   I also understand that it would not be possible to go further in thediscussion with the T. U. C. than to ascertain their reactions to the idea in very general terms.   I accordingly ask the Cabinet to approve the proposal toenter upon such discussions.W.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S. W. 1. ,5TH MAY, 1952.
