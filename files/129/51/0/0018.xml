7TH APRIL, 1952CABINETRELAXATION OF CONTROLS ON TEAMemorandum by the Minister of food the Economic Policy Committee considered last week a memorandum which I circulated on this subject (E.A.(52) 39) recommending among other things -(a) Removal of the subsidy on tea as from 15th June;(b) An announcement at the same time of an increase in the ration from  oz. to      oz. to come into force in August, as a preliminary to(c) Consideration in the late autumn of the possibility of completederationing.2.       The increase in the ration, for which ample tea would be available if theTrade were permitted to buy it, would cost about  7 millions sterling this yearand  10 millions in a full year at recent prices.   Some of the necessary stockhas already been imported into this country by the growers.3.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer reserved his position because of the extra expenditure involved and I was invited to explore the matter further with theMinister of State for Economic Affairs.&apos; This I have done but I have been unable to clear the financial objection that we ought not in the present criticalbalance of payments situation to Increase overseas spending, even in sterling,to finance increased consumption.   I am therefore reporting the matter to theCabinet.i4.       If the subsidy on tea is to be taken off by the 15th June this must be announced on 9th April.   The next possible date is 10th August.   I had hoped to beable to announce the increase in the ration simultaneously to compensate for the inevitable price increase (though the Trade have undertaken to keep the increase for blends of sound quality at 4d. a lb. less than the amount of subsidy removed).5.       If I cannot announce an increase in the ration of \ oz. my colleagues should be aware of the consequences.6,       World supply has now outrun consumption which is unrestricted outsidethese Islands.   With present restrictions here we still take about 45% of teaentering world trade.   Tea prices particularly for the lower grades have been falling steeply in the last few weeks.   A serious position faces growers in India,Pakistan and Ceylon, where some  40 millions of British capital is invested intea growing.   My information is that they are already selling at under cost and unless present trends are arrested marginal producers may go out of business:the larger firms will restrict production.   The International Tea RegulationCommittee would also be likely to move in this direction.   The consequent set-back to production would be likely to postpone the prospect of decontrolling teafor a considerable period.   The Trade are thoroughly alarmed and we shall bes E c R s T CABINET&quot; OFFlCtc. (52) 118 RECORD COPY copy no. 6 ^
faced, with violent criticism if in failing to take up available Commonwealthsupplies we seriously jeopardise the future of this industry.7.       I appreciate the Chancellor&apos;s position but in the light of the foregoingI must ask my colleagues to consider very seriously whether the extrasterling expenditure which my proposals call for should not be faced.   Theoutlook on the food front generally is bleak and the stimulus to moralewhich the prospect of a better supply of tea would give would in my view bewell worth while.8,       There are also prospects of an improvement in the position of theLondon market in the re-export trade.   This and other matters affectingthe development of world trade in tea I would propose to discuss in due course with the Commonwealth Governments concerned in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.   They do not/&apos;however, directly affect the present issue.G. L. G.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1. ,7TH APRIL, 1952.
