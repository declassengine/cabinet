s document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)confidential CABINET  OFFICtc.(5z) 104 RECORD COPY copynoJU4TH APRIL, 1952cabinetTHE CIVIL LISTNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer it will be necessary, very soon after the Easter E.recess, to set upthe traditional machinery for obtaining Parliamentary approval to the civil list for the new reign.   The Bill for this purpose must receive the royal assent not later than six months from the demise of the Crown, i. e. by6th August.   Its introduction is preceded by the appointment of a SelectCommittee, on whose report the Bill itself is founded.   It has been thepractice for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be Chairman of this Committee,and the proposals which he submits to it are the proposals of the Government.2. The Prime Minister  has, therefore, asked me to circulate, forconsideration by the Cabinet, the proposals which I have submitted to him.They are set out in the memorandum below.   In making comparison betweenthe proposals for the new reign and the Civil List of the previous reign,,we should bear in mind the considerable decline in the purchasing power ofmoney since 1937.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1. ,4TH APRIL, 1952.THE CIVIL LISTI.   THE CIVIL LIST ITSELF.     In the last reign, the provision was as follows:-Class Description 1937 Civil List ActI Privy Purse  110,000II Salaries of the Household  134,000III Expenses of the Household  152,800IV Royal Bounty, Alms and   13,200Special services total         410,000Classes I and II included  40,000 for the Consort.The  410,000 has, in fact, proved insufficient in recent years, and since the war the Civil List has shown a deficit (now about  30,000 per annum),which has had to be met from the Privy Purse.   The new proposals cover this
deficit and also embody certain &quot;economies&quot; offset by other items ofadditional expenditure.   The &quot;economies&quot; consist of:-(a) On Class I, a voluntary surrender of  17,000 by the Queen, to bemet by savings on the private estates.   This is an effective economy.(b) On Class III, the transfer to the Ministry of Works Vote of the wages of the purely industrial staff - with a consequential saving to the Civil List ofabout  24,000 per annum.   (This is only a further development of the similarprocess of transfer to Votes which operated during the last reign, when theExchequer took over from the Civil List some  50,000. )The items of additional expenditure consist of:-(a) On Class II, some  17,600 per annum to cover increases in salaries of the Household which are long overdue.(b) On Classes II and III together, some  85,000 per annum as a marginfor contingencies.   The purpose of this is twofold:-(i)     It covers the possibility of further rises in wages and prices duringthe reign.   It is, therefore, an insurance against the need to approachParliament a second time, which is undesirable both on precedent and inpractice.   The contingencies margin, in so far as unused, would be allocated to a reserve fund which would be kept intact;   its disposition at the end of thereign would be left for settlement then.(ii)     It would provide the Palace with a means of easing the circumstancesof those members of the Royal Family for whom there exists no Parliamentaryprovision, without making any specific grants.   The Duchess of Kent is themost striking case.   But the Duchess of Gloucester may also be widowed;and there are, in any case, the five children of the Gloucester and KentHouses who will fairly soon reach an age when they will be expected to fulfilofficial functions and take an active part in public life.   There is no way of helping them financially, except by providing some margin in the Civil List,to be allocated at the discretion of the Privy Purse.There is no need to distinguish precisely between the two elements in the contingencies margin, and it should be described to the Select committee as a single item of  85,000 per annum.   This is a considerable sum,representing an addition of about 25% to the rest of the Civil List;  and it mayprovoke some criticism.   But given the probable length of the reign and the impossibility of forecasting the future of costs and prices, I believe theprovision to be wise.On this basis, the Civil List - for the Queen alone - would amount toabout  465,000 per annum as compared with the provision of  410,000 perannum in the previous reign for the King and the Queen.II.    THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH.    The Duke should be provided forseparately and should receive a Parliamentary annuity of  40,000 for life.This compares with:-(a)    An annuity of  30,000 for life granted to the Prince Consort in QueenVictoria&apos;s reign.-2-
(b)    The sum of  40,000 per annum included in the Civil List of king george VI for the Queen Consort.It is wise that this sum should be granted for life - there will thenbe no question of a separate and larger annuity (as in the case of a QueenConsort) if the present Queen predeceases him.   The new Civil List Actwhich would then be required could make alternative provision ton him, ifnecessary.On the basis of the above, proposals, and allowing for the transfer ofvarious items of expenditure to Departmental Votes during the previous reign,the comparison between the present proposals and the Civil List of the lateKing will show an increase from  410,000 to about  580,000.   It is, of course,assumed that the Sovereign will continue to draw, in addition to the (tax-free)Civil List, the (tax-free) revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, which averagedbetween  80,000 and  100,000 a year in the last reign;  and that any attemptto alienate these revenues from the Crown, and to require their surrender aspart and parcel of the hereditary revenues, will be resisted.III. THE DUCHY OF CORNWALL.     These revenues have averaged, in theyears since the war, about  90,000 per annum.This is the first time since 1910 that there has been a Duke of cornwall;  but the provision which Parliament made in the last two Civil ListActs for the disposition of the revenues during the minority of a hypotheticalDuke point to the following arrangement:-(a) The Duchy revenues should accrue in their entirety to the Duke onmajority, i. e. at age 21.   It is important that this link between the Duchy andthe Heir Apparent should be maintained intact.(b) During the Duke&apos;s minority, a fixed sum, perhaps  30,000 a year,should be made available from the revenues for his maintenance and education,and for the accumulation of a reasonable capital sum for him on attainingmajority.   The balance of the revenues, about  60,000 per annum, should bemade available to the Exchequer in relief of the Civil List liability.(c) The Duke should provide in the future for his wife from the revenues of the Duchy, which he will draw in full on attaining majority.   But the Civil ListAct should provide a Parliamentary annuity of, say,  30,000 a year for hiswidow.IV. THE DAUGHTERS AND YOUNGER SONS OF THE SOVEREIGN. We should follow precedent by providing:-(a) For younger sons -  10,000 per annum, increased to  25,000 perannum on marriage.(b) For daughters -  6,000 per annum, increased to  15,000 per annumon marriage.The increase in the allowance for daughters on marriage (which would apply also to Princess Margaret) is an innovation;  but I think it is justified by the fact that, at present levels of taxation, it is almost impossible for thedaughter of the Sovereign to marry a husband who is capable of supporting heron the necessary scale from his private fortune.27th March, 1952
