confidential.(52) 147 CABINET OFFICE copy no.&quot; RECORD COPY3RD may, 1952cabinetZONE A OF THE FREE TERRITORY OF TRIESTEMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues will recall that on the 25th March I told them about therecent disorders in Trieste and that I was invited to explore the possibilityof securing the agreement of the United States and French Governments tothe termination of the Allied occupation of Zone A of the Free Territory(C.C.(52) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5).   I am actively pursuing this line asregards the long-term solution of the Trieste problem.2. Meanwhile, as my colleagues are aware, Mr. Acheson and I agreed,in deference to strong representations by the Italian Government, that representatives of our two Governments would hold talks with the Italiansabout a possible modification of administrative arrangements in Zone A.I considered that in view of the predominantly Italian character of the Zonethere was scope for greater Italian participation in its administration providedthat it entailed no prejudice to the legal position of the United Kingdom and united States Governments deriving from the Italian Peace Treaty or to theauthority of the Zone Commander, Major-General Sir John Winterton.3. These talks started on 3rd April.   After a long and difficult negotiationthe three delegations have now referred to their Governments the understandingsreached between them.   These understandings are embodied in a memorandum,which it is proposed should be made public (Annex &apos;A&apos;).   A joint communique(Annex &apos;B&apos;) would be issued at the same time.   I do not expect that either ofthese documents will be substantially modified as the result of reference tothe United States and Italian Governments and to the Zone Commander (whohas been continuously consulted and has been asked for his comments on points of detail).4. From the point of view of presentation in this country the memorandum is not altogether satisfactory.   The United Kingdom and United Statesdelegations have been obliged to bear constantly in mind the desirabilityof producing an agreement which would not weaken the position of theItalian Government.   It has therefore been necessary to dress up thememorndum in order to make it presentable to Italian public opinion and to listin it in detail the functions to be administered by Italian officials of allied military Government in its new form, whereas those functions (including thecontrol of the police) reserved for direct operation by the Zone Commanderare not mentioned.   Three other factors have, however, also been taken intoaccount, namely, the position of the Zone Commander, the reaction of any agreement reached in London on the Yugoslav Government, and the risk thattoo radical changes would prejudice the prospects of a solution for the free territory as a whole.5. I am confident that the memorandum represents the best possibleattempt to reconcile these factors, and in particular that it safeguardsadequately both the ability of the United Kingdom and United States Governments
to exercise their international responsibilities and the powers and authorityof the Zone Commander.   I am therefore authorising the United kingdom delegate to initial the Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of her majesty&apos;s Government.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,3RD MAY, 1952.ANNEX ADRAFT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEGOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, UNITED STATESAND ITALY REGARDING ADMINIS1 RATION IN ZONE of THE FREE TERRITORY OF TRIESTE1. In accordance with the decision announced on the 27th March, 1952,representatives of the Governments of Italy, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates have examined in detail the present structure and operation of theMilitary Government in Zone A with a view to arriving at arrangements fora closer collaboration among themselves and with the local authorities inthe administration of the Zone.   The three Governments have approved thefollowing conclusions and understandings reached by their representatives.2. The three Governments have started from the premises, which they all share, that such arrangements should be of a nature so as not to prejudice the ultimate solution of the future of the Territory as a whole /x and so as tocontinue to ensure to all inhabitants of the Zone the enjoyment of human rightsand fundamental freedoms without distinction as to race, sex, language orreligion/.3. The three Governments recognise that, since the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and the United States retain the responsibilities with regardto the administration of Zone A devolving on them under the Treaty of Peacewith Italy, particularly Annex VII thereof, the Commander of the UnitedKingdom and United States troops retains all powers of government in the zone.4. Taking the foregoing into account, and with a view to arranging fora simplification of the structure of the government of the Zone, the three governments have reached the following understandings.5. A Senior Director of Administration,proposed by the ItalianGovernment, shall be appointed by and shall be responsible to the ZoneCommander.   Under the latter&apos;s direction, he will administer by means oftwo directorates the functions of civil government indicated in the followingNOTE:     x     Subject to Italian Delegation finding a satisfactory formulain final communique concerning Zone B.
1 osub-paragraphs.   He will have under his administration:-(a) a Directorate of Interior consisting of the following branches:   -Department of Labour, Department of Social Assistance, PublicHealth Office, Education Office, Census and Survey Office,Housing Department, Local Government (Zone President),Fire Service.(b) a Directorate of Finance and Economics consisting of the followingbranches:   Department of Commerce, Department of Production,Department of Finance (including Customs and Finance Guards),Department of Transportation, Department of Public Works andUtilities (with the exception of construction and housing for theUnited Kingdom and United States troops), Office of Agricultureand Fisheries, Loans Section..;. Italians in a number adequate to ensure efficient administration ofthe Departments and offices mentioned in paragraph 5 above shall in the same manner be proposed by the Italian Government and appointed by the ZoneCommander to staff those Departments and offices.   They shall be responsible to the Zone Commander through the Senior Director of Administration.Such Italians shall be removable by the Zone Commander, who shall ask theItalian Government to propose their successors.   The Italian Governmentretain the right to recall persons proposed by it, on due notification to the zone Commander.   To the maximum practicable extent employees who havebeen recruited locally and who are now exercising civil functions in theMilitary Government will be retained;   any dismissal shall be effected only with the approval of the Zone Commander.7. While it is intended initially to retain the present organisation of thedirectorates administered by the Senior Director of Administration,he may recommend modifications thereof to the Zone Commander and effecithem with the latter&apos;s approval.8. An Italian Political Adviser to the Zone Commander will beappointed by the Italian Government.   His status and functions will be similar to those of the United Kingdom and United States Political Advisers.9. The three Governments have noted the intimate connections thatexist between the economy of the Zone and the Italian economy as a whole andthe essential contribution that is made to the well-being of the Zone by theItalian Government.   The three Governments therefore reaffirm that allthe existing Economic and Financial Agreements between them concerningZone A, and the understandings reached pursuant thereto, remain in fullforce and effect.   Security controls over international trade shall continueto be administered by the United Kingdom and United States officers appointedby and responsible to the Zone Commander.10. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States willinstruct the Zone Commander concerning the application of the presentunderstandings and the necessary readjustments to be made in the present organisation of the Military Government, in order to carry out the provisionsof this Memorandum of Understanding as soon as possible.D ^ -
DRAFT COMMUNIQUERepresentatives of the Governments of Italy, the United Kingdomand the United States have today concluded the conversations begun on 3rd April, 1952, with a view to arranging for a closer co-operation inZone A of the Free Territory of Trieste between the three Governments andwith the local authorities.   These arrangements are incorporated in aMemorandum of Understanding which is being published today.2. The conversations have necessarily involved a complete and detailed examination of all aspects of the existing structure of governmentin the Zone and of the implications of changes therein.   The Understandingis designed to give greater recognition to the predominantly Italiancharacter of the Zone without prejudice to a final solution of the problemof the future of the Territory as a whole.3. The three Governments are confident that the spirit of friendlyunderstanding which has been present throughout the conversations willalso be present in the operation of the arrangements contained in theMemorandum.4. This confidence is enhanced by the realisation that these conversations,while limited to the question of administration in Zone A, have emphasised that the three Governments, inspired by the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations, are determined to promote and encourage peaceful co-operative solutions of international problems and the respect everywherefor human rights and fundamental freedoms.
