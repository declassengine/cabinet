29TH APRIL, 1952CABINETLICENSING OF ROAD PASSENGER VEHICLESNote by the Lord President of the CouncilOn 10th April the Cabinet (C.C. (52) 41st Conclusions, Minute 3(4))invited the Committee on Road and Rail Transport to consider the possibilityof modifying the operation of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, more speedilythan would be possible&quot; under the procedure suggested in C. (52) 121.    We have carefully considered this request but we remain convinced that the licensing system which was set up under the Act of 1930 after a Royal Commission shouldbe altered only after a full and impartial investigation.   Such an enquiry is nowdue.   Conditions have changed significantly since the Act of 1930 was passed.The railways have been nationalised, the British Transport Commission hasitself acquired large interests in road passenger transport and the difference in level between road and rail fares has increased.   These changes have affected the balance between road and rail resulting from the licensing system,and a new balance can be attempted only on the basis of full information and careful consideration.2. In our view such an enquiry could best be made by a DepartmentalCommittee of independent persons appointed by the Minister of Transport.Its terms of reference might be as follows:-&quot;To enquire into the operation of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act,1930, relating to the licensing of public road passenger services,with particular reference to the adequacy and convenience of services to the public and the regulation of competition between providers oftransport, whether by road or rail, and to make recommendations. &quot;As for the composition of the Committee, we would suggest:-Chairman:   A barrister with a knowledge of transport matters.Members:    A person with experience of railway management.A person of some standing with experience of local government.A person with an academic interest in transport or alternativelyan economist.A person with experience of work as a member of a road vehicleslicensing authority,A representative of Scotland.A representative of the Trades Unions.3. I ask my colleagues to approve the appointment of a DepartmentalCommittee on these lines and to authorise the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and Power, in consultation with the Ministry of Transport, to invite suitable persons to serve on the Committee.W.Privy Council Office, S.W.1. ,29TH APRIL, .T95.v.nO    CONFIDENTIAL CABINET OFriUt.RFOORD COPY //C.(52) 136 RtUUMU  ^ COPY NO. 6/
