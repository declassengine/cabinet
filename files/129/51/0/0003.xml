-g^THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HER  ERITAfttMC   MA.IESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTTHE PRESENT POSITION IN THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHINGINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Permanent Secretary, treasury. The attached report, prepared by a Working Party of officials, provides an appreciation of current trends and prospects for the textile industries. The main points are summarised below:  (a) The industries over which there is at present cause for concern are: Cotton,Wool, Linen, Rayon and Silk, Hosiery and Clothing.(b) In all of them there was in February a big rise in unemployment (to a level of about 5 per cent.) as compared with a year ago, particularly among women. In addition, there is substantial short time beingworked. There was some improvement in Clothing between january and February, but this is probably not continuing. Provisional figuresfor March suggest a further substantial rise in unemployment in Cotton.(c) There is a world-wide recession in textiles. This is partly a reaction againstthe abnormal buying after the start of the Korean War, combined withthe ending of the post-war restocking movement, and more recently theresult of holding off the market waiting for price falls. import restrictions abroad, especially in France and Australia, have intensifiedthe difficulties. At home, uncertainty over raw material prices, overlikely Government action and over the trade&apos;s own price policy, have led consumers to defer purchases and business men to reduce theircommitments to a minimum.(d) The balance of probability favours a mild recovery in textile buying bythe autumn or winter, but, short of another war scare, there is no evidence that demand will return to the peak levels of late 1950 and early 1951. Large stocks throughout the distribution system have tobe worked off, before home demand can revive. Wool is likely to recover sooner than other sections, and there are slight signs of thisalready.There is not likely to be much increase in the general level of demand for labour over the rest of the year. There is some scope forabsorbing redundant workers in other industries, but the prospects of so absorbing within the next few months cotton, woollen and clothingworkers unemployed in Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding andSouth Scotland cannot be considered good. The position in those townswhich depend heavily on those industries is definitely bad and evenworse in Northern Ireland.(e) The main possible short-term courses of action are a modification (if only temporary) of purchase tax, and an acceleration of defence orderspreviously proposed for 1953-54 and 1954-55. There are separatepapers on both topics. Some acceleration of public purchases by civil departments and Public Bodies may be possible.(/) Additional dollar purchases of raw cotton to help United Kingdom industryto be competitive in price have previously been rejected in view of the dollar shortage. The possible advantages are now less than they were,and our dollar position is graver. It is being re-examined, but a decisioncannot be reached until all the facts are known. In any event a decisionon this could not be made effective for some two months when the newbuying season begins.(g) Other fields of action are the possibility of dispensing with future importsof Japanese grey cloth, continued efforts to secure relaxation of overseasimport restrictions, reconsideration of existing restrictions on Govern-ment ordering in one part of Lancashire, and longer-term measures todiversify industry in the textile areas.2. After consultation with officials of the interested Departments! submit the following observations on the situation.3. The main issue for decision is whether it is in the best interests of the economy as a whole or indeed of the textile industries themselves to try to givea special stimulus to home demand for textile at this juncture.42090 b
4. There is no evidence that the difficulties in the textile and clothing industries are due to any general insufficiency of purchasing power at home. Indeed, further restrictions on consumer spending were expressly avoided in the Budget in viewof the threatened decline in overseas demand for consumer goods.5. The demand for clothing and textiles both here and throughout the restof the world has been depressed by a number of temporary factors: in particularreaction from the spate of buying which followed the outbreak of war in korea and uncertainty about future prices. The latter is probably the dominant factornow holding demand in check.6. There is uncertainty about how far raw materials prices will fall, aboutthe Government^ intentions on purchase tax and about the extent to whichproducers and traders can be forced to cut their losses on old stock bought at high prices. These uncertainties are leading the public to defer purchases and leadingbusiness men at all stages in the chain of production and distribution to reduce their commitments to the minimum.7. Raw material prices have fallen a great deal and cannot continue to fallindefinitely. Old stocks of materials and finished goods are gradually being workedoff. Consequently the influence of the temporary factors will diminish and somerevival of demand is to be expected.8. But there are more permanent factors. It is probable that the world demand for textiles will be lower for some time than in the highest post-war years,since war-time depletions have been made good. This implies that home marketdemand will not recover fully when the temporary factors have ceased to operate.In the case of exports the natural contraction is being made worse by import restrictions in sterling and some other markets. It will not be possible, therefore,to restore the level of export sales without winning away trade from our com-competitors in, non-sterling markets just at a time when Japan and Germany arechallenging us strongly.. 9, In these circumstances there can be no assurance that, even when thetemporary factors at present depressing demand have ceased to operate, the textileand clothing industries will be able to secure sufficient business to employ a labour force of the size that has been built up in recent years. If they cannot, the needs ofthe nation require that there should be a transfer of labour from them to industries which can increase their exports or which are faced with growing commitments for defence and other vital purposes.10. In short, behind.the temporary influences now at work there is an under-lying need for structural adjustment if the nation is to reorganise and build up itsexporting power. Measures to innate home demand for textiles, which mightstimulate demand to a level higher than can be sustained and so aggravate thedifficulties later on, would impede this process. They would reduce the incentivefor textile manufacturers to fight, for the largest possible share of non-sterlingexport business, to readjust their cost structure and to accept the cuts in profit margins needed if they are to succeed in this struggle. They would check theredeployment of workers to other occupations. More generally,, they would weaken the belief, both abroad and in British industry as a whole, in the Governmenfsdetermination to make exports the first call on the nation&apos;s resources. Further-more, we have succeeded in maintaining our present precarious balance of payments position by a series of once for all expedients such as rundown of stocks, reserves and capital investment. If we are not to be faced with growing and continuingdifficulties on this front, we can afford no delay in bringing about the necessarystructural changes in the economy.11. These considerations suggest very strongly that no action to provide ageneral stimulus to home demand should be taken. They would not preclude,however, limited measures to relieve transitional hardship in the worst hit areas where there is good reason to think that the available labour would otherwise remainidle on a substantial scale. For this purpose carefully selected Orders on publicaccount would provide the most effective assistance arid yield the best return inemployment for the money involved, since every pound spent will go direct to the textile industry in localities where the help is most needed. An abatement of purchase tax on the other hand would give no guarantee that an equivalent sumwould be spent on textiles, and in any event part of the sums so spent would be absorbed in distributors&apos; margins. The selection of specific requirements for publicpurchase would need prior technical examination.E. E. BRIDGES
THE PRESENT POSITION IN THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING, INDUSTRIESReport of a Working PartyIntroduction1. This Report has been prepared by the Treasury with the Economic Section,Cabinet Office, the Ministries of Labour, Materials and Supply, the Board of Tradeand the Government of Northern Ireland. The purpose of this paper is to provide an appraisal of the facts of the situation, the prospects for trade and labour andto discuss possible lines of action, if any, to be taken at this stage, except inconnection with purchase tax, on which a separate report has been made.2. The Industries, over which at the present time there is cause for concern,are the following: Cotton, Wool, Linen, Rayon and Silk, Hosiery and Clothing.The particular aspect on which attention has been focused, both in Parliament andin the Press, has been the recent steep rise in unemployment in these industries.The Extent and Distribution of the Unemployment3. The following table shows the increase in unemployment that has occurred in these industries in Great Britain during the last twelve months, the February 1952figures representing a level of about 5 per cent, unemployed for the industry (16 percent, in Northern Ireland):  		February 1951			February 1952		Males    Females		Total	Males	Females	TotalCotton...      ...	.552	681	1,233	6,446	16,424	22,870Wool   ......	502	486	988	4,467	8,017	12,484Rayon and Silk	224	210	434	1,220	3,029	4,249Hosiery	114	394	508	842	4,569	5,411Clothing	1,225	3,042	4,267	4,331	&apos;   15,228	19,659In the industries which are important in Northern Ireland the change has been						as follows: -4?

In all these industries the increase in unemployment has been much greateramong women than among men, both absolutely and relatively. The increase inthe numbers temporarily stopped has also been much greater than in the numberswholly unemployed. In addition to recorded unemployment, these industries arealso suffering from short-time working to a greater extent than others. In the weekending 26th January, out of a total of 216,000 workers reported as on short timein the manufacturing industries in Great Britain, 144,000 were in textiles and clothing. There was a fall of nearly 8,000 in unemployment in clothing between january and, February, but the indications are that this fall may since have been checked and that unemployment in cotton has continued to rise. An industrialanalysis of unemployment in March is not yet available, but the provisional figures show that total unemployment in the North-Western Region at 17th March was nearly 40,000 more than a month before, an increase rather greater than for GreatBritain as a whole.5. Unemploymentt in cotton and wool is concentrated in Lancashire andthe West Riding of Yorkshire respectively. The chief effects of the recession in:hosiery have been felt in the North Midlands Region, particularly Nottinghamand Leicester. Leek and Macclesfield are the principal towns suffering fromunemployment in silk, while in rayon it has affected or is likely to affect Braintree,Flint, Coventry and some of the Lancashire cotton towns. The clothing industryis widely distributed and every Region has been affected by the recession to someextent, though the biggest concentrations are in London and Leeds. Clothing affectsalso the development areas.6. In Northern Ireland unemployment in the clothing industry is centred on&apos;Belfast and Derry.  Unemployment in textiles is spread more widely through the.   42090 b 2   &apos;
province. Returns for March 1952 show a further deterioration in the combinedfigures for these industries, the total of unemployment having risen from 17,842in February to 20,815 (or 19 per cent.) in March. Within this total a seasonal fallin unemployment among clothing workers has been more than offset by a further increase among textile workers, notably in the linen trade.Causes and Prospects7. The main cause of the present recession was the same in this country asin practically every industrialised country throughout the world. By the summer of 1950 the great shortage of textiles resulting from the war was over and consumersand traders everywhere had replenished their stocks, and demand showed signsof falling Off. The outbreak of war in Korea led traders and the public to buywildly in anticipation of war-time shortages. This swollen demand, combined with large purchases of wool (for military and civil purposes) by the United States, withan exceptionally poor United States cotton crop in the summer of 1950, and withthe expectation of a severe shortage of sulphur for rayon production, drove up theprices of textiles, and the more they rose the more people tried to buy before theyrose still higher. Production of all kinds of textiles reached higher levels thanat any time since the war, and the expected shortages of raw materials did notin fact restrict production to any noticeable extent. Nevertheless, order bookslengthened, and in many branches of the textile industry extended to 9 months ora year.Wool8. In March 1951 the American Government stopped buying raw wool. Thisled to an immediate and sharp fall in the price, which has continued to decline(with fluctuations) ever since. At the same time panic buying by the public rapidlydeclined, and as soon as, prices began to fall consumers and distributors alike heldback in the expectation of still lower prices. The wool industry in this country,nevertheless, continued active until October or November while orders were beingworked off, though activity in the top-making section, which is the first to feel the effect of any change in conditions, began to decline in the summer. But from april onwards new orders for cloth were becoming scarce and distributors were finding difficulty in selling their considerable high-priced stocks. Since Novemberactivity has remained more Or less stationary at a relatively low level.Cotton9. In the case of cotton, it was the announcement of the size of the American195.1 crop in July which started off a fall in raw cotton prices. This, and thesaturation of the market which had already shown itself in wool goods, led quicklyto a virtual cessation of buying by clothiers and distributors, both at home andabroad. Home sales to the public fell rapidly in the early autumn and, exceptfor the usual seasonal revival at Christmas, have remained relatively low ever since.Stocks have been building up gradually since 1950. The large industrial demandfor cotton yarn and cloth was affected later and to a smaller extent, but tyres andfootwear, which account for a sizable part of it, have been subject to the sameinfluences as clothing. Nevertheless, production of cotton-goods continued highthroughout the autumn and right up to Christmas as old orders were worked off.Since Christmas, there has been some production for stock, but. this has nowlargely come to an end because it cannot be financed.      *Rayon10. Trade in rayon cloth followed a similar trend to cotton, but the cuts in production of rayon yarn and staple fibre were delayed until March because ofstocking up by the producers.Linen \.   .r    , , &apos;       . : - -11. In common with other textiles the Northern Ireland linen industry has suffered from the general curtailment of demand in the home market. Its special difficulties have arisen from the nature of its export trade which comprises about50 per cent, of total production and the bulk of which is directed to a limited number of overseas markets. Of these markets North America which takes about40 per cent, of exports is the most important. Australia, too, is a good customer.Trade with South America on the other hand has for some time been made difficult by import restrictions. In 1950 and early 1951 demand for linen in North Americawas buoyant and encouraged production to reach the highest level since the war.
Since mid-1951, however, demand has fallen sharply and this coupled with theimport restrictions announced by Australia has reduced production to 50 per cent.,of normal. The prospects for 1952 are obscure, but on the whole.it is felt that little or no improvement is likely before the end of the year. In the longer termthere should be a progressive improvement in the industry&apos;s productive efficiencyas a result of the Re-equipment of Industry Act.General- 12. Import restrictions by other countries, especially France and Australia,in recent months have intensified difficulties in the export trade, but even without these a severe reduction in our exports; would have followed inevitably on the recession of demand. Exports of wool goods have been falling markedly over thepast four or five months; exports of cotton and rayon goods have not so far shownmuch, if any reduction, but this has been due entirely to the execution of orders placed many months ago, and a severe falling off in the rate of exports will become apparent in the next few months.13. In these conditions it is extremely difficult to forecast the future. Con-sultation with the trade itself shows that there is no single clear view on what theprospects really are or how long the recession is likely to last. Uncertainty abouthow far raw material prices will fall, about the purchase tax and about how muchtraders will cut losses on stocks, adds to the difficulty. It is pretty safe to saythat activity in the textile industries is unlikely to remain indefinitely at the lowlevels to which it has fallen, though in the case of cotton and rayon, at any rate,it is fairly certain that there will be a further fall before there is any improvement.How and when an improvement may come depends on many uncertain factors.In this country much will turn on the effect of higher food and other prices onconsumers&apos; buying, and on the extent to which this is offset by wage and salary increases, by reductions in taxation already announced and by the diversion of demand resulting from import cuts (largely of food) and reduced supplies of metalconsumer goods; in the last resort it is the retailer&apos;s judgment of the future thatwill be decisive. The factors that will determine the level of export demand are thecourse of rearmament and economic activity in the United States, the fiscal policies of the Australian and other Commonwealth Governments, and the ability of ourcotton and rayon industries to reduce their costs so as to compete with Continentaland American and Japanese and Indian manufacturers.14. Course of Wool and Cotton Prices. The market prices of the two maintextile materials wool and cotton -have reflected the slowing down of activity inthe manufacturing industry. Apart from spasmodic fluctuations early last autumnwool prices have been going down for exactly a year and the decline has beenspectacular. The price of a representative grade (average 25-66c/. 1934-38) whichrose to the record level of 314c/. last March had fallen to 107c/. last week. since october last, when the price was about 150c/., the decline has been steady, slow anduninterrupted. Current levels, three months from the end of the wool sellingseason, are those of autumn 1949. This decline, while in part a reaction againstthe feverish levels of last spring, reflects a real recession in trade activity. TheUnited Kingdom wool industry used about 400 million lb. of wool in 1951 ascompared with 518 million lb. in 1950; similarly, the United States consumed only478 million lb. as compared with 634 million lb. the previous year. So far as the raw wool market is any guide there is no sign whatever that any revival of manu-facturing activity is imminent. It seems likely that wool prices are near bottom,but there is no evidence that the trade expects a revival.15. The price of raw cotton, slower to fall, is showing the same trend, althoughit is more erratic. The raw cotton market is more complex than the wool market and subject to more artificial influences. Nevertheless, the premium for non-dollarcottons has narrowed a great deal in recent months, e.g., the prices of standardgrades of United States and Peruvian cotton, 37d. and 56c/. respectively on1st January are now 36d. and 40d. Brazilian cotton was showing a.similar tendencybut the price has recently risen again possibly because the Brazilian Governmenthave introduced support measures, Egyptian cotton prices have fallen since 1st January, Karnak from 115c/. to 87c/. and Ashmouni from 63c/. to 48c/. Indica-tions are that the trade doubts the ability of the Brazilian and still less the egyptian government to support prices at the level they have chosen. If this is right, the trend wOuld be for non-dollar cotton prices to fall and for the premium to narrow.16. Prices therefore in both the cotton and woolmarkets have shown a steady,although sometimes erratic retreat.   There is no indication in either market that an
upward swing is round the corner. Trade circles consider that cotton prices will fall still further. Market activity is sluggish. In these circumstances it isimpossible to make any useful forecast of the possible trend of cotton and woolprices in the next few months. The really determining factor for cotton will be the size of this year&apos;s crop.17. Likelihood of Revival. Consideration of the factors in the preceding paragraphs leads, to the conclusion that the balance of probability is in favour of amild recovery in buying of textiles by the autumn or winter. But, short of anotherwar scare, there is no evidence that demand will return in any circumstances to the exceptionally high levels of late 1950 and the first half of 1951.18. The effect of such a recovery on activity in the textile industries will,however, be delayed. Stocks throughout the chain of distribution are large (there isa surplus of perhaps two months production on the.average) and will have to be worked off before a revival of demand is reflected in revived activity in the mills.The fact that these stocks have mostly been bought at prices well above the current level makes their digestion harder because traders are unwilling to take losses on them. The tighter credit policy will be an inducement to them to get rid of these stocks. At the same time, the increased cost and scarcity of credit will make it moredifficult for firms to retain under-employed labour or to produce for stock in hopeof better times.19. Since the recession started some months earlier in wool than in cotton andrayon, a revival may also be expected first in wool. Indeed, there are alreadysigns of some slight revival of demand, and activity in the top-making section hasincreased a little in recent weeks.Possibilities of Alternative Employment20. The absorption of the unemployed workers from textiles and clothing inother employment depends on the existence of other industry in the areas concerned,on the level of activity in that industry, and the type of worker it demands. Out of27 cotton areas, in Lancashire and Cheshire, 26 textile areas in the West Riding, and7 textile areas in South Scotland, 8, 8 and 2 respectively are so dependent on these industries that over half of their insured population are engaged in them. some indication of the prospects can be measured by the ratio between unemployment andoutstanding vacancies. In Great Britain as a whole there are at present two out-standing vacancies for every three unemployed persons: for women the ratio isabout one to two. In 20 of the 27 cotton areas in Lancashire and Cheshire, thenumber of unemployed exceeds the number of outstanding vacancies, the ratiovarying from 3 to 10 unemployed for every vacancy in 13 areas, while in Nelsonit is nearly 30 to .1, In the case of women there is only one area where there are more vacancies than unemployed and four areas where the ratio is better than forthe rest of the country.21. The fact that many of the existing or prospective vacancies are for menand the highest proportion of the unemployed are women raises the question of thepossible employment of women on work normally done by men. EmploymentExchanges as a matter of course, if they are unable to fill vacancies notified formen, suggest women if suitable women are on the register. At the outset of thedefence programme, the Ministry of Labour raised with both sides of industry theneed to make arrangements to employ women to a greater extent and to make arrangements for their training as necessary. It must be recognised, however, thatpractical results will not come from this unless employers are unable to obtain malelabour and work is suitable for women. At present the main shortages are for skilled engineering workers.. 22. Since engineering constitutes the biggest group of industries in lancashire and Cheshire an improvement in the prospects of absorbing the unemployed cottonworkers is largely dependent on what is to happen about steel supplies for theengineering industry and the development of defence and export work in these areas: The prospects for the engineering industry generally are discussed inparagraph 27 below. The chief immediate defence demands for women in these areas are at the Blackburn and Chorley R.O.F&apos;s amounting to 700 in 1952.Demands for a few hundred workers have been approved for aero engines at
Nelson and for several thousand workers for aero engines or airframes at Bolton,Preston, Accrington and Stockport, which will be spread over the next two years.The Ministry of Supply estimate that in 1952 there will be net vacancies for some7,000 unskilled workers for defence contracts in the textile areas in Lancashire.Of these, only 3,000 will be for women. Recruitment for these jobs is, in any case,dependent on the provision of skilled workers and in general one skilled worker will,be required for every two unskilled.23. The position is similar in the woollen areas in the West Riding, though not quite so serious. In 16 of 26 textile areas, the unemployed exceed the vacanciesvarying from 3 to 6 unemployed for every vacancy in 9 areas, while in one the ratio is 9^ to 1. In the case of women there are only two areas where vacanciesexceed unemployment and five where the ratio is better than for Great Britain.The engineering industries are also the biggest group, in the East and West RidingsRegion. Such defence demands as have been approved are in Leeds, where thereare 2 R.O.F&apos;s with demands amounting to 860 (including 75 skilled) in 1952, and small demands in Huddersfield and Bradford; alt three being areas which are among those less seriously affected. The demands are also mainly for men in skilledengineering occupations. As regards unskilled workers, the Ministry of Supplyestimate that 2,200 will be required in Yorkshire during 1952. Of these, 1,100 willbe women. Here again, sufficient skilled workers have to be recruited pari passu.The existing unemployment in the textile towns on the Scottish border does not present a serious problem, but it would become serious, in view of their dependence on these industries, should the recession gets worse.24. The places in which rayon production is carried on are in areas where unemployment is not heavy and there should not be serious difficulties in findingother work for unemployed rayon workers, if necessary. In the case of rayonweaving, much of which is carried on in Lancashire, the difficulties are those already described in connection with cotton. Of the silk towns Leek is within travellingdistance of the R.O.F. at Swynnerton, and some men and women have already been recruited for work there. There is little alternative work at Macclesfield and the nearest demand area is Crewe, where men are required for engineering; whereas the unemployed in Macclesfield are mostly women. As regards hosiery, the places in the North Midlands which are mainly affected are areas where there is a fairlywide range of industry. The prospects of absorbing unemployed hosiery workers inother work, therefore, must depend very largely on the prospects for industry ingeneral. There are moderate defence demands from the R.O.F., Nottingham, and prospects of a later demand for electronics, but mainly for men.25. As already noted, the clothing industry is distributed widely throughoutthe country and there are few places where the recession in this industry alone hasturned an area into one of comparatively heavy unemployment. These circum-stances should ease the problem of finding alternative employment, although in anumber of areas, such as Leeds, where wholesale tailoring is concentrated, andsome of the Lancashire cotton towns, it adds to the difficulties created by the recession in textiles. The other type of area where difficulty might be experiencedare those parts of the Development Areas into which clothing has been brought,such as Durham and South Wales. Generally, however, unemployment in theDevelopment Areas is no worse at present than a year ago.26. In Northern Ireland the absorption of the unemployed workers from tex-tiles and clothing into other employment presents special difficulties. The unemploy-ment in these industries has been superimposed on an already serious unemploy-ment position. During the four years 1947-50 of full employment in Great Britain,Northern Ireland&apos;s unemployment averaged 6-2 per cent. If allowance is madetor seasonal unemployment in the building industry and among agricultural wor-kers it is estimated that there is in Northern Ireland a pool of more than 10,000men who could be put into productive work if suitable industrial employment couldbe found. It is the Government of Northern Ireland&apos;s long-term policy to meet this situation by a programme of industrial development which will at the same timebroaden the basis of the country&apos;s economy. This is proceeding as fast as possilbe within the limits of the capital investment programme. As a short-term measure,urgent representations have been made for defence contracts to be allotted to North-ern Ireland firms. As a result of efforts to date, it is estimated that, about 2,000jobs will be provided in 1925. But against the background of chronic unemploy-ment, these jobs clearly offer only a very limited opportunity for absorbing textileand clothing workers who have become unemployed in the last six months.
Absorption of Redundant Workers in other Industries27. The metal using industries are not likely to require a great deal of addi-tional labour this year. Their output is limited by shortages of material rather than of labour, and the increases in defence work will be little more than an offset tocontraction of civil output. Defence sub-contracts which will increase as the pro-gramme develops, are more likely to be placed with firms having under-employedcapacity than with those who would have to engage additional labour to meet them.On the other hand there are considerable direct defence contracts in parts of the textile areas (especially in South Lancashire) and the demand for labour to fulfilthese is developing. To the extent that they are suitable or can be trained, someredundant workers from the textile industries may thus find alternative employment.But it remains generally true that the absorptive power of the metal using industries,in textile areas as elsewhere, is likely to be small in the shorter term and indeeduntil there is sufficient material to permit of an expansion in the total output of these industries for all purposes, whether export, defence or the home market.28, The possibility of any increased demand for labour from the rest of manu-facturing industry during 1952 depends largely on the demand for home-producedconsumer goods. As has been suggested earlier in this Report, the cuts in importsfor consumption and in metal consumers&apos; goods will fend, once they are reflected in supplies to the shops, to divert demand on to other goods. Consequently, if thetotal volume of consumer expenditure does not fall (and the general assumptionunderlying the Budget is that it will not), there may be some revival in the demandfor home-produced manufactures, but this effect is unlikely to be very swift.29. Outside the field of manufacturing industry, the demand for labour in the distributive trades may be expected to follow reasonably closely the fortunes ofthe consumer goods industries. In building, coal, transport and agriculture thereis little likelihood of recession, and their demand for labour will presumably keep up, but these industries are not of course suitable for direct transfer of much of thelabour becoming redundant from textiles.30. The general conclusion is that there is not likely to be much increase inthe general level of demand for labour over the rest of the year. There is some scope for absorption of redundant workers in other industries but the prospects of soabsorbing within the next few months, cotton, woollen and clothing workers un-employed in Lancashire, Cheshire, and the West Riding cannot be considered good.The position in those towns which are heavily dependent on those industries isdefinitely bad, and worst of all in Northern Ireland.Fields of Possible Action31. Purchase Tax. Prominent among the suggestions made in the recentParliamentary Debate was one that there should be a modification, if only temporary, of the Purchase Tax on textiles and clothing. This is being examined,and a separate report is being made to Ministers.32. Defence Orders. Emphasis has also been laid on the possibility ofadvancing to the maximum extent practicable orders for textiles and clothing tobe placed under the defence programme and for civil defence. This is the subjectof a separate report, which makes it clear that almost all clothing and textilesrequired by the Armed Forces under their production programmes for 1952-53have already been ordered. This Report then suggests that orders for the balanceof the rearmament programme, originally to be placed in 1953-54 and 1954-55,might be accelerated and placed this year. The total cost for the three services would be about  59 million. Orders on this scale would involve supplementary estimates. (This would be avoided if delivery of other equipment were deferred,but the Service Departments do not consider this would be practicable.) some further measures involving expenditure totalling  56 million outside the rearmament -ment programme are also discussed. These would involve purchase of additionalreserve and mobilisation clothing, orders for uniform and kit to full normal peace-time scales, and provision of uniforms and equipment for the Home Guard, either for the present recruiting target of 140,000 or possibly for the eventual plannedstrength of 840,000. Restoration of Cuts made in Civil Defence estimates are also proposed. These with other additions would together involve textiles and clothingto a cost of  23 million, to which might be added a national stockpile of blackoutmaterial also requiring supplementary estimates. (It should be noted here that policy decisions have yet to be taken in connexion with the form of a blackout, if any,
;in a future war.), All these;proposals are; in effect, a statement of gross requirementsbut it is doubtful whether more than a fraction of them could be usefully orderedeither because they would not.be lor textile goods made by the worse hit parts ofthe industry, or even because in some cases they Would fall upon sections of the-industry already well&apos;occupied &quot;with defence and other; work. Moreover^ the pYeseritprogramme of defence orders on the textile industry-amounting in 1952 -53 to 46 million-is in itself at an, abnormal&apos; level; wjiich&quot; is masking&apos; the; true state&apos;:of demand. Any marked acceleration of defence purchases would thus accentuatethe difficulties which will confront the &quot;industry later &quot;on: it&apos;&apos; wpuld&quot; &apos;%$sb:- requireaddition to the defence estimates and lead to extra&apos;demand&quot;foristorage.; space.Nevertheless, limited defence orders placed selectively do afford a possibility ofrelieving unemployment in the worst hit areas where resources may otherwiseremain idle because of the lack of alternative employment.33. Other Public Purchases. Outside the defence programme the biggestinstitutional buyer of textiles is the Health Service. Annual expenditure amountsto between  8 million and  9 million. It is not possible to say what buying policyis being followed or the extent to which purchases might be brought forward, asbuying is not centralised, but a circular could be issued by the Ministry of Healthadvising the early placing of orders for textiles. The railways do not normallycarry very large stocks, and so could not hold off the market for long periods andhave not therefore been doing so. A great deal of their textile purchases are forflax and jute canvases, the capacity for which is fairly fully occupied, and ordersfor this would not help the slack sections of the trade. Orders for uniforms andlinings might be susceptible of acceleration, but the railways would expect, to beallowed to consider carefully the effect on costs. The Crown Agents for the Coloniesspend  3 million to  4 million a year on textiles. They are agents with an obligationto their principals to have regard to commercial considerations. For much of their business they are in any case not in a position to accelerate orders, since forspecialised requirements they notify tender prices to the orderer and buy or not,according to instructions received. About one-third of their textile business is,however, for standard items (for the most part piece-goods, sheets, blankets, &amp;c),and it is their practice to buy ahead for such items, meeting colonial orders asthey come forward. They admit to buying short on these items at the moment.They report that on other items there is often a tendency to reduce orders whenprices are notified, suggesting that there is still some price resistance and that lower prices would improve the level of business. The Police and the Fire Service are, likethe Health Service, not centralised buyers, and a circular advising early orders isthe only quick action that could be taken. Their combined purchases do not amountto much more than  2 million a year, however. The Post Office are already largelycommitted for their 1952-53 requirements, their annual level of expenditure againbeing just under  2 million. They might be able to accelerate some orders forlinings and cloth for 1953-54 requirements, but this would not amount to a greatdeal. The Ministry of Works spend about  li- million a year on textiles, the largestitems being curtaining, carpets and domestic textiles (dusters, &amp;c). They couldplace (and actually propose to do so) orders to the value of about  400,000 fairlyrapidly, mainly for carpets, but also to some extent for household textiles andcurtaining. The Departments concerned might be asked to take (in consultationwith the Board of Trade) such action as is open to them to encourage the acceleration-tion of placing of orders, where those orders would help to relieve the currentdifficulties.34, Additional Dollar Purchases. The suggestion has been made that theposition of the United Kingdom cotton textile industry would be materiallyimproved if it could be given, in the medium staples, a greater proportion of dollarcotton. This question was examined earlier from November to February last before the textiles depression had assumed its present proportions and it was then decided on dollar balance of payments grounds not to proceed with it. In themeantime circumstances have changed.35. The problem arises because the world-wide shortage of dollars has inrecent years forced to a premium the price of cotton (e.g., from Brazil and Pakistan)which is substitutable for dollar cotton. This premium has been as high.as 15/20J.per lb. and at its highest the Raw Cotton Commission^ selling prices for Americantype cotton were, grade by grade, about 6d. per lb. higher than comparable UnitedStates prices. This meant that those countries who obtain a greater proportionof their needs from dollar sources (the United Kingdom industry has kept down to42090 c
about one-half) were in a better competitive position in export markets but the disparity mattered less while there w;as a buoyant sellers&apos; market.36. But in present conditions it is obviously important that the UnitedKingdom trade should be fully competitive. The question of switching to a greater proportion of dollar cotton would need further detailed consideration with newfigures but the immediate advice of the .Raw Cotton Commission is that anadditional substantial purchase of dollar cotton at this juncture would not have a decisive effect for two reasons. These are: :(a) that the premium for non-dollar cotton is now tending to disappear ofits own accord and, with a smaller aggregate demand for raw cotton,the Commission expect the differential to narrow much more in thecoming months; and(b) that cotton of the right qualities is no longer available in bulk from dollar sources.It is now towards the end of the selling season in the United States. .37. The Commission imply that a much longer term view of the problemought to be taken. They consider, making the best estimates they can, that ifnext year they could be authorised to buy medium staple cotton in the proportions of 70 per cent, from the United States and 30 per cent, from all other sources,they would be able to sell raw cotton at approximately United States prices from now on. How much more United States cotton this would mean next year wouldhave to be worked out and it would depend on the probable level of activity fore-casted to the end of 1953. The additional cost in dollars (with a saving on other types) would naturally depend upon the vagaries of cotton prices over the periodbut would scarcely be less than about  5 million for perhaps 20,000 tons.38. This whole question is being re-examined with the Cotton Board and the raw Cotton Commission and a report will be made as soon as possible. Thefollowing considerations have to be borne in mind, but a decision cannot be reacheduntil all the facts have been examined.(i) Our dollar position is so grave that the highest justification would be needed for any additional dollar expenditure.(ii) As the premium narrows and the Commission^ selling prices comenaturally closer to United States prices this becomes a less important factor. Our export competitive position may then be governed byother factors than the slightly higher cost of raw cotton, but in buyers&apos;market every little helps.(iii) As regards the home market marginal variations in the prices of raw cottonare not necessarily the determining factors in the cost of goods in shops.In other words the cost of cotton goods to the user in the United King-dom will not fall spectacularly merely because the United kingdom trade are given more dollar cotton for the home market.(iv) In any case action of this kind, even if it were desirable, could not be taken until the opening of the new buying season in some two months&apos; time.39. Overseas Orders for the Defence Programme. During the first half of1951, orders were placed abroad to a total of some  35 million at a time when itwas difficult to get the orders fulfilled by our own industry. There has recentlybeen a review of the outstanding contracts to see what could be cancelled, and infact  2-2- million worth of orders have been cancelled. To go beyond this wouldhave meant paying compensation equal to a high percentage of the total cost ofthe goods in &quot;question. No further orders for textiles are being placed abroad, andthere is no scope for further diversion to the home market of orders placed abroad.40.   Imports of Grey Cotton ClothImports of grey cloth over the last three years in million square yards havebeen:  -Source 1949 1950 1951Japan   ...      ...      ...      ...      178 91 85India    ...      ......... 3 71 106European Continent  (but in-cluding    small    amountsfrom Commonwealth)   ...      128 83 150Total ...      ...      309 245 341
Imports from Japan are subject to quota restriction. The issue of new licenceswas stopped in February 1952, after only five-sixths of the current six-monthlyquota had been issued. Licences which lapse are being renewed only in those cases where firm contracts have been made. It is an essential condition of alllicences for Japanese grey cloth that the cloth shall be re-exported after processingto specified markets.Imports of cloth from India, which are not controlled in any way, reached a peak in May 1951 but have fallen sharply since then. There is no condition aboutre-export but available information suggests that from one-half to three-quartersis re-exported.Imports of grey cloth from the Continent were, until recently, on Open GeneralLicence. They have been falling steadily in recent months. The Size of the futurequota has not yet been decided. There is no condition about re-export but avail-able information suggests that a little more than 50 per cent, is re-exportedThe imported Japanese grey cloth is of a cheaper type suitable for the Colonialor native trade. The merchants and finishers take the view that these supplies have enabled them to keep a foothold in the Colonial and native markets which theywould not otherwise have been able to maintain. In the past when other business was available Lancashire has been reluctant to produce cloth of this type. Itshould now be possible for special arrangements to be made to weave cloth ofsuitable type and price in Lancashire to replace at least in part the supplies from japan. Another factor is the excess finishing capacity in Lancashire comparedwith weaving. The President has asked the industry through the Cotton board for an agreed recommendation about the future requirements of the industry forJapanese grey cloth.41. Competition from Textile Imports. Competition within the UnitedKingdom from imported textiles will fall off because of the import restrictions imposed to rectify the balance of payments position. Clothing and carpets were removed from Open General Licence last November and on Budget day the open general Licences on a wide range of textile goods were suspended. Imports infuture will be under quotas which will be fixed up to 31st December, 1952. Theeffect of these restrictions on the general level of textile imports from the Continentwill not be known until the quotas are announced. Imports, however, were alreadyfalling off sharply because of the decline in demand. The details in relation tothe overall cut announced in the Budget have not yet been worked out, but it seems likely that imports of textiles will be cut to about 50 per cent, of the 1951 level.42. It should be emphasised that the cuts were made solely to reduce ourdeficit on current account, especially with the European Payments Union area,imports from which now cost 80 per cent, in dollars. The cuts were not made forprotective reasons.43. Should a revival of demand arise later this year, the United Kingdomtextile industry would benefit from the restriction on imports as foreign exporterswill only have a fraction of their former access to the United Kingdom market;but the duration of the restriction on textiles and other imports from Europe is greatly dependent on our balance of payments situation. Moreover, if the UnitedKingdom were to run a surplus in E.P.U. for some months, there would be heavy pressure&apos;from O.E.E.C. and member countries to ease up on our imports. Wecannot therefore rely on this -form of stimulus to the industry. Exporting nationswhose imports are cut might be tempted into retaliatory action against our textileexports. This would be contrary to the O.E.E.C. code if they were runningsurpluses in E.P.U. Moreover, an analysis of our exports to Europe shows that about half goes to Scandinavian countries who do not have large textile industries.44. Import Restrictions on Textiles in Overseas Markets.-It is notoriousthat the textile and clothing industries are among the first to be set up in agriculturalcountries seeking to industrialise themselves; and that an early consequence of thisis the erection of protective barriers in the form of tariffs and import quotas.Moreover, when import restrictions become necessary on balance of paymentsgrounds they tend for the same reason to fall heavily on the more advanced formsof textile manufacture and clothing.Latin American countries, with few exceptions, subject textile imports to severequotas or prohibitions; the &quot; Iron Curtain &quot; countries virtually exclude all manu-factured textiles from us; on the other hand, nearly all the Western european countries at present admit most textiles reasonably freely.  Efforts are made in the
bourse. of bilateral trade iiegbtiatro&amp;suto-^^^ textileswhere these are needed, and some success has recently been achieved with Germany-and Finland. But the United Kingdom&apos;s bargaining power is much limited by ourpresent inability to offer adequate supplies of toai, steel and other requirements&quot;Of these countries, and by our heed to use ail we can offer as a means to securein return food and raw material essential to ourselves. Moreover, our own balanceof payments position limits the extent to which we i can offer-inducements in theform of import licences for inessential goods which the other countries want to-sell. Finally, when the foreign country is itself short of sterling, it may well prefer to spend much of its resources on primary products from the outer sterling area.45. A severe blow has been dealt to the United Kingdom textile industry atan inopportune moment by the drastic import restrictions which the australian government was recently compelled to impose in order to balance its externalaccount. A few textile goods, mainly yarns, are subject to a cut of 40 per cent,on imports in the base period July 1950-June 195.1 but most have to bear a cut of no less than 80 per cent. Moreover, the base period is one during which imports were running at a much lower rate than in recent months, so that the quotas repre-sent in practice even lower percentages when related to current imports. SinceAustralia is easily our best market for textiles, having taken 19 per cent, of all our exports of cotton yarn and manufactures in 1951 and 30 per cent. cent, of rayonyarn and piece-goods, these cuts have inevitably had a shattering impact. efforts are being made to get some amelioration of the position where firm contracts are involved. A rough estimate indicates that outstanding orders amount to about one year&apos;s quota. But any relief to be obtained does not at present seem likelyto be appreciable, particularly as (i) the Australians will reckon any concession against the importers&apos; quotas;and(ii) they are clearly unable to move to any measurable extent from the overallseverity of the cuts if they are to achieve their major objective of getting into external balance.46. Representations have already been made to the Australian Governmentand the question of a further approach to them is under consideration. As regards other overseas markets, there is little hope of obtaining any improvements in thenear future, but every effort will continue to be made.47. Existing Restrictions on Government Ordering. As a result of the recession in textiles and rephasing of the defence programme there has been achange in the labour situation in the Chorley-Preston-Blackburn areas since thedecision was taken at the end of last year to ban Government contracts from this area, save in very exceptional circumstances. The supply of skilled labour is stilla limiting factor to building up the labour force on defence work in the area, butin view of the surplus unskilled labour, particularly female labour, it is recom-mended that this virtually complete ban on Government contracts should be liftedfor other than engineering work and the need for it re-examined in relation toengineering work. Moreover, a regional enquiry should be made to see whether there is scope for steering further defence work into the textile areas as a wholewithout interfering with existing defence and export work in particular parts ofthem.:; 48. Diversification of Industry in the Textile Areas. There is little that couldbe done in the near future to provide useful additional employment in those areas where existing alternatives to the textile industries are lacking. The severelimitations which are necessary upon new capital investment, and the shortage of skilled labour are two of the most important limiting factors. The longer-termpossibilities of action in this direction should be examined in connection with the study on which the Board of Trade is about to start working of the longer-termprospects for the textile industries. Meanwhile, within current limitations, suchencouragement should be given as is possible to help developments of this kind.
