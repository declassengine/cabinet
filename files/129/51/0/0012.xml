(52) 1124th APRIL, 1952.CABINETPUR.CHASE- TAX AND TEXTILES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Various proposals have been made to use the machinery of Purchase Taxto relieve the depression in the textile industry, and in the related fields ofcarpets, linoleum, footwear etc.   The three main suggestions are that:-A. The level of D for these articles should be raised, thusincreasing the tax-free element in the price.B. There should be a tax-free &quot;holiday&quot; for a limited period.C. A reduction in the rates of tax should be made, leaving thelevel of D unchanged.2.      Each of these proposals is open to certain objections which are set out below.   But they are all vulnerable in certain respects, which they share in common.3.      In the first place, they assume that a reduction in the burden of tax,whatever form it took, would stimulate demand, and, therefore, revive employment.But this assumption itself is inconsistent with the facts.   A large part of theproduction of textiles is already wholly outside the scope of the tax, e, g. exports,Government contracts, young children&apos;s clothing, industrial cloth, and upholsterycloth.   (The latter pays tax, if at all, as furniture).   In this way probably not morethan 60% of production is within the potential field of the tax.   Under the D schemehalf of this remains wholly exempt.   This leaves only 30% now affected by tax.Over most of this sector, representing what was previously the better Utilitygrades, the burden of tax is now relatively trifling, ranging from almost nil toabout 10% of the retail price.   It is generally expected that prices will eventuallyfall by far larger amounts than these, and this makes it highly improbable that even complete remission of tax under the tax &quot;holiday&quot; would have any effect in this field at all.   It is only in the case of the 10% representing most expensiveproducts, previously non-utility, that even complete remission of the tax mightachieve some result, but this would obviously be represented as a mere manipulationof the tax in favour of the luxury article.4.     Secondly, it must be remembered that if the tax on textiles were reduced by an appreciable amount, there is no guarantee that the money would be spent on buying more garments etc.   Much of it would probably be spent on other things, thus increasing the inflationary pressure.   While there is a case fordealing with particular areas of deflation we must be sure that the methods usedhave a definite effect on the ills which they are designed to cure.5.      In addition to these general considerations, each of the proposals is opento certain particular objections:-
(i)   To raise the level of D for textiles would be to make a quite fundamental^Iteration in a new scheme of Purchase Tax, which has only just been launchedand is not yet effective so far as the consumer is concerned.   It would alsojeopardise the median principle on which the D scheme is based;   in whichconnection it must be borne in mind that as prices fall (as they are clearlytending to) the relative level of D will rise automatically, possibly to a quitesubstantial extent - i. e. more goods will be tax free.   Moreover, to give purchase tax relief by way of modifying the D scheme would, from the point of view ofthe long-term interests of the Purchase Tax, be a very definite step in the wrongdirection.   The whole policy on this tax should be to effect a gradual reductionin the rate  of the tax as and when circumstances permit;  and to put a largerrange of goods on the tax-free field, obviously makes it harder to achieve this long-term policy.(ii) A tax &quot;holiday&quot; for a limited period is open to even more serious objection.   In the first place, if - contrary to the probabilities, as shown above -it were really effective, the result might be an even more serious problem thanexists now.   For if the consumer were really induced to take advantage of thislimited opportunity, he would pack into a few months the spending of a much longer period;  and at the end of the &quot;holiday&quot; the slump would be recreated on an even larger scale.   Secondly, if - as is more ^probable - the &quot;holiday&quot; hadrelatively little effect, and, at the end of it, the slump still persisted, the pressure to prolong the &quot;holiday&quot; would be overwhelming;  and in the end it wouldbecome a permanency, the Exchequer having lost forever revenue which, fromthe Budgetary point of view,it cannot afford to sacrifice.   (The total tax involvedin this field is of the order of  80 to  100 millions.)   Indeed , it can be argued thatthere would be pressure to prolong the &quot;holiday&quot; even if it were a success.Finally, a tax &quot;holiday&quot; for one particular industry would be an extremelydangerous precedent.   We should come under great pressure thereafter to make&apos;a similar concession to any and every industry which experienced a recession,whatever its cause and however brief its duration.   The long-term implications for the Exchequer are intolerable.(iii)  A reduction in the rate of tax is even less likely to be effective than an all-out tax &quot;holiday&quot;, and would simply involve the Exchequer in a loss ofrevenue to no definite purpose.   This loss - unlike that resulting from a tax&quot;holiday&quot; of limited duration - would, of course, be permanent.   It would bevery difficult to secure agreement to compensatory increases in the tax on other articles.   Moreover, the internal relativities of the tax would be disturbed,and the whole structure of the tax might gradually be undermined.6.     I am dealing here with suggestions which have been put forward forpreferential concession to textiles in the Purchase Tax field.7.     I do not think we need or should close our minds to making amendmentson the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on detailed points affecting theworking of the D scheme - Purchase Tax.   I have particularly in mind the incidence of the tax on furnishing fabrics, gloves and possibly boots and shoes,R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1 .4th APRIL, 1952.
