ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Committee on Road and Rail Transport, augmented by theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Vlinister of Labour and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, have recently been charged by the Cabinet with three tasks:-(i)  To study the proposals for reorganisation of road and rail transport in  C. (52) 83 and to report to the Cabinet on the results of this study and on the form which any announcement of the governments intentions should take (C. C. (52) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 4(1)).(ii)  To consider forthwith whether the proposals of the Committee on Road and rail  Transport for regulating competition between road and rail transport could not be extended to cover long-distance road passenger services    (C. C.(52) 36th Conclusions, Minute 1(3)).(iii)  To consider and report what standstill arrangements could be madepending the introduction of long-term legislation for regulatingcompetition between the railways and road services in respect ofthe  carriage both of passengers and of freight.In this memorandum I concentrate on the first of these tasks.   A separate paper is being submitted to the Cabinet about the licensing of long-distance road passenger services, which are dealt with here only in so far as they are affectedby the Committee&apos;s earlier proposals in C. (52) 83.The Proposals in C. (52) 832, I am now able to report, on behalf of the augmented Road and rail transport Committee, an unanimous recommendation in favour of the proposalsfor reorganisation of road and rail transport contained in C. (52) 83, except thatit is not now proposed to impose a levy on long-distance road passenger transport.There is now no difference of opinion over the proposal to impose a levy on roadgoods transport.   If the Cabinet endorse the proposals, drafting of a Bill, whichwill necessarily be long and complex, should begin at once.Long-distance Road Passenger Transport3, As indicated above, we are submitting a separate paper on thissubject.   The present provisions governing the licensing of long-distance road passenger transport, to the working of which the recent case of Northern RoadwaysLimited has drawn attention, are contained in the Road Transport Act, 1930.   So faras the 1947 Act is concerned, all we need to do is, as already proposed in C.(52) 83,to repeal the British Transport Commission^ scheme-making powers.Announcement of the Governmenfs Intentions4. Our unanimous view is that the earliest and fullest possibleannouncement should be made of the Governments intentions in respect of transporsecret CABINET OFF.-UfcRECORD copy . (52) 110 copy NO.  )Q:    3TH april, 1952cabinet
In view of the time required before a Bill can be drafted and introduced, it seemsto us that the announcement should take the form of a White Paper, which mightbe debated if Parliament showed a desire for that course.   Any other form of announcement would be liable to distortion and misrepresentation, and wouldbe no freer from the risk of tying the hands of the Government.   The Committeehave therefore prepared a draft of a White Paper, which I attach as the Annex tothis memorandum.Recommendations5. I ask my colleagues:-(1)  To endorse the proposals in C.(52) 83 including the proposal for alevy, which would, however, be limited in so far as this Billis concerned to road goods transport.(2)  To authorise the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power,to embark forthwith on the preparation of a Bill to give effect tothe proposals in C. (52) 83 as modified by recommendation (l)above.   This Bill, before submission to the Cabinet, would beconsidered by the Road and Rail Transport Committee, to whompoints of policy arising during the course of drafting would bereferred for decision.(3)  To agree that a White Paper in the terms of the annexed draft should beissued.W.&apos;Privy Council Office, S. W. 1. ,8TH APRIL, 1952.
annex draft WHITE paper, The Government have for some time past had under consideration the situation resulting from the passing of the Transport Act, 1947.   Intheir view this Act has not achieved and is not likely to achieve its avowedpurpose which was &quot;to provide or secure or promote the provision of an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of publicinland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods, &quot; and &quot;to provide most efficiently and conveniently for the needsof the public, agriculture, commerce and industry&quot;.2, In spite of the efforts made by the British Transport Commissionand its Executives integration of its road and rail services into aco-ordinated whole has made little progress, and shows little real prospectof developing into much more than working arrangements between separatetransport entities.   Even if integration in its fullest sense were practicable,it would result in an immense and unwieldy machine, ill-adapted to meet with promptitude the varying and instant demands of industry.3. It is the view of the Government that the administration of therailways has become excessively centralised under the Act, and that theRoad Haulage Executive, with the elaborate system of depots working under its direction, cannot give trade and industry the speedy, individual andspecialised services afforded by free hauliers before nationalisation,and could not stand up to competition from them.4. The Transport Act provided for area passenger transport schemes which were intended to cover the whole country, and for schemes for tradeharbours or groups of trade harbours.   The efforts so far made by theCommission to promote these schemes have provoked so much oppositionthat it is clear that they would have little chance of surviving the elaborateprocedure provided in the Act for bringing them into force.5. In the light of the above considerations, the Government have come tothe conclusion that amending legislation is imperative.   It is not enough merely to amend or remove the undesirable features of the Transport Act:  a positive approach is needed under which, with a minimum of centralisedcontrol, the transport system may be stimulated to adjust and developitself in accordance with public needs, and may regain and increase the flexibility without which the demands of trade, industry and commercecannot be adequately met.6. The main features of the Governments proposals are as follows:-Road Haulage7. Road haulage has in the past been restricted mainly in order to avoidexcessive competition between road and rail.   In the view of the government this process has deprived trade and industry of the full advantages of road transport and has driven traders to provide their own road transport to an extent which would not otherwise have occurred.   The railways are a nationalasset and must remain a vital element in transport, and it would be wrong toallow them to fall into decay.8. The Government have come to the conclusion that the undertaking of the Road Haulage Executive set up under the Transport Act should revert to private enterprise.   For this purpose it is proposed that the undertaking
should be divided into operable units (including a suitable proportion ofsmall units) and offered to the public for disposal by open tender.   Unitsacquired will be given &apos;A&apos; carriers&apos; licences under the Road and rail traffic Act, 193 3, and will at once be freed from the 25-mile limit imposedunder the Transport Act.   Eventually this limit will be removed altogether andin the interim period the existing permit system will be continued.9. In order to allow road haulage to play its appropriate economic partin the transport system provision will be made for greater latitude in the granting&quot; of new licences under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, whereneed for a better or more convenient service is shown.10. Since the goodwill of the former businesses, of which the road haulage Executive is composed, has substantially disappeared its under-taking is unlikely to be disposed of at the price at which it was acquired.On the other hand&apos;, the units will be going concerns and purchasers canrightly be expected to pay for the opportunity to trade which the units will carry with them.The Railways11. The present excessive centralisation of the railways will be reducedby giving greater autonomy to areas which may follow the general pattern of the present regions.   Scotland will be a separate area.   The areas willtogether continue to constitute a single entity for financial purposes and forthe control of charges.12. The existence of these separate areas should encourage a healthyrivalry between them, and give greater scope for initiative than is possible under a single centralised administration.13. It is not intended that the area organisation should be set out indetail in the Bill.   It will be dealt with in a Scheme which the commission will be required to submit to the Minister of Transport for his approval.14. The Commission will be given greater latitude in their chargesschemes so as to improve the ability of the railways to compete with other forms of transport and will also be empowered within prescribed limits to make immediate increases in charges subject to subsequent approval bythe Transport Tribunal.Levy on Road Transport15. Under these proposals the finances of the Commission will be affectedby any loss arising out of the disposal of the Road Haulage Executive&apos;undertaking and also by any transfer of traffic to road from rail which theexpansion of road haulage may entail and which cannot be offset by compensatingeconomies in railway operation, including the closing down of redundantcapacity.   It is necessary to make good to the Commission the deficiencieswhich might otherwise necessarily arise from these two causes.   This it isproposed to do by means of a levy on road goods vehicles, including those of&apos;Clicensees.   &apos;C licensed vehicles form a substantial part of the transport system and their owners would be in a privileged position if hauliers were subject to a levy from which they were exempt.   The levy would not, however,extend to small local delivery vans holding &apos;C&quot;licences.16. The initial annual amount of the levy, which will be specified in theBill, will be  3 millions. &apos; This figure has necessarily been fixed arbitrarilybecause the factors which will later determine it will only begin to become operative when the Bill has become law.   In view of the large number of
vehicles concerned its incidence will not be heavy.   The levy will be adjusted at intervals, of say 3 years, by the Minister of Transport afterconsultation with the Transport Tribunal.   It will be confined to the purposesstated above and will not be called upon for other purposes such as to make good deficiencies in railway revenues due to a recession in trade or to any failure on the part of the railways to effect reasonable economies,17. When the amount of any loss arising out of the disposal of the road haulage Executive&apos;s undertaking is known, one element in the levy will be definitely ascertainable, and the period for amortising this loss can be adjusted to minimise the extent of any change in the levyj   The remainingelement in the levy can increase only so far as road attracts traffic from rail.The levy can thus never constitute an excessive burden upon road transport.18. The scheme-making powers of the Commission in regard to road passenger transport and harbours will be repealed.19. The Governments proposals in regard to road passenger transport are limited to repealing the scheme-making powers of the Commission.They intend, however, to take an early opportunity of reviewing, in the lightof present day conditions, the working of the licensing system for publicservice vehicles set up under the Road Traffic Act, 1930.Conclusion20. Such, in broad outline, are the main proposals which the government intend to embody in a Bill to amend the Transport Act.   Other matters of less importance such as bringing the Commission^ goods vehicles within the licensing system set up by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, will also beincluded.   The general effect of these proposals will be to re-establish ameasure of competition between road and rail in the long-distance field.This will encourage efficiency in both.   The railways will be protected by means of the levy from losses of revenue which are due to increasedroad competition and cannot be met by economies in operation.   Tradeand industry will get a better service, and the distribution of traffic between road and rail will be determined by the advantage which each has to offer to the trader.   This in the opinion of the Government should lead to betterand cheaper transport than could possibly result from the &quot;integration&quot;contemplated by the Transport Act, which in any case would have tended to subordinate the needs of the trader to a plan, rather than to adapt transport to his needs.
