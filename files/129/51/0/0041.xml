secret _^-1-1 /*-\r-- CABINET office.(52) 141 RECORD COPY copy no. ??3rd may, 1952cabinetGERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSUMMARY AND recommendations we are approaching the final stage in the negotiations on the german financial contribution to defence, the results of which are to be incorporated in a Convention under the General Agreement with the Federal Republic andin the European Defence Community (E. D. C.) Treaty.   The result of these negotiations will have most serious consequences for us in the defence field,the character of which is described later in this memorandum.2. On the most favourable hypothesis, we might hope to continue to receive from within the available total German defence contribution the whole of thelocal costs of our forces in Germany at least until June, 1953.   On the leastfavourable hypothesis, this expenditure will cease to be covered from a datesome months earlier.   In any case, it is clear that from a date which cannotbe very much later than mid-1953 we must expect a rapidly decliningproportion of our costs in Germany to be covered from German sources.These costs amount to about  130 millions a year in foreign currency.3. The action I recommend, apart from that already in train in regardto the long-term implications of this financial problem for our future defence programme, is:-(a) We should send a message to the United States Government on thelines suggested in Annex A.   This might take the form of a message from me toMr. Acheson.   Our position could also be explained to General Eisenhowerwhen he visits London about 16th May.(b) We should do everything possible to avoid a cut in the allocation fromthe German financial contribution to defence for the period to 30th June, 1953,which implies a reduction in the amount available for the United Kingdom forcesbelow their estimates.   If necessary, we should accept that in the first place theallocation to the Allied forces should be firm only up to 31st March, 1953.INTRODUCTION4. In my previous memoranda on this subject (C. (52) 36 and C. (52) 106)I warned my colleagues of the dangerous position developing in the discussions on the division of the total German financial contribution to defence.   Thenegotiations in regard to the arrangements in the first year must be concluded in time for signature of the E.D. C. Treaty and of the Contract about 20th May.I must therefore be in a position to reach final decisions with my United Statesand French colleagues and with the German Federal Chancellor at latest bythe middle of May.   These decisions, which will relate to the short-term, willhave important long-term implications.&apos;    .  : &quot;I&quot;
5. I attach at Annex B a memorandum setting out the stage now reached in these discussions so far as the first year 1952-3 is concerned.There are still many unknown factors in the situation.   But, on the currentassumption that the contract with Germany and the Treaty come into effectabout 1st October, 1952, it will be very difficult to reach agreement that even in the first period (i. e. the NATO year ending on 30th June, 1953)the agreed total German financial contribution to defence of DM 850 millions amonth will be enough to meet the present total estimated requirements of theAllied forces and the cost of building up the German contingents.   No figurescan be given going far beyond the middle of 1953, but it is clear that the rateof expenditure on the German contingents will then be rising rapidly.   Eventhough the amount of the total German contribution is raised in the NATOfinancial year 1953-4, little if any of this total will be left for the Allied forcesif the full requirements of the German forces are to be met.THE LONG-TERM PROBLEM6. We are thus faced with the fact that from mid-1953 or thereabouts we .shall lose up to  130 millions a year as a result of German rearmament.Moreover, the loss is in foreign currency.It was, of course, clear from the start that as expenditure on their forces rose the Germans could contribute less to the support of Allied forces.All that recent negotiations have disclosed is the rate at which the payments for Allied support are likely to dwindle away.7. In C. (52) 36 I suggested that in order to avoid this additional burden,there was a choice of one or more of three courses of action open to us -military redeployment, cutting further the local costs of our forces in Germanywhile maintaining their strength, or seeking additional United States aid.There is the additional possibility mentioned in my earlier memorandum(C. (51) 15) of a substantially smaller German defence contribution to theE.D.C. or a slower build-up of the German contingents.MILITARY REDEPLOYMENT8. Any redeployment of forces elsewhere in the world would not enable us to meet increased expenditure in Germany, which would have to be throughthe European Payments Union (E.P.U.).   There are very strong strategic andpolitical objections to making a large reduction in the level of our forces inGermany, so long as there is no real reduction of tension with the soviet union and no major change in the present situation in Europe.   Any such reduction would add most seriously to the difficulties of our European policy.This depends upon the confidence of the Western European nations and of theUnited States in our readiness and ability to play our full part in the defenceof the West.   It also depends upon maintaining and increasing our strength inorder to deter the Soviet Union from dangerous courses.   The present NATOdefence plans as approved at Lisbon assume an increase in our own strength on the Continent as well as the new German defence contribution.   If wewere to pull out or substantially reduce our forces the chances of securing thecontinued co-operation of the Federal Republic with us and the other Westernnations, the continued progress of Western European integration, and Franco-German reconciliation, would be greatly weakened.   Any public suggestionthat we were even contemplating a substantial withdrawal of forces,particularly at this time when we are being asked to repeat our undertakings to maintain forces in Europe, and when Soviet Russia has launched a newdiplomatic offensive in regard to Germany, would be bound to call in question our determination in carrying out our declared policy.   The consequences wouldbe grave and might be disastrous.
9. From the military point of view, the withdrawal of Britishformations from Germany would mean a failure to fulfil our commitments to NATO and would involve a grave strategic risk.   It should be noted too thatthe withdrawal of our forces to the extent to which their local costs cannot bemet from German sources, while it would remove balance of payments difficulties would not, unless corresponding reductions were made elsewhere,mitigate to any extent the increased financial burden on the United Kingdombudget, since the cost of maintaining forces here would be roughly equivalentto that of maintaining them in Germany.   In the economic circumstances &quot;inwhich we find ourselves, and bearing in mind the economies we are already being forced to make, the need to find an additional sum, which would amountto a substantial part of  130 millions in 1953-4 and the whole of it in 1954-5 ,from within the total likely to be available, would clearly imply the most drasticreductions in the size of our forces throughout the world and possibly majormodifications in present strategic plans.   In concrete terms, a sum of this size would represent the cost of some ZOO,000 men.   The danger thatwe might have to make such a reduction will clearly be a major factor in the review of our future defence programme which the Minister of Defence and theother Ministers concerned already have in hand.ADDITIONAL, ECONOMIES IN GERMANY10. Every effort will, of course, be made to secure further economies,but it must be realised that no significant contribution can be made from this source to solve our long-term problem.A SMALLER GERMAN DEFENCE CONTRIBUTION OR A SLOWER BUILD-UPOF THE GERMAN CONTINGENTS11. This is clearly an attractive alternative to a cut in our own forces.But there are the following strong objections:-(i)  It was to secure a German contribution on the planned scale that theE.D.C. was launched and the other participating countries agreedto sacrifice control over their national forces;  if such a contribution is to be reduced the Benelux countries in particular might considerthe sacrifice not worth making.(ii)  The present NATO defence programme, as approved at Lisbon, assumesthe availability of the equivalent of 12 German Divisions withaccompanying Air Forces being available by 1954.(iii)  The United States Government would be most unwilling to accept a voluntary limitation in Germany&apos;s effective defence contributionwhile American troops are stationed in Germany.(iv)  The Germans themselves, once they have taken the plunge, will insist upon strengthening the defences of their exposed front-line position.They will never agree to provide money for Allied contingents, once they are in a position to devote their whole defence budget to theirown forces.It seems likely, in fact, that practical difficulties will in themselves cause a slowing down of the German build-up, and,to the extent that this happens, it mayease our financial problem.   It must be remembered, however, that expenditureon the German contingents will be part of the common financial arrangements of the E. D. C., which will no doubt seek to retain any financial savings which result from this cause.
12. It may be seen from the above that we may be forced to contemplatenot only withdrawing part and eventually the whole of our forces fromGermany but also making a serious overall reduction of our forces throughoutthe &apos;World,   In theory, the serious military and political consequences of this situation could be avoided if we were to receive additional United States aid to compensate us for taking on the additional burden in Germany.   As the UnitedStates Governments proposals for the total amount of aid in 1952-3 havealready been presented to Congress and can hardly be changed now exceptin a downwards direction, any increase in United States aid could only take effect in subsequent years.   Moreover, the conditions which Congress imposes on thereceipt of aid make it increasingly difficult for us to take advantage of suchaid as is offered.   And even if the United States Government were to give uslong-term assurances on this subject, we could have no certainty that theywould be able to carry them out.   In fact, they are in no position to give anyconcrete assurances, and it would be folly for us to lay our plans on theassumption that additional aid would be forthcoming.13. I am forced to the conclusion that in the long-term, there is no way in which we can count on avoiding this additional balance of payments burden,on the assumption that our present military plans are maintained.   On theother hand, I am bound to recognise the impossibility of adding to our balanceof payments difficulties.   Hence the importance of the review of these plansreferred to in paragraph 9 above j but we should, I feel, be deceiving ourselvesif were to assume that anything less than a radical changing of these planswould enable us to avoid this aggravation of our balance of payments problem.SHORT-TERM PROBLEM14. Quite apart from the serious long-term problem referred to above,it will be necessary in the immediate future to settle, with the United Statesand French Governments and with the German Federal Government and theother members of the E.D.C., the division of the German total contribution to defence in the period between the date of entry into force of the Contract withGermany and the 30th June, 1953.   During this period an amount of DM 850millions a month will be available.   The Allied estimates on an annual basistotal DM 6. 8 milliard (about DM 570 millions a month), but the federal government, which is concerned both to leave sufficient for its own forces and to avoid the political embarrassment of giving a larger share to theAllied than to the German forces, has asked us to cut the Allied rate ofexpenditure to DM 4. 5 milliard a year.   Even more divergent estimates havebeen prepared by the German and Allied experts in the Paris Conference ofthe costs of the German contingents in the period in question.   Assuming thatthe Contract enters into force on 1st October, 1952, the Allied experts have estimated that DM 4. 2 millions would be needed in the period up to 30th June,1953, whereas the German estimates total DM 6. 3 millions, plus substantialadvances to industry for conversion to armaments production.   Even the lower figure of the Allied estimates represents not the minimum necessary to ensurethat the build-up of the German contingents is not delayed, but the cost of fullmilitary requirements in the period.   They take no account of the extent towhich it may not be possible to produce the necessary light equipment inGermany in the period or to carry out the proposed construction programme.In fact, it seems highly improbable that the provision for light equipment orconstruction could be spent in the first year.   Moreover, the estimate includes a substantial amount for heavy equipment which could not be produced in germany in the time, and may not even be available in the required quantities from theUnited States.   On the other hand, it will be politically very difficult to convince the Germans that they cannot spend the sums that they think they will need, andeven more so that they cannot spend the amounts estimated by the Allied experts.
15. Although, therefore, there are good grounds for believing that the costs of the German contingents will be considerably lower than the estimates andthat the total German contribution should be adequate to cover both Allied andGerman costs in the period to 30th June, 1953, I expect very great difficulty inobtaining German agreement to give us what we need.   Quite apart from thisquestion there are features in the proposed Contract with the Federal Republicwhich will be unpopular not only with the German Opposition and the public at large, but also with the coalition parties supporting the Federal Government.Division of the total German contribution to defence which gives the larger part to the Allied forces in the first year is, therefore, bound to arouse strong opposition, and I expect Dr. Adenauer to put up a hard fight.   The probabilityis, therefore, that in the final negotiations a serious squeeze not only on theGerman but also on the Allied figures will develop and, in order to get the contract signed we shall have to be prepared to accept the best figure for theAllied forces that we can get.   I have, therefore, considered whether there is any contribution that we can make to bridging the potential gap which would easeour task in these negotiations.   I have particularly in mind that Mr. Achesonhas never been satisfied that the Allied estimates have really been cut to themaximum possible extent.   When he came to London in February he proposedthat the Allied estimates should be cut by 10%, a proposal which I then resisted.Recommendations have recently been received from the special financialrepresentative in Germany (General Sir Sidney Kirkman) which suggest thatit might be possible to make some further savings on the DM expenditure of theUnited Kingdom forces.   I am informed that to a large extent these savings could only be made at the expense of additional sterling expenditure which wecannot accept, and that the remainder will be swallowed up in meeting additionalcharges which have arisen since the estimates were prepared.   If my colleaguesconfirm that this is the position it does not seem possible to agree to any cutbeing made in the estimates of the United Kingdom forces.   It might beconsidered desirable that the United States forces alone should take a largecut, but, since the United States will have to give assistance to the Germansby the provision of equipment, it seems very unlikely that they will beprepared to do so.   Moreover, if the Americans were ready to accept asubstantial cut in the allocation to their forces and the French were gettingtheir needs met within the E.D. C., our position in Germany as the onlyPower standing out for its requirements in full would be most uncomfortable,to the prejudice of Anglo-German relations and the position of our forcesin Germany.   I am afraid, therefore, that any suggestion that the total Alliedfigure of DM 6. 8 milliard a year should be cut would in practice imply thatwe should have to take our share, which would advance the date on which weshould not get all our Deutschemark requirements met from German sources.16. The best way in which we could make a decision on the division ofthe funds easier would be to agree that a firm allocation should be made onlyup to 31st March, 1953, the end not only of the United Kingdom but also of theGerman financial year, and leave the division of the funds in the subsequentquarter to be settled by a later agreement, to which the E.D. C. would also haveto be a party, at a time when we shall have a clearer idea of the rate at which expenditure on German forces is likely to take place.   This suggestion hasalready been recommended by the United Kingdom High Commissioner inGermany.WARNING TO THE UNITED STATES17. I consider that it is essential not to leave the United States government under any misapprehension whatever about our position either in the short- orthe long-term.   We know that they are inclined, in view of their own economic position and of their anxiety to see the maximum progress in the formation ofGerman units, to accept bigger estimates of German financial requirementsthan are justified, at the expense of the Allies.   I therefore propose that we
should send a message to the United States Government explaining the financial implications for us of the situation as it is developing in Germany and our inability to assume any consequential additions to our economic burdens asa result.   I attach at Annex A an indication of the lines which I suggest sucha message should take.18. We should not, I think, at this stage suggest to the Americans thatthey might give us additional direct aid to enable us to maintain our forcesin Germany.   They would probably be unable to give us any assurance of suchaid.   If they did give such an assurance past experience and their present political situation would make it highly unreliable and any action based upon it highly dangerous in consequence.   Accordingly, the message I propose wouldbe aimed rather at securing the maximum United States support in thecurrent negotiation while leaving us uncommitted for the future, and at openingtheir eyes to the seriousness of the long-term problem with which we are confronted.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.,3RD MAY, 1952.
OUTLINE OF PROPOSED MESSAGE TO THE UNITEDSTATES GOVERNMENT(a) Our economic position, and in particular the seriousbalance of payments situation with which, we are faced, iswell known to the United States Government0     We have throughout made it clear, in relation to the currentcontractual negotiations with Germany, that we should heunable to contemplate assuming any additional burdens as aresult of the situation in Germany.(b) As regards the long-term position, we are already, in preparation for the next NATO   Annual Review, reviewing thefuture of our rearmament programme, and, on general economic grounds, quite apart from the situation which is arising inGermany, we are being forced to contemplate a furtherprolongation of the period required for its completion.This situation will be greatly worsened if we have to bear the further burden of maintaining our forces in Germany.Prom the time when we can no longer expect to receive our full Deutschemark requirements from German sources, we shallhave to consider not only withdrawing some or all of these forces on balance of payments grounds but also making furthermajor modification to our whole defence programme in order tofind the necessary savings from within the total resourceswe expect to be able to devote to defence.(c) On the more immediate issue of the division of the total german defence contribution in the first year, we have considered the results of the recent examination in Parisof the estimated costs of German contingents.      These suggestthat even in the first year, the agreed total german contribution of DoM0850 million per month will be inadequate tomeet expenditure both on the Allied forces and on Germancontingents.     We are convinced that even the lower estimates of expenditure on the German contingents are higher than willbe found to he required in practice and that the allocation of a smaller amount would not in practice retard the build-upof German contingents on the assumption that minimum requirements of heavy equipment can be provided free from united States sources.      We have considered whether we ourselves can make any contribution to bridge the gap that,in theory, might arise in this first year.      We have cometo the conclusion that any marginal economies that can he made will he  swallowed up by increased expenditure resultingfrom the acceptance of new charges which were not includedin the Allied estimates.     We therefore consider that in the.period between the date of entry into force of the contract and 30th June, 1353, we should insist on obtaining an allocation from the German total contribution adequate tocover expenditure on Allied forces at the rate of D.M. 6.8milliard a&apos; year, the figure which was agreed upon betweenthe three Foreign Ministers in London last February.We hope that we shall have full American support in pressing the Federal Government and the other members of theEuropean Defence Community to accept this extent
GERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO DEFENCEDiscussions in Paris and Bonn on cost of German contingentsof the E.D.C. and of Allied forces in Germany,  in -period upto 30th June. 1953Costs of German Contingents1 .      The task of estimating the costs of German contingentswas undertaken by the Paris Conference on the European Army,with the assistance of British and United States experts.    the initial work of the Paris Conference was conducted on the assumptions based on the position which Mr. Harriman was understood to have taken up at the time of the Wise Men&apos;s review,that the heavy military equipment required for the Germancontingents would be supplied by the United States under the mutual Security Programme without charge to the Federal Republic.This would have covered the most expensive items of equipment,i.e.  tanks and heavy artillery, production of which in germany could not be effective during the first year and possibly longer,and military aircraft, production of which is not to be permitted in the Federal territory.    The United States representative inthe Costing discussions, however, recently stated in Paris andthe same point was made by the United States High Commissioner inBonn, that the Germans could not assume that the United states would be responsible for supplying all the heavy equipment andthat it could give no estimate of how much they could supply.They pointed out that the Federal Republic must apply for aid inthe same way as other countries and their application would beconsidered when Congress had made decisions on the total amountof aid available..    They made it clear that they expected as muchas possible of the heavy equipment  in the permitted categoriesto be manufactured in Germany.2.      There has been insufficient time for a full examination ofthe possibilities of German production of heavy military equipment and there remains uncertainty about how much of the balance ofsuch equipment could be provided from the United States, even if no financial difficulty were present.    The members of the paris conference have, however, attempted to make estimates of theamount and cost of the heavy equipment that would be required inthe first year.    Inquiries in regard to production possibilities in. Germany are proceeding.3.      The Paris Conference found it impossible to reach agreement among its members on the correct figures.    The dissenting view was that of the Germans who, in nearly all cases, estimated much higher figures than those considered to be adequate by the othermembers of the Conference, including the United States and united Kingdom observers.    The German representatives contend inparticular that because of the exposed position of the federal republic their new units would require a full complement of equipment as soon as they were formed, whereas the other membersof the Conference considered that training scales of equipment would be adequate in the initial period.    In the case both ofAllied and German estimates, figures have been given not only for the 12 months from the date of the coming into force of theE.D.C.  Treaty but also for. the first 9 months.    The latter aregiven because it is not expected that the E.D.C. Treaty will come into effect earlier than 1st October, 1952,-    this will leave 9 months of the N.A.T.O. financial year 1952-3 to run,and it is this period with which we have been concerned in
fixing the total German contribution to defence and in seeking to make initial arrangements for the costs of theAllied forces to be met.    It will be noted how quickly thefigures increase during the fourth quarter of the first year,an indication of the trend of costs in the second year, forwhich no estimates are yet available.Figures in DM milliards(DM 1 ma. s  85 million)g months12 monthsParis Conference estimates(not accepted by Germanmember)(a) All costs other thanheavy equipment(b) Heavy equipment2.k1 .8h.23.9TOTALSk.28.1German estimates(a) All costs other thanheavy equipment(b) Heavy equipment(c) Government advances toindustryL.3 7.72 5.u(?) 2.56.3 plus advance 15.6-to industryk.      It should be noted that the figures for heavy equipment in both estimates are for requirements only.    They are notbased on certainty that the equipment can be provided either from United States, German or other sources.    The figures aretherefore certainly too high, and there would seem to be astrong likelihood that what is required in the first year willbe provided free by the Americans.    On the other hand, theGerman estimate contains a figure of DM.2 milliard forGovernmental advances to privately owned industry includingthe steel industry.    There is no corresponding figure in theAllied estimate,  since most of the participants consider thatsuch expenditure would not under W.A.T.O. criteria rank as a defence expenditure.    On the other hand, it is understood thatthe Americans will probably press that some provision for this item should be made within the total German defence contribution in order to ensure that the German armaments industry is built up to make the bulk of the heavy equipment required by Germany.Such provision would to some extent counteract the reductionwhich would be made if the Americans agree that the heavy equipment figures need not be included in the present estimate.Allied Deutschemark Costs lj5.      The High Commission presented the Federal Government inBonn with estimates of the Deutschemark expenditure of theAllied Forces in a full year from the entry into force of thenew contractual relationship, totalling DM 6.8 milliard.
These estimates were discussed at meetings between the threeelements of the High Commission and the German Finance Ministerat which, so far as the British Zone was concerned, littlecriticism was made.    The German Finance Minister has, however,now circulated a memorandum in which he argues that the Alliedestimates have not &quot;been prepared according to the samestandards of economy as have been applied.to the German costestimates in Paris, and that total annual expenditure couldbe reduced to DM. 24.5 milliard.    He proposes that this shouldbe achieved by stricter standards of economy, &quot;better co-ordination with the German authorities and eliminating what are considered to be luxuries which are not appropriate in a defence programme.    Secondly, he proposes that certain itemsshould be struck completely out of the Allied DM budgets,notably, expenditure on the procurement of supplies in germany which he contends should be borne on the national budgets ofthe forces concerned, and expenditure on domestic servants inMesses,  clubs, and families&apos; accommodation which should beborne by the personnel who benefit.Summary of figures6. On the assumption that the Allied estimates of the costs of German contingents are accepted but that German criticisms of the Allied Defence Budgets are not; and on the assumptionthat the Contract with the Federal Republic and the E.D.C.Treaty come into force on the 1st October, 1952, the additionof the two claims on the total German Financial contribution in 1952-53 produces the following resultFigures in DM MilliardsExpenditure October1952 - June 1955Allied Costs 5.1German Costs (including Heavy Equipmentrequirements - 1.8) 4.039.13Total German Contribution at DM 850 million a month 7.65Gap 1.48If a corresponding calculation were made for a period of12 months from the date of the Contract, the gap would amountto DM. 4.7 milliard.    If the German estimates of the costs ofGerman contingents were accepted, the gap would be very much larger.8.      In the above table, the gap in the first 9 months issmaller than the figure given for heavy equipment.    If the americans can be assumed to be able and willing in practice to provide free such heavy equipment as1 is available, then the total of German costs according to the Allied estimates,could be reduced to DM.  2.23 milliard; j this figure mighthave to be increased in order to include some provision for thegovernment financing of the production?of armaments by private industry.    Thus, although the above estimate of the gap is almost certainly higher than it will prove in practice it cannot yet besaid that there will be no gap in the first 9 months. There will almost certainly be a gap in the first year even on the Alliedestimates.    On the German estimates, the gap will be considerableeven over 9 months.-h-
