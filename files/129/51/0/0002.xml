(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidnetial cabinet OFFICfe .RECORD COPY copy no,^3RD april 1952eCABINETT&apos;HE DATE OF THE CORONATIONV emorandum by the Home secretary i understand&quot;&apos; that the replies received from the other commonwealth prime Ministers to the Prime Minister&apos;s enquiry whether a date in May, 1953,would suit them for the Coronation show:-(i)  that a date in Mf y, 1953, would cause no difficulty to Australia^ NewZealand, Iniia, Pakistan and Ceylon;(ii)  that Canada wou Id agree to late May or early June if this would suitother Commonwealth Governments, although at this time theCanadian Pi rliament is normally in session;(iii) that as regards   outh Africa, Dr. Malan feels that the date should befixed in the light of the wishes of the majority.2. I ought to bring to the notice of my colleagues a number of points which they will wish tc have in mind before coming to a decision as to the period from which the Queen should be invited to select a date for Her MajestyTsCoronation.(i)  In 1948 the date of municipal elections in England and Wales was altered.Next year Thursday, 7th May, will be the date of election.   The annualmeeting at which the mayor is elected and committees are appointedwill be on 18th May or such later date up to and including 25th May,as the Council may decide; therefore the earliest date on which mayorsmay be made next year is Monday, 18th May.The Notice of Election of councillors will be 14th April;  the latestdate for delivery of nomination papers will be 21st April, and oldcouncillors will go out of office and new councillors come into office on 11th May.Town council elections in Scotland will be held next year on tuesday, 5th May, and the statutory meeting on 8th May:  until that meeting it is not known in many cases who will be provost or who willhold office as magistrates.It is customary for mayors and provosts to be invited to the coronation.   Until 18th or, at latest 25th, May, in England and Walesit will not be known who will be mayors during the ensuing year.   InScotland the provost for the ensuing year will not be known until8th May.   It would, I feel, be inappropriate to hold the Coronation on a date while the elections are in progress or until it is definitely knownwho will be elected the Chief Civic Dignitary for the ensuing year inthe cities and boroughs in England and Wales and towns in Scotland.-1-
2-(ii)  The British Industries Fair is, I am informed, fixed for the period27th April to 8th May next year.   I under stand its duration could be slightly shortened, but it would be extremely difficult to openit on an earlier date.(iii) A decision is required before Easter on the question whether or not theRotary International is to be held in London or in Paris.   Thisbiennial conference is fixed for 24th-28th May, 19530   I understandthat the British Travel and Holidays Association attach importance tothis convention being held in London as it will attract visitors ata time when they normally do not come here, and that the hotelswould require a certain overlap with the period of the Coronation ifit were held here in order to fit themselves for Coronation visitors.If the Coronation were to take place between 11th May and 11th Juneit would not be possible to hold the Rotary International in thiscountry.(iv)  The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will open on 19th May,1953.(v)  The Queen&apos;s birthday will normally be officially celebrated On 3rd June,when the ceremony of Trooping the Colour will take place on the horse Guards Parade, involving frequent rehearsals by the brigade of Guards in May and the erection of stands.(vi)  I am informed that the provisional date for the Epsom meeting, which includes the Derby, next year is 2nd-5th June: no doubt this could be altered.if necessary.(vii)  The Ministry of Works require at least a year in order to discharge theirnumerous responsibilities.   They would have liked a date early inMay because, inter alia, the trees are not then fully in leaf to inter-fere with the view of processions and there is less danger of a clash with other ceremonial occasions.(viii)  In 1953 Whit-Monday falls on 25th May.   It is customary for CoronationDay to be declared a Bank Holiday.   I understand that any attempt to fix Coronation Day on an existing Bank Holiday would cut acrosswage agreements and create difficulties with the trade unjoas.I am advised that there would be less interference with productionif the Coronation Bank Holiday were to follow immediately after a statutory Bank Holiday, but this would cause dislocation of transport to such an extent that I do not think it can be contemplated.(ix) All Departments want a period of a year, if possible, from the date ofthe Coronation Council at which the Proclamation setting up the Courtof Claims and fixing the date of the Coronation is approved by the queen, to complete their arrangements.Summary3. I suggest,therefore,(i)  that no date in April later than the 14th is practicable because of the local elections in England and Wales and the British Industries Fair;(ii) that there are objections to any date in May earlier than the 26th, becauseof local elections in England and Wales and in Scotland and theGeneral Assembly of the Church of Scotland;
(iii) that the day after Whit-Monday would be inconvenient and any otherworking day that week except Friday would aggravate interferencewith production;(iv) that any date before 14th April is too early for the ceremony   and any dateafter Saturday, 6th June, is too late, because of interference withother functions and because the hotels will, after that date be unableto cope with ordinary tourist traffic;(v)  our conclusion should be to recommend that the period from which thedate of the Coronation should be chosen should run from29th May to 6th June.D.M. F.Home Office, S. W. 1. ,3RD APRIL, 1952.
