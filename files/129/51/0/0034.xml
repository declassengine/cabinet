(this document is the property of her britannic ma jest y&apos;s government)secret CABINET office record COPY Lc.(52) 134 copy no.28th APRIL, 1952CABINETTHE EXCESS:.: PROFITS LEVYMemorandum, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Federation of British Industries has objected strongly to theimposition of the Excess Profits Levy and they have criticised it on anumber of points.   Representations have also been made by the Association of,British Chambers of Commerce, the National Union of Manufacturers,the Institute of Chartered Accountants and a number of other bodies and individuals.   I have also received representations from some of my colleagues and desperate distress signals from members of our Party.2.    We must go forward with this tax.   It was an Election promise and itforms an integral part of my Budget proposals.Nevertheless, I am anxious that any just claim should be met.   This will mean a number of concessions which will reduce the net yield in a full year(that is, after allowing for the reduction proposed in the rates of Profits Tax)below the  100 millions originally estimated.   There would be little effect this year as the Levy in general is not payable until next year.3.    Two possible courses of action are summarised in the Appendix to this paper under the titles Plan A and Plan B.   Plan A involves concessions whichreduce the net yield to about  70 millions in a full year;   Plan B involves more substantial concessions on the Excess Profits Levy, but recovers part of thecost by giving smaller Profits Tax reliefs than I originally proposed, andreduces the net yield to about  80 millions.4.     On the whole I favour Plan A as involving a less radical departure fromthe basic principles of the Levy as I proposed them in my Budget Speech -particularly as regards the exclusion of 1950 from the standard;  but if we take this course, we should also incorporate the proposals (from Plan B) toincrease the percentage allowed on new capital and undistributed profits to12% (with the corresponding increases in the allowances for mines and oilwells and borrowed money), and to increase the distributed, rate of Profits Taxto 20%.   The effect of this would be to leave a net yield of about  70 millions,below which we cannot afford to go if the new tax is to retain its essential features and to serve the purpose for which it was intended.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.28th APRIL, 1952.
APPENDIXPLAN AThe standard years   The trader would be permitted to base his standardon the average of the profits of any two of the three years 1947, 1948 and 1949,instead of being compelled in all cases to take the average of the threeyears, i. e. he would be allowed to take the average of 1947 and  1948, or theaverage of 1948 and. 1949, or the average of 1947 and 1949.   This would meetmany of the criticisms about the rigidity of the standard, and would permit the exclusion of 1947 where that was a bad year.Malaya and the Far East    I promised special consideration to companies operating in Malaya and other territories occupied by the Japanese, and Iwould propose that they should be allowed to take as their standard theaverage of the profits of the two years 1949 and 1950.Alternative standard based on net assets. I propose that a furtheralternative standard should be provided which the company can take where itwas making no profits or only small profits in the standard period.   This newalternative would be eight per cent of the net assets of the business valued(at the trader&apos;s option) either at the beginning of the standard period or atthe beginning of the period of charge.   Subsequent additions to the profits,whether in the form of undistributed profits or new capital, would qualify for the ten per cent allowance as in the case of other businesses.   This should meet the criticisms which have been made of the existing alternative standards and fulfil the undertaking I gave on Second Reading.The minimum standard    I propose that the minimum standard should beincreased from  2,000 to  5,000.   This will mean that where there is onefull time working director, the effective starting point of liability, allowing for the director&apos;s remuneration, will be  7,500 and where there are two  9,000.This will cut out about one-third of all companies from the charge.Allowance for increased output of metal minesSomething must be done to help metal producers who in the national interest increase their output over that of the standard period as this increasein output represents the anticipation of a future profit.   I propose, therefore,that the normal  rate of profit on the additional output should be exempted fromthe Excess Profits Levy.   This is a much more generous relief than wasgiven during the last war when the relief was restricted to a percentage (varying from thirty per cent down to five per cent) of the normal profit on the additionaloutput.   It has been suggested that we should relieve from the tax the wholeof the profit on the additional output, but there&apos;-, is no case whatever for relievingany excess profit made on additional output.   The relief I suggest is both just and generous. \Borrowed money  Under the present proposals the interest payable onborrowed money will be allowed as a deduction in computing profits, but thecompany will be given no allowance over and above this.   It has been represented to me that borrowed money ought to be treated as &quot;capital&quot;, i. e. it wouldqualify for an allowance of ten per cent but no deduction would be given forthe interest paid.   In view of the great advantage which borrowed moneyenjoys under the existing Profits. Tax (an advantage which has ledto undesirabledevelopments in company finance), I am not prepared to go as far as this.I propose, however, that in addition to the allowance of the interest paid,
borrowed money should qualify for an additional allowance of three per cent.This would mean that where the rate of interest was five per cent borrowed money would, in effect, qualify at eight per cent against the ten per centgiven on share capital.   Having regard to the Profits Tax advantage borrowed money enjoys this is fair treatment.PLAN BThe standard years   Under Plan B the trader would be permitted to base his standard on the average of the three years 1948, 1949 and 1950 if hepreferred this to the averageof the years .1947, 1948 and 194?.   The inclusionof 1950 would meet many cases of real hardship which could be met in no other wayMalaya and the Far East    Companies operating in Malaya and other territories occupied by the Japanese would be entitled, as under Plan A, to base their standard on the average of the two years 1949 and 1950.Alternative standard based on net assets    As under Plan A.The minimum standard    As under Plan A.Allowance for increased output of metal mines    As under Plan A.Increased allowance on profits ploughed back into the business and on new capital.   The ten per cent allowance proposed on new capital would leave little margin over and above the dividend which would have to be paid on the new capital and the Profits Tax on it.   It would be desirable to increasethe figure to twelve per cent.   A corresponding increase should be made onprofits ploughed back into the business, as the company which finances its capital development in this way should not be placed at a disadvantage compared withthe company which raised its new capital on the market.   The additionalallowances of two per cent and four per cent given on metal mines and oilwells should similarly be raised to three per cent and six per cent.Unless more generous allowances are given on new capital there is a real danger that new development will be impeded.Borrowed money    An allowance would be given on the lines suggestedin Plan A, but the percentage would be four per cent instead of three per cent to correspond with the increased percentage proposed on share capital.Profits Tax    The rate of Profits Tax on dividends would be put atZZJr% compared with the 17j% I proposed in the Budget.   The 22f% is still lessthan the existing rate which is equivalent to about 25%.
