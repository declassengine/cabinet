secret.(52) 1147TH APRIL, 1952THE NAME OF &quot;WINDSOR&quot;Memorandum by the Lord chancellor on the 27th February the Cabinet considered the draft of a Proclamationconcerning the name of the Royal House and of the Queen&apos;s descendants, and invited me in consultation with certain of my colleagues to examine the drafting of the Proclamation and to report our conclusions to the Prime Minister(C.C.(52) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 3).   This we did, but, as it subsequentlyappeared that the same object could be achieved more simply by means of aDeclaration in Council than by a Proclamation, I prepared a draft declaration in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary and the Minister ofHealth.   The draft as amended by Her Majesty is annexed (Annex I).   A noticewould, if Her Majesty approves, be published in the Gazette after the meetingof the Privy Council at which Her Majesty is pleased to make it.I take this opportunity of placing on   record, after consultation with mycolleagues, the reasons which have led us to the conclusion that such a declaration should be made as will ensure that the name of the Royal House and Family isnot changed, and that the surname of Windsor is borne by Her Majesty&apos;sdescendants.1. There are two distinct questions involved:  the first is as to the name ofthe Royal House:  the second is as to the surname which certain of thedescendants of the Queen shall bear.   These questions are of constitutionalimportance and it is the duty of Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers to form an opinionupon them and advise Her Majesty accordingly.2. In the consideration of these problems the Proclamation made by king george V on the 17th July, 1917 (Annex II) and the Letters Patent issued by Himon the 30th November, 1917 (Annex III) are of decisive importance, and I doubt whether any useful guidance can be obtained from precedent or analogy in this or any European country.3. The Proclamation of 1917 declared first that the King*s House and Familyshould be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, and second(a quite separate thing) that the descendants of Queen Victoria &quot;who are subjects of these Realms, other than female descendants who may marry or may havemarried&quot; should bear the surname of Windsor.   The Proclamation also renouncedon behalf of the King and his descendants and all other descendants of QueenVictoria, who were &quot;subjects of these Realms&quot;, all German titles.The Letters Patent of the 30th November, 1917 (which amended letters patent issued by Queen Victoria on the 30th January, 1864) provided that the title of Royal Highness with the dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to theirChristian names should be borne by the children and the children of sons of anySovereign and by the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, but should not (except as therein mentioned) be borne by any other descendant ofany Sovereign.CABIMET office record copy copy NO. tnCABINET
4. The action of King George V in renouncing the German titles of His familyand in limiting the number of persons entitled to the style of Royal Highness wasl^idely acclaimed at that time when we were at war with Germany.   Later, when&quot;the passions of war had subsided, it was also generally regarded as havingbeen an act of wise statesmanship which had confirmed and increased the prestige of the monarchy.5, The Proclamation of the 17th July, 1917, and the Letters Patent of the30th November, 1917, must be read together to determine their effect upon thetwo questions at issue, the surname of the Queen&apos;s descendants and the name ofthe Royal House.The Surname(a) Persons entitled to the style of Royal Highness and the prefix of Princebefore their Christian names do not possess surnames.   Hereditary surnames,which were in origin usually nicknames or patronymics, only became commonin this country and elsewhefe in Europe about the 13th century.   Royal Families,continuing the ancient practice of styling themselves by territorial names, did notacquire surnames.   Thus neither &quot;Wettin&quot; nor &quot;Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot; was thesurname of the children of Queen Victoria.&quot;   These were not surnames, andthey, having titles, possessed no surname.   So also, in an earlier generation,when the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex married outside the Royal Marriage Act,it became necessary to invent the surnames of FitzGeorge and D&apos;Estefor their progeny.   It may be said that members of two of our Royal Housespossessed surnames, and it is true that the Tudor and Stuart dynasties are known by those names, which were the surnames of their founders;  but, as I havealready said, such precedents can be of little value today.(b) The Letters Patent of 1917 in limiting the number of persons who may beentitled to the style of &quot;H.R.H. Prince X&quot; (for whom, as I have said, a surnameis unnecessary) made it essential to provide a surname for those of the royal family who in the future, by reason of the Letters Patent, would not be entitledto that style.   Accordingly the Proclamation of 1917 provided that that surnameshould be Windsor.(c) Thus Her Majesty the Queen, being within the Letters Patent of 1917,has never had a surname because from birth She has had a title.(d) But, though Her Majesty, being within the Letters Patent of 1917, did not need a surname, the position of Her children was different.   As soon as her majesty came to the Throne, Her children would come within the same letters patent as &quot;children of any Sovereign of these Realms&quot;;  but, if they should beborn before She came to the Throne, they would not come within it.   Accordinglyon the 22nd October, 1948, shortly after Her marriage to the Duke of Edinburgh,King George VI issued Letters Patent (Annex IV) by which He declared that thechildren of that marriage should enjoy the style of Royal Highness and thetitular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names in additionto any other titles of honour which might belong to them thereafter.   Thusfrom their birth Prince Charles and Princess Anne came within these letters patent and neither had nor needed any surname.   And, as I have pointed out, assoon as Her Majesty came to the Throne, they came within the Letters Patent of1917 as will any other children of the marriage.   The Letters Patent of 1948served a temporary purpose and will have no further operation.(e) It follows from what I have said (i) that the question of a surname doesnot arise in relation to the children or children of sons of the Queen or to theeldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, for they have, or will have,the style and title of Prince or Princess and Royal Highness:   (ii) that thechildren of daughters of the Queen, being outside the Letters Patent, will nothave such style and title and will take their father&apos;s name, as did the children ofthe Princess Royal;  and (iii) that the sons of grandsons of the Queen (other-2-
than the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) will not be withinthe Proclamation or the Letters Patent of 1917 and, if they have a surname at all,will have the surname of Mountbatten.(f)     I do not think that it can be questioned that it was the intention of king George V and was within the spirit and purpose of His Proclamation thatthe descendants of a Sovereign of these Realms should within certain limits bear the name of Windsor;  but (perhaps because He did not contemplate His grand-daughter coming to the Throne) the Proclamation did not give full effect to his intention.   The result will be that, unless Her Majesty makes the appropriateProclamation or Declaration, Her great-grandchildren who need surnames willnot bear the name of Windsor but that of Mountbatten.Name of the Royal House(a) The Proclamation of 1917 must be read and interpreted in the light of conditions prevailing in the twentieth century in this country.   It may well have been the practice in the past that the name of a Royal House was changedif an heiress married a member of another Royal House, although sometimesthe names of the Houses were combined in much the same way as their coats-of-arms.   These matters of high policy have no relevance to the consideration ofthe present problems.(b) It cannot be doubted that by His Proclamation of 1917 King George Vintended that, so long as there was a member of His House to ascend the throne, the name of the House should be Windsor.   It is true that he did not expressly provide that that should be so if a female descendant of His came tothe Throne;  but on the other hand He did not provide to the contrary.   Femaledescendants who may marry are not excluded in this part of the Proclamationas they are in the later part which deals with the surname.Nor can it be questioned what was the wish of King George VI.   Itmay be assumed that He expected to be succeeded by a daughter, but it is certainthat it was His wish that the name of the Royal House should in that eventcontinue to be Windsor.   When he conferred a dukedom upon H. R.H. the Duke of edinburgh he did not intend that the name of Edinburgh should supersede that of Windsor as the name of the Royal House.The Queen ascended the Throne as a member of the House of Windsor.It has not been suggested that She ceases to be of that House on Her marriage.Doubts have been expressed about the position of Her children and these shouldbe removed.(c) Permanence and continuity are valuable factors in the maintenance of a constitutional monarchy and the name of the Royal House should not be changed ifchange can be avoided.   It was probably considerations such as these that led,in the Netherlands, to the continuance by Royal Decree of the name of Orange-Nassau as the name of the Dutch Royal House, although the succession has inrecent times passed twice in the female line.(d) Above all it is certain that, in confirming what was clearly the intentionof Her father and grandfather, Her Majesty the Queen would be acting inaccordance with the sentiments and desires of all Her peoples.   Nothing couldshake their loyalty and devotion to the Queen and this is personal to Her Majesty;but behind it lies their grateful memory of Her father and grandfather whoimmeasurably strengthened the institution of monarchy and have given to the nameof Windsor a significance that should not be lost.SIMONDSLord Chancellor&apos;s Office, S.W.1. ,7TH APRIL, 1952.
