K0O4th APRIL, 1952.CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPERelations between officials and members of the Consultative Assembly.Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The growing activities of the Council of Europe make it necessaryto consider how far officials in the service of individual governments or ofinternational organisations should have business dealings with members ofthe Consultative Assembly.   The following is a statement of the present position,for the information of my colleagues.2.       We have hitherto maintained that officials (our own and others1,national and international) ought not to have direct contact with members of theAssembly.   Our attempts to carry out this policy have, however, met with only indifferent success since other Governments do not share our scruples.Indeed, it is a common practice in Continental countries for civil servants toattend meetings of parliamentary committees.3.       It has consequently become difficult for us to insist, in.an international organisation, on the application of what are almost exclusively British practices.This axoplies particularly in the case of the Liaison Committee of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) and the Councilof Europe, a body of officials which, from time to time, invites representativesof the Assembly to attend its meetings for the discussion of particular subjects.4.      Although it would have been desirable to secure, where practicable, theacceptance of principles  which have been found beneficial in this country, thecontinued application of them at Strasbourg can only lead us into furtherdifficulties.5.       I have therefore agreed:(a) that no obstacles should be placed in the way of contact betweeninternational officials and Parliamentarians;  and(b) that the United Kingdom member of the Liaison Committeeshould be permitted to attend meetings at which Parliamentariansare present to take part in discussion at such meetings, and,while refusing to enter into discussions relating to the policyof hewart  Majesty&apos;s Government, to deal with reasonable requests for information on their merits.The Treasury support both these decisions.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,4th APRIL, 1952.
