i5 *&quot;&quot;*DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL CABINET  OFFlCfcRECORD COPY ^C.(52) 127 COPY NO. Sip17TH APRIL, 1952CABINETGENERAL CERTIFICATE OF EDUCATION:  AGE LIMITMemorandum by the Minister of EducationMy Departments present Regulations forbid the entry of candidatesunder 16 for the examination for the General Certificate of Education (which washeld for the first time in 1951, in place of the old School Certificate and HigherSchool Certificate examination).2, This restriction was imposed by the late Government on the advice of the secondary School Examinations Council, a body on which universities, localeducation authorities and the schools are represented.   Its main purpose was toprotect the schools and their pupils from being influenced unduly by examinationrequirements and to preserve examination standards.3. The age limit has been much criticised, chiefly for holding back thebright boy;   and in &quot;Britain Strong and Free&quot; we undertook to &quot;review the certificate regulations which hold back the talented pupil&quot;.4. On taking office I deferred a decision on the matter because the secondary School Examinations Council themselves undertook to review the wholearrangements for the examination.5. The Council have now submitted an unanimous report.   Their main proposals are:-(a) to retain the general principle of an age limit of sixteen;   but(b) to give the Heads of schools full discretion to enter pupils for the examination under the age of sixteen if they are convinced that it iseducationally sound for such pupils to be examined at the time proposed and that the pupils are fully up to the standard required.6. These proposals seem sensible to me.   They would permit suitablecandidates to enter for the examination irrespective of age, but would excludeimmature and ill-qualified pupils under sixteen.   They would place the responsibilityfor a decision about any particular pupil where it should belong, with the schools.7. I propose, therefore, to accept the CounciPs recommendations.A suitable opportunity to announce my decision will be in reply to theParliamentary Question which Mr. Erroll has put down for Thursday, 24th April.I would then publish the report, which is quite a short document, and circulate mydecision to schools and local education authorities.F.H.Ministry of Education, W. 1. ,17TH APRIL, 1952.
