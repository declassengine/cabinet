TOP SECRET Copy No.c (52) m CABINET OFFICb9TH APRIL, 1952 RECORD COPYCABINETTHE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS position memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer think it will be convenient that I should tell my colleagues howmatters stand before we adjourn for the Easter Recess.The Background of the ProblemIT. The United States has shown a persistent tendency to earn a balanceof payments surplus, and the rest of the world a dollar shortage.   The main reasons are probably:(a) United States commercial policy has discouraged importsof   manufactured goods, and manufacturers in othercountries have been unable or unwilling to get any real hold in american markets or to compete effectively with America inthird markets.(b) Non-dollar primary producing countries have not been able to expand their output enough to enable non-dollar manufacturingcountries to get along without large imports from north america.(c) Political factors have made it necessary to keep down the levelof East-West trade, which would otherwise have increased thesupply of primary products.(d) Recently these problems have been increased by re-armament,which has reduced the supply of exports available from non-dollar countries.   Added to this is the failure of ourselves and of western Europe to produce enough coal.3. In face of this persistent tendency for the United States to be insurplus, non-dollar countries have discriminated against her, have kepttheir currencies inconvertible and have developed mutual credit systems,i. e. the Sterling Area.and the European Payments Union, (E.P.U.).   These actionshave kept up the level of trade and employment in the non-dollar world.4, In spite of these measures, the United States has had a heavysurplus during the last six years, which has been financed by aid.   Aid is nowmuch less.   Our gold reserves and those of some other countries are falling.This loss of reserves, past and prospective, threatens the whole position of sterling and with it our ability to carry out our national and international policies.Prospects of Gold Reserves5. The latest forecasts of our position are as follows:-(a)  Quarter to 31st March, 1952. The losses from the reserves inthese three months were $299 millions, $266 millions and $71 millionsThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................
respectively, making $636 millions for the quarter.   The reserves stood at$1,700 millions on 31st March.   The improvement in March was due partly to an improvement in the E.P.U. position, partly to post-Budget sentiment and,as to $75 millions, to certain special non-recurrent receipts.(b) Quarter to 30th June, 1952.     The deficit in this quarter is estimatedat about $375 millions (after the receipt of $100 millions from U.S. aid).The confidence factor is very uncertain:   it might continue favourable, orthe knowledge that the drain on the gold reserves was continuing might give it an unfavourable turn.   In addition there are great uncertainties aboutprices, the expenditure of other sterling area countries etc.   All theseuncertainties might well involve $150 millions either way.   Hence the reservesat 30th June may be $1,325 4- 150 millions.(c) Half-year to 31st December, 1952    There must obviously be a greatmargin of error in any estimates of the position so far ahead.   After assuming the receipt of $300 millions from U.S. aid, and providing in full for the payments due on the American and Canadian loans in December 1952, the deficitis very tentatively put at $375 millions, with a margin of error of/250 either way.On this basis the gold reserves at 31st December 1952 would be $950 i&apos; 400 millions,6.      On the above figures we shall obviously continue throughout 1952 in a mostprecarious position.   There are many possibilities, apart from confidence,which could plunge us into a worse crisis:  e. g. a failure of U.S, aid, a further fall in the prices of sterling area commodities, a crisis in E.P.U., a change inthe U.S. business situation.   The effects of confidence, or lack of it, abroad areunpredictable since we cannot say what view foreigners will take of the adequacy of our reserves against the risks ahead.   Moreover, our position may well beweaker in 1953 than in 1952.7.     The next stepsIt is clear therefore that the Budget and the concerted Commonwealthaction, while they may have saved us from going over the rapids,-have not solved ourproblems.   We cannot afford to let matters drift while the reserves dwindle;and we must decide what course we mean to adopt to regain control.   Fortunately,however, the improvement in our position gives us a little more time than we had previously expected to study the main alternatives.8. Study of the courses open to us continues in the Treasury, in consultationwith the representatives of the Departments mainly concerned.   This is an interim report, and I do not propose to submit recommendations to my colleaguesuntil later.9. I am, however, satisfied that it would be a mistake to make any further approach to the Sterling Area countries until we are in a position to put before them a comprehensive scheme for dealing with the crisis.   But a statement is being prepared to show how large a proportion of the sterling area balance isin fact already tied up.   Publication of such a statement should help to allayanxiety as to the extent of sterling sight liabilities.lO.        I would like to warn my colleagues against the risk of thinking that our balance of payments difficulties and our external financial policy can be treated as though they were in a separate compartment, isolated from our internal financialand economy policy, and that we can allow ourselves all sorts of indulgences andfancies in the internal field without doing any harm to the Balance of Payments
^position.   It is probably true to say that nothing in the administration ofthe Socialist Governments since the war was more disastrous than the failure to grasp this simple truth.   I shall therefore continue to be importunatein pressing my colleagues to keep the Balance of Payments continually in their minds.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.9th APRIL, 1952.
