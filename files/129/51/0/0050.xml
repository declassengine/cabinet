secret cabinet office.(52) 150 RECORD COPY copy no.6TH may, 1952CABINETSITUATION IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with reference to the two papers on Germany (C. (52) 141 and 144) whichthe Cabinet are taking on 7th May, I circulate for the information of my colleaguesa note which our High Commissioner in Germany has written, at my request,about the present situation in Germany.2. It is clear that the situation must cause us some anxiety.   My own view,however, is that despite this set-back, we shall still win through to the signature of the contractual agreements, though there may be some delay.3, Admittedly, there are many who want this effort to fail:   Soviet Russia and her satellites and stooges, many in France - who have asked for the european defence Community and are now not sure that they want it and anyhow disliketaking a decision on any subject - and the Deft Wing of the Socialist Party here.Against this, if we and the Americans persevere, as we must, the final outcomeshould be as we wish, but it may be necessary to make one or two concessions to Adenauer, upon which Kirkpatrick will advise me when he returns.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,6TH MAY, 1952.annex note BY THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER IN germany during the last week the situation in Germany has notably deteriorated andit is now by no means certain that the Chancellor will be able to sign the Contracts.Apart from certain technical, constitutional problems which have recentlyarisen, two factors are responsible.First, the Ministry of Finance has become aware of the total financial implications of the Contracts, viz. the financial obligations Of Germany to pay:-(1)  a contribution to our forces;(2) financial aid to Berlin;(3) restitution to the Jev/s;(4) compensation for the owners of sequestrated German assets abroad;
(5)  occupation damage claims;(6)  non-recognised occupation costs;and, in addition, the obligation to forego revenue through:-(1) total exemption of the forces from all customs duties and taxation;(Z)  exemption of U.N. firms and U. N. nationals from the Equalisation ofBurden Tax for six years.The second factor is the disquiet of the Chancellor^ own CoalitionParties at the treaty as a whole.   They overlook the advantages which willaccrue to Germany and see only the total sum of discrimination, servitudes and obligations imposed on Germany, viz:-(1)  the maintenance by the Allies of certain sovereign rights;(2)  the right of the Allies to suspend the German Constitution in an emergency -a right which the Allies do not enjoy in their own country;(3) the retention of Allied legislation on deconcentration of German industry;(4) the extension to the Anglo-American troops of privileges to a degree notenjoyed by foreign troops in any other NATO country;(5) the provision of special facilities for the future Allied Embassies;(6)  the continued incarceration of German war criminals;(7)  the financial burdens and obligations listed above;(8)  the limitations on the German armament industry which may place theGerman army in a situation of technical inferiority;(9) the reservation of the Allied right to claim further reparations at a peace treaty except for reparations out of current production;(10) the acquiescence of the Federal Government in the sequestration ofGerman assets abroad.The attitude of the Coalition Parties is that the sum total of these provisions denies to Germany an equal place in the Western community of nations and that in the circumstances the Chancellor should not agree to sign.If the Allies decline to pay any regard whatever to the views of the Parties,they may well decline to allow the Chancellor to sign.   On the other hand, theyhave an interest in not bringing about the collapse of the chancellor^ own policy and they may prove content if the Chancellor can assure them that somethinghas been done on the Allied side to meet their wishes.   In the contrary event,however, their opposition to the treaty is likely to stiffen.
