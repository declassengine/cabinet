Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1952.SECRET CABINET O F r IC b \ - Copy No^ gRECORD copy . (52) 1385th May, 1952CABINETRUBBER EXPORTS TO THE SOVIET BLOC, CHINA AND NORTH KOREAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of trade on 18th March the Cabinet discussed a memorandum (C. (52) 79) on rubberexports for Russia for the first half of this year, and invited the President of theBoard of Trade to submit later in the year further proposals about shipmentsfor the latter half of 1952 (C.C. (52) 31st Conclusion, Minute 2). Since then theUnited States Government have sent us a memorandum about our future policy towards rubber exports to the Soviet Bloc to which we must reply, and it hasbecome desirable in connexion with our arrangements for importing grain and timber to notify the Russians of our intentions about rubber shipments in thesecond half of this year. We accordingly circulate the present paper containing a comprehensive review of the situation, and invite our colleagues to approve therecommendations in paragraph 25. The paper has been prepared by officials of the Departments concerned and approved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Ministers of Defence and food and the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and Commonwealth Relations.background. There has been a complete embargo on exports of rubber from the UnitedKingdom and the Colonies to China since May 1951 following on a resolution of the United Nations. There is of course also an embargo on exports to north korea.   We propose that these embargoes should continue under present conditions.3. Trade with the Soviet Bloc (i.e., Russia and the East European satellites)is of considerable importance to us. Trade with Russia is particularly important as a means of obtaining supplies, especially coarse grains and timber, essentialto our economic life and therefore to our defence effort. Rubber is by far the most valuable of the exports which enable us to pay for those imports and since thebeginning of 1951 the Russians have insisted On including in our grain and timbercontracts clauses (the so-called &quot;rubber clauses&quot;) giving them the right to ceaseor reduce deliveries if they are unable to spend the proceeds on rubber. AlthouthRussia has a substantial synthetic rubber industry, natural rubber is the one rawmaterial for which the Soviet Bloc is dependent on outside supplies and the lackof natural rubber for certain purposes would hamper Russia in a war. Tradewith the other satellites is also of economic or financial importance to us. from some we obtain near-essentials (like eggs and bacon from Poland) and from czechoslovakia we are obtaining debt payments, the continuance of which certainlydepends on satisfactory trading arrangements.4, Since April 1951 we have restricted exports of rubber from the UnitedKingdom and the Colonies to the Soviet Bloc to amounts which we consideradequate for normal consumption (the &quot; security quota&quot;). For 1951 quotas,were fixed at 80,000 tons for Russia and 35,000 tons for the satellites. We actuallylicensed 74,000 tons for export to Russia, of which only 56,000 tons could be shipped before the end of the year owing to shipping difficulties. Total Russianimports from all sources in 1951 were 63,000 tons compared with 82,500 tons in1950 and 105,000 tons in 1949.   Total satellite imports for the last three years.42222B
have been approximately 50,000, 40,000 and 30,000 tons respectively, the declinein 1951 being due largely to satellite misunderstanding of the operation of Malayanlicensing controls and consequent failure to buy their requirements.5. For the first half of 1.952 licences have been issued for 46,000 tons(C.C. (52) 29th Conclusions, Minute 3, and 31st Conclusions, Minute 2) and therewere in addition licences for 18,000 tons outstanding unused from 1951. TheRussians will therefore be in a position to ship 64,000 tons of rubber in the first half of 1952. Of this, 49,000 tons were shipped in the first quarter. We know that the Russians have bought 12,500 tons of rubber which will be available for ship-ment in the second quarter in excess of licences issued (and which we have told themwe cannot license) and a further 5,000 tons for shipment in the third quarter;they are still buying small quantities. There are therefore already commitmentsby Russia which will call for licences for over 17,000 tons in the third quarter.The Board of Trade have been under pressure from the Russians over the lastmonth or two to increase the rate of licensing.6. There has been an informal exchange of views with American officials on a memorandum about rubber exports to the Soviet Bloc presented by theAmerican Embassy on 3rd April. Under the Battle Act, which makes the grantof United States military or economic aid conditional on the receiving countryrestricting its trade with the Soviet Bloc to the extent required by the UnitedStates on security grounds (C. (52) 1), the Americans are required to discuss with us limitation of supplies of rubber to the Soviet Bloc and these informal exchangesshould discharge that obligation.   The Americans suggested the following points-(a) that the embargo on exports to China and North Korea should becontinued;(b) that our exports to the Soviet Bloc should be limited to amounts necessaryto obtain essential imports not obtainable elsewhere; this would involvein particular a reduction in exports to the satellites;(c) that the receipt from all sources of rubber by the Soviet Bloc in 1952 should in any case not exceed the 1951 levels;(d) that we should discuss with them after the forthcoming meeting of the rubber Study Group in Ottawa whether there would be any purpose in seeking the co-operation of Indonesia and Ceylon to control shipments of rubber to the Soviet Bloc and China.7.   The discussions with American officials were friendly and our officials, indealing with (b) in paragraph 6, explained that we had to assess the balance ofadvantage between economic and security considerations.   Our aim would be to limit exports to the security quota but whether this would be possible would depend,particularly in the case of Russia, on the demands of the Soviet Bloc and our needfor essential supplies from them. The Americans recognised this and accepted thatwe must be the judges of where the balance of advantage lay. It was also explained to the Americans that restriction of exports or rubber to Russia to anything belowthe security quota would amount to economic warfare and would be a policy whichwe have already rejected (C.C. (52) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1).   In dealing with(d) in paragraph 6 our officials also made it clear that it is a delicate matter for usto discuss with the Americans the attitude of a fellow member of the Common-wealth but that we will consider whether we can agree to discuss with them thedesirability of seeking the co-operation of Ceylon and Indonesia in the way pro-posed. While the Americans have emphasised their anxiety that we should reduceshipments of rubber to the Soviet Bloc they did not suggest that there is at presentviolent feeling on the subject in Washington.  It is, however, a potential source of trouble with both Congress and public opinion in the United States. The decisions which we now ask our colleagues to take about future exports of rubber will enable us to reply to the American memorandum. It has, however, been arranged that weshould not do so until a date to be agreed by them; it may be advantageous duringthe Congressional hearings on aid for Europe that they should be able to say thatthey are in discussion with us.Security Arguments .  ,8. The United Kingdom has its own strategic reasons for restricting tradewith Russia. Under present policy, and in concert with most ^other western countries, we prohibit the export to the Soviet Bloc of armaments, munitions and
industrial goods of key strategic significance, and we restrict the export of certain other industrial goods which, although essential for civilian use in peace, are also of considerable strategic importance. We regard natural rubber as being in thesecond of these categories and aim to restrict total imports of the Soviet Bloc tothe quantities needed currently for civilian consumption. The Soviet Bloc has no significant indigenous production of natural rubber and is therefore dependent onsynthetic production for rather more than two-thirds of its rubber supplies and on imports of natural rubber for the remainder. On technical grounds a proportionof natural rubber for, e.g., aircraft and vehicle tyres is important in war. In viewof the nature of the Russian economy there can be no certainty that restriction ofRussian imports of natural rubber to civilian requirements will prevent the military needs, including the stockpile, from being met. At best the restriction can only make it more difficult to meet military needs. The real test of the extent to which our policy is being successful is whether with the supplies available Russia is build-ing up a stockpile of natural rubber on a scale sufficient to make it easier for her to wage war. From the reports available to our intelligence authorities it is estimatedthat the Russians have from their imports in past years accumulated a stockpile ofupwards of 100,000 tons, but that our present policy of restriction of exports to theestimated civilian consumption is preventing Russia from adding significantly tostocks.9. It is impossible to make an accurate assessment of the quantity of naturalrubber used for civilian production within the Soviet Bloc, but a rough estimatecan be made by reference to their average imports over a number of years, theextent and type of their industrial capacity and output and estimates of stockpiles.On this basis, and having regard to the steady growth of normal industrial capacity in Russia, it is considered reasonable to assume that up to about 85,000 tons maybe consumed in civilian production in that country in 1952, and about 35,000 tonsin the satellites taken together. On that assumption the import of those quantitiescould be freely permitted without the risk of a material build-up of war stocks orof military production.10. On past experience it seems likely that during 1952 Russia will obtainabout 10,000 tons, and the satellites about 10,000 tons between them, from countries other than the United Kingdom and the Colonies. From a purely security stand-point, therefore, the appropriate export quotas from the United Kingdom and theColonies for the current year would be 75,000 tons to Russia and 25,000 tons tothe satellites.World Production and Consumption11. Estimates of the production and consumption of rubber in the next fewyears are uncertain, and are subject to wide divergences of opinion. One view isthat there is likely in this period to be a surplus of production, especially of thelower grades; this would lead to a sharp fall in prices particularly of natural rubber.This situation might well be precipitated by the conclusion of the United Statesstockpile purchases, which is expected in 1953. The other view of market pros-pects is that a surplus is unlikely to occur, given a reasonable possibility of competi-tion between natural and synthetic rubber in the United States and given the disturbances in South-East Asia, which will themselves limit production.12. If it is correct that there will be a surplus from next year, there will bea serious danger to political stability in South-East Asia, and especially in Malaya,where the lower grades, demand for which is most likely to be affected, are mainlyproduced by smallholders. So long as we restrict the market for rubber by pro-prohibiting exports to China and North Korea and by refusing on security grounds to allow the Soviet Bloc to buy all they could use, the result of further cuts in suchshipments as are allowed.is likely to be a sharp fall in the-market price for naturalrubber and one which is likely to be accentuated by the time its effects reach thesmallholder. Since the smallholders and their dependents in Malaya form 20 percent, of the population, the effect of a further fall in the market price thereforemight have extremely serious political consequences under present conditions. Itwould certainly make very difficult the task of the local Government in maintainingcontrol of shipments to Communist countries. Similar considerations hold goodin the case of Indonesia, where the major part of production is by peasant small-holders, who are already finding it difficult to make a livelihood out of rubber pro-duction.  If the result of further cuts in shipments is to depress South-East Asia42222
to such a pitch as to increase the unrest which already exists there, we may havedefeated our own strategic object.13. A substantial fall in the price of rubber might therefore increase politicaldisturbance in South-East Asia, and for this reason, as well as for balance ofpayments considerations, it would justify a review of the level of our shipments.Similarly, any significant increase in exports of rubber to the Soviet Bloc by Indo-nesia, which would require us to reduce our own exports if the security quota wasto be observed, might jeopardise our essential supplies from the Soviet Bloc,notably Russia, and so justify a review of policy.Economic Case14. In the year 1952-53 our purchases of timber from Russia, which are now made by private importers, will be lower than usual because we shall be running down stocks of softwood, but in deciding on a policy towards Russia for the futurewe must take account of a more normal year. In such a year we might buy atthe very least 100,000 standards of softwood, which at present prices would cost 9 million. If we lose Russia as a source for this timber our bargaining position vis-a-vis Finland and Sweden will be greatly weakened and the price of timberwill rise against us to such an extent as might force us to forgo timber on balanceof payments grounds.15. In 1951-52 We bought a million tons of grain from Russia, 800,000 tonsof coarse grain which we wanted and 200,000 tons of wheat without which theRussians would not let us have the coarse grain. We hope to make further contracts of at least the same magnitude in 1952-53 and the future. The results of our failing to do so would be extremely serious since the only alternative source of supply for the coarse grain would be North America and we could not possibly providedollars for the purchase. Even if we could find the dollars we could not replace the whole 800,000 tons of coarse grain from North America on grounds of bothsupply and transport. The result of our failing to get substantial quantities of coarse grain from Russia for 1952-53 would therefore be a big fall in animal feeding-stuffs. It would inevitably lead to a considerable loss of home agricultural production, especially pig meat. The cost of a million tons of grain from.russian 1952-53 and the future may be of the order of  35 to  40 million.16. Russia&apos;s sterling balances are at present about  10 million and we cannot expect her to hold much more than this. She seems likely to earn between  40 and 50 million for timber and grain plus, perhaps another  10 million for other essential imports. The big items in the list of Russian purchases from the sterling area arerubber, wool, cocoa, jute and cotton. It is very difficult, because of the fluctuatingprices, to judge how much of her sterling Russia might spend on imports otherthan rubber, but it is unlikely to be more than  20 million. Russia will no doubtpay some sterling to, and receive some from, third countries. But it would seem that we shall need to allow Russia to spend  30 million on rubber. At present prices this would be about 100,000 tons i.e., 25,000 tons more than the securitylimit of 75,000 tons mentioned in paragraph 10. If the price falls below its present level, the quantity would be correspondingly increased.17. The London Rubber Market which has been re-established since the war,is important and contributes to our invisible earnings. An essential feature of a commodity market, which necessarily deals for forward delivery, is the maximum possible freedom from interference by licensing procedure since it is impossible fortraders to enter into contracts for forward delivery if there is a risk of frustrationthrough the withholding of export licences. We have arranged with the RubberTrade Association that they will in future try to prevent their members from makingcontracts with the Russians in excess of licences we are prepared to issue. This willrequire the limits proposed to be notified to the Association and to the Russiansabout six months in advance of shipment from the United Kingdom.Ceylon and Indonesia        ......:     , .18. Security considerations suggest that imports of rubber from all sourcesby the Soviet Bloc should be limited to a certain figure. There is at present no limit on the amount of rubber which may be sent to the Soviet Bloc by either Ceylonor Indonesia, i Although Ceylon sent about 6,000 tons of Rubber to China in 1951,her only exports to the Soviet Bloc were 660 tons to Poland. Indonesia is thought to have exported about 19,000 tons to the Soviet Bloc in 1951.  If these countries
increase their exports of rubber to the Soviet Bloc we might have.to reconsider, as suggested in paragraph 13, the limit imposed on our own trade. ; -Present Position19. It is now necessary to tell the Russians what licences will be issued forthe third quarter and we cannot long delay saying something about the fourthquarter if we are to ensure that they do not over-buy. Excluding the carry-forward from 1951 of 18,000 tons for which licences were issued in that year, the russians have already had licences for 46,000 tons of rubber this year. It may be that thecoarse grain negotiations will lead to the Russians demanding more rubber thanthey have had in the past, and we doubt whether they will agree to accept less. Wehave not much hope that we shall be able to avoid full discussion with the Russiansduring the grain negotiations about the quantity of rubber we are to let them have,but if we can, as we have always done in the past, avoid writing into the grain and timber contracts the precise amounts of strategic goods which are to be sent toRussia it would be to &quot;our advantage, and might well involve sending less to Russiathan would otherwise be the case. If we declare the third-quarter quota now andrefuse to say anything about the fourth quarter until the grain negotiations, thereis little hope of avoiding linking so many tons of grain with so many tons of rubber.20. In these circumstances it seems tactically unwise to attempt to reducethe figure of 80,000 tons to which delivery was limited in 1951 to the 75,000 tons which the strategic arguments now lead us to think is all that can be justified for1952. Moreover, the quotas are in no sense internationally agreed quotas of exports. The American view is that the present scale of rubber exports to theSoviet Bloc should be substantially reduced and that no sales should be permittedbeyond those necessary to obtain essential imports: on the other hand, no quotalimitation of rubber exports to the Soviet Bloc has yet been agreed or considered bythe other Western countries participating in security controls on East-West trade.21. We would, therefore, propose that we should tell the Russians that, asthey have had 46,000 tons of rubber licensed this year, there remain 34,000 tons for the second half of the year, and that they may have licences for this as theylike, although not for more than 20,000 tons in the third quarter. We believe thatthis will give us the best chance of getting a satisfactory negotiation with theRussians later and that it can be justified to the Americans as being in our judgmentthe way to handle matters which will lead to the smallest quantity of rubber goingto Russia.22. As for the satellites, we propose that we should reduce the quantity of rubber which we are prepared to licence for them to the level of 25,000 tons, asbeing our share of the security quota of 35,000 tons.23. There is another point which the Russians may welt introduce into the grain negotiations; they have, in fact, already raised it informally with the Boardof Trade. Rubber is a commodity bought and sold in international markets whereprices fluctuate and a buyer could reasonably expect to be free to buy when themarket situation suited him. Thus there would be force in a Russian claim thatthey should be free to buy (and ship) their quota during the year as they choose.But there is, from our point of view, strong objection to this course. If the Russiansshipped in the early part of any year a large part of their quota for the year we might, in order to get our essential supplies, find that we had to give Russia inthe second half of the year larger quantities than we had proposed. We do not propose that we should reach any decision on this question until it is raised in negotiation by the Russians, but it is difficult both politically (vis-a-vis the americans) and from the security aspect. It should, therefore, be considered by our colleagues at that time.Conclusions24.   This paper leads to the following conclusions:   .(i) Under present conditions Her Majesty&apos;s Government should maintain their present embargo on shipments of rubber to North Korea and china. This should be reviewed on any change in conditions(e.g., a truce or armistice in Korea or a general change&quot;of policy towardsChina). &quot;
(ii) As regards supplies of rubber to the Soviet Bloc (i.e., Russia and the satellites), Her Majesty&apos;s Government should maintain their present policy, i.e., that it is for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to decide wherethe balance of advantage lies between security and economic considerations.(iii) From the security point of view it is desirable that supplies of rubberfrom all sources to the Soviet Bloc (i.e., Russia and the satellites) shouldnot exceed the estimates of civil consumption within the Bloc. Broaderconsiderations (see paragraphs 12 and 13) may justify some relaxation.(iv) In any calendar year the best possible estimates should be made of thelevel of supplies from other sources; these estimates should stand forthe whole of the year. When these quantities have been deducted fromthe quotas fixed, export licences for the balance may be issued.Instead Of determining during any one quarter the extent to whichlicences may be issued in the succeeding quarter, it will in future benecessary to fix the figure for two quarters ahead.(v) The Russians should now be told that for the second half of 1952 weshall restrict the issue of export licences for rubber to Russia to34,000 tons, of which not mOre than 20,000 tons will be licensed in thethird quarter.(vi) Export licences for the satellites for the year 1952 should be limited to25,000 tons.(vii) These quantities should be reviewed as necessary and in particular if either . . .v.. *(a) Negotiations show that it would be necessary to sell larger quantitiesof rubber if we are to obtain essential supplies; or(b) it is necessary for economic or political reasons.Recommendations25.   We recommend to our colleagues that (i) They should accept the conclusions in paragraph 24.(ii) We should be authorised to communicate this policy to the United StatesGovernment at a suitable time, in reply to their memorandum of3rd April (see paragraph 6 above), together with an indication that,although it is a delicate matter to discuss with them the attitude of afellow member of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty&apos;s Government willbe prepared, after the meeting in Ottawa of the Rubber Study Group,to discuss whether there would be any purpose in seeking the co-opera-tion Of Indonesia and Ceylon in controlling shipments of rubber to theSoviet Bloc, China and North Korea.A.
