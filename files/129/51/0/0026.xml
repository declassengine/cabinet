(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET--- CABINET office.(52) 1Z6 RECORD COPY copy no,15TH APRIL, 1952CABINETREPORT ON SUPER-PRIORITY FOR CERTAIN DEFENCE PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyWhen the Cabinet approved the introduction of the Super-Priority procedure for certain defence production (C. 0. (52) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5), I was invited to report at intervals on the working of the scheme.2. The following action has been taken to give effect to the scheme:(i)  I have sent a letter to each of the firms holding main contracts forSuper-Priority work, asking them to give the highest priority to these contracts, at the same time stressing the importance of interfering as little as possible with exports.   A copy of this letter is attached.(The Admiralty have written a similar letter to their main contractors),(ii)  The suppliers of raw materials have been asked to ensure that orders forSuper-Priority work are met promptly.(iii)  Particulars of the scheme were announced and explained at a press conference on 26th March.(iv) All the Trade Associations whose members might be engaged on Super-Priority sub-contract work have been told of the scheme and their co-operation in its execution has been sought.(v) A list of main contractors on Super-Priority work has been sent to theMinistry of Labour so that Employment Exchanges will know which firms are entitled to ask for special assistance in finding labour.3. Contractors have been warned against abuse of the scheme and arrange-ments have been made to carry out spot checks on the use being made of Super-Priority.4. The introduction of the scheme has been generally welcomed by industry,and we can, I am sure, rely on their co-operation in making it a success.5. Since most of the types of equipment to which Super-Priority applies arestill in the development stage, it is not possible as yet to forecast the extent towhich the scheme will accelerate production.6. I shall continue from time to time to report progress.D.S.Ministry of Supply, W. C. 2.,15TH APRIL, 1952.
i 0Ministry of Supply,Strand, W.C.2.26th March, 1952.priority for Certain Defence Contracts1. I have to inform you that, as announced recently by the Prime Minister inthe.House of Commons, the Government have decided that the national safety requires that the delivery of certain types of aircraft and other vitally needed weapons andequipment should be accelerated to the greatest possible extent.   Super-Priorityis accordingly being given to all contracts relating to this work.2. The contracts held by you to which this Super-Priority applies are set outin the attached schedule. In order to identify them, the word &quot;Super-Priority&quot; shouldbe added to the contract numbers.3. In the employment of the resources available to you (labour, materials,machine tools and factory capacity) you are asked to give to these contracts Super-Priority over all other work of any kind whatsoever.   It is, however, particularly important to interfere as little as possible with export work, although if necessaryeven this must give way.4. In any new orders you may place for materials or components requiredfor these contracts, you should prefix the full contract number with the word &quot;Supers-Priority&quot; (e.g. Super-Priority/6/Engines /0001), and you are authorised to make it acondition of such sub-contracts that the sub-contractor shall likewise accord priority to this work over all other work which does not enjoy similar Super-Priority,   you should also add the Super-Priority prefix to any unfulfilled orders which you havealready placed relating to such work and inform the sub-contractors concernedaccordingly,5. Sub-contractors who receive Super-Priority contracts are authorised topass on the Super-Priority prefix to their sub-contractors and suppliers on the same conditions,6. Nothing in this letter should be interpreted as authorising the acquisitionof controlled types of iron and steel other than in accordance with the Iron and SteelDistribution Order, 1951.   If you do not hold appropriate control authorisations under that Order, enabling you or your sub-contractors to acquire steel in the quantitiesand at the times required, you should report the matter (like any other difficultyexperienced in working the Super-Priority procedure) to the appropriate ProductionDirector or Regional Controller of this Ministry.7. The scheme is being explained concurrently to the various trade associations of suppliers of materials and components and their members are being asked to meet promptly and in full any requirements for contracts bearing theprefix &quot;Super-Priority&quot;.8. In any applications for additional labour which you or your sub-contractorsmay make to Employment Exchanges, you should be most careful to distinguish those required for Super-Priority contracts from others.9. If it is to be successful this scheme must be operated with the fullestsense of responsibility.   In particular, I rely on you and your sub-contractors toensure that orders placed for supplies for &quot;Super-Priority&quot; contracts are notduplicated, that they are strictly limited to the amount necessary for the particularSir,Super-Pi
contracts, and that delivery is not asked for earlier than is necessary.   Wherebulk orders are or have been placed, the use of the Super-Priority prefix must, ofcourse, be restricted to that part of the order which is required for Super-Priority contracts.10. In order that this Ministry may supervise the operation of the schemeand check abuses, you are asked to maintain a list of the sub-contractors andsuppliers whom you authorise to use the Super-Priority prefix, and to hold this list available for inspection by any authorised officer of this Ministry,Sub-contractors must also maintain similar lists.11. Copies of this letter are enclosed for you to send to your sub-contractors.   Additional copies, if required, can be obtained from the RegionalController of the Ministry of Supply in each area.12. I shall be glad if you will acknowledge receipt of this letter to theDirector of Contracts (C,B. ), Ministry of Supply, St, George&apos;s Court, NewOxford Street, London, W.C.1., and confirm that you are applying the Super-Priority procedure set out above to the contracts concerned.Yours faithfully,(Sgd)      DUNCAN SANDYSMinister of Supply. &apos;The Managing-Director.
