 . (52) 144 CABINET 0uav lac, RECORD CO5th MAY, 1952.CABINETCONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENT WITH THEGERMAN FEDERAL republic memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as my colleagues are aware, our present plans are laid on the basis that about the 21st May I should join the French and United States foreign ministers and Dr. Adenauer in signing the contractual settlement between theThree Western Powers and Germany.   More or less simultaneously, the six countries concerned will sign the Treaty establishing the European defence community (E.D.C.).    The present intention is that the E.D.C. Treaty will be signed in Paris and the German Contract in Bonn, although this has not yetbeen finally cleared with Mr. Acheson.   The Three Powers also intend tomake joint declarations reaffirming their guarantee of the security of Berlin(which unlike theGerman Federal Republic will not be covered by the new agreements) and expressing their &quot;abiding interest&quot; in the integrity of the E.D.C.In addition, the United Kingdom will apply to the E.D.C. as a whole, and on a reciprocal basis, its Brussels Treaty commitment to provide automatic military assistance in the event of an attack.   All these agreements will be subject to ratification by the Parliaments of the countries concerned.   They form a singlewhole and will not enter into force until ratification.2. I should warn rny colleagues that the above programme may be delayedor even disrupted altogether by last-minute doubts in the countries concerned,and more especially in Germany.   Dr. Adenauer&apos;s political situation is difficult,and has been made more difficult by the Soviet proposal for Four-Power talks.But these eleventh-hour difficulties were always to be expected.   Although theymay prove serious, I hope they can be overcome and it is on this assumption thatI am now requesting the approval of my colleagues for the contractual settlement as it stands.3. I have recently submitted to Parliament two White Papers (Cmd. 8492of March 1952 and Cmd. 8512 of April 1952) which deal with the german denfence contribution and the United Kingdom military commitment in relation to the E.D.C.,and also with the relationship between the latter and the North Atlantic treaty organisation,(N.A.T.O.).   I explained the general principles of the contractualsettlement in C. (52) 31.   The present memorandum summarizes the main provisions of the settlement that has been reached.   Further details are contained in the Annexes.4. The draft conventions are not yet all in final form.   This appliesespecially to the important convention dealing with Germany1 s financial contributioto defence, on which I am circulating a separate memorandum.   The final shape and general content of the contracts, provided the political situation in Germanydoes not call for any drastic last-minute modifications, are, however, clearlydiscernible and not now liable to substantial change.   The picture does not infact differ in any important aspect from that described in Annex II of my memorandum C.(52) 31.SECRET ^COPY NO.       ) L
5. &quot;The contractual arrangements&quot; as such will be embodied in sixinstruments:   a General Convention;   three related Conventions calledrespectively the Rights and Obligations Convention, the Financial convention and the Acts and Interests Convention;   and two Charters setting up an arbitration Tribunal and an Arbitral Commission.   These instruments will end the Occupation and bring about between the Federal Republic of Germany and theThree Western Powers a new relationship which, for all practical purposes, will bthat between sovereign states co-operating on a basis of equality and agreement and settling their differences by arbitration.   But the special position of theThree Powers in regard to Germany as a whole and in Berlin will be safeguarded.I attach at. Annex I the full titles of the six &quot;contracts&quot; and brief summaries of thepurpose of each.   The most important of these instruments is the general convention, which was agreed in Paris last November.   It was discussed in my memorandum C. (51)24.6. The accompanying instruments are of two kinds:   those annexed toand integral with one or other of the Conventions, and those which are separatedocuments but will be concluded at the same time.   The former are indicated inthe appropriate sections of Annex I;   the latter are listed with some explanatorynotes in Annex II.   I mention here only the four most important items covered.First, Security Controls for restricting armaments and aircraft manufacture and atomic energy development in Germany;   second, the preservation of certainAllied legislation to avoid weakening the  Western powers position vis-a-visPrussia;  third, the list of the treaties and international agreements entered intoby the Occupying Powers and now to be &quot;taken over1 by the Federal Republic;and fourth, instruments relating to Berlin .7. Lastly, there are the tripartite declarations, the latest texts of which appear in Annexes III and IV.   These are still subject to redrafting as thereis not yet full agreement between the Three Powers regarding their form and timing.   The main purpose of the Security Guarantee   is to provide, as it were,a shield behind which the German contingents can be built up to operational efficiency and so make easier the acceptance of the contracts and the E.D.C.Treaty by German public opinion and the Federal Parliament.   The main objectof the Declaration on the E.D.C. is to assure the French and warn the Germansagainst any attempt at secession.   It is now possible that it may now be agreedthat the E.D.C, declaration is an adequate substitute for the Security guarantee in respect of the Federal Republic.     The Security Guarantee would then be preserved only for Berlin, which is not of course within the Federal republic and is not therefore covered by the E.D.C. arrangements.8. Throughout the year-long negotiations, all Departments concernedin London have been kept informed of general progress and have been consulted on all points which affected them.   The War Office in particularhave been represented in the negotiations in Germany by observers from theBritish Army of the Rhine.   It has not of course been possible to secure alloptimum requirements.   But considering the complexity and unprecedentednature of the problems that had to be solved and the difficulty of reconciling the widely different viewpoints and procedures of the four nations taking part,the agreements now reaching completion seem to me to be satisfactory.   Whilesafeguarding the essential requirements of the British forces in Germanythey provide a fair basis for the development of a new partnership in western europe.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.5th MAY, 1952.
THE CONVENTIONS AND CHARTERS COMPRISING THE CONTRACTUALSETTLEMENTA. GENERAL CONVENTION ON RELATIONSBETWEEN THE THREE POWERS AND THEFEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.1. This Convention, which was agreed at Paris in November 1951by the Three Foreign Ministers and the German Federal Chancellor, hasalready been seen by the Cabinet.   It establishes in broad outline the changes which are to transform the occupation regime into the contractual relationship.It makes effective the related Conventions and establishes the arbitration tribunal.2. Its chief provisions include:-(i) an Article by which the Three Powers retain their rightsrelating to(a)  the stationing of armed forces in Germany and theprotection of their security;(b)&apos; Berlin;(c)   Germany as a whole, including the unification of Germanyand the peace settlement;  and(ii) an Article by which the Three Powers may proclaim astate of emergency if the security of the forces is endangeredby an attack on the territory of the Federal Republic ofGermany, orby subversion of the liberal-democratic basic order, or-    by a serious disturbance of public order, orby a grave threat of any of these events, and the federal republic and the European Defence Community are unableto deal with the situation.3. It will also publicly bind the Federal Republic to conduct its policy in accordance with the democratic and international procedures to whichthe free world is committed.4. There will be annexed to it:-(a) .an undertaking by the Federal Republic to continuematerial aid to Berlin;  and(b) the Charter of the Arbitration Tribunal (see Section E below).5. The full text as agreed subject to final editing, was annexed to memorandum to the Cabinet No. C. (52) 31 of 8th February.
B. CONVENTION CONCERNING THE RIGHTSAND OBLIGATIONS OF FOREIGN forces and THEIR MEMBERS IN THE federal republic OF GERMANY.1. So far as the United Kingdom and United States forces in Germany-are concerned, this has the same sort of objects as the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) Status Agreement, but because such large forces are stationed in a forward area it obliges Germany to give awaymore rights and preferential treatment than the N.A.T.O. countries areprepared to concede to one another.   It details the legal status of individual members of the forces and their dependants, and enumerates the rights and obligations of the forces as a whole and the measures to be taken to safeguardtheir security.   It will regulate in all their aspects, except those aspectsconcerned with finance (for which see Section C below), such matters ascivil and criminal jurisdiction;   co-operation in intelligence activities;the procurement of accommodation, goods and services;   requisitioningstax exemptions, special postal facilities and other such privileges;the provision of labour, including the use of the German Service Organisation;and all the other various and detailed matters falling under the general heading of logistical support.2. Annexed to this convention will be:-(i) a list defining those offences against the security of theforces which are not offences at present under Germandomestic law but will become so by this means upon Germanratification of the contracts;(ii) an agreement on the use of radio frequencies;  and(iii) (possibly) a list of the organisations (such as N.A.A.F.I.)to be &quot;assimilated&quot; to the forces for purposes of logisticalsupport.3. In addition, -&quot;&quot;here will be a minute of understanding, which forobvious reasons will remain unpublished, specifying the arrangements forco-operation in intelligence activities, particularly the Allies1 powers to investigate and interrogate security suspects.CONVENTION ON THE ECONOMIC ANDFINANCIAL PARTICIPATION OF THEFEDERAL REPUBLIC IN WESTERNDEFENCEThis has as its objects:-(1)   To confirm the agreement reached with the federal chancellor in February that in the year ending 30th June1953, the Federal Government would provide DM 850 millions a month to cover the costs of Allied forces stationed inGermany and its contribution to the E.D.C,
(2)   To lay down the division of this sum between theGerman and Allied forces.(3)   To bind the Federal Republic to make a continuingcontribution to Western defence comparable to that madeby the other principal Western co countries and, within this contribution, to assist in meeting the Deutschmarkcosts of the forces of non-E.D,C. powers stationed inGermany..(4)    To lay down that in future years the amount provided from the German contribution for the support of the forcesof non-E,D.C. powers will be determined by negotiations between those powers, the E.D.C. and the federal government.(5)    To arrange that the German payments towards the costof forces in Germany will transit the budget of theE.D.C. without being under the control of the latter.(6)     To regulate various financial details of logisticalsupport for the Allied forces.The very important implications of this convention are discussed ina separate Memorandum to the Cabinet No. C.(52) 141.D. CONVENTION ON ACTS AND CERTAININTERESTS OF THE THREE POWERSAND THE TRANSFER OF CERTAINRESPONSIBILITIES TO THE federal republic OF GERMANY1. This convention will consist of twelve Chapters dealing with separatesubjects.   Its general purpose is to arrange for the winding up or the continuationunder German control of certain of the &quot;programmes&quot; put in hand by the occupying Powers as part of their post-war policy for a defeated Germany.2. Its first Chapter - General Provisions - deals with the validity of rights and obligations created by acts of the Occupation authorities or under international agreements;   the general principles applicable to Occupationlegislation;  non-discrimination against persons who have co-operated withthe Allies;  the phasing out of Occupation courts and the carrying out of the criminal sentences imposed by them.   This Chapter will also contain theprovisions for the future handling of war criminals.3. The rest of the Chapters are of a very technical nature.   The followinglist of their titles will illustrate their scope:-
Deconcentration and Decartelisation (of Industry)Internal Restitution (of identifiable property of Nazivictims);Annex:   Charter of the Supreme Restitution Court.Compensation for Victims of Nazi Persecution.External Restitution  (of property looted from occupied territories).Annex:  Document regarding Establishment and functioning of Federal Administrative Agency.ReparationDisplaced Persons and RefugeesClaims against Germany   (transitional provisions related to settlement of German external debt).Certain Claims against Foreign Nations and Nationals(waiver of claims by Germans).Foreign Interests in GermanyAnnex:  Document regarding Establishment andFunctioning of Federal Administrative Agency.Eleven    Facilities for^the Embassies and Consulates of the three powers in the Federal Republic.Twelve     Civil AviationE.    CHARTER OF THE ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL1. This will appear as an annex to the General Convention (see section A above).2. The Tribunal will consist of three Allied, three German and three&quot;neutral&quot; members.   The British member is to be Lord Justice Somervell,OBE.3. The Tribunal will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes arisingout of the operation of the contractual agreements, except disputes involving the rights referred to in Article II of the General Convention (see Section a paragraph 2(i) above) or other matters specifically excluded by the terms ofthe Conventions themselves.   It will also be empowered to give advisoryopinions and will probably exercise supervisory jurisdiction over otherarbitral or co-ordinating bodies set up under the Conventions.Chapter Two&quot; Three&quot; Four&quot; &apos;  Five&quot; Six&quot; Seven&quot; Eight&quot; Nine&quot; Ten
F.CHARTER OF THE ARBITRAL. COMMISSIONON PROPERTY, RIGHTS AND INTERESTS INGERMANY.1.    The Commission will decide disputes arising out of Chapters Four(External Restitution) and Ten (Foreign Interests) of the Convention ohActs and Interests (see Section D above).   It will be judicial in character and will be composed of three Allied, three German and three &quot;neutral&quot;members.   Its decisions will be final and will not be subject to review by the arbitration Tribunal (see Section E above).2.      The Governments of other states will be able to accede to the charter and appoint members adjoint.
A.    SECURITY CONTROLS - Letters from the German Federal Chancellor.1.     It has been agreed that, in order to avoid the appearance of discrimination against Germany, a solution of the problem of Security Controls will befound outside the contractual arrangements.   The Allied Military SecurityBoard, whose function has been to enforce restrictions on Germany&apos;s militarypotential, will therefore disappear.   Instead, the Germans will be subjectto the following restrictions imposed by the Treaty establishing the european defence Community of which they will be members:a ban on the production of certain war materials in &quot;strategicallyexposed areas&quot; (i. e. Western Germany) except by a unanimousdirection of the European Defence Community Council.   Thesewar materials are atomic, chemical and bacteriological weapons;long-range and guided missiles^; naval vessels over 1,500 tons,including submarines;   and military aircraft.an undertaking by the Federal Republic to maintain controls in thefield of atomic energy in general, without which no controls overatomic weapons would be practicable.2.    The Federal Republic will also undertake to accept the restrictions at(a) above vis-a-vis the United Kingdom and the United States of America whichare not members of the European Defence Community.3.    The Federal Chancellor will accordingly address to the Governmentsconcerned:(a)(b)(a) a letter stating that, if orders are not placed in Germany for itemson List II of the E.D. C. Treaty (i. e. war materials not to beproduced in exposed geographical areas), the Federal Republicwill not regard this as discriminatory;(b) a letter concerning controls to be maintained in the field of atomic energy in general (text still under negotiation);  and(c) (to the United Kingdom and United States Governments only)a letter stating that the limitation in armaments production on the member states of the E.D.C. will, so far as the Federal Republicis concerned, have effect also vis-a-vis the United Kingdom and united States.B.      PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN ALLIED LEGISLATION-Letter to the German Federal chancellor.        In order to give effect to the Allied &quot;reserved&quot; right in respect ofGermany as a whole (see Annex I Section A paragraph 2(c) above)it will be necessary to maintain in being in the Federal republic the fundamental legislation creating the machinery of four-powercontrol.   Otherwise the Soviet Government may be able to showconvincingly that the three Western Powers had forfeited that right.In particular it will be necessary to maintain in legal force control council Proclamation No,, 1,ACCOMPANYING INSTRUMENTS TO BE CONCLUDED ATTHE SAME TIME AS THE CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENT
2.    A letter will be sent accordingly to the Federal Chancellor.   Itstext is not yet finally agreed.C. TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS - Letter to german Federal ChancellorThis will simply list those treaties and international agreements whichwere concluded during the Occupation period on behalf of one or more of thethree Western Zones by one or more of the Occupying Governments or theirdelegates and which are to remain valid as though they had been concluded by the Federal Republic.D. BERLIN - (a) Letter to the Federal Chancellor ;   (b)  Declaration bythe Three Powers(a) The Three Powers are reciprocating the Federal Republic^ promise of material aid to Berlin (see Annex I Section A paragraph 4(a)) with a letteragreeing to facilitate the Federal Republics task.   In effect this letter willstate in what mannei Federal legislation can be made applicable to Berlin(which is not a Land of the Federal Republic) in order that the federal republic&apos;s fiscal and other measures will be applicable to the City, the stability of whose economy it has underwritten.(b) At New York in September, 1951, the Three Foreign Ministersdirected the Allied High Commission to review the Statement of principles governing the relationship between the Allied Kommandatura and berlin and to liberalise Allied controls in the city to the maximum extentpracticable.   It is expected therefore that a tripartite declaration will bemade giving final effect to these directions.   It will, however, avoid allappearance of being directly connected with the contractual settlement inorder to safeguard from a legal standpoint the political and military position of the Three Western Powers in the city.   For this reason it is unlikely to be made in Bonn along with the publication of the contractualarrangements although to achieve the maximum effect it should bepublished about the same time, perhaps in Berlin.In the drafting of the declaration it is proving difficult to reconcile thepolitical desires of the West Berliners with the legal needs of the Allies.E. CLAIMS AGAINST GERMANY - Exchange of letters.In connection with Chapter Eight of the Acts and Interests Convention (see annex I Section D), there will be published an exchange of letters between theFederal Chancellor and the Allied High Commissioners confirming the federal republic&apos;s liability for Germany&apos;s pre-war debt and acknowledging in principle the debt arising from post-war economic assistance given by the Three Powers,F. CLAIMS AGAINST FOREIGN NATIONALS - Exchange of Notes.In connection with Chapter Nine of the Acts and Interests Convention (see annex I Section D above), there is to be published an exchange of notes betweenthe Three Powers and the Federal Republic by which the assets of the JointExport/import Agency (now an organ of the Allied High Commission) will betransferred to the Federal Republic.   The latter will also accept certainundertakings in consideration of the transfer.
SECURITY GUARANTEE.Text agreed at Paris in November 1951 by the Three foreign ministers and the Federal Chancellor:-&quot;On the occasion of the entry into force of the conventions establishing a new basis for the relationship between France, the United Kingdom and the United Statesof America on the one hand, and the Federal Republic ofGermany on the other, the Three Powers:-(a) Declare that they consider the integrity of the federal republic and Berlin an essential element of the peace of the free world-.(b) Reaffirm they will treat any attack against the federal republic or Berlin from any quarter as an attack uponthemselves, and(c) Declare that they will maintain armed forces within theterritory of the German Federal Republic and Berlinfor such time as they deem necessary, having regard totheir special responsibilities in Germany and the world situation. &quot;French re-draft   restricting guarantee to Berlin,   (UnofficialEnglish translation).&quot;On the occasion of the signature   of the conventionsestablishing a new basis for the relationship between France,the United Kingdom and the United States of America on the onehand, and the Federal Republic of Germany on the other, and ofthe Treaty creating the European Defence Community, the three powers:-(a) Declare that they consider the integrity of Berlinan essential element of the peace of the free world.(b) Reaffirm that they will consider any attack againstBerlin from any quarter as an attack upon themselves.(c) Declare that they will maintain armed forces within theterritory of Berlin for as long as their special responsibilities and the world situation require.( * Alternatively, in form of letter to the Governing Mayorof Berlin.)
DECLARATION ON THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE community the following is the draft at present under discussionof the Tripartite Declaration on the European defence community and related questions:The Governments of the United States of America, theUnited Kingdom and France have today signed agreements withthe German Federal Republic which will establish a new relation-ship with that country.   These agreements, as well as the treaties for a European Defence Community and a European coal and Steel Community, of which France is a signatory, provide a new basis for uniting Europe and for associating Germany with theWest.    They also ensure against any future revival of aggressivemilitarism.    They make possible the removal of the specialrestraints hitherto imposed on the Federal Republic of Germanyand permit its participation as an equal partner in western defence.These Conventions and treaties respond to the desireto provide by united efforts for the prosperity and securityof Western Europe.    The Governments of the United States and ,the United Kingdom consider that the establishment and&apos;development of the two European Communities correspond to theirown basic interests and will therefore lend them everyco-operation and support.Moreover Western Defence is a common enterprise inwhich the Governments of the United States and the United King-dom are already partners through their membership of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation.Finally, the three Governments recall that the system of reciprocal guarantees established between the member States of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the member States of theEuropean Defence Community, and between the latter and theUnited Kingdom, applies to the countries concerned only as long asthey remain parties to one or the other of the treaties creatingthese Organisations.For these various reasons the Governments of theUnited States and the United Kingdom have an abiding interest, as has the Government of France, in the effectiveness of theTreaty creating the European Defence Community and in the strengthand integrity of that Community.   Accordingly, if any action from whatever quarter were to threaten the integrity or unity of theCommunity, the two Governments would consider the matter of thegreatest concern to them, calling for consultation under Article q.of the North Atlantic Treaty in order to agree on measures to meetthe situation thus created.   Moreover, they have both expressed their resolve to station such forces on the continent of europe as may be necessary and appropriate to contribute to the joint defence of the area of the North Atlantic Treaty, having regard totheir interest in the integrity of the European Defence Community,their obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, and their special responsibilities in Germany.
