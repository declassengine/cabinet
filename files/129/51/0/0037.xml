Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1952.secret cabinet off1cRECORD copy copy No.C. (52) 137.\5th May, 1952CABINETTHE ODER-NEISSE LINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Prime Minister has enquired about the present status of the frontier between Poland and Eastern Germany and has asked for an account of how thispresent line was decided. He has also directed that a map should be preparedshowing the course of the Oder and Western and Eastern Neisse rivers. This is annexed to this paper.2. My colleagues will be aware that the present provisional western frontier of Poland rests on the Oder and the Western Neisse. As a result of this the greaterpart of the Silesian basin is under Polish administration. Under Soviet pressurethis frontier has been recognised by the German authorities in the Soviet Zone andwas made the subject of a formal treaty between them and the Polish Government,signed on 6th July, 1950.3. At the Teheran Conference in 1943 all three Powers were agreed that poland must be compensated for the loss to the Soviet Union of territories east of the Curzon Line, including the town of Lwow, now incorporated in White Russiaand the Ukraine. The Prime Minister and President Roosevelt argued that thenew western frontier of Poland should lie along the Oder and the Eastern Neisse,but Marshal Stalin insisted on the Western Neisse. The economic, agricultural and population factors involved are summarised in Annex A. At Moscow in October1944 an understanding was reached between the Prime Minister and Marshal Stalin(but not President Roosevelt) that in compensation for her acceptance of the curzon line in the East, Poland should receive the German lands to the east of the Oderand the Oppeln district to the east of the Eastern Neisse. * At the Yalta conference the dispute continued, but it was agreed (a) that Poland must receive substantialaccessions of territory in the North and West, and (b) that the final delimitationof the Western frontier of Poland should await the Peace Conference.4, On 2nd November, 1944, during my temporary absence in Rome,Sir Alexander Cadogan, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, wrote to M. Romer, Foreign Minister of the Polish Government in exile.Replying,, on instructions from the Prime Minister, to certain questions put to himby M. Romer, Sir A. Cadogan wrote that &quot; even in the event of the United StatesGovernment finding themselves unable to agree to the changes in the Westernfrontier of Poland foreshadowed in the conversations in Moscow (i.e., those ofOctober 1944), His Majesty&apos;s Government would still advocate these changes atthe Peace Settlement.&quot; He went on to say that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government con-sidered that Poland should have the right to expand her territory up to the lineof the Oder, to include the port of Stettin.&quot; Nothing in this correspondence, how-ever, committed Her Majesty &apos;s Government to support a frontier on the WesternNeisse.5. The Prime Minister, in a speech in the House of Commons on 15thDecember, 1944, said: &quot; The Poles are free, so far as Russia and Great britain are concerned, to extend their territory, at the expense of Germany, to the West.I do not propose to go into exact details, but the extensions, which will be supported* The effect of this formula would be the same as if the frontier were the Oder and EasternNeisse except that the pocket of land between the Eastern Neisse and the Czech frontier South-East of Glatz would remain in Germany.42220
by Britain and Russia, bound together as they are by the twenty years&apos; Alliance,are of high importanpe. Thus, they gain in the West and the North territories moreimportant and more highly developed than they lose in the East.&quot; Again no refer-ence was made to the line of the Western Neisse and the statement did not commitHis Majesty&apos;s Government to the cession of the Silesian basin to Poland.6. At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the Prime Minister and president truman declared that the Soviet proposals (embodying those of the Polish Pro-visional Government) that the Oder and the Western Neisse should form the frontierwere unacceptable. The Prime Minister argued that Poland ought not to be over-compensated in the West since this would deprive Germany of essential sources offood.and would oblige the United Kingdom to undertake the main burden of feed&apos;&quot;-ing the industrial areas of Germany. Stalin conceded that, while he himself had insisted at Tehran on the Western Neisse line, the Prime Minister and president roosevelt had advocated a line on the Oder and the Eastern Neisse, leaving Breslauand Stettin in Germany. (N.B. Stalin was not apparently then aware of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments decision, subsequent to the Tehran meeting and conveyedin Sir A. Cadogan&apos;s letter of 2nd November, 1944, to M. Romer, that Poland shouldhave the right to the port of Stettin.)7. It was left on 22nd July, 1945, that the matter would be discussed furtherafter representatives of the Polish Provisional Government had been heard. ThePolish representatives met the three Foreign Ministers, including myself, on 24thJuly. 1945. Nothing new emerged. But I did in the course of these discussions,as on many earlier occasions, impress upon the Poles as our allies that we couldnot agree to anything beyond the Eastern Neisse and that the Poles would be most unwise to seek to press for it. They would only be laying up future trouble for themselves with the Germans. It was on this account, also, that more than once in discussion with the Poles during the war years we urged upon them the formula&quot; up to the line of the Oder.&quot; It was always my own view that the Poles wouldhave been wise not to go even as far West as the Oder itself in all its length.8.   On 26th July, 1945, the Government went out of office and Mr. Attleereturned to Berlin to lead the British Delegation, accompanied by Mr. Bevin.9. On 31st July, 1945, Mr. Byrnes, the United States Secretary of State, saidthat, as part of their attempt to secure agreement on Reparations and on theproposed statement on the admission of neutral and ex-enemy States to the united nations, the United States delegation had put forward a proposal which would permit the Polish Provisional Government to take over, on a provisional basispending the final peace settlement, the administration of all the territory up to theline of the Oder and the Western Neisse, as well as Pomerania and Danzig. TheUnited States proposal (the text of which is attached in Annex B) was accepted,after some argument on Mr. Bevin&apos;s part, and was included verbatim in the BerlinProtocol.10. The view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, shared by the United States andFrench Governments, as recently expressed in the Note of 25th March to theSoviet Government, is that &quot; no definitive German frontiers were laid down by the potsdam decisions, which clearly provided that the final determination of territorialquestions must await the peace settlement.&quot; The Soviet view, as expressed in theSoviet Note of 10th March, is that &quot; the territory of Germany is defined by the borders established by the decisions of the Potsdam Conference.&quot; Mr. Vyshinskytold Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Moscow, when the latter presented the note of 25th March, that the Potsdam decisions and frontiers were definitive and final and all that remained was for them to be &quot; formalised &quot;in the Peace Treaty.The matter, Mr. Vyshinsky said, was beyond dispute and further discussion was unnecessary. In their subsequent Note of 9th April, the Soviet Governmentrepeated their view in the following terms: &quot; As for Germany&apos;s frontiers, the SovietGovernment holds as quite sufficient and final the decisions on this score of the potsdam Conference which were adopted by the Governments of the United States,U.S.S.R. and Britain and to which France subscribed.&quot; jj.-  -ii .
