(THi^. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential CA 8 11 \ c i    OFFlCtc.(52) 140 RECORD COPY copy nov5th may, 1952cabinetLICENSING OF ROAD PASSENGER VEHICLESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council as requested by the Cabinet on 1st May (C. C. (52) 48th Conclusions,Minute 3(1)), the Committee on Road and Rail Transport have reviewed the draft terms of reference of the proposed Departmental Committee on theoperation of the Road Traffic Act, 1930.Terms of Reference2s.    We have come to the conclusion that it would not be quite sufficient to direct the attention of the Committee to the need for a review of the provisionsof Section 72 of the Act of 1930,   There are certain other factors which oughtto be looked into and which too precise a reference to Section 72 might rule out.   For example, when the licensing system was set up under the 1930 Act,it was assumed that there would always be operators ready to come forward.The control which the British Transport Commission now have over asubstantial proportion of the road passenger services may deprive this assumption of some of its force.   Furthermore, road service licences arenot now required for the hire of vehicles - known as &quot;contract carriages&quot; -to carry private parties on special occasions.   Doubts have arisen latelyabout the legal scope for this type of business but, relevant though the point is,it could not be considered under an enquiry strictly limited to Section 72.3.    We therefore recommend that the Cabinet&apos;s view should be met by termsof reference framed more generally as follows&quot;In the light of present-day conditions, to enquire into the operationof the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, relating to the licensing of public road passenger services and to make re commendations. &quot;Form of Inquiry4,    The recommendation we have already made, and to which we adhere, is thatthe inquiry should be remitted to a Departmental Committee of independentpersons appointed by the Minister of Transport.  A Royal Commission would,in our view, take too long and its appointment might be read as indicating a desire to shelve the problem.   A Departmental Committee is the only publicalternative to a Royal Commission.   It should work much more quickly and itslesser powers should be no disadvantage.   Its standing in public estimation will depend entirely on the personalities and records of the members appointed, andon the balance of the membership as a whole.   Much of the 1930 Act itself was based on recommendations of Departmental Committees which were subsequently endorsed by a Royal Commission.
Members of the Committee5.    I have discussed a number of possible names with the Road and rail transport Committee and will hand round a list to the Cabinet when this note is discussed.   In the meantime my colleagues may like to know thatfor the person with an academic interest in transport suggested inC. (52) 136 we propose to substitute a person with past experience of road passenger transport operation, and that it is hoped to secure in the person of the Trades Union representative a man who can speak for Wales,W.Privy Council Office, S.
