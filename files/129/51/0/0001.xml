(52) 1013rd April, 1952CABINETCOTTON: IMPORTING AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellorof the Duchy of lancaster the Cabinet will recall that in the Debate on the Address on 9th november the President of the Board of Trade made it clear that:  (a) It was the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that the Liverpool CottonExchange should be re-established; but(b) foreign exchange and dollar difficulties made it impossible to reopen theExchange forthwith.He said: &quot; In fact our present foreign exchange position makes it impracticableat present to allow the free use of dollars in trading in cotton, and that fact alone would prevent a return to the free working completely free working of the liverpool Cotton Exchange.&quot;2. Following this we jointly set up on 5th December, 1951, a Committee,representative of all sections of the cotton industry, to advise us on how in presentcircumstances cotton imports could best be handled.3. Because we did not wish to imply that we were prepared to consider anyother ultimate goal than the reopening of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange theCommittee were required to address themselves only to the current foreign exchange position and were not asked to consider possible courses which might be taken inthe more distant. future. The terms of reference of the Committee thereforewere:  &quot; To consider and report .... on the question how, in the current foreign exchange position, cotton can best be supplied to the United Kingdom cottonindustry on the most advantageous terms as to quality and price.&quot;4. This Committee, known as the &quot; Cotton Import Committee &quot; and underthe independent chairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins, comprised representativesof the importing merchants, the cotton spinners, the manufacturers and converters,the Trade Unions, the Cotton Board and the Raw Cotton Commission. Apartfrom the Chairman of the Cotton Board and the Chairman of the Raw cotton commission the members of the Committee were not appointed by us but werenominated by their respective Associations and organisations. The committee reported on 28th March. Their report is unanimous and it is attached (Annex B).5. The Committee have endorsed the view that present foreign exchange and dollar difficulties preclude a full return to the free cotton market and thus there opening of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange.6. They have, however, recommended that the Raw Cotton commission should cease to exercise monopoly control over raw cotton imports and that hence-forward, under suitable conditions, the private user should be free to import hisown cotton through private channels if he wishes to. Under the Committee&apos;sproposals the cotton spinner would be free to import either through the commissioner independently at his own choice. He would be free to take whichever course he42085 b
pleased. It is essential that the using industry should be able to &quot; cover &quot; their purchases. The Commission would continue to provide &quot; cover &quot; for the purchases of private buyers in the same way as cover v/ill continue to be available for spinnersdeciding to remain with the Commission.7. The recommendations are set out in full on pages 13-14 of the Report.The main operating features are briefly summarised in Annex A to this paper.8. The proposals which form the basis of the Committee&apos;s recommendations were in fact put forward by the Chairman of the Raw Cotton Commission. TheCommission are ready to give such a scheme all possible assistance.9. We are advised that the proposals, if accepted, could be carried through initially at any rate by licences issued under the Cotton (Centralised Buying) Act1947 and that fresh legislation would not be necessary immediately. If, as time went on, a substantial proportion of spinners were to opt to buy independently itwould be contrary to the intention and spirit of the 1947 Act for a Governmentdepartment to license a large volume of private trade under an Act designed tocreate a monopoly. Amending legislation would then be desirable and if &quot; optingout &quot; went far enough necessary.10. Conclusions-Om recommendation is that the Committee&apos;s proposals should be accepted by the Government in their entirety and that the report shouldbe laid before Parliament without delay. Our primary reason for advocating thiscourse is that the report is a unanimous document, signed by Lancashire men drawn from all sections and both sides of the industry, on a subject which has hitherto been the focus of violent controversy. The proposals have the support of the liverpool and Manchester Cotton Exchanges, of all sections of the industry and ofthe Trade Unions.11. Apart from the significant fact that the representatives of the two CottonExchanges have not stood out for the complete return to the pre-war organisationof the market we are satisfied (as we have both already stated in Parliament) thatin our present foreign exchange difficulties no greater step towards the reopening of the Cotton Exchanges could in fact be taken. The Committee&apos;s proposals arein no sense presented as a final solution, and the report recommends that a further review might be desirable after adequate time has elapsed for some experience ofthe plan to be gained. We can concur in this view without wishing at this stage to forecast when such a review might most usefully take place. Meanwhile, weshall have taken a substantial step away from the monopoly.12. We are satisfied that, from the administrative point of view, the proposals are workable and that, if the necessary decisions are taken in time, they can beapplied this year. The main points on which administrative problems might arisewere spotted in advance and have been covered, so far as possible, in theCommittee&apos;s report.13. We think it important that an early decision should be taken in orderto give no opportunity for the resumption of controversy which has been set asidewhile the Committee has been working. Moreover, if the scheme is to be putinto effect this year, the administrative arrangements must be made by 1st June.14. In the course of the Textile Debate on 26th March, the President of theBoard of Trade intimated that the. House of Commons would no doubt wish to debate the Committee&apos;s report.15. Finally, we wish to record our profound appreciation of the skill andwisdom with which Sir Richard Hopkins, as Chairman, has guided the Committeetowards an agreed report without re-awakening any of the controversy associatedwith this subject.16. Recommendation. We therefore recommend that the report of theCotton Import Committee should be laid before Parliament as soon as it can be printed, and that a simultaneous statement should be made accepting the recom-mendations as they stand. There is little doubt that a Debate in the House ofCommons will be asked for, and we hope that suitable arrangements can be made.P. T.3rd April, 1952.SWINTON.
ANNEX AThe main operating features of the plan put forward by the Cotton ImportCommittee are:  1. Spinners who choose to buy their own cotton would give notice to that effectto the Commission.2. &quot;Groups &quot; would be established representing the main categories of raw cotton, which is not a homogeneous commodity. Spinners could &quot; optout&quot; for one or more groups at their choice; i.e., they could choose to buy independently all or part of their requirements.3. Because the Commission for their part must know where they stand, spinnerswould have to give advance notice of their intentions from year to year.They could not opt in and out at convenience in the course of a year.4. Spinners &quot; opting out&quot; would be given rations separately for dollars andother scarce foreign exchange strictly proportionate to the currencyrations which would be available to the Commission for the businessremaining with them.5. Facilities for &quot; covering &quot; purchases of raw cotton, provided by the pre-war futures market, and continued by the Cotton Control andsubsequently by the Raw Cotton Commission, are essential for theusing industry. The Commission, under the present proposals, would continue, subject to reasonable conditions, to provide (on a somewhat,different basis) cover for independent spinners and merchantsrequiring it.6. Safeguards are provided which would ensure that (a) independent spinnerswould obtain full access to cotton, e.g., certain Colonial crops andpossibly Sudan cotton which it might be desirable to continue to buyin bulk; and (b) arrangements for developing cotton production in the sterling area were not impeded.The following points are of special importance:  1. Merchants-Independent spinners would be free to use the services ofmerchants if they wished to. But (except possibly in a minor degreewhich need not be explained in detail here) the present scheme wouldnot restore the private trade in raw cotton directly into the hands ofthe pre-war merchants. This is the consequence of the need for foreign exchange rationing. It is accepted by all concerned, including the merchants, that the foreign exchange ration and therefore immediateauthority to import cotton, must be given directly to the spinner asuser. It does follow, of course, that the practice may grow up wecannot tell of spinning firms importing their own cotton directlywithout making as much use of merchants as before the war.2. Cover. The provision of &quot; cover &quot; for the imports of, spinners and mer-chants will mean that public money is at risk to protect the activitiesof private bodies. The Commission have already been risking public money in providing cover for the United Kingdom cotton trade. Theyare authorised to do so by a section of the Cotton (Centralised Buying)Act. The Committee do not consider that the extent of public risk willbe significantly greater merely because a proportion of cotton is hence-forward bought privately.  We concur in this view.3. Foreign Exchange Rations. There will have to be a market in ration&quot; entitlements &quot; i.e., independent spinners must be free to buy and sell- -e.g., dollar rations from each other. Without going into details, thisis because a two-price system rules in the world to-day for dollar and non-dollar cottons of similar quality. The spinner who prefers, on technical grounds, to use dearer non-dollar cottons must be able, if heis to remain competitive, to sell his rights to cheaper dollar cotton.Trafficking in import certificates may evoke some public interest and perhaps criticism, but is inevitable under the scheme. In order to avoidinternational criticism, particularly from the United States, it would bedesirable to stress in any public statements on the subject that the traffic in import certificates is by private agreement and that the passing of a cash consideration is not the consequence of any Governmentarrangement.42085 b 2

Part I. Present Arrangements for Importing Raw Cotton1. The Raw Cotton Commission, established under the Cotton (CentralisedBuying) Act, 1947, has operated as the sole authority for importing, holding and distributing all raw cotton required for use by spinners and other users in the UnitedKingdom, and for the purpose of re-export. In these functions the Raw cotton commission succeeded the Cotton Control, which early in the war had taken overthe responsibility for importing raw cotton.2. Before the outbreak of the war the import of raw cotton was entirely inthe hands of merchants and users, and most of the cotton imported was handled by members of the Liverpool and Manchester Cotton Associations, who carriedout their transactions on the Exchanges of these two cities. Both Associationsoperated &quot; spot&quot; markets, i.e., had facilities for the buying and selling of.cottonin particular lots, and, in addition, the Liverpool Cotton Association operated a&quot; futures &quot; market, z&apos;.e... a market trading in contracts providing for delivery ina forward month of cotton within a prescribed range. Through the &quot; futures &quot;market, importers, spinners and others were able to protect themselves against certain fluctuations in the price of raw cotton. Such cover is important to theUnited Kingdom cotton industry and is discussed in detail below (paragraphs 11-16).3. Certain initial war-time arrangements terminated in March 1942, when the importing and distribution of raw cotton became the sole responsibility of theCotton Control set up by the Ministry of Supply (and later transferred to the Boardof Trade). On 1st January, 1948, the Raw Cotton Commission took over. From1942 to 1947, therefore, the members of the Liverpool and Manchester CottonAssociations played only a small part in the import and sale of cotton. They acted as agents for the Cotton Control in the import of some growths, principally Indian,though most growths were acquired direct by the Cotton Control, which undertookthe whole task of importing the cotton and selling it to spinners, using the servicesof merchants and brokers on commission for passing contracts, invoicing, andcollecting money due. After the war, the Cotton Control made greater use of themethod of buying cotton in the United Kingdom from an agent of the foreignshipper, instead of buying it in the producing country. The Raw cotton commission extended the use of this method. Many members of the CottonAssociations now act as agents of foreign shippers and to-day most of the cottonis so bought, except for the growths, referred to below (paragraph 27), boughtunder bulk purchase arrangements between the Raw Cotton Commission and theGovernment concerned.4. As regards its subsequent sales to spinners, the Raw Cotton commission is required by law to sell cotton at prices such as may seem to it best calculated tofurther the public interest in all respects. It is further stipulated that theCommission^ revenue and expenditure should be balanced, taking the good years with the bad. A reserve fund, financed initially from the profits made by the CottonControl from 1st April, 1946, on a rising market and amounting to  30 million,was provided with the intention of enabling the Commission to meet the losses which might result from falling prices, or from any other cause. The commission has, up to the present time, taken the view that it can best meet its statutoryresponsibilities by selling cotton at prices approximating to world replacementprices (but see paragraphs 6-10). Broadly speaking, the nature of world trade in cotton goods is such as almost to compel the Commission to adopt a price policywhich so mirrors the prices in the free cotton markets of the world. This countryseeks to sell much of its cotton yarn and cloth in competitive export markets andit follows that the spinner needs to pay at any moment no more&quot; in the aggregatefor his raw material than do his international competitors. On the other hand, ifthe Commission were to charge him consistently less than the world price, it would,over any period when prices did not show a steady upward trend, dissipate itsreserves.5. The consequence of the policy described above of selling to spinners atreplacement cost (coupled with the accounting practice of valuing stock at thelower of cost or replacement price) is that in years of rising prices the Commissionmust make a profit on its sales, since it is selling from a stock still valued at cost;whereas in years of falling prices not only will it make a loss on its sales, but also
on its stock valuation. If it is to serve the industry the Commission has no alterna-tive to holding considerable stocks since it cannot risk running its unsold stocksdown to nil, because this would jeopardise the continuous operation of the industry.The carrying of this unsold stock from season to season, with its value fluctuatingwith changes in world cotton prices, causes severe changes in the Commissions,financial position. Thus an end-season stock of 150,000 tons valued at one time at, say,  1.00 million might change substantially in value, say by 33y per cent., fromone season to the next. This degree of change in the value of the stock may wellobscure any financial items properly attributable to efficiency or inefficiency inoperation, and, moreover, ties up in the reserve fund which might proveinsufficient the large sum of public money needed to cover this price risk.6. The Commission has never followed its replacement price policy to theextent of quoting exact equivalents for the many growths of cotton that are used and, indeed, many producing countries do not have a continuously operating marketwhere a daily replacement price could be ascertained. The Commission has alwaysused the price mechanism to give a degree of encouragement or discouragement tothe use of certain cottons, but in the last two years the emergence of considerablydiffering prices for raw cotton, not related to the intrinsic qualities of the cotton butdepending on whether dollar or non-dollar currency is required to pay for it, has,as described below, had a profound influence on the Commission^ price policy.7. Nearly half the cotton entering v/orld trade is exported from the UnitedStates. A large number of countries produce cottons which are to varying degreessubstitutable with United States cotton (these and the United States growths are known collectively as the American-type cottons and comprise over 80 per cent, of world production; the other large group being the longer-staple Egyptian-typecottons), but the total supply of these substitutable cottons available from non-dollar producing countries is very limited. A world dollar shortage has the conse-quence of concentrating demand from importing countries on to the non-dollarsupplies, and forcing up their prices above that of comparable United States cotton.(The same effect was produced to an even greater degree last season by the quanti-tative restriction on exports of United States cotton imposed because of the shortcrop.) The result has been that two price levels have been set up for cottons whichbefore 1939 were regarded as virtually interchangeable at prices appropriate to their commercial value, and importing countries have had to pay premia to secure their supplies of cotton from countries which do not demand payment in dollars. Thecurrent world-wide recession in trade in cotton goods, by relaxing pressure on supplies generally, has greatly reduced these premia but during 1951 theywere very high.8. About one-half of the United Kingdom&apos;s imports of American-type cottonsare normally drawn from the dollar area. They constitute one of the largest indi-vidual items of our dollar expenditure. For this reason the Raw Cotton Corn-mission^ intended purchases each year have been subject to close scrutiny by government departments and, in so far as dollar purchases are concerned, havebeen fixed in relation to the Government^ estimate of the country&apos;s dollar position,and not in relation to the Raw Cotton Commission^ estimate of what the trade would choose to buy.9. The Raw Cotton Commission has dealt with the situation resulting fromthe existence of two price levels for similar cottons by selling its American-typecottons not according to the approximate replacement price of each particulargrowth but according to an &quot; averaged &quot; replacement price determined by com-bining the replacement prices of all the comparable growths. Consequently UnitedKingdom spinners are obliged to buy a growth of cotton at a price determinednot by the relation of their demand to available (or permitted) supplies of thatcotton, but by the proportion of &quot; cheap &quot; dollar cotton and &quot; expensive &quot; outsidegrowths in the import programme determined by Government departments at theopening of each season. It results that the Commission charges more for dollarcottons, than the world price and less for the outside growths:10. For the first three and a half years of the Raw Cotton Commissionsoperations, Lancashire enjoyed a &quot; sellers&apos; market&quot; for its products and except ina few isolated cases, of specialised products the difficulty was not to find the market for its goods, but to find the goods for its markets.   The premium resulting from
the practice of&quot; averaging &quot;- i.e., of taking account of the extra purchases of non-dollar cottons made necessary by the decisions of the Government to restrict dollar expenditure-was in general borne by the willing buyer. Towards the end of 1951.however, circumstances made the industry more conscious of the burden it wascarrying. As it happened it was expected in the summer of 1951 that raw cotton prices in the United States would drop sharply in the autumn and New York futuresprices fell artificially low. Concurrently the first signs of a decline in the.market for cotton goods began to appear. The marked contrast between New Yorkfutures prices and the Raw Cotton Commission^ current quotations helped tofocus attention on the considerably higher price which the United Kingdom spinnerwas called upon to pay for his cotton compared to those who had free access to united States cotton. This disadvantage in price continues to cause considerable anxiety, although as already indicated in paragraph 7, the premium is muchnarrower than it was.11. The foregoing paragraphs have described the external background to the raw Cotton Commission^ purchasing and to the price policy it has adopted for itsday-to-day sales (i.e., the sales corresponding to the &quot; spot &quot; market). The Corn-mission has also undertaken the task of providing United Kingdom users of raw cotton with facilities comparable to those offered by a &quot; futures &quot; market.12. The provision of futures cover is essential to most of the Lancashirespinning industry. This industry sells probably as much as three-quarters of itsproduction of yarn as such, and the spinning margin by itself is too small in relationto the raw material cost to act as a buffer to absorb large changes in raw cotton prices. An example of how the need for such facilities arises is given by the spinnerwho has temporarily exhausted his sales of yarn but is anxious to keep his millrunning and so decides to spin &quot; for stock.&quot; He will have to sell his yarn later atthe price then current and covers himself against the risk of a change in raw cotton prices either by arranging with his supplier to buy his cotton &quot; on call,&quot; i.e., at a price to be fixed at the level ruling when he later sells his yarn; or alternatively by sellinga &quot; futures &quot; contract which he buys back when he sells his yarn, and so balancesa loss in yarn prices due to a fall in cotton prices by a gain on his &quot; futures &quot;transaction, or conversely.13. Before the war the Liverpool futures market provided the mechanismfor such &quot; hedging &quot; operations by spinners, and others (e.g., importers who hadbought raw cotton overseas and would not be able to resell it for some periodahead, or who had sold cotton in advance of purchase in the country of origin).Futures contracts were available in respect of American, long-staple Egyptian and short-staple Egyptian cottons. They were also available, though much less used, inrespect of Empire and miscellaneous cottons and Indian cotton. When privatetrading ceased during the war the futures market was closed. The Cotton control in course of time found it necessary to introduce &quot; cover &quot; schemes of a fairly simplenature to maintain a smooth flow of production during the war.14. When the Raw Cotton Commission took over it found that peace-time conditions made certain changes necessary; and what was in effect a new schemewas introduced in November 1949. Under this scheme the spinner could placehis order with the commission when he booked an order for yarn. If he wanted to keep his mill going when there was a deficiency of yarn orders, he could buycotton without &quot; fixing &quot; his price until he booked an order for yarn; similarly ifwanted to secure a supply of &quot;a particular growth for delivery at some future datehe could buy and &quot; fix &quot; the price when he booked his order for yarn to be spunfrom that cotton (this is an adaptation of the &quot; on call &quot; contact mentioned above).The effect of these arrangements was that the spinner got full cover againstfluctuations in the price of the cotton he had selected. He also had facilities fordeferred delivery. To prevent speculation by the spinner on changes in theCommission^ prices, spinners are required (except when purchasing &quot; on call &quot;) tomaintain a balanced position (within prescribed limits) between their raw cottonpurchases and their yarn sales.15. In August 1950 the Commission inaugurated a Cover Contract Schemefor converters. This was intended to meet the needs of converters who felt thatthey were running dangerously &quot; long &quot; positions. It was made clear by convertersthat they did not want cover for the whole of their long holding, but only for par-ticular types and particular markets.  To provide some flexibility the Commission
introduced a scheme whereby converters when they bought cloth could sell nominal&quot;futures&quot; to the Commission provided they did not re-buy in less than threemonths, and did not re-buy from it under twelve months (the intention of theCommission being to limit the possibilities of speculation at its expense). very recently a cover scheme for doublers and manufacturers was introduced to meetthe needs of those who wanted to keep their machinery running by buying yarnwhile not selling cloth.- 16. So far as the Raw Cotton Commission^ financial position is concerned,the offering of &quot; on call &quot; contracts to spinners and of cover contracts to the other sections is equivalent to its acquiring a &quot; long &quot; interest in cotton, and the offeringof forward delivery to spinners to acquiring a &quot; short&quot; interest. These interests are small (and sometimes opposed) compared to the Commission^ own stocksof cotton (see paragraph 5), and we believe that, in practice, the additional risk to reserves attributable to providing futures facilities is relatively insignificant.Part II. Alternative Methods of Marketing Raw Cotton17. We have described above the present arrangements in the United King-dom. We have also considered some of the other arrangements made in this countryand elsewhere. Pre-war, Liverpool and Manchester offered spot facilities, and dealtin virtually ail the types of cotton grown in the world. They were able to do this because they were closely situated to a large consuming industry and were largeports. The Liverpool market also offered futures facilities to all and sundry.Moreover, it was so geographically placed that it had a time overlap with all theother markets in the world (mainly Bombay, Alexandria and New York); that is,it could in the course of one working day operate in any of these other markets.There were minor markets in other importing countries. Because it was an inter-national market, foreign business was attracted to Liverpool, and carried with itbanking and insurance business. The income so earned, though small in relationto total turnover, was undoubtedly significant.18. No comparable market has grown up in any other importing country; and certainly no futures market. The big markets now are only found in exporting countries, notably those of New York and Alexandria. The pre-war Bombaymarket is not at present functioning. Both New York.and Alexandria offer futuresfacilities, but of course only American or Egyptian cotton respectively are tender-able in these markets. We must, however, point out that conditions in thesemarkets are different from pre-war. In New York, and especially in.Alexandria,the imposition of Government regulations in particular of arbitrary limitations on price movements whatever their justification, has from, time to time affected the quality of the cover that is offered.19. An important point in regard to the futures facilities offered by marketssuch as these compared to those now offered by the Raw Cotton commission is that the risk of loss or gain involved in hedging against future price fluctuationsis borne entirely by private capital. To a large extent these markets work bybalancing operators who wish to sell against those who wish to buy a futurescontract; but to the extent that these do not exactly match at a particular momentthere is a potential net &quot; long &quot; or &quot; short&quot; interest which causes the market tomove until someone comes in to close the gap.20. Before the war freedom from import and currency restrictions allowed the several markets to act as restraining influences on each other by bringing tobear the balancing activities of the type of operator who by &quot; straddling &quot; wouldbuy in the cheaper market with a view to selling in the dearer market (and thusreverse the upward trend in that market) and vice versa. Moreover, futures con-tracts were based on the actual delivery of cotton against the contract, and a sellerwas always free to deliver and a buyer to take up cotton against futures contractsso that this close connection between the &quot; spot &quot; and &quot; futures &quot; market was alsoa limitation on the extent of price swings.21. These conditions do not exist to-day when most countries restrict expendi-. tureby their nationals, at any rate in currencies regarded as &quot; hard &quot;; and many havealso imposed quantitative import or export restrictions. The position of animporting country is thus inevitably more difficult than it was pre-war; and thearrangements made in some European countries, who to varying degrees are underthe same difficulty of dollar shortage as ourselves, seemed to us worth some study.
22. We understand that some European cotton importing countries depend upon a system of import licences granted to spinners for cotton produced in countries whose currency is scarce. The effect of this system is that the pattern ofproduction tends to be determined by the.pattern of allocation; the prices paid forthe various growths are &quot;averaged&quot; by the manufacturer at the &quot;yarn or clothstage; and the extent to which cover is adequate generally depends on the extentto which imports are available from, and hedging facilities are permitted in thecountries where a market is in operation. However, there is no certainty thatBrazilian prices, for instance, will maintain a steady differential compared with new york prices, or even that they will move in the same direction: The seriousness ofsuch disadvantages obviously depends on circumstances including particularly the dollar position of the countries concerned. In recent years, most European cottonindustries have had a higher proportion of dollar cotton than the United kingdom industry, but none have had access to cover facilities so complete as those in theUnited Kingdom.Part III. Assessment of the Situation23. In general we believe it is true to say that the climate in which the greatinternational commodity markets grew up was one in which every operator on themarket entered into his commitments without having to stop for one moment toconsider whether he would be allowed to pay, or allowed to&quot; import. This is notthe climate we live in to-day. This country has had a dollar shortage since thebeginning of the war, although this has been cloaked to a greater or less extent by Lend-Lease arrangements, the United States Loan, and the European recovery programme. It is still the dominant factor in our &quot; current foreign exchange posi-tion.&quot; How long it will remain thus is not for us to say, but to. prescribe for anyother situation would carry us outside our terms of reference. This means that wehave to consider a situation in which restrictions on dollar expenditure, and possibly on expenditure of some other currencies, continue, so that for the immediate futureimports are likely to remain limited from certain sources or in total; and the condi-tions in which the free market operated will by no means exist in their entirety.What we have therefore to consider is how, in these conditions, cotton can best besupplied to the United Kingdom cotton industry on the most advantageous terms ,as to quality and price.24. There are two important consequences of these conditions. First, world trade in cotton is likely to be complicated by the existence of two prices for american-type cotton. We have asked those in the industry primarily concerned to consider together whether in to-day&apos;s conditions there is any superior alternative to the &quot; averaging &quot; policy which so far, with the agreement of the industry, the raw Cotton Commission has followed (see paragraph 9). Any relief that may befound in this difficult situation is not likely to be prejudiced by the recommenda-tions which we make below.25. The second consequence is that unless there is virtually complete freedom to import cottons of either the American-type group or the Egyptian-type group,it is impossible (see paragraph 23) for futures cover in the relevant group to beprovided for the United Kingdom spinning industry by mechanisms differing fromthe present cover schemes of the Raw Cotton Commission.26. A great advantage of the present system is that despite the exchange position the United Kingdom cotton industry does enjoy an adequate provision ofcover, which, for example, compares favourably with the facilities available tospinners in some of the European countries. We think that many spinners wouldbe reluctant to accept facilities less comprehensive than those now provided by theCommission which in effect offers to carry the spinner&apos;s risk for him not only onthe changes in the United Kingdom price of the two basic growths, but also of thesubstitute growths.27. The present system also offers other advantages to the industry. We havebeen told by some firms that they can rely upon being given a &quot;fair share &quot; of anycottons that may be in scarce supply. It is clear to us that a number of spinners^are satisfied with the present system. It has also been represented to us that the raw Cotton Commission is in a better position, because of its financial backing andits command of the market, than private traders would be, to enter into arrange-ments designed to develop the production of cotton in the sterling area. Thus it has42085 c
long term contracts with certain Colonies, principally in West Africa, and has bulk purchase arrangements with other countries for the whole, or part, of the crop.Although facilitated by the present organisation of the industry these arrangements should still be possible if there were not a monopoly. The increased developmentof cotton production within the Empire seems to us most desirable.,28. It is also possible that the Raw Cotton Commission may have some advantage over the free market in cost of operation but we do not believe the saving to be significant in relation to turnover.29. On the other hand, there are disadvantages in the present system. the financing of the operations of the Raw Cotton Commission requires the use of a&apos;considerable sum from public funds and there is always the possibility that thepresent level of reserves might prove insufficient (see paragraph 5).30. It has been put to us as the view of some firms that the present arrange-ments do not enable the spinner, of e.g. speciality and quality yarns, to secure the exact qualities, or the complete continuity of cotton that he needs. They believethat it is impossible in practice for a monopoly purchasing agency to give the sameindividual attention to a spinnefs requirements of grade and character- as was available pre-war; and to build up the same tradition of personal contacts with overseas shippers. Some feel that such personal contacts are essential to secureexact quality shipments. In consequence these firms have said they have been unable to guarantee unvarying yarn to their customers, as they could do pre-war.This consideration, they argue, affects not only the spinning qualities of the yarnbut also the quality of the cloth, and its finishing properties. They also maintain that in seasons of difficult supply an intermediary cannot make the necessaryprompt compromise decisions as knowledgeably as a principal, and that the benefitsderived from personal contact have thus been lost.31. The mere fact of being a strict monopoly also carries with it some dis-advantages. An employee of a monopoly organisation such as the Raw cotton commission has no defence against criticism. He may regard the knowledge thathe is doing what he considers a good job as an adequate defence, but he cannotprove that he is doing a good job. An employee of a private firm on the other handmay find competition not only a spur to, but a measure of, his excellence. Theobverse of this is that the spinner who feels he has a complaint against the Corn-mission can never prove himself right, nor can the Commission prove him wrong.A justified attack which cannot strike home is as enervating to the efficiency of theindustry as an unjustified complaint which cannot be disproved may be to itsmorale. Another aspect of the same problem is the heavy responsibility which lieson the three members of the Raw Cotton Commission whose duty alone it is to fix the prices which the spinning section pays for its cotton. Such decisions clearlyaffect the well-being of the whole industry and of its export trade.32. A further consideration which has been put to us is the need to maintainthe arbitration facilities of Liverpool and Manchester. Since the Raw cotton commission came into being, disputes referred to arbitration between it andspinners have been rare. Nevertheless, machinery will always be needed to settledisputes which cannot be agreed. Practised judges are also required to arbitratebetween the Commission and its foreign shippers. The machinery of arbitrationmust be kept efficient.33. In this connection our attention has been called to the waste of skill thathas resulted from the fact that a number of principals and employees of firmsoperating on the pre-war markets have not found direct employment with theCommission. Some of course have either acted as agents for suppliers andcustomers of the Commission, or have continued their activities as intermediariesand arbitrators between sellers and importers in other countries. We feel that theearning power which such skills can contribute to this country should not be over-looked ; but we do not believe that in many cases the individuals concerned would wish for an opportunity of employment with the Commission, or that they wouldbe best employed where opportunities for the exercise of private judgment and responsibility as principals must be circumscribed. It has also been suggested thatit should be possible for the Commission to allow merchants to act effectively asprincipals both buying and re-selling to users within a very general directive fromthe Commission as to quantities and prices, but we feel that such a scheme wouldin practice result in a division of responsibility that would lead to friction andinefficiency.  We do not believe that the best interests of the Commission or the
trade could be served by dictating to the Commission what its employment or commercial policy should be.34. In the evidence submitted to us some representative associations haveexpressed the opinion that a complete return to free market conditions is thedesirable ultimate objective. The contrary opinion has similarly been expressed to us. The resolution of this difference lies outside our terms of reference and itis in any event clear to us that the present conditions so long as they persist precludea full return to the free market.35. The proposals that we make, while not going as far as some may thinkpossible in present conditions in the direction of the fullest use of private enterprise,do not fix the present debated pattern. So far as they have any relevance to thefuture, their application will, we hope, provide opportunities for experience to be gained and useful inferences drawn on the merits of differing systems in conditionswhich, however they may develop, are very unlikely to be entirely comparable tothose known in the past.36. We have tried to indicate above some of the advantages and disadvantages of the present system. Some firms in the industry have stressed the benefit to themselves of some of the advantages, others the handicap to themselves of someof the disadvantages. No doubt these differing views derive partly from thediffer -ing position of various units in the industry. The units vary very much among themselves in size, in the degree to which successive processes are integrated in asingle unit, in the sorts of product they make (and thus in the qualities they seek intheir raw material) and in the markets for which they cater.37. It has seemed to us that the major advantages which the industry derives from the present system of public purchase of its cotton are not dependent on themaintenance of a strict monopoly, and that some of the disadvantages that havebeen brought to our attention would disappear if the monopoly were to be relaxed.38. In the light of these various considerations, we have concluded that thebest course at the present stage is that the Raw Cotton Commission shouldcontinue its functions generally as at present, but that individual spinners shouldhave an option, exercisable and revocable at appropriate times, to dispense withthe services of the Commission and make their own arrangements for the acquisitionof the cotton they require; this option being exercisable not necessarily over their total purchases of all types of cotton but, if they so prefer, over their puchases ofa stated group of growths.39. The plan we propose is worked out in detail in the succeeding part ofthis Report and in the Appendix. It has been our object to provide spinnerswho so choose with a genuinely free choice to import under their own arrange-ments instead of through the Raw Cotton Commission, and to give them all the help from the Raw Cotton Commission that may be needed to overcome particular difficulties inherent in the change-over, or in the conditions of the present time.For example, this option would be hollow if it carried no proper &quot;facilities forcover, which is essential to most units in this industry. We propose, therefore, that unless and until at some future time some form of cover not using public fundsbecomes available, cover should be provided by the Raw Cotton Commission tothat part of the trade that exercises the option to contract-out. The&apos;proposed arrangements for cover are described in detail later and correspond, though notexactly, as closely as we think practicable, to those available to the rest of thetrade. Some public money must on this account remain at risk, though not, we&quot;consider, significantly more so than at present. There is also a further point. in framing the plan, we have had in mind the need for it to be adjustable to changingforeign exchange restrictions. But the plan in its present form requires that thenumber of countries from which imports are to be subjected to separate limitationsbe kept low.40. Though our object has been to give spinners, who exercise the option to contract-out, a perfectly fair field, the alternative offered to them cannot be completely independent or presented to them entirely cut and dried. Our schemeimplies that the Raw Cotton Commission will be their one source of cover; that fortheir supply of some growths they will have to rely upon the Raw Cotton Corn-mission; and that initially at least they are likely to depend on the willingness ofthe Raw Cotton Commission to help in broadening their facilities. We have complete confidence that the Raw Cotton Commission would enter into the spirit- 42085 - &apos;   &apos;   :: &apos; - &apos; &quot; -,,v:;/    c 2 &quot;
of our recommendations and fulfil their part with complete fairness. nevertheless it is possible that some spinners, may in these circumstances feel some hesitationabout choosing the alternative. Further, while we feel that the plan we proposeis initially appropriate amid the restrictions arising from the present foreign exchange difficulties, if these restrictions persist for any considerable time it willprobably be under changed conditions which might well call for a development or modification of our proposals. For reasons such as these, we recommend that, whenadequate time has eiapsed for some experience of the plan to be gained, the situa-tion should be the subject of a further special review.Part IV. Recommendations41. The recommendations we make below centre on the exercise of an optioneach year by every spinner * whether he wishes to obtain his supply of cotton (ineach of certain stated groups of growths) from the Raw Cotton Commission or to import it on his own account using, as he wishes, the services of merchants. we propose that where the import of any growth of cotton has to be restricted oncurrency grounds, a proportionate &quot; entitlement &quot; should be granted to any spinnerwho chooses to import on his own account such entitlements to be transferable byagreement between the parties and to be cancelled whenever a licence to importcotton is required. We think it necessary to require the option to be. exercisedfor a year at a time, except in the-first year, because in current circumstances thewhole year&apos;s supply of many crops must be bought, if at all, when they move onto the market and also because the present price policy of the Raw Cotton Corn-mission is closely related to its year&apos;s pattern of procurement. We consider thatcover facilities should be made available to all spinners by the Raw cotton commission.We recommend accordingly that:  (I) Each spinner should be required annually to choose whether he will buythrough the Raw Cotton Commission, or on his own behalf, all thegrowths of cotton in each of a number of stated groups. His &quot; annualoption&quot; should be exercised separately for each group, enabling him,if he wished, to buy all his cotton in one group from the Commissionand all his cotton in another himself or through a merchant. (We have proposed the groupings in the Appendix to our recommendations.)(II) By a given date each year the spinner should record his option, and there-after should be regarded as having &quot; contracted-out &quot; from, or remainedwith, the Commission for the ensuing season.! Contracting-outspinners should receive &quot; entitlements &quot; enabling them to import directly,or buy through a merchant, cotton in the particular group. Theseentitlements should be calculated on the same general basis as the raw Cotton Commission^ import programme and should provide forconsumption requirements and some stockholding. (The details ofthe proposed method of calculation are described in the Appendix.)(Ill) Any spinner who contracted-out for the American-type group shouldreceive within his general entitlement a special &quot; dollar-entitlement &quot; in strict proportion to that granted to the Commission. Any spinnerwishing to use a disproportionate amount of non-dollar cotton, e.g.,from Pakistan, should be free to transfer by agreement his dollar-entitle-ment, or any part of it, to any other eontracting-out spinner (who wanted to use a disproportionate amount of United States cotton) or to anymerchant. This transfer would correspondingly assist his acquisitionof his non-dollar cotton. In this way contracting-out spinners would do their own &quot; averaging &quot; between dollar and non-dollar cotton with-out having actually to use a rigid proportion of dollar cotton. It is notenvisaged, at any rate at the start of the plan, that the supply fromcontracting-out spinners wishing to dispose of entitlements will neces-sarily be balanced by the demand from those seeking to acquire them.We have therefore proposed arrangements (as set out in the Appendix)to meet the difficulties which might arise from this and other inequalitiesof opportunity for contracting-out spinners due to their being few in number at the start.* Throughout the recommendations, and in the Appendix, we refer to &quot; spinners,&quot; but the termis intended to apply to all consumers of raw cotton.f Subject to the provision for &quot; contracting-in &quot; in paragraph 14 of the Appendix.
-   (IV) Licences to import cotton should be issued against entitlements., original.  or transferred.   (We assume this to be practicable.)   An import licenceapplication not greater than: the entitlement (original or transferred) of the  applicant should be sponsored by whatever organisation it may, be. decided should keep the records. ... The import licences would be issued under the authority of the Minister concerned and it may be foundconvenient that an Advisory Panel should be drawn from the,interested parties to advise him on the administration of the scheme;(V) The Raw Cotton Commission should continue its cover arrangements forspinners, manufacturers, doublers and converters. It should also pro-vide cover either at the Commission^ current symbol price or, ifpreferred, at the sterling equivalents of New York and Alexandriafutures prices, for any contracting-out spinner or merchant who signsa cover agreement with it. (The proposed cover arrangements are setout in detail in the Appendix.)   And(VI) There should, at the appropriate time, be a further review of the situation.42. Our recommendations have been framed to fit the complications arisingparticularly from the restrictions placed on dollar expenditure for cotton. Wemust record that the weight of the evidence put before us has impressed us withthe handicap which the industry in this country suffers from the. fact that dollar,restrictions have borne more heavily upon it than upon many of its competitors.
APPENDIX TO recommendations we set out below the first five recommendations we have made in our Report,followed by our proposals for operating each in practice.,Recommendation I&quot; Each spinner should be required annually to choose whether he will buy throughthe Raw Cotton Commission, or on his own behalf, all the growths ofcotton in each of a number of stated groups. His &apos; annual option &apos; shouldbe exercised separately for each group, enabling him, if he wishes, to buyall his cotton in one group from the Commission and all his cotton in anotherhimself or through a merchant.&quot; .. Proposals for Operation&apos;(a) Groups1.   The groups should be as follows:  Group I (American Type)*United States (excluding   t (a) British West Africa. Iran. &apos;    !\Calif ornian), Belgian Congo. ,    tlraq.*Mexieo. French Equatorial Syria.*Salvador. Africa. Turkey.*Nicaragua. (b) American Seed Greece.Uruguay. Sudan. t Cyprus.Paraguay. t (b) East African (ex- U.S.S.R.South Brazil. eluding BP. 52).t India.1&quot; Pakistan.t Burma. *China.Group II (Egyptian Type)Egypt.(b) Sudan (other than American seed).(a) Aden.*Haiti.. North Brazil. &quot;-   t (b) Uganda BP. 52.Group IIIPeru.*Calif ornian.t - &apos;Group IVt (a) West Indian Sea Island.(b) Date for Exercising Option.2. The period for &quot; contracting-out&quot; should be related to the time at whichthe most important growth in each group moves and should begin at the earliestmonth in which that growth could reach this country. Thus in American typethe &quot;dominant growth&quot; is obviously United States cotton, and the contracting-out period might be September to August. This period seems also appropriate forEgyptian type; but as the dominant growth in Group 3, (Peruvian) is produced in the Southern hemisphere, the period should be March to February. whatever the period, it is important that contracting-out mills receive their importing rights in good time before the period starts at least one month, if possible two. Noticeof intention to contract-out should be given one month earlier still, e.g., for Group I(assuming the opening month is September) by 1st June, or at latest 1st July.* Dollar countries (see paragraph 5).t Sterling countries.(a) R.C.C. buys all exportable surplus (see paragraph 16(a)).(b) R.C.C. buys in bulk (see paragraph 16 (b)).
Recommendation II&quot; By a given date each year the spinner should record his option, and thereaftershould be regarded as having &apos; contracted out&apos; from, or remained with, the:;&apos;&quot; Commission for the ensuing season.* Contracting*out spinners shouldreceive &apos; entitlements&apos; enabling them to import directly, or buy through a merchant, cotton in the particular group. These entitlements should be calculated on the same general basis as the Raw Cotton Commission^import programme, and should provide for consumption requirements andsome stockholding.&quot;Proposal for OperationFormula for Calculation of Entitlements3. These entitlements should be calculated on a formula which leaves no room for doubt that each mill is receiving comparable treatment, both vis-a-vis othermills which have contracted-out, and vis-a-vis those remaining as customers ofthe Raw Cotton Commission.4. The formula we propose to meet these requirements is calculated asfollows :  i :.&apos; &apos;(i) The base period for consumption should be the twelve months ending31st May (30th November, for Group III) immediately preceding the contracting-out period.(ii) The import entitlement for the whole trade in a forthcoming season fora group of cottons can be assessed as follows. From the base periodconsumption is estimated the likely increase (or decrease) in the nextyear (we assume for illustration an increase of 3 - 6 per cent.) and tothis consumption requirement is added the permitted end-season stockallowance (which we have taken as equivalent to 13 weeks&apos; consump-tion). From this is deducted the stock at the beginning of the season(which can be closely estimated). For example, in Group I (assuming the period is September to August) the calculation might be asfollows:  1.2.3.4.5.6.Group I (Whole Trade)Consumption in Base PeriodExpected Consumption in ensuingyear ...Permitted   End-year   Stock   (31stAugust)Total of (2) and (3).........Deduct Opening StockTotal Import Programme, i.e., (4)less (5)      ............Metric Tons (2,204 lbs.)280,000 (actual or estimated).290,000   (3-6   per   cent,   increaseassumed over base period).75,400 (assumed as  13 weeks inrelation to (2)).365,400.72,800 (actual or estimated).292,600.(iii) We propose that the identical calculation be made in respect of eachcontracting-out mill as follows:  A Contt acting-Out Spinner7. Consumption in Base Period8. Expected Consumption in ensuingI, year ...9. Permitted End-year Stock10. Total of (8) and (9) ......11. Deduct Opening Stock     ......12. Total Entitlement, i.e. (10) less (11)2,210 (actual).2,290 (3-6 per cent, increase, as (2)above).595 (13 weeks&apos; in relation to (8)).2,885.221 (actual or estimated).2,664.It will be seen that we have assumed that initially actual stocks at an individual mill will be much less than the whole trade&apos;s (which includes the Commission^ own stock).* Subject to the provision for&apos;&quot; contracting-in &quot;&apos; in paragraph 14 below.
(iv) The sum of the entitlements of contracting-out spinners should be deducted from the total entitlement and the remainder should be the total entitle-ment of the Raw Cotton Commission.(v) It will be observed that the resulting entitlement (12) is larger in relationto the base period consumption (7), than is the total import programme(6) in relation to (1). This is the result of enabling the contracting-outspinner (or a merchant on his behalf) to import sufficient cotton toraise his opening stock level (11) to the 13 weeks&apos; level or what-ever level is permitted for the trade as a whole shown under (3) and (9).To the extent that the spinner himself does not wish to hold stocks atthis level the merchant will be able to build up some spot stocks. Asthe total of all contracting-out spinners&apos; entitlements will be deducted from the total import programme the effect is likely to be that the raw cotton Commission^ import programme will be correspondingly lower,and this in turn should cause it to run down stocks by the amount thatthey exceed the level allowed for the trade as a whole.Recommendation III&quot; Any spinner who contracted-out for American-type group should receive within his general entitlement a special &quot; dollar entitlement&quot; in strict proportion to that granted to the Commission. Any spinner wishing to use a disproportionately-portionate amount of non-dollar cotton, e.g., from Pakistan, should be free to transfer by agreement his dollar entitlement or any part of it, toany other contracting-out spinner (who wanted to use a disproportionateamount of United States cotton) or to any merchant. This transfer wouldcorrespondingly assist his acquisition of his non-dollar cotton. In this waycontracting-out spinners would do their own &quot; averaging &quot; between dollarand non-dollar cotton without having actually to use a rigid proportion of dollar cotton. It is not envisaged, at any rate at the start of the plan,that the supply from contracting-out spinners wishing to dispose of entitle-ments will necessarily be balanced by the demand from those seeking toacquire them. We have therefore proposed arrangements to meet thedifficulties which might arise from this and other inequalities of opportunityfor contracting-out spinners due to their being few in number at the start.&quot;Proposals for Operation(a) Calculation of Dollar Entitlement5. It is expected that the Treasury will set a limit, within the total importentitlement of the trade, on the quantity that may be imported from dollar&quot; (and perhaps other scarce currency) sources. We propose that each contracting-outmill should receive exactly the same proportion of &quot; dollar-entitlement&quot; to histotal entitlement for each group as does the trade as a whole. The Raw cotton commission^ dollar-entitlement will then be the residue of the trade?s dollar-entitlement after substraction of those of the contracting-out spinners.(b) Distribution and Transfer of Entitlements6. We must make it clear that in our recommendations we have assumed thatthe Treasury will find it necessary to set strict limits to dollar expenditure on raw cotton; and that it may also be necessary to limit, at any rate initially, total expen-diture in other currencies outside the sterling area. But we must emphasise thatthe scheme depends on there being no other restriction on expenditure by source.We do not see how it could work if &quot; entitlements &quot; for a number of differentgrowths had to be separately issued, and exchanged. Moreover, the aim of our recommendations is that the spinner who so wishes should be free to choose between the various growths according to price and quality.7. To calculate the contracting-out spinners&apos; entitlements on the formula indi-cated, we think those concerned should agree upon and maintain a representative body to keep the records concerning entitlements. Individual contracting-outspinners would have to be prepared to pledge themselves in advance to accept the calculations of this body. In particular, if the scheme is to be put into earlyoperation, time will make it impossible for appeals to be considered without,jeopardising the whole operation of the scheme.
8. After these entitlements had been distributed, they would be transferable,until finally cancelled against an import licence. The effect of applying the formulaset out in paragraph (5) above will be that each contracting-out spinner will receiveat the start the same proportion of dollar entitlement as every other spinner. But hewill not necessarily wish to consume the exact proportion&apos;of dollar cotton whichthe formula allows him. Some spinners who have previously used a larger propor-tion of United States cotton than the general average may wish to continue to doso; others who may have been using, for instance, Pakistan cotton, may prefer togo on doing so provided that they do not lose the benefit they previously enjoyedunder the Raw Cotton Commission^ &quot; averaging &quot; policy, of securing this cottonat prices more related to its spinning value. We therefore propose that spinnersshould be permitted to exchange entitlements freely by private agreement; in thisway, a regular system of interchange of entitlements would grow up betweenspinners who wish to use a larger proportion of &quot; cheap &quot; dollar cotton&quot;than theirown dollar entitlements permit, and spinners who do not wish to use their fullentitlements of dollar cotton. Through this system the spinner of, e.g., Pakistancotton who wishes to dispose of his dollar entitlement could do so, and thus aid hisacquisition of the more expensive non-dollar cotton. In this way spinners would,as we have indicated, do their own averaging.(c) Safeguards for &quot; Contracting-Out &quot; Spinners(i) Interchange of entitlements between the Raw Cotton Commission andContracting-Out Spinners9. At the start of the plan the demand from prospective acquirers of entitle-ments will not necessarily be balanced against the supply from prospective disposers.To avoid disadvantage thereby arising some special arrangement should be devisedif the contracting-out spinners are few in number or do not form a representativecross-section of the mills in the group. (If they do form a cross-section they shouldhave less difficulty in redistributing the entitlements so that each spinner securesthe cotton of his choice). We propose as a special arrangement that they shouldbe allowed some interchange of entitlements with the Commission at its discretion.We do not think that this would create difficulties for the Commission. If thenumber of contracting-out mills is small, so will be the effect on the Commission(and its customers). If the number is large, the need for such arrangements will bereduced, as mills&apos; opportunities for interchange among themselves will be correspondingly greater. It is desirable that such transactions, and the dependence of contracting-out spinners on the Commission, should be kept to a minimum.In so far as such interchanges are necessary the terms on which the commission would be prepared to enter into them would be a matter to be settled by it withthe trade.10. Another difficulty we foresee at the start of the scheme is that, in the eventof any delay in shipping early new crop cotton, the contracting-out spinner might find himself in difficulties because of inadequate stocks. We think, therefore, that even after the period opens he should have the right to buy from the Commission ontransfer to it of the appropriate entitlements. Cotton so bought would probably not represent an exact cross-section of the mill&apos;s total entitlement, dollar and non-dollar, so the sale price would be replacement cost of the cotton rather than theCommission^ normal issue price. As the spinner will presumably not contract-outunless he thinks he can derive some benefit from doing his own purchasing, wethink there is little danger of these facilities being misused. After the first year theproblem could be met by allowing mills who wish to contract-out (or to remainso) and are able to give early notice of their intentions, advance entitlements equalto say 30 per cent, of the current year&apos;s entitlement. But by the end of the first year of its option, a contracting-out firm should have secured sufficient stock, underthe formula in paragraph 4 above, to carry it through until the new crop of thenext year is available.11. It is possible that an individual contracting-out spinner might find thatduring the year his consumption was likely to increase beyond the extent envisaged in the estimate made for the trade as a whole, and that his individual entitlement,being related to this estimate, was inadequate. If this occurred we think it shouldbe open to him in necessity to. apply to the proposed body (described in paragraph above) for a supplementary entitlement. &apos;  &apos;42085 d
(ii) Allowance for Quality12. If the number of contracting-out firms in any group is small, it might happen that they, or merchants buying on their behalf, found that too large a partof their entitlement consisted of cotton which on arrival proved unsuitable. the size of this problem is likely to be in inverse proportion to the number of millscontracting-out&apos; since the larger this is the easier will it be to find a mill preparedto take up cotton which another mill finds to be unsuitable. The problem couldbe met by setting aside a margin to increase the calculated entitlements of con-tracted-out firms by a percentage inversely related to the proportion they representof the total trade in that group. Thus if the entitlements of contracting-out mills ina given group amount to X per cent, of the total import programme for the wholetrade in that group, the margin for each should be 10^Q X per cent, of its entitle-ment, unless otherwise determined by the Advisory Panel mentioned below (seeparagraph 19). If contractors-out represented 20 per cent, of the trade in that group, their entitlements would be increased by 8 per cent..; if 40 per cent, theincrease would be 6 per cent. To ensure that this did not result in the Raw cotton commission^ customers finding themselves at a disadvantage, the same formulashould be applied to the Commission^ entitlement. Where a merchant was theimporter, he could retain the margin to enable him to sell to the spinner with arejection clause.13. So that currency was not wasted in amassing rejected bales, merchants and importing spinners should be allowed to exchange such bales with the Corn-mission if it thought such cotton suitable for its own customers. While we think the Commission should be free and ready to help in this way, we do not recom-mend that it should be obliged to enter such transactions.(iii) &quot; Contracting-In &quot;14. Some spinners may feel that they cannot, without experience of trading in the present uncertain market conditions, take the risk of contracting-out if thisentails their remaining responsible for their own import arrangements for a full year before they are free to &quot;contract-in&quot; again. Lest spinners be deterred by such doubts from exercising their option, arrangements should be made for themto contract-in again before the end of the initial period, provided the terms of their return are not such as to give them an advantage in price or supply (e.g., of dollarcotton) over firms which have not contracted-out in the first place or have remainedcontracted-out.15. Similar arrangements should be made to ensure that any spinner who wishes to contract-in at the end of the period has thereby no unreasonable advan-tage (or disadvantage) vis-a-vis others. Regard would have to be had to his stock position and an equitable settlement negotiated.(iV) Bulk-Bought Cottons16.   There may be a special problem for contracting-out spinners who havebeen using cottons which the Commission buys in bulk (see paragraph 1) either-(a) those of which the Commission buys the whole exportable surplus, in which case the growth has strictly no market price, and the contracting-outspinner no market to buy in; or(b) those of which the Commission buys part but not the entire crop, theremainder being sold.in the normal way, sometimes at auctions.17. As regards (a), we propose that contracting-out mills should be entitledto obtain their proportionate share from the Commission at its issue price.18. As regards (b), if the number of contracting-out users is large, we hopeit would be found possible for the Commission to reduce the proportion of itspurchasers by arrangement with the supplying country. If it is small, there shouldbe no difficulty in the way of such spinners obtaining their requirements by theordinary means. But if for any reason difficulties occur, we think the commission should be prepared either to supply such mills, up to their proportionate share,from its own. stocks at current replacement prices; or to act as their agent (orthe agent of their supplying merchant) in obtaining the cotton for them.
Recommendation IV&quot; Licences to import cotton should be issued against entitlements, original ortransferred. (We assume this to be practicable.) An import licence applica-tion not greater than the entitlement (original or transferred) of the applicantshould be sponsored by whatever organisation it may be decided should keep the records. The import licences would be issued under the authorityof the Minister concerned and it may be found convenient that an AdvisoryPanel should be drawn from the interested parties to advise him on theadministration of the scheme.&quot;Explanation19. We assume it should be a comparatively straightforward matter for an import licence to be issued against the entitlement notified by the recording body.But it may be that other points of technical difficulty will arise as the schemeproceeds, and for this reason we have proposed the setting up of a small panel,consisting of representatives of the parties most concerned, to advise the Govern-ment as necessary.Recommendation V&quot; The Raw Cotton Commission should continue its cover arrangements for spinners,manufacturers, doublers and converters. It should also provide cover either at the Commission^ current symbol price or if preferred, at the sterlingequivalents ,of New York and Alexandria futures prices, for any contracting-out spinner or merchant who signs a cover agreement with it.&quot;Proposals for Operation20. There should be no difficulty in the Raw Cotton Commission continuingits existing arrangements for spinners who elect to remain its customers. But wehave made clear in our report that contracting-out spinners are unlikely in presentcircumstances to find equivalent cover facilities outside the Commission. Similarly,without some cover facilities merchants might be deterred from collecting entitle-ments, importing and holding stocks. We therefore propose that contracting-outspinners and the merchants serving them should have the right to cover with theCommission. Such spinners and merchants would have to enter into a cover agree-ment with the Commission. Spinners should be able, as at present, to cover both&quot; long &quot; positions, i.e., cotton required in anticipation of orders to keep mills runninguntil a sale is made, and &quot; short &quot; positions arising from sales of yarn made beforecotton can be bought.21. We do not think the Commission could cover contracting-out spinners and merchants in exactly the same way as it now covers those it serves, because it couldnot offer cover at its own prices for a precise quality of cotton when it would nothave ready means of verifying the quality of the cotton to be covered. But it could offer cover at the Commission^ current symbol price for the growth of cotton con-cerned; or if the importer preferred, cover at the sterling equivalent of New YorkFutures prices; or of Alexandria Futures prices, if that market was operatingnormally. (If it were not, modifications might have to be worked out, e.g., by theAdvisory Panel we have suggested in paragraph 19 above.) The choice of method would have to be made irrevocably at the time cover was applied for; and themonth of maturity named at the same time. Should the cotton still remain unsoldby the time quotations for this month ceased to appear, the cover might be trans-ferred to a more distant month (but without payment of any difference for the spread in price between the two months at the date of transfer).- In convertingNew York quotations to sterling the official par rate of exchange should be used.As the cover would only be needed for price changes between the dates of purchase and sale, it would not be necessary for the Commission to make allowances for transport; but it would be desirable that a percentage addition should be made toallow for the fact that New York quotations refer to gross weight and for expenseitems such as insurance, which depend on the value of the cotton.
22. It will be necessary to ensure that there is no abuse on account of prior-knowledge.
