CABINET OFFICE 4TRECORD COPYS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(tj2)  107 COPY NO.   (kcl8TH APRIL.  1952CABINETCLOSURE OF BRITISH FIRMS IN china memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should like to craw the attention of my colleagues tothe intention of the major British firms operating in China to close down operations. *2. The decision to cease operations in China has been takenentirely by the firms themselves as the result of the increasingdifficulties placed in their way over the past two years by theCentral People&apos;s Government,3. The main difficulties are:-(i)    The Chinese Government&apos;s policy of State trading.(ii)    The intransigence of the labour unions with the supportof the Chinese Government.(iii)   Arbitrary judgment of law courts and unfair taxation,both of which are discriminatory against foreigners.(iv)    The doctrine of personal responsibility whereby each individual manager is held responsible for the firm&apos;policy and acts.(v)    Increasing restrictions on the entry and exit offoreign staffs.x   The following firms have decided to withdraw from China:-Alfred Holt &amp; Co.Arnhold Trading Co. Ltd.British American Tobacco Co. Ltd.  (transfer arrangements to Chinese &quot;ownership&quot; almost completed).Butterfield &amp; SwireChartered Bank of India, Australia and ChinaChina Engineers, Ltd.Hong Kong and Shanghai BankImperial Chemical Industries, Ltd.Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd.Lever Bros.  (China) Ltd.Liddell Bros. &amp; Co.Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.Mercantile Bank of India Ltd.Mollers Ltd.Patons &amp; Baldwins, Ltd.Sassoons.Shell Petroleum Co.Union International Co., Ltd.Wheelock Harden &amp; Co., Ltd.
k* This victimisation cf private trading interests is not confined to British firms but is applied to all foreign firmsoperating in China.    The British firms have been the first totake the decision to cease operations.    They have, however, by far the biggest stake in China of all foreign interests.   the nearest estimate, at pre-war values, of the total value of Britishproperties in China is about  125 millions,5. The firms wish to cease operations as soon as possible and to make application to do so on or about 1st May.    closure of these firms will be a serious blow to our world trading interests, but the firms have hung on for as long as they can and it has been no easy decision for them to take after their longand honourable connection with China.    The plain truth is thatChina, as a Communist state, is inimical to t he Western system and is anxious to shake off the &quot;foreign capitalist yoke&quot; as soonas it possibly can.    The same process occurred in Soviet russian 1927, only more quickly.6. The firms will inevitably encounter serious difficultiesin their closing down operations.   They will be met withextortionate demands for wages and taxes, etc.,  and until all claims against them are met, the Chinese will keep the british staff remaining in China as virtual hostages.    I am sure that my colleagues will agree that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must, inthese later stages, do&apos;everything they can to help the firms.If my colleagues agree, I will circulate a paper on the varioustechnical aspects involved in the closure operations to theEconomic Policy Committee for their information and with recommendations for action.7o Meanwhile, the firms would like Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto authorise I-I.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking to submit, as an interim measure, a note to the Central Peopled Government assoon as possible, drawing their attention to the seriousdisabilities under which British firms in China are operating.The general view is that in order not to provoke the ChineseGovernment into possible immediate retaliatory action against british staffs in China, the terras of the note should be as anodyneand as factual as possible.    I attach as an annex the draft ofsuch a note.    H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires may have to be instructedto send a further note.to the Chinese Government on about 1st Maystating that the firms wish to cease operations and requestingfacilities for this and for the withdrawal of British staff.8. I do not know how the Chinese will react to the note;they may simply ignore it.   On the other hand they may even sayor do something to imply that conditions for t he firms vail improve.Whatever the reaction, however, the firms are unanimously agreedthat there is no point- in their continuing operations in Chinaand their only aim is to cease operations on the best termspossible and to withdraw their British staff who they fully realiseare in a most unenviable position.9. The Foreign Office have been in consultation with theTreasury, Board of Trade and Colonial Office throughput overthe firms&apos; decision.Recommendations10. I accordingly invite my colleagues:(i)    to take note of the intention of British firms in Chinato apply to the Chinese authorities on about 1st may to cease operations;(ii)    to approve the text of the attached draft note to theChinese Government.Foreign Office, S,W.l.,8TH APRIL,  1952,A.E,
annex draft NOTE FOR PRESENTATION BY H.M.  CHARGE D1 AFFAIRES.PEKING.  TO THE CENTRAL &quot;PEOPLE&quot;g GOVERNMENT        i&quot;British firms have been, facing increasing difficultiesin China which have been handicapping them in carrying out their legitimate trading activities.   Among these diffi-culties are the following:-(i)   The making of each individual manager personallyresponsible for the policy and acts of hiscompany, in some cases for acts before hebecame manager.(ii)   The increasing restrictions on the entry and exitof foreign staff.(iii)   The cancellation by the Chinese Government&apos;strading organisations of former contracts, eventhough raw materials have been paid for andprocessed.(iv)    Taxation and legal judgments which both appearto be discriminatory against foreigners.(v)    Uncertainty caused to British subjects by the fear of arrest and detention incommunicadoand without charges being preferred.(vi)   Pressure by the labour unions and reluctanceby the local authorities to give any protection to firms who are being accused by the unionsof malpractice.If this situation continues it can. only result,sooner or later, in the elimination of British business interests in China to the detriment of friendly relationsbetween China and the United Kingdom.    I am thereforeinstructed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, at the requestof the British firms principally concerned, to bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs to the notice ofthe Chinese Government.
