CABINET office record COPY copy NQ-    QQC. (52) 1392nd MAY, 1952.CABINETLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Minister of HealthAt their meeting on 24th April (C.C.(52) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, to draw upfor their further consideration a detailed legislative programme for therest of the Parliamentary Session, taking into account the points madein their discussion, including the desirability of enacting the transport bill before Christmas.2.    The principal factor in drawing up this programme is the timeneeded for the Transport Bill.   We are now advised that this Bill islikely to consist of some 60 clauses and we propose that seventeen days shouldbe allowed for it in the House of Commons, made up as follows:-Second Reading and Money Resolution. ........ 3Guillotine Motion........................... committee................................. report. .. *................................. 3Third Reading...............................13.     Another important factor is that reasonable time must be allowed for the Bill to be studied before Second Reading and intervals must be allowedbetween the various stages of the Bill, viz, , after Second Reading and beforeCommittee stage to allow amendments to be put down;  and after committee stage and before Report to give time for points raised during the committee stage to be considered.4.      We suggest that about three weeks should be allowed for the Billto be studied before Second Reading.   But in order to allow some sitting time,as well as the Summer Recess, between Second Reading and Committee,, theSecond Reading should be taken as early as possible.   After consultationwith Parliamentary Counsel and the Ministry of Transport, we thinkthat the aim (which should just provide enough time for drafting of theBill and for its consideration by Ministers) should be to present the Billin the House of Commons on Thursday, 3rd July and to publish it on 4th or5th July;  the Second Reading debate might then run either from Tuesday, 22ndto Thursday 24th July or   from Monday 28th to Wednesday 30th July.We assume that the House will adjourn not later than 8th August.5.      We have considered the following alternative time-tables for therest of the discussion of the Transport Bill, with the aim of sending theBill to the House of Lords in time to allow approximately a month fordiscussion in that House before Christmas.
A0fIn order to avoid the difficulties of the above programme, in whichthe Committee stage would be allotted four days a week for two weeks and only Fridays would be available during the first three weeks of the session for other urgent matters or debates (which would be difficult tojustify after two months&apos; recess, and, I think, impossible to implement inpractice), the House might come back on Tuesday, 7th October.   A time-tableMotion could then be taken on 9th October and the Committee stage would begin on 13th October and end not later than 29th October.   This would spread the Committee stage over a period of eleven sitting days, excluding Fridays,and would thus allow two days for urgent business such as votes of censure; andit would, by allowing a&apos;break in the Committee stage, afford some relief to those handling the Bill.   Committee stage would be followed by an interval of eleven days, including two weekends.   The Report Stage would be taken from Monday - Wednesday, 10th - 12th November and third Reading onMonday, 17th November.   The Bill would reach the House of Lords two daysearlier than under Alternative A.6.     Our considered view is that to defer the re-assembly of Parliamentuntil 14th October would be too dangerous, because of the short intervalwhich it would permit between Committee stage and Report, and because ofthe need to reserve some time for other business in the first three weeks of the session.   Indeed, any unforeseen event requiring the attention of parliament would wreck the programme under Alternative A.   We therefore suggest thatAlternative B should be adopted.   This offers a more reasonable time-table in the House of Commons and some relief to the House of Lords,The Commons would reassemble on Tuesday, 14th October, and a time-table motion would be taken on l&amp;th October.   The Committee stage wouldoccupy the whole of the period Monday to Thursday in the two successiveweeks beginning on ZOth and 27th October,   together with the following monday, 3rd November;  the Report stage would be taken on Wednesday,12th, Thursday, 13th, and Monday, 17th November and third Reading onWednesday, 19th November.   Thus, excluding the period of the Recess, a littleover three weeks would be allowed between Second Reading and the firstmeeting in Committee;  and only eight days including a week-end between theCommittee stage and Report.   We consider that this interval betweenCommittee stage and Report is less than adequate.If this programme is to be carried out despite this difficulty, theLords1 amendments are not likely to reach the Commons until Thursday,18th December at earliest and, under the most favourable assumptions the session would have to continue until Christmas Eve.   The House of lords would, however, have the bare minimum of time to deal with the Bill.It is worth commenting that the Labour Government allowed ?.\ weekswhile the House was sitting between introduction of their Transport bill and Second Reading, Zj weeks after Second Reading before the first meeting in Standing Committee and another 2 weeks between the last meeting inStanding Committee and the Report stage.   In addition to those intervals therewas the christmas Recess between Second Reading and Committee andthe Easter Recess between Committee and Report.   Conservative criticismwas directed against them for rushing contentious legislation through parliament.Alternative B
Sax7.      None the less we are concerned at the shortness of the time which,under either alternative, will be given to the House of Lords to considerthe Transport Bill.   We think it more than likely that it will not prove possibleto complete all stages by Christmas.   If that should be so, we suggestthat the Commons might consider the Lords&apos; amendments in January, whenit will be necessary, in any case, for Parliament to meet in order formally to prorogue.8.    - We estimate that under the time-table of Alternative B it shouldbe possible to complete within the session all other Bills at presentbefore Parliament, though some could not be discussed until the autumn and certain urgent small Bills would have to be taken with other business or after 10 o&apos;clock.   We have assumed that the Iron and Steel Bill willnot be proceeded with this Session.H.C.Ministry of Health, W. 1.2nd MAY, 1952.
