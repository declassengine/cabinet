annex draft OP THIRD PERSON NOTE TO UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR:KATYN MASSACREHer Ida jesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs presents his compliments to the United states ambassador and, with reference to the letter&apos; s Note No. 531.0of the 3rd April, has the honour to state that urgent consideration is being given to His Excellency&apos;s request .for the assistance of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in making available to the Select Committee of the House ofRepresentatives of the United States Congress, which isinvestigating the Katyn Forest Massacre, certain reports and documents on this subject.     As regards foreign nationals, who may be resident in this country, it wouldbe contrary to.the practice of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto make their addresses available.      If, however, theUnited States Embassy deliver at the Foreign Officeindividual communications inviting the assistance of eachof the aliens concerned whom they believe to be resident in this country, these communications will be transmitted to their destinations, in so far as this may pyove to bepossible.     It will then remain for the aliens themselvesto respond or not, as they wish, to such requests as areaddressed to them by, or on behalf of, the Select Committeeof the House of Representatives.     As regards the request for the addresses of certain British officers, &quot;who mightbe able to provide information, if the United States Embassydeliver at the Foreign Office individual communicationsinviting their assistance, arrangements will be made forthese to be forwarded.2.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom understand from your Excellency that the Select Committee are likelyto adopt one of the following courses of action;-(a) To invite witnesses from the United kingdom to present themselves for examination duringthe hearings to be conducted in the federal german Republic;(b) To take depositions privately in the United kingdom from available witnesses;(c) To hold formal, public hearings in the United Kingdoms.3.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government can see no difficulty in theway of voluntary attendance at hearings of the SelectCommittee in the Federal German Republic of private persons resident in the United Kingdom.      But it is the opinion ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government that the following considerations would apply with varying force to the courses of actionoutlined in (b) and (c) above:-(i)    The Select Committee would have no power in theUnited Kingdom to compel the attendance of anywitness, nor any power to require a witness togive evidence.     The administration of oaths
in this country is strictly regulated, and her M&amp;majesty&apos;s Government take the view that,in the absence of specific authority from parliament, it would not be proper for theCommittee to take evidenoe on oath even fromwitnesses who are prepared to attend and togive evidence on oath,(is)   Quite apart from any question of the legality of taking evidence on oath, there would beno sanction if false evidence were given bya witness before the Committee, since suchconduct would not be an offence againstEnglish law.(iii) No privilege would attach to the proceedings ofthe Committee, whether written or spoken, inirespect of the English law of defamation, andiall concerned with the proceedings would be fully amenable to proceedings in English courts of law.(iv) Her Majesty^ Government have reason to believe \that if the Committee took evidence in thiscountry there might be public demonstrationsand counter-demonstrations which might well lead to breaches of the peace and thepossibility of serious public disorder.k*      It follows from the foregoing considerations that any proceedings which the Select Committee might decide to holdin the United Kingdom might have embarrassing consequencesboth for Her Majesty,s Government and the United StatesGovernment.
