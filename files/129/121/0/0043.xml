113 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)K QC(65) 93 COPY NO.6th July, 1965CABINETIMMIGRATION OF ASIANS FROM EAST africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the problemI wish to draw rny colleagues attention to the existence in the newly independent countries of East Africa of a considerable number of people of Asian origin who, if they choose to come to this country, arenot subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act.2.      Part I of the Act (which provides for control of immigration)applies to a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies only if his pass-port is issued by or on behalf of the Government of a part of theCommonwealth outside the United Kingdom.    After a territory hasbecome an independent member of the Commonwealth, its Governmentissues passports only to those of its inhabitants who have become citizens of the new State.    The others who have remained citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies must then obtain their passports from the UnitedKingdom Government through the High Commission;  and passports so obtained exempt them from our immigration control.    The citizenshiplegislation of the newly independent countries of East Africa did notconfer citizenship automatically on either -(a) persons who had become citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies by registration or naturalisation in the country concerned, or(b) persons born in the country both of whose parents were bornabroad.The vast majority of such persons are Asians of Indian or Pakistaniorigin who have no connection with the United Kingdom, but who have nocitizenship other than citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.Arguments for control3.      7iTe cannot tell with any accuracy how many of these people thereare, but it is thought that there may be as many as 150, 000 in Kenya a.ndperhaps another 100, 000 in Uganda and Tanganyika.    Malawi and other territories, including those still dependent, might account for another25,000 or 35, 000.-1-

4.      At first these people shewed no tendency to migrate to the UnitedKingdom but reports from the immigration staff at London Airport since december last indicate that they are now arriving at the equivalent of anannual rate of at least 5,000.    Only the arrivals of large parties are reported;   since these people are exempt from control, the arrival cfindividuals or single families is not normally noted.    Nor do any of themappear in our statistics of Commonwealth Immigration, which relate onlyto people subject to control.    The political, economic and social factors which induce them to leave East Africa seem unlikely to change for the better in the near future.    It is hard to justify letting them enter theUnited Kingdom freely while contemplating more stringent restrictions on other categories of Commonwealth immigrants.Means of securing control5.       To bring these people within the scope of Part I of the commonwealth immigrants Act it would presumably be necessary to amend section 1 ofthe Act so as to provide that a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonieswho holds a United Kingdom passport shall be exempt from the controlonly if he &quot;belongs&quot; to the United Kingdom in a sense to be specified in the amended provision.    The qualifying connection with the United kingdom would probably be that the individual or his father or his father&apos;s father -(a) was born in the United Kingdom;  or(b) was naturalised in the United Kingdom;  or(c) was registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies in the United Kingdom or in a country which at the date of registration was mentioned in section 1(3) of the british nationality Act 1948;  or(d) was adopted in the United Kingdom.   /7.      In view cf the pressure of Commonwealth immigration I have thought it right to bring the circumstances outlined in the paper to theattention of my colleagues.    My own view is that legislation depriving them of their existing rights and status as citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies v/ould be difficult to justify.    On the other hand it may be arguedagainst this view that it is not practicable, within the limits of the absorptive capacity of this country, to acquiesce in the entry of another quarter of amillion or more persons of Asian descent who have little or no connectionwith the United Kingdom, and that investigation of possible forms oflegislation to change their legal status and reduce the numbers enteringshould be undertaken.    Clearly the form of any such legislation wouldhave to be most carefully examined; but if, in principle, my colleagues are of opinion that ouch legislation is unavoidable, the necessary studiesshould begin at once before the rate of arrivals increases substantially, asit is perhaps in the nature of things likely that it will, over the presentannual rate of 5, 000.I accordingly invite my colleagues to decide -(i) whether we should accept the position that these entrants shouldhave an unqualified legal right to settle in the United kingdom on a permanent basis;  or(ii) whether studies should be immediately begun with a view toframing legislation to alter their legal status as citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, so that their entry may be restricted.Home Office, 55. w. 1.
