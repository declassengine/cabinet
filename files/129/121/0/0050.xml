PHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)59C.(65) 100 COPY NO.12th July, 1965CABINETLAND COMMISSION:  BETTERMENT LEVYAND CAPITAL GAINS&quot; TAXMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the proposals put forward by the Minister of Land for a progressivebetterment levy appear to proceed, on the assumption that development value is to be taken out of the capital gains tax and subjected only to the betterment levy.2.      I regret that I cannot agree with this assumption.    We have presented the capital gains tax as a comprehensive tax which applies to every sort of capital gain and we have particularly stressed the case fortaxing gains arising from the passive ownership of capital.    development value is the prime example of such gains, and it ought to contribute to theorginary tax revenues of the Exchequer like other gains.     We shall be accused of not knowing our own minds if, having brought it within thecapital gains tax we now take it out again.  ,3.      The levy is intended to recover for the community some proportionof development value.    We can still have a respectable rate of levy (say30 per cent) with a capital gains tax.    Charging development value to levy,notwithstanding its liability to capital gains tax, brings out clearly that itis a special type of gain which ought to bear something extra, beyond theordinary taxation to which a.11 gains are now subjected.4.       Taking development value cut of a capital gains tax means with-drawing reliefs which we have given in the Finance Bill.(a) There would be a clear breach cf faith with the owner-occupier;his development value would pay the same as any one else&apos;s.    The minister has suggested that he will still have enough to buy another house;  but thisis not the point.    My promise to the owner-occupier has been unqualified;there has never been any suggestion of limiting it to people who are buyinganother house.    The House has set great store by this exemption and wehave now extended it to include houses provided for a dependant.(b) The same point arises on the alternative basis cf charge to capital gains tax under which a small man may pay on one half of the gain at hisregular rates of  ax instead of the flat rate of 30 per cent.    My original proposals, which were less favourable, were extended to meet criticismin the House.  &apos; These extensions reflect the importance which the House,including our own supporters, attaches to shading the charge for smallpeople.    Plow can we now render them valueless ?-1-

5.       I have also carefully limited the capital gains tax to gains arisingafter Budget Day so to avoid any possibility of retrospection;  there arespecial provisions in the Finance Bill for establishing the Budget Dayvalue of land with a development value.    The betterment levy as I under-&apos;stand it, will not be limited in this way.    This may be acceptable so longas the levy is a special 3ort of charge and net a tax;  but if (so far asdevelopment value is concerned) it takes the place of the capital gains taxit becomes a tax itself, and a plainly retrospective one.    Retrospectivetaxation is difficult enough to defend at any time, but it becomes quite impossible when it means withdrawing guarantees of non-retros-pectionwhich have already been given.    It is no answer to cay that the levy willnot be imposed at the full rate to begin with.6.      I have set out above the points which I regard as of the greatest importance.    To exclude development value from the capital gains tax would, to my mind, lay us open to serious and justifiable charges of inconsistency in purpose and of disregard for public pledgee.    In addition the exclusion of development value from capital gains tax erodes thesuccess of the tax in meeting the purposes for which it was introduced.7.       There are other important objections to this courso;-(a) A property-dealing company brings in its receipts from sales ofland as a trading receipt and pays income tax - or in future corporationtax - on the net profits.    This would have to continue, with levy being allowed as a deduction.    A land-owning company on the other hand would pay only levy and would be better off - just when the capital gains tax hasbeen introduced to equate capital gains with income.(b) Short-term gains are taxable as ordinary income.    If development value were taken out of the charge short-term gains would pay at the flat rate of levy only instead of paying income tax and surtax at ordinaryrates.    The distinction between long-term gains and the short-term gainsof the speculator, which we have carefully preserved in the Finance bill would be abolished.    There may not be many cases of short-term gains bysurtax payers but when they occur they are well publicised.(c) There would be a difference between the position of a person whosold land directly and one who sold shares in a land-owning company.    Thefirst would pay no capital gains tax on the development value of the land;the second would pay capital gains tax on that part of the increase in thevalue of the sharer, which reflected development value less only a contingent liability to levy.(d) Capital gains tax is to be charged on death, gifts and at a 15-yearlyinterval on property in discretionary trusts so that gains may not escape taxover a long period by passing from hand to hand unrealised..    We have maintained this charge in debate against strong pressure.    To excludedevelopment value from tax on these occasions might result in a prolongeddeferment of any charge on this one particular form of unrealised asset(e.g. where land is kept off the market for reasons of amenity).

CONFIDENTIAL , . .4048.      The argument has been pressed in the Finance Bill debates thatit is wrong to impose two taxes - capital gains tax and estate duty - atthe same time.    We have firmly resisted this pressure.    If the argu-ment is now accepted in relation to levy, which is not even part of theordinary tax system like estate duty, we can expect the argument to be renewed, and more forcibly, next year.9.      These considerations show the kind of quite unnecessarycriticism and difficulties to which we shall expose ourselves if weproceed in the way that has been suggested.    When this matter was discussed by some of my colleagues, I was not present and my position was reserved.    I must therefore ask seriously that the question shouldbe reconsidered.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,9th July, 1965
