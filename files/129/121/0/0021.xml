May 1965C (65) 71 Copy No.    5 911th May, 1965CABINETIMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILES AFTER THE ENDOF 1965Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIt is urgently necessary to take certain broad policy decisions toenable discussions to be started with the developing countries, andprimarily with India, Pakistan and Hong Kong, which export cotton textiles to the United Kingdom.2. Annexed is a paper by the Chairman of the official committee on Commercial Policy which sets out the background tothis complicated issue; explains why the question of the protectionof the British cotton industry after the end of this year involves a break with past policies; and makes recommendations, and in somecases alternative recommendations, as to the courses that might be pursued in 1966 and thereafter.3. My own view is that our objective should be to set a total limit on imports of cotton textiles from less developed countries by meansof a global quota. I should be ready to agree to some measure of country quotas within this total, if this would make the principle more acceptable to the supplying countries and if, as I believe, it might serve to mitigate the pressure on prices in our home market. We should allow an annual rate of increase of \\per cent, which is approximately the likely increase in domestic consumption, in the total import figure,and we should aim at maintaining the new system of protection for atleast three years and preferably for five. This would carry out ourundertakings to the developing countries, while allowing some increasein the Lancashire industry&apos;s sales at home.4. I am satisfied that a scheme on these lines is the best meansof ensuring to the British industry the further period of stability thatit requires to complete the reorganisation in which it is at present engaged. Unless we can offer a solid assurance on the total level ofimports, there is a serious danger that the further capital investment in the industry which the large new groups are now contemplatingmay not be forthcoming on an adequate scale. Without this, I see no prospect of the cotton textile industry becoming an effective part ofour economy, and there would be a serious risk of wasting the investment that has already occurred over the last two or three years.On the other hand, given the assurance of a predictable limit uponimports of low-cost textiles, I believe it is now reasonable to expectCONFIDENTIAL5692 A
that the industry will, by 1970, be highly capital intensive, economicalin the use of labour and well-equipped; and that it will no longerremain the formidable problem which it has been to successive governments for most of the present century.5. I am opposed to the suggestion that we should at presentcontemplate the imposition of a tariff on Commonwealth goods. Thiswould be contrary to all that we have said both about our intentionstowards developing countries in general and about commonwealth trade and-particularly just before a Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference would be likely to precipitate reactions in theCommonwealth which might injure our exports. Even if this were not so, I am not at present satisfied that the use of the tariff would secure a predictable level of imports, which I believe to be essential for thenext few years.6. I do not think that we need or should decide at presentwhether in the longer term we should contemplate tariffs on commonwealth cotton textiles. Long-term policy in this field dependsnot only upon the strength of our own industry but upon the importpolicies of other countries, notably the United States and the european economic Community (E.E.C.). We must see how these develop and how we can influence them before we make our own decisions.7. If my colleagues agree that we should proceed on the broadlines I have suggested, I propose to inform the Cotton Board as quickly as possible of our intentions and to open negotiations with india, Pakistan and Hong Kong immediately thereafter. It is withthese three countries that the main settlement must be hammeredout first.8. I must, however, warn my colleagues that the negotiationswith supplying countries will be difficult and protracted, and that whatever course we take is likely to give rise to a great volume of protest both from them and from the British industry. If we are toreach any kind of of agreement with the developing countries andhonour our obligations to them, we must be prepared to give morethan Lancashire would wish us to offer; and I have little doubt that,in the course of the negotiations, we shall have to make further concessions in order to secure some measure of assent to our proposals both from the affected countries and in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).9. I would hope, however, that by claiming the utmost credit for the fact that we give far greater access to the cotton textileexports of developing countries than any other major industrialisedcountry, we can both persuade the developing countries to acceptsomething on the lines of the proposals I have outlined, and at thesame time join with them in pressing the United States andthe European Community substantially to improve their own poorperformance in this respect.D.

IMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILES AFTER THE END OF 1965Memorandum by the Chairman of the Official Committeeon Commercial policy. Most of our present arrangements for restraining imports of low-cost cotton textiles expire at the end of 1965. The purpose ofthis paper is to obtain decisions from Ministers about thearrangements with which we should seek to replace them. This will involve deciding on the degree and nature of the protection to begiven to the British cotton industry after this year having regardto our international commitments and the interests of our suppliersamong the developing countries, particularly of the Commonwealth.In order not to disrupt business the arrangements for next yearmust be known by the late summer. Negotiations with supplying countries are likely to be prolonged and it is urgent to make a start on them.Background to the present position2. The first voluntary agreements for the restraint of cottontextile exports to this country were concluded with India, HongKong and Pakistan in 1959 after nearly two years of negotiation.Prior to 1958, United Kingdom imports had been rising at a rateof the order of 40 per cent per annum, and there appeared to bean imminent danger of the complete collapse of the British industry which had been declining for most of the present century. the rapid growth of imports coming mainly from the commonwealth and from which the tariff provided no protection, coupled withthe rigidly horizontal structure of the industry, the obsolescenceof much of its equipment and its fragmentation into an immensenumber of small units, threatened to deprive it of all power of recovery. Parallel with action to limit imports, therefore, theCotton Industry Act 1959 was introduced to provide financialassistance for the scrapping of old machinery and the purchase ofnew. The restraint agreements with the three commonwealth countries were re-negotiated for a further three years in 1962.permitting higher export quotas but nevertheless designed toprovide a further period of protection to enable the reconstruction of the industry to proceed in the confidence that it could count ona reasonably stable share of the domestic market.3. From 1962 onwards, however, it became apparent that theindustry did not, in fact, feel this confidence. Following thelimitation of exports from the three Asian Commonwealth countries,other developing countries from every continent except Australasiawhich were building up their textile industries began to supply the British market or to increase supplies which had previously been insignificant. The cyclical recovery in textile demand in thiscountry which began late in 1963 accelerated the process; and byearly 1964, the speed with which imports from some sources weregrowing (cf. Brazil, Colombia, Korea and Malaysia in Table 3 of annex I) led us to impose import licensing of cotton textiles,primarily to discover the extent to which the visible rise in importsCONFIDENTIAL5692 a 2
was accompanied by forward orders threatening a further increase.The volume of forward orders prove formidable. But the only means by which restraint could be secured from all these countries was by negotiation with them on the basis of the GATT Long-TermArrangement on Cotton Textiles (the terms and purpose of whichare described in Annex III). By the end of 1964, we had negotiated,or were in negotiation for, restraint agreements with 19 countries.(These are listed at (a) and (c) of Annex II.) The net result of aprodigious expenditure of time and energy on import limitation has,in fact, been a continuing average rise of some 15 per cent a year in the level of our imports from developing countries since 1958.The total proportion of our consumption now met from imports isabout 40 per cent, of which three-quarters come from less developed countries; and the relation of this proportion to the position in theUnited States and the E.E.C. is illustrated by the following table:4. Until 1963, it appeared that the reconstruction of theindustry which the 1959 Act was designed to foster would not be forthcoming. For although a great deal of obsolete machinery wasscrapped and a considerable amount of modern equipment wasinstalled (the Government contribution to scrapping andre-equipment was about  25 million), and although the closure ofmills was accelerated, there was little sign of any major change inthe horizontal structure of the industry or of the creation ofsignificantly larger units. In that year, however, the two bigman-made fibre producers, Courtaulds and I.C.I., began to buildup what are now their big interests in the industry (they are nowdirectly or indirectly involved in over one-third of the industry&apos;production ) and continued the process vigorously during 1964. Thisoffers the prospect of a radical improvement in the efficiency&apos;of theindustry.The prospects of the British industry. Over the last decade, the continuing contraction of theindustry has resulted in a fall of about 40 per cent in its productionand of about half (from 300,000 to 160,000 in spinning, weavingand finishing) in its labour force. This reduction has not been reflected in high unemployment; unemployment in the cotton areas is below the national average. The growth of other industries inthe North-West has absorbed the available labour, so that thecotton industry now employs only some 7 per cent of the labour inthe cotton belt. This includes a relatively high proportion of olderworkers and there will be a correspondingly high wastage over thenext few years. It is unlikely that by 1970 employment will exceed120,000 and it may well be much less. In the Board of Trade&apos;opinion, however,1 production will not fall in anything like theTotal imports(1963)(th: metric tons)Imports per100,000populationUnited kingdom united States ..E.E.C......9898511855530
same proportion, and may indeed not fall appreciably further if,as now seems probable, productivity in the industry shows a rapid and substantial increase. The scope for such an increase is great,and with the control which the wealthy and efficiently managedman-made fibre firms and their proteges now have in the industry it is likely to be exploited. Increased machine utilisation (ours isstill currently the lowest in the world) by mill grouping, by longruns, and by shift working, which is more acceptable to the newgeneration of union leaders, is already getting under way. The newgroups in the industry also have an essentially vertical conception of organisation; their interest lies largely in the development ofintegrated production, embodying both cotton and man-made fibres,and marketing the sale of branded, advertised products whichitself reduces the scope for imports. But, on the information whichthe groups have given us, it will take them some four to five years to organise and re-equip the sector of the industry they have acquiredduring the last two years or so. This appears to us a reasonableestimate.The decision to be taken6. It is against this background that we haVe considered three questions:(i) Is further protection against imports from developing countries desirable after 1965, and if so, for what period?(ii) If protection is desirable, how should it be provided?(hi) What level of imports should it aim at permitting?The need for further protection7. The Cotton Board has urged in a memorandum (&quot; The case for a viable United Kingdom cotton industry &quot;) to the President ofthe Board of Trade that there should be a period of at least fiveyears of further stability of imports; and this period accords prettywell with that which the new groups say they will need to complete the reorganisation of their acquisitions. The Government are not as yet committed to any period, or to any definition of stability, thoughthe President in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 10th Decembersaid that &quot; The Lancashire industry is now engaged in vigorous and effective reorganisation which must not be impeded by excessiveimports&quot;. Officials are agreed that a further period of quotaprotection is a reasonable objective, though they do not agree onthe length of time for which it should run. Officials are also agreedthat it should be made clear both to the British industry and to the exporting countries that it is intended to adopt a substantially more liberal policy on imports after the period of special protection,though they cannot foresee that the Lancashire industry will ever beable to stand up to Commonwealth competition without some protection by way of tariffs or quotas. Internally a more liberalpolicy on imports is desirable to maintain the vigour and urgency of the present reorganisation and to bring the maximum pressure upon inefficient producers to get out of the industry.

Internally a more liberalpolicy on imports is desirable to maintain the vigour and urgency of the present reorganisation and to bring the maximum pressure upon inefficient producers to get out of the industry. Externally,it is desirable both to facilitate the negotiations with supplying
countries, and to put an end as quickly as practicable to theembarrassments to our relations with a number of overseas countrieswhich the continued special protection of the British cotton industry has involved.The means of protection8. It is not feasible to provide a further period of protection for the British cotton industry simply by extending the existing arrangements. Few countries would be ready to continue these arrangements without an increase in their quotas. Moreover we donot have firm arrangements with a number of existing suppliers:in some cases we are still in negotiation while in others we havearrangements simply designed to hold the position for the time being.With these countries and with the potential new suppliers there are,therefore, no permanent arrangements to extend. Thus if we wereto continue with existing practice we should have to be ready toreach agreements with all existing suppliers and with newcomers asthey emerge. Such a process would involve us in heavy concessionsand would not provide any firm total limit on imports.9. In their memorandum the Cotton Board considered that thebest means of providing continued protection would be by meansof a countervailing levy, i.e., a levy on imports to bring prices to within a defined percentage of fair domestic prices. If this were not practicable they asked for a total quantitative limit to be placed on imports from low-cost sources, preferably accompanied by a tariffat five-sixths of the most-favoured-nation (m.f.n.) rate on imports ofcotton textiles from the Commonwealth. Subsequently they askedfor control to be placed on imports from all sources, not forprotective reasons, but to prevent low-cost supplies being brought inthrough third countries.10. We do not think that it would be practicable or desirable and certainly not negotiable to introduce a countervailing levy on imports of cotton textiles. The majority of the Cotton Boardrecognise this.11. We have also considered the proposal for establishing aCotton Commission to deal in imported goods or to exercise controlover their prices. The establishment of any such Commission would,however, be strongly resisted by the exporting countries who would regard it merely as a machine for collecting a variable levy.Moreover, the Commission would have to attempt to deal in a very wide variety of different cotton textiles (which are much morediverse than jute goods-the only textiles on which bulk buying has so far been tried). Its administration would be intolerably complex and its operation would be subject to constant criticism. For these reasons we could not advise Ministers to establish a cotton commission.The tariff12. The present m.f.n, rates of duty (7  per cent on cottonyarn, 17-J per cent on cloth and 20 per cent on made-up goods) havenot prevented substantial imports from the non-Commonwealth
developing countries to which they apply. The effects of tariffs are hard to predict, but studies made by the Board of Trade suggest that at thepresent time higher levels, particularly on finished cloth and made-upgoods, would be needed to stabilise imports at their present leveland probably to keep the growth of imports within the limits thatwe should adopt if we relied on quotas. The extension of the m.f.n.tariff, even without any preference, to Commonwealth cotton textileswould thus not at present achieve our objective. It would probablybe necessary therefore to increase the m.f.n. rates or to attempt to devise some specific element in the duties to provide effective protection against low-cost imports. Nevertheless the general viewof officials is that, in the longer term and possibly by 1970, therewould be substantial advantages in eliminating quantitative restrictions and using the tariff as the sole means of protection against imports from both Commonwealth and foreign countries ifthis could be negotiated.Quantitative restrictions13. Both the British industry as a whole, as indicated in theCotton Board&apos;s memorandum, and the new groups within it, have placed the greatest possible emphasis on the need for a known limit on imports for the next five years. Their strongest and most bittercriticism of the existing system of quantitative limitation has beenits inability to stop a continuing and unpredictable rise in the importlevel and to prevent new exporting countries from building up sales in this country as a basis for negotiating a &quot; restraint agreement&quot;which will entitle them to maintain or increase those sales. From theGovernments point of view, a more serious criticism of the existing system is that, while providing little satisfaction to the industry, it involves an endless series of acrimonious negotiations with supplying countries (of which the protracted and bitter controversy withMalaysia is only one example). We are accordingly agreed in recommending that any quantitative restrictions after 1965 should provide a total limit on imports from low-cost sources. We alsoaccept the view that to prevent excessive concentration of importson particular goods, there should be separate quotas for a dozen or so categories of goods.Alternative courses14. It is agreed that our objective should be to arrive by 1970at a position where the degree of special protection afforded to theBritish industry can be greatly relaxed and quantitative barriers to imports largely removed. This could most conveniently be done by substituting tariff protection for quotas by 1970. Different views are,however, held as to the timing and methods by which we should move towards this objective.15. The Treasury and Department of Economic Affairs (D.E.A.)consider that, so long as quantitative restrictions are retained, theyshould take the form of a global quota shared by all developing countries. Their main ; reason for this view is that the additionalcompetition engendered among suppliers within a global quota tends to bring down prices and therefore obtains any given volume of
imports for the lowest cost to the balance of payments. Further,imports of cheap yarn and cloth would benefit the manufacturers ofmade-up goods. They consider that the import of a limited quantityof textiles need not substantially disrupt United Kingdom price levels.The Treasury estimate that the additional cost to our balance ofpayments entailed in the present system of country quotas is probablysubstantial.16. These Departments recognise that there will be strong objections, as described in paragraph 20 below, to the completereplacement of country quotas by global quotas especially if theintention were to maintain such quotas for a further period of fiveyears. The difficulties entailed, coupled with the necessity for safeguarding our balance of payments to the maximum possible extent, constitute a strong argument for the substitution of tariffs forquotas at the earliest possible date. Tariffs would have the effect of keeping our import prices down whilst reducing risks of pricedisruption to United Kingdom producers which other Departmentsfear might be entailed in a system of global quotas.17. These departments consider, secondly, that it is desirable tomake clear both to the industry here and to exporting countriesabroad that quantitative controls over imports will be retained for only a limited period. It is common ground that it is essential to givea strong incentive to inefficient firms to improve their efficiency or togo out of business and so release resources for more effective use, but these Departments think that this can best be done by aiming toreplace quotas by tariffs at the earliest practicable date which couldonly be discovered by negotiation. They would therefore advocateintroducing a tariff for the present quotas on imports from theCommonwealth as soon as this could be negotiated. Given the uncertainty of the effect of a tariff, they recognise that quotas would still have to provide the main protection in the early stages butprovided the initial tariff v/as at a sufficiently high level they wouldnot rule out a transitional period during which the quotas were removed by a process of annual expansion and the tariff phased in.They also recognise that it is hardly possible to negotiate the necessary arrangements in the time available before the existing quotaarrangements expire.18. Their proposals are, therefore, (i) that in the forthcomingquota negotiations we should make it clear from the outset that we intend to replace quantitative restrictions by tariffs; (ii) that the newquota arrangements should cover 1966 and 1967 only; (iii) thatduring this period we should negotiate with the countries concerned for the introduction of effective tariff protection; (iv) that the quotaarrangements during 1966 and 1967 should take the form of a globalquota for all imports from developing countries, limiting the annual increase in those years to \\ per cent in order to retain the maximumbargaining power for the subsequent negotiations over tariffs. (the precise nature of these negotiations would depend on whether some increase in m.f.n. rates was felt to be needed or only the introductionof the m.f.n. rate or lower rate on imports from the Commonwealth.
It would, moreover, be necessary to take account of developments inthe Kennedy Round and in the discussions on the review and extension of the GATT Long-Term Arrangement on Cotton Textiles.)19. While the negotiation of such arrangements, as indeed ofany in this field, would clearly be difficult the D.E.A. and Treasurydo not believe that the objections raised by other Departments see paragraph 20 below are soundly based. A tariff would reducethe risks of price disruption. The other countries affected would nodoubt object strongly to any arrangements which obliged them toreduce their prices below those which the existing or any othersystem of country quotas enabled them to charge. But these objections would apply equally at the stage when, as all departments are agreed, quotas were replaced by tariffs. As regards our trade agreements with Commonwealth countries, no reason is seen tosuggest that imposing a tariff on Commonwealth cotton textiles would substantially affect our trade agreements with any countries otherthan India and Pakistan and to a lesser extent, Canada and the irish republic; and with India and Pakistan the agreements are largelyinoperative as regards our exports because of the tight import controls necessitated by both countries&apos; balance of payments difficulties. Treasury and D.E.A. believe that the commonwealth countries affected should in any event see advantages in exchanginga tariff for quotas; and that the strength of our position as much themost liberal country on cotton textiles, importing a third of ourconsumption from low-cost producers would be great enough toenable us to conduct these negotiations successfully at a cost to ourselves which would not be excessive.20. Other Departments consider that these proposals havedecisive disadvantages. They doubt whether the saving to the balanceof payments due to the price effects of global quotas would be significant as a magnitude compared with other factors affecting ourpayments. But, precisely to the extent that the global quota was successful in depressing the prices of imports, it would throughcausing general price disruption fail to secure the confidence andincentives needed by the progressive elements in the industry tocontinue to make the investments needed to raise efficiency. Forthis purpose some price stability as well as a limitation on the total volume of imports is needed. Also, to the extent that prices weredepressed, the method of control solely by global quota would beseen by developing countries as a device to minimise their currencyearnings partly by the transfer of profit from exporters to importersand to force them into cut-throat competition one with another. Thiswould be bitterly resented and would almost certainly prejudice thesuccess not only of the immediate negotiations about the quotas butalso the subsequent negotiations for replacing them with effectivetariffs. The other Departments also consider that to propose now toplace a tariff on imports from the Commonwealth would put our commonwealth Trade Agreements seriously at risk and would raiseat a most awkward moment the whole issue of Commonwealth free entry and preference. It would also accord badly with our recentinitiatives in UNCTAD and the GATT directed to lowering tariff5692B
barriers against the products of developing countries. On all these grounds, the other Departments consider that to launch these ideasat the present time would involve us in difficulties which would be wholly disproportionate to the advantages that are claimed for them.Moreover, even if they could be negotiated, they would not providethe predictable level of imports over the next five years which theindustry seeks.21.   Accordingly, these Departments propose the following alternative arrangements. The United Kingdom should put forward a scheme of global quotas within which a proportion (say half asan opening offer) of the total would be reserved in the form of country quotas for at any rate the larger supplying countries; the licensing of these country quotas would be in the hands of the exporting countries, thus enabling them to exercise some controlover the prices they charged. In negotiation it might well prove .desirable to concede that more than half of the available total shouldbe allocated to the country quotas. Again it may prove desirable to accord country quotas to all existing suppliers. But the aim shouldbe a level of total imports not greater than the average of 1963-64(1964 was an exceptionally heavy year). We should open with an offer to increase imports by l\ per cent a year (which accords roughlywith the expected annual increase in domestic consumption). Itmight be necessary to concede more growth than this, especially onfinished and made-up goods. Whatever growth was conceded, weshould try to secure that it was added in whole or in part to the global quota rather than to the country quotas. We should proposethat the arrangements would run for five years but should be subjectto review after two or three years when arrangements for the period after 1970 might be considered in a preliminary way. At that pointwe could, if it seemed desirable, introduce the idea of a change to a tariff system in or even before 1970; indeed it might be advisablefrom the outset to hint at the possibility of an ultimate tariff solution.22. It may be asked whether it is necessary to concede any increase in low-cost imports over the next five years. Apart from thedifficulty or negotiating an arrangement which made no provisionfor an increase, we think that there are advantages in doing so. Itwould reduce the possibility, if there were some increase in our needs for imports of cotton textiles, that these would be met fromhigh-cost sources. A standstill on imports for the next five years would result in slackening the pressure for reorganisation inLancashire and would encourage the survival of inefficient firms; itwould also make the transition to a freer regime in 1970 moredifficult. Equally important, if we were willing, despite our alreadyhigh rate of imports, to accept some increase, this would help to divert the pressure of the developing countries towards securinglarger increases in the imports of other Western countries. It wouldalso strengthen their hands in doing so. This is very much in our interest.23. The imposition of quotas, as proposed in paragraphs 18and 21 would be formally contrary to the GATT unless we invokedthe emergency provisions of Article XIX. In that case, however, the
application of quotas would have to be non-discriminatory; thiswould mean imposing them on imports from developed countries,which is unnecessary and would lead to further complications and opposition. We think that we could convince the Contracting Partiesthat the scheme proposed was a reasonable application of the GATTLong-Term Cotton Arrangement to our circumstances and could obtain their acquiescence in it.24. With either alternative there will be a number of other international complications, some of them serious. Portugal is a low-cost manufacturer but as she is a member of EFTA we cannotimpose either tariffs or quotas on imports from her. Japan, whosecotton textile exports to us are at present held to a very low level by special Treaty arrangements, which fall to be reviewed this year, will present a special problem. Imports from Eastern European countries and China are already subject to bilateral quotas which we should wish to continue though they may claim to come under the globalquota.Conclusions25. (a) All Departments agree that the British cotton industry should be provided with a further period of special protection againstexcessive imports so as to allow the present reorganisation in theindustry to proceed in an atmosphere of confidence.(by We do not think that we can foresee a situation in whichthe industry will be able to stand up to imports from the Common-wealth without the protection of either quantitative restrictions or a tariff. All Departments agree, however, that our objective should beto end the period of special quota protection by 1970 and that thereafter to provide the necessary protection for the industry bymeans of a tariff, if circumstances permit and this proves negotiable.(c) While all Departments are agreed that we should work towards tariff protection, we are not agreed on the way in which thisshould be achieved:(i) The Treasury and the Department of Economic Affairsconsider that quota protection should be provided only for 1966 and 1967 and that we should aim to get a tariffin force by that time. These Departments consider thatwe should embark as soon as possible on the necessarynegotiations.(ii) Other Departments take the view that we should aim tonegotiate quota arrangements to last until 1970, but thatwe should aim nevertheless well before this time to begindiscussions with other countries about a tariff solution.Thus the Treasury and the D.E.A. favour making it clear now thatwe are working towards a tariff solution; other Departments considerthat this would not provide the Lancashire industry with apredictable level of imports and would also provoke too violent a reaction from Commonwealth countries and that no positive steps should be taken on the tariff for a year or two (though, if ministers agreed, it might be desirable to hint, at least in informal discussionwith Commonwealth countries, at the possibility of a tariff solution).CONFIDENTIAL5692 b 2
(d) Departments are also not agreed on the form of quotaprotection (whatever the period for which it endures):(i) The Treasury and D.E.A. favour global quotas for importsfrom all low-cost producers so that there will be themaximum competition among supplying countries, and accordingly that the cost to the balance of payments willbe least.(ii) Other Departments consider that global quotas alone, byreason of their price effects, would fail to provide thenecessary assurance to Lancashire and would be unacceptable to many exporting countries. The otherDepartments accordingly consider that we should seekarrangements under which exporting countries would begiven quotas equal to half (and probably, afternegotiation, more than half) of their entitlement, with thebalance made available in global quotas.(e) All Departments are agreed that we should open by offering to increase imports by 1 or l\ per cent a year. If quotas were settledfor only two years ((c) (i) above) the Treasury and D.E.A. considerthat every effort should be made to hold growth to this level so asto preserve maximum bargaining power. But if quotas are negotiatedfor five years ((c) (ii) above) all Departments agree that we mustreckon that it will be necessary in negotiation to concede rather higher rates of growth, especially on finished cloth and made-ups.

Annex IIIGATT LONG-TERM ARRANGEMENT REGARDINGINTERNATIONAL TRADE IN COTTON TEXTILESThis Arrangement, which entered into force in the autumn of1962, allows importing countries to deviate from their full GATTobligations towards exporting countries so far as cotton textiles areconcerned. It provides for the imposition of quota restrictions whereimports of particular cotton textiles from particular sources causeor threaten market disruption. Where quotas are imposed, they mustbe increased by 5 per cent per year. The Arrangement also providesfor the progressive increase of those quotas which had been imposed by some countries before the Arrangement was concluded and in thisconnection the E.E.C. undertook to increase their quotas by over10 per cent a year.2. Because the United Kingdom met a much higher proportionof its consumption of cotton textiles from imports than any other major country and because of the exceptional contraction in our industry, we were exempted from general growth obligations in theArrangement by a special Protocol which was accepted by all the participants except Pakistan. The United Kingdom was not, however,exempted from the obligation, to provide some reasonable level oftrade for new supplying countries as they emerged.3. The Arrangement will expire in the autumn of 1967 unless it is renewed in the meantime. In practice there is little doubt thatit will be renewed on some basis or other. It will be an object ofUnited Kingdom policy to see that other developed nations undertakeobligations to allow substantial growth in their imports.4. The United Kingdom supported the negotiation of theArrangement so as to provide a framework for resisting more drasticlimitation of imports from the developing countries which waspossible as a result of protectionist pressures in the United Statesand in parts of Western Europe. Our objects were to minimize the damage to the principles of the GATT to help the interests ofexporting countries in the Commonwealth and, by seeking thelargest possible growth obligations for developed countries, to reducethe pressure on our own market. The way in which the Arrangementhas been used, particularly by the United States, has caused a gooddeal of dissatisfaction in developing countries. Many of thesecountries have indicated that they will be pressing, during the majorreview of the Arrangement which is due to take place late this year,for its re-negotiation or re-interpretation on a basis more favourable to themselves.
