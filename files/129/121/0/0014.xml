MILITARY AID TO INDIA AND PAKISTANMemorandum by the Minister of State, commonwealth relations office at their meeting on 8th April, 1965 (C.C. (65) 24th Conclusions,Minute 3), the Cabinet considered the recommendations on Military aid to India and Pakistan which the Commonwealth Secretary put forward inhis memorandum C.(65) 60 of 6th April,2.       The recommendation for the supply of 30 Kunter fighters toIndia was then agreed subject to consultation with the United StatesGovernment on the method and timing of the communication of thisdecision to the Government of India.    The State Department confirmed that an early announcement to the Indians would not cause them any difficulty.    (President Ayub&apos;s visit to Washington has in any case nowbeen cancelled).    This offer has, therefore, been conveyed to theGovernment of India.,3.       Before reaching a decision to offer India and Pakistan each anOberon submarine on ten year credit terms, the Cabinet wished thepossibility to be explored of the United States Government meetingthese requiremeats.    Our Embassy in Washington consulted the state department on 12th April and received the reply that there would be thegreatest difficulty in the United States Government providing a sub-marine for India.    Congressional authority for their military aid programme for India limits it to what is necessary to meet the threatfrom China.    Aid to the Indian Navy falls outside this criterion, butthe Americans argue that we could justify it as aid to a fellow memberof the Commonwealth.    Moreover, as the United States are notbuilding any conventional submarines, they would only be able to supplyold submarines:  for the sale or loan of these the specific approval of congress would be required and such an offer would be much less effective than one of a new submarine a.s a means of diverting the indians from accepting the offer Gf Russian submarines which is now before them.    It is even less likely that the Americans could be persuaded to finance the purchase of Oberon submarines constructed inthis country.    Because of the current distaste of the United StatesGovernment for the Pakistan Government&apos;s trafficking with China and russia, it would be particularly difficult to persuade them to helpPakistan over a submarine at present.4.       The Prime Minister mentioned this matter to Mr. Rusk in washington on 15th April, when Mr. Rusk said that he would be glad todiscuss problems of military aid further with us when he is in london for the SEATO meeting during the first v/eek in May.

25 IE    ^ department have confirmed this with the Minister of State, ForeignOffice.    These discussions will foe useful but the United states authorities are most unlikely to resile from their present position about submarines.5.      An early decision is desirable.    We have kept the Indianswaiting on this since Mr. Shastri was here in December.    Moreover,we ought to tell the Pakistan Government of the offer of Hunter air -craft which we have now ma.de to the Government of India and could bestdo this when we offer them an Oberon submarine.    The longer wedelay, the greater is the danger of their hearing about the Hunters from another source and therefore reacting the more sharply.    Finally,Lord Mountbatten will be in Delhi in the first week in May and therewould be great advantage in his being able to discuss the matter withthe Government of India at that time.6.       On the substance of this matter I would not repeat what was setout in the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C.(65) 60), except to emphasise that if the Indian Navy acquired a Russian submarine, theywill almost certainly acquire Russian frigates, for which they also haveopen an attractive Russian offer.    This would make it necessary forus to restrict the equipment in the Leander frigates, and stop jointexercises with the Indian Navy and the attendance of Indian naval officers at our courses.    In due course, Soviet influence would replacethat of the Royal Navy with the Indian Navy.7.      I recommend therefore that as regards India:-(a) We offer to finance the construction of an Oberon submarine( 4. 5 million) on ten year credit terms.    It should bepossible to arrange with the Indians to delay publicity for somev/eeks. ,(b) We should explain to the Indians that this offer is made on theassumption that they do not intend to obtain submarines orfrigates from Russia;and as regards Pakistan that:-(c) We should offer to finance the construction of an Oberon sub-marine and the provision of certain radar and electronicequipment up to a total value of  1 million, both on ten yearcredit terms, leaving me discretion to settle the timing of negotiations with the Pakistan Government.c a-Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W.l.23rd April, 1965-2-
