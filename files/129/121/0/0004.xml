SEC RE!cabinet european LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury the Minister of Aviation proposes that the Government shouldcommit itself to participation in the development to completionof the initial launcher (ELDO-A) either as a three-stage or as a two-stage vehicle, and, in principle, in the development of an advanced launcher (ELDO-B).    He estimates that the continuing costof this to the U.K. might be of the order of  8- ,$ million a year.2. Technical programmes as insufficiently defined as ELDO-Bcannot of course be precisely costed at this stage.    Experience showshovifever, that early estimates of the cost of advanced aerospaceprogrammes are usually greatly exceeded.    There is also much doubt about the proportion of the cost which the U.E. would bear.    Itseems on the whole very unlikely that the cost to the ILK. will inpractice be limited to  &amp;- 9 million a year.3. The Interim Report by the official Task Group on government expenditure (MISC.  2:1/2) concluded that the ELDO programme, and otherlauncher and satellite programmes envisaged, were of low economicpriority and could not be justified on economic grounds.    The TaskGroup pointed out that the economic argument was not merely neutral,but militated actively against incurring expenditure on this work,since the resources pre-empted by it were capable of being put toalternative uses which were likely to yield a better economic return.i-!-. The Minister accepts that the case for continued U.K.participation in ELDO does not rest on economic arguments.    he considers, however, that there are other grounds on which theexpenditure on ELDO could be justified.    I do not agree.    I note,for example, the suggestion that it would be unwise to allow launchincapability to &quot;become an American monopoly (in the West;    the russians are of course in active competition).    I do not believe however thatthe American position would in practice be noticeably affected bythe development of an ELDO launcher since, as the Minister observes,even the advanced ELDO-B launcher cannot be expected to &quot;be technically or financially competitive with American launchers.The scale of the American launcher effort, which dwarcfs the proposedELDO programmes, must enable them to maintain and increase the leadthey now hold.5- More important is the suggestion that, having taken theinitiative in setting up ELDO&apos;, we should be seriously criticised by our European partners if we now brought about the collapse of theorganisation by withdrawing from it.    It is also suggested thatELDO is an important factor in our policy of advancing our relationswith European countries by means of co-operation with them on technical projects-    The Government is novi committed to spend verylarge sums (on, for example, the Concord, the Anglo-Erench Strike/Trainer, and the European Space Research Organisation) in pursuanceof this policy.    Unless, however, the projects selected for

co-operation are themselves likely to be successful, theconsequences of engaging in them may prove to be a source ofpolitical embarrassment.    This has already proved to he the case with ELDO.    The initial programme (SLDO-A) is now generally accepted to be not worth pursuing in itself, and we are told thatwe must go on to ELDO-B.    But it is not seriously claimed thatthe ELDO-B launcher will have substantial worthwhile uses.I do not believe that the Government&apos;s European policies shouldbe prayed in aid of co-operative projects whose sole justificationis that they are co-operative.6. It should be remembered that the ELDO programmes to which itis now proposed that the Government should commit itself are very different from those covered by the original ELDO Agreement.    Thelatter specifically provided for the development ef a three-stageEL DO-A;    now the proposal is that ELDO should,  if the French insist upon it, abandon development of this launcher, but should insteaddevelop a two-stage ELDO-A, with ELDO-B to follow.    It should alsobe noted that all this arises out of the flat French refusal at the january Conference to continue with the development of the launcherto which the French set their hand in the ELDO Agreement.    by insisting on a limitation to their financial commitments in respectof the original launcher, the French have, moreover, introduced an element of ultimatum;    in effect, ELDO members are being told thatthe French will only continue as members of the Organisationprovided it commits itself to the adoption of new plans which havenot been properly costed or even delineated.7- I believe that the U.K.  should refuse /to participate in theproposed ELDO programmes, since they fall, in my view, squarelywithin the category of items of low economic priority which theGovernment are publicly pledged to cut out.J.D.T re a sury Chambe rs,Great George Street,S.W. 1.26th March, 1965

cabinet european LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation memorandum by the Minister of Aviation1.     My colleagues will recall that the E.L.D.O. Conference in Paris inJanuary failed to reach any conclusion because the French made radicalproposals to stop work on the current E.L.D.0, programme and proceed withan advanced type of launcher at ence.   The Conference will be reconvenedon 7th April, to consider the report of a Working Group which has been examining the French and alternative proposals.2.     I understand that the French are hoping to formulate their own views onthe future of E.L.D.0. by 31st March, and that they will let the Embassiesin Paris know their views before the Conference opens.   The matter is likelyto be raised during the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Paris, and it is alsoessential that we should give instructions to our delegation to the Conference.3.     I attach a detailed paper leading up to the conclusion that aurdelegation should be authorised to agree in principle to the development ofan E.L.D.0, &apos;B&apos; launcher consisting of Blue Streak plus one or two liquidhydrogen upper stages and to accept the Working Group&apos;s recemmendation thatthe best technical foundation for such a project is the completion of thefirst programme (E.L.D.0. &apos;A&apos; launcher and Apogee motor).   If the French do not agree with the Vforking Party&apos;s recommendation, our delegation should beauthorised to accept a compromise solution which has/been suggested by theWorking Group and which involves the completion of the E.L.D.0. &apos;A&apos; programme as a two-stage launcher.A.    The attached paper sets out the arguments for this conclusion at length.Briefly, I believe that to abandon E.L.D.0. at this stage would have mostserieus political consequences in Europe; would involve the forfeiting ofvaluable technological &quot;spin off&quot;; might involve the clasing-down of theWoomora base, a consideration of great concern to the Australians; and wouldmean delivering wurselves and Europe completely into the hands of the Americansfor the means of future world communications (civil and military) and space research.5.     I think that our object should therefore be to devise the most economicalprogramme which will keep Europe in this field of Technology; but as such theprogramme will need a more specific objective than simply &quot;keeping in the field&quot;It must be aimed towards actual hardware and launching.   The proposals in my paper are designed to meet this objective, and I therefore seek agreementof my colleagues to our delegation being instructed to proceed as at paragraph 3 above.R. H. J.Ministry of Aviation,25th March, 1965.

ANNEXEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation.     Before our delegation attended the Paris Conference on ELDO in January,I circulated a note setting out the case for and against continuing our support for the Organisation.   Subsequently the United Kingdom Delegation was authorised,if our partners showed a real desire to continue with ELDO. to offer to provideour share of expenditure during 1965 while estimates and programmes werecritically examined.2.     The proposals before the Conference involved the completion of the initial (ELDO A) programme followed by development of an apogee motor andmore advanced launchers using liquid hydrogen upper stages (ELDO 3.1 and B.2)at a total estimated further cost (including contingencies) of  238M.(subsequent re-examination of costs has increased this figure to  253M.).When the Conference opened the French Delegation proposed an immediate starton the development of ELDO B launchers and the cessation of all work on thecurrent ELDO A programme which did not contribute to the development of theb type launcher.   They said the proposals before the Conference were tooexpensive.   The completion of ELDO A would serve little useful purpose inview of technological advances since the programme was started and it wouldbe better to develop as quickly and cheaply as possible a launcher whichwould have practical applications.   The French estimated that their proposal would reduce the cost by about  60M.3.     All Member States were concerned about the cost of the ELDO programmesbut the French proposal was not acceptable to the others.   The estimatedsavings were thought to be exaggerated.   It gave rise to serious industrialproblems particularly in the U.K. and Australia, and it involved a high levelof technical risk.   The Conference set up a Working Group to examine theFrench and alternative proposals.   In an effort to force an early decision infavour of their proposal, the French applied economic sanctions by limitingfunds available to the Organisation in the first six months of 1965 and by refusing to agree to the original  70M. estimate for the ELDO A programmebeing exceeded.4.     As a result of the French initiative, the January Conference achievednothing.   It will reconvene on April 7 to consider the Working Party&apos;s report.The report says the French proposal is unacceptable and that the proposalsoriginally before the Conference for completing the ELDO A and a/S programmes are, on technical grounds, the best foundation for the ELDO B programme.If for any reason these cannot be adopted a compromise solution based onthe original ELDO A programme but developing a two stage launcher instead ofa three stage one is the best alternative technical solution, bearing inmind the requirements of the ELDO B programme.5.     The compromise solution would (except in France itself) virtuallyeliminate the hiatus in the work implicit in the French proposal, and thusavoid consequential industrial difficulties leading to the loss of theexisting trials and development teams.   It would considerably reduce the element of technical risk.   But the savings on the earlier estimate ofv / 238M.

 238M. which the French regarded as too high would be small ( 18M.).   Therewould be advantage for the United Kingdom in the adoption of a new programme which would enable us to reduce our percentage contribution instead of continuing at the higher rate on the old programme.6.     The compromise proposal may not, therefore, be acceptable to the French; their estimate of savings from thoir own proposal - in our view much exaggerated -would not be achieved.   But if ELDO is to remain in being the French positionis not far from our own.   ELDO should, in that case, devise the most economicalprogramme which would keep Europe in this field of technology.    Such a programme should have a more specific objective than simply &quot;keeping in thefield&quot;.   It should be aimed at hardware and actual launching of satelliteswhich could be used in conjunction with a global telecommunications system.7.     It is an open question whether this objective could be achieved withoutdeveloping the B.2 version of the advanced launcher.   The Working Group&apos;sreport states that the B.i version meets all European requirements nowidentified., but the use of an equatorial launching site may be necessary insome cases and experience shows that estimated performance is not alwaysattained.   It is currently estimated that the adoption of the Working Party&apos;recommendation up to the development of the B.1 launcher would cost about 185M. (including the same element of contingency as in the  238M. inparagraph 2 above).   The programme would be spread over about 7 years.Providing we could negotiate our percentage contribution down from the current38.79?^ &quot;to the 25$ which is related to our Gross National Product and which applies in such cases in other organisations, such a programme would cost the U.K. about  7-8M. per annum.   The French and German costs would be ofthe same order of magnitude.8.     Under such a modified programme Europe would develop a launcher usingan advanced form of propulsion and guidance.   It would not be such an advanced vehicle as the ELDO B.2 launcher with two liquid hydrogen stageswhich was envisaged in the French proposal and in the proposals originallybefore the Conference, but the estimates for the B.2 launcher are not sowell founded as the others and. some Member States may not be willing to commit themselves beyond the B.1 launcher at this stage.   If it were to beused to put satellites into synchronous equatorial orbits, the most probablerequirement for communications purposes, it would have to be fired from anequatorial launch site instead of the present base at Woomera, which would however continue to be used for development programmes.   The French are proposing to develop such a base in French Guiana for their national programme.   They have suggested that EKDO should take a share in that base at an estimated cost of about  30M.   If this were agreed it would increasethe cost of the programme to the U.K. by about  1M. a year.9.     The payload performance of the ELDO B.1 launcher is difficult todetermine because the technical factors are not sufficiently known.   Butdrawing upon such United States information as is available to us andrecognising the difficulty of applying this to forecasts of Europeandevelopment achievement over the next decade, U.K. opinion is that thelauncher would only be able to place a 250 kg. communications satellitein a synchronous orbit from an equatorial launch site.   ELDOr basing their estimate on French studies, think in such circumstances the payload wouldbe 350 kg.   If a programme leading to a B.1 launcher were adopted the needfor an adequate margin of performance could lead to pressure to go on tothe B.2 programme.   The merits of such a requirement would have to be assessed on the basis of much better information about costs than is currentlyavailable,10. Apart from the possibility of launching a few scientific experimentsfor ESROr the prospects of finding a practical use for an ELDO B launcherdepend on its ability to compete in price and performance with American/launchers

launchers for the task of putting communications satellites into orbit.Whatever global system may be adopted, the European contribution to theInternational Communications Satellite Corporations funds would, on themost optimistic assumptions, hardly entitle Europe to more than one launchper year.11.   By the time ELDO B.1 has been developed the Americans will have available a Titan 3C launcher using conventional propellants as opposed to the difficultliquid hydrogen technique.   If fired from Cape Kennedy this launcher could put into orbit twice the payload of the ELDO B.1 launcher fired from anequatorial site.   It would be capable of multiple launchings, on which the economies of communications satellites are likely to depend, at a costcomparable with that of a simple ELDO B.1 launching.   Thus, technically andfinancially, the ELDO B.1 launcher, even after the construction of anequatorial launching site, would not be competitive.12.   At a time when we are looking for economies in Government expenditure,and some of our principal partners in ELDO are expecting us to achieve them,it is difficult to argue an economic case for an Organisation which seems unlikely to yield an adequate return for our investment.   But the case forour continued participation in ELDO does not rest on economic arguments.It rests upon the effect on our partners if we lead the move for disbandmentjand upon the undesirability of contracting irrevocably out from the rapidlydeveloping but largely unpredictable field of space research.   We cannotleave everything to the Americans and yet hope to achieve a technologicallyadvanced economy.13-   There.have been rapid and significant advances in the field of satellite communications over the last few years.   Adequate launching capacity isessential for participation in space activities, and in the field of launchingtechniques we hold the lead in Europe at present.   It is a field to whichEuropean countries as well as the United States and the U.S.S.R. attach importance.   Space activities are very much in the public eye and no nationwith claims to an advanced technology seems prepared to leave the fieldentirely to others.14.   Moreover, we took the lead in setting up ELDO as a form of technologicalco-operation with our European partners.   This is .an aspect which has consider-able attractions for some of the other Member States.   It enables them toparticipate in an activity which individually they could not undertake.   Butthe U.K.. by completing the development of Blue Streak and successfully firingit three times, is the only ELDO partner with technical achievements to showfrom the jointly financed programme.   We should suffer serious political embarrassment if we took any action now as a result of which we could beheld responsible for ELDO&apos;s collapse.   The effects would not be confined toELDO alone but would almost certainly affect our position in other EuropeanOrganisations,   It might also react on any proposals we may contemplate forbi-lateral co-operation.15.   If ELDO programmes ceased, work arising from the likely future defence programme may be insufficient to justify keeping open the joint U.K./Australian facilities at Woomera to which Australia attaches great importance as one of her few bases of advanced technology.   In this country some 2,000men would have to be re-deployed.   The bulk of them in the Stevenage andDerby areas could probably find alternative work fairly easily but this doesnot apply to about 700 employees at Spadeadam in Cumberland.   No alternative work can be foreseen for this costly Establishment ( 22M.).Conclusions16.   The April Conference:will be held at a time when the financial situation of ELDO is critical.   The limitation by the French on expenditurein the first six months of 1965 to  13^M., and their refusal to allow the 70M. estimate to be exceeded, means that if the Conference does not reach a/conclusion

i!conclusion which will enable the French to lift the restrictions, member states will have to stop work on ELDO wniraoto at +U0 &quot;beginning of May,if they are net to rvpo^J their share of the  70m.   Such action would almost certainly result in the Organisation collapsing.17.   None of the other Member States have spoken in terms which suggestthey are anxious to wind up ELDO.   They attach importance to the aims agreedwhen the Organisation was established and seem anxious to insure against future uncertainties by continuing to play a part in an aspect of space technology which would provide sufficient knowledge and experience to enableEurope, if it so desired, to participate in future applications which mayemerge.18.   In these circumstances I suggest our Delegation should be authorised toagree in principle to the development of an ELDO B Launcher consisting of blue Streak plus one or two liquid hydrogen upper stages and to accept theWorking Group&apos;s recommendation that the best technical foundation for such a project is the completion of the first programme (ELDO A) launcher and apogeemotor.   The development of an ELDO B Launcher should be based on an agreedspecification aimed at meeting an identified requirement.   Arrangements forthe development of the ELDO B.1 type launcher should be put in hand withoutdelay and a study be made to determine whether the agreed objective can be best met by constructing an equatorial launching site, developing a B.2type launcher or both.19&apos;   The French may not agree to the acceptance of the Working Group&apos;recommendation that the completion of ELDO a and a/S programmes is the bestfoundation for an ELDO B programme on the grounds that it is too expensive.In that case our Delegation should be authorised to accept the compromise solution suggested by the Working Group involving the completion of the eldo a programme as a two stage launcher and urge its acceptance on the French.20.   I therefore recommend that the United Kingdom Delegation should beauthorised to agree to bear our share of the cost of work during 1965 whiledetails of such a programme, the contribution to its cost and the sharingout of the work involved are determined.   The U.K. share of the cost of anELDO B programme should be reduced from the 38.79$ we pay at present to 25$if possible, and not more than 30$ in any case.21.   Despite the inability of the French experts on the Working Group to associate themselves with its recommendations because they were not in line with the French proposal to the inter-Governmental Conference, there aregrounds for thinking that the French will not insist on the acceptance ofthat proposal.   If, however, the French do insist on the acceptance of theproposal which they made to the January Conference, the United kingdom delegation should make it clear that the proposal is not acceptable and ifthe French and others are unwilling, subject to a thorough re-examinationof the costs involved, to complete the current programme, we should statethat our Government would have to give immediate consideration to the questionof continued participation in the Organisation.SECI E
