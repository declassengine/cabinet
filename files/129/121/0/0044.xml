80S5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 94COPY NO. j)Q6th July, 1965CABINETREPORTS BY SIR LESLIE MARTIN and professor BUCHANAN ON THE YTHI TEH ALL area memorandum by the Minister of Public Building and Y/orknIntroductionAlmost all prospective building within the Whitehall area has beenheld up for the past 12 months to await Sir Leslie Martin&apos;s plans for thefuture development of this area.    I have been studying the reports sinceEaster and have arranged to publish them on 19th July.2.       The reports are long and detailed,    Copies are available for ministers who wish to study them, but the salient features are recorded at appendix B.    I have had prior discussions with my colleagues in the HomeAffairs Committee and have reached substantial agreement on most of themain points.    Only the question of building Government offices in the long-term remains unresolved.G ove r nme nt&apos; s s tat e me nt3.       We simply must state our intentions when the report is published.The plans are far reaching in their concept arid timescale.    They may notbe fully realised for half a century.    If we do not lay down general principles and disciplines now, all this effort will be lost in the quicksands of detailedcriticism and aesthetic argument. .    Piecemeal development will follow, tothe general detriment of the area.4. My proposed statement, to which I seek my colleagues agreement, isat Appendix A.    It covers the three essentials:-(l) the need.for a Parliamentary precinct;(2) the need to develop the Bridge Street site for Parliamentarypurposes, and as Government offices;(3) feasibility studies should be made of Martin&apos;&apos;s plans to build a riverside tunnel from the Embankment to Lambeth Bridge,and of Buchanan&apos;s road proposals.A statement on these lines does not commit us to immediate expenditure orconstruction, but is essential if we are to deal at all with the Foreign Officeand Commonwealth Relations Office accommodation.restricting office development in London.    First, we must have regard tothe tirnescale.   Secondly, Whitehall and Parliament Square, as theadministrative centre of the Commonwealth must be in a class apart from government building5.I see no conflict between my proposals and the present policyof-1-CONFIDE&amp;TIAL

other office development.     Thirdly, all experience chews that the cost of housing civil servants in leasehold building, scattered throughout london is absurdly high;  on grounds of economy and efficiency we must concentratethem in Crown buildings, at a fraction of the annual cost.6.       My intention is to work within the guidelines of Sir Leslie Martin&apos;splan.    First, by developing the Bridge Street site, around which we havepurchased property.    Left as it is, it will degenerate into a slum.    Theconstruction of Government offices behind the Parliamentary building willenable me, as a second step, to replace the present Foreign office building - a decision inherited from the previous Administration.    If adecision were taken tomorrow, it would be over six years before it couldbe started beca.use of the need to decant its present occupants, and otherconsequential moves.    Further development can take place as theeconomic situation permits, but we must have an overall plan.    TheMartin framework is a comprehensive survey, the biggest of its kind.We need to take these steps to move towards a centre worthy cf theCommonwealth, to create a Parliamentary precinct from which much ofthe traffic will be removed, and tc increase the quality and decrease theccst of Government accommodation.conclusion.       If the initial decisions are taken, we will get great credit as aGovernment sensitive to town planning and architectural considerations.We can then await informed public and technical, comment.   We can then proceed to examine this gigantic concept in detail, piece by piece.    Butwe must state firmly on publication our intentions for the future.    this must not be just another White Paper.    The country would expect a leadfrom this Government and they should get it.   , Apart from the buildingbehind Bridge Street, there is nothing I want which effendo against thecurrent legislation on office development in &quot;Condon.     To expect that everything will be the same in ten years&apos; time, with all the restrictions inforce, seems to me pessimistic and unrealistic.    In the timescale of the plans our present restrictions are ephemeral.I seek my colleagues agreement to say, on behalf of the Government,we welcome Sir Leslie Martin&apos;s proposals as a long-term&quot;orofframme for the redevelopment of the Whitehall area;we shall develop the Bridge Street site for Parliamentary and government purposes;we shall initiate further studies of the proposed tunnel, whichmay make a major contribution in drawing off traffic from parliament Square, and cf the other traffic aspects of the plans;the Government intends to carry cut future building within the framework of the plan, so far as this is consistent with currentoffice building restrictions in London.c ministry of Public Building and Works, S.E. 1.Sth July, 19650 9(a)(b)(?)(d)

APPENDIX ADRAFT STATEMENTSir Leslie Martin and Professor Colin Buchanan were appointed in the spring of 1964 as consultants to advise on the redevelopment of the Whitehall area.    Their reports are publishedtoday, and are available in the Vote Office.The Government welcomes these reports, and regards them asthe framework within which future development of the parliament square and Whitehall areas should take place.    We are in sympathy with the concept of a precinct in and around Parliament Square fromwhich traffic not serving the area should gradually be withdrawn.We recognise that how, when and to what extent traffic can beremoved from Parliament Square must be looked at in the context ofLondon traffic as a whole.    We will promote studies of the proposalfor a riverside road tunnel between the Embankment and LambethBridge and the Korseferry Road improvements.The Government accepts in principle the proposal for a new building for Parliamentary purposes on the Bridge Street site, andhopes to proceed with it as soon as possible. The Government alsoaccepts that the remainder of the Bridge Street site should be developed for Government offices as a necessary part of the subsequentredevelopment of the Foreign Office site.    In regard to further government building, we are in accord with the general principles set out by Sir Leslie Martin.    Further study will be given to theremaining building proposals in the reports, but during the currency ofthe present restrictions on office building in London, development willgenerally be carried out in conformity with this policy.On behalf of Her Majestyrs Government I thank Sir LeslieMartin and Professor Buchanan for their imaginative proposals.    the redevelopment of this area, which is the heart of the Commonwealth,may not be completed in our generation.    It must be governed by economic priorities.    But we must lay down now the disciplines withinwhich the development may be carried out.

APPENDIX BSir Leslie Martin was commissioned by the Ministerof Public Building and Works in April,  H 964? to act asconsultant to ensure that various proposals underconsideration for redevelopment in the Whitehall area were related to each other and had regard to thegeneral architectural character of the area, taking into account relevant traffic considerations,  and toprepare a report.    In May,  1964-? Professor ColinBuchanan was appointed by the Minister to act asconsultant on traffic with Sir Leslie Martin.2.      Below are summaries of Sir Leslie Martin&apos;s and professor Buchanan&apos;s reports, which were presented tothe Minister of Public Building and Works in April ofthis year.Foreword3.      The report concentrates on what might be achieved in the area around Parliament Square and Whitehall ifail the current building proposals are seen as partsof a total plan.    These include the redevelopment ofthe site between Bridge Street and Richmond Terrace,to provide accommodation for Parliament and government offices; of the Foreign Office;  (eventually) of theGovernment Offices, Great George Street; and of thearea between Great George Street and Broad Sanctuary(including a new Government Conference Centre).4-.      The main recommendations are as follows(1)    The opportunity presented by the buildingproposals to create a new setting around anda new environment within Parliament Squareshould not be lost.(2)    The building proposals should be accompaniedby a policy of improving the environment and amenities by the gradual removal of traffic which merely passes through but does notserve the area.(3)    The Palace of Westminster   and westminster abbey should dominate the area, and theformer should not be extended in any way that would change its external appearance.Other historic buildings in the area shouldbe preserved and enhanced within a newsetting.(4)    An area, based on Parliament Square,  shouldbe reserved for buildings associated withState and Government.    A new Parliamentarybuilding should be erected on the BridgeStreet site and another building of national or international significance erected on the broad Sanctuary site, embodying the sites ofthe Middlesex Guildhall and of the buildingsalong Great George Street.Report by SiLeslie Martin

(5)    The Bridge Street, Foreign Office,  and GreatGeorge Street sites should be redeveloped forGovernment offices, together with some public amenities,  to form the north end ofthe precinct; the area around the WestminsterCentral Hall would be redeveloped to form thewestern enclosure to the precinct; and therewould be new residential development along the line of Great Peter Street to form thesouthern enclosure to the precinct.(6)    The area at the northern end of Whitehallshould be considered further as part of a study of the needs of the Trafalgar Squarein relation to Whitehall and other adjoiningareas.(7)    The opportunity of general rebuilding shouldbe taken to rationalise building lines    andthe layout of public services, and to provide adequate underground garaging,  service roads,etc.Sir Leslie Martin makes it clear that the main buildingoperations could go ahead without any major roadchanges at the centre, but points   out that an appro-priate environment cannot be created,  nor can the areaadequately satisfy its national and public functions,until traffic which merely passes through but does notserve the area is withdrawn.Basis of Sir Leslie Martin&apos;s plan5.      In the Abercrosnbie Plan of 1943? an area betweenthe river and Strutton Ground,  and Parliament Squareand Horseferry Road, was envisaged as a precinct.    TheLondon Development Plan of 1962/63,  also recognisedthis as a Government and Commonwealth Centre.6. The following are regarded as appropriate activi-ties within the triangle formed within Lambeth Bridge,Charing Cross and Buckingham Palace(i)    Uses associated with State occasions,bringing into relationship Buckingham Palace,the Abbey,  the Houses of Parliament andWhitehall.(ii)    Government uses, which spread beyond the palace of Westminster and the buildingsalong Whitehall into the surrounding area.(iii)    Public uses, including sight-seeing.7.      Parliament Square is at present one of the sixmost heavily trafficked intersections in London.Sir Leslie Martin considers methods of taking trafficout of Parliament Square.    A tunnel beneath it would run up against the Underground District Line, andeven if practicable would be extremely costly and not provide more adequate facilities for the area as awhole.    The creation of a separate pedestrian level would not contribute to easing the traffic situation.Hence, he favours a riverside tunnel road from the victoria Embankment to Millbank to cope with north-south traffic,  and the improvement of the LambethBridge/Horseferry Road route to cope with east-westtraffic.2.

The components of Sir Leslie Martin&apos;s planHistoric and other buildings and spaces8.      Sir Leslie Martin envisages the retention of the westminster Central Hall (but the eventual removal ofthe Middlesex Guildhall and the buildings on the southside of Great George Street); of Downing Street, theOld Treasury, Horse Guards, 36 Whitehall, AdmiraltyHouse and the Admiralty Screen group of buildings; ofthe Banqueting House (but the removal of the RoyalUnited Services Institution and Gwydyr House); and ofthe Scotland Yard building by Norman Shaw as part ofthe redevelopment of the site from Bridge Street toRichmond Terrace.Houses of Parliament9.      A Parliamentary building to provide 100,000 sq.ft.net of accommodation is proposed, with 180 ft.  frontageto Bridge Street,  stretching back to a depth of 280 ft.This building would be linked by a covered way to thecolonnade at the foot of the Clock Tower so as to form part of the present Palace of Westminster.    Ultimately,with the greater space afforded by the riversidetunnel,  this building could be increased to 150,000sq.ft. net and be provided with a forecourt linking itbelow Bridge Street to Speaker&apos;s Green.10.    A number of ways are suggested in which additional accommodation might be provided for Parliament withinthe Palace of Westminster,  e.g. by building out over existing buildings,  and by adaptingspace now unsuitable for use or unsuitably used.The Broad Sanctuary area11.    Instead of the present plan to erect a GovernmentConference Centre of 33,000 sq.ft., with offices ofabout 77,000 sq.ft., the opportunity should be takento erect in time a larger building to cover this sie and the sites of the Middlesex Guildhall and of theexisting buildings on the south side of Great george street, which   include the present Headquarters of theRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and theInstitution of Civil Engineers.    This building wouldprovide(a) A Conference Centre of 33,000 sq.  ft,,  towhich might be added a Conference Hall for ,000 people, capable of sub-division;(b) a Reception Centre with suites of rooms forentertaining, dining, refreshments,  etc;(c) a tourist and visitors&apos; centre with enquiry and refreshment facilities,  exhibitionspace, roof restaurant and viewing areas.12.    Sir Leslie Martin does not consider that government offices or the Headquarters of Professional Institutionsare appropriate uses for the site.    He suggests thatalternative space should be found in the vicinity forthe R.I.C.S.  and I.C.E.    Pending redevelopment, theMiddlesex Guildhall and its Annexe in Great george street might be taken over by the Government.3.

Government Office buildings13.    The redevelopment of the site between BridgeStreet and Richmond Terrace,  the site between GreatGeorge Street and Downing Street,  and the presentAdmiralty, War Office, and neighbouring Ministriescould make room for an additional 10,000 or soGovernment staffs in    the area.    The last group of buildings he considers should be considered further aspart of a study of the Trafalgar Square area.    the redevelopment of the first two sites are seen as partof the process of forming the inner precinct.    Thereport comments on the uneconomic design of thebuildings on   the site between Great George Street andDowning Street,  and the opportunity that redevelopmentof this and the Bridge Street site affords for providing efficient accommodation for housing GovernmentDepartments in the area:    about 1,4-00,000 sq. ft. netof usable office space could be provided on these sites,to house some 11,000 civil servants (about 7,000 morethan are at present in the area), as follows(1)    Besides the 100,000 sq.ft. building for parliament, 396,000 sq. ft.  of net office for 3,300 or so staff (plus 36O car parkingplaces) could be built on the site betweenBridge Street and Richmond Terrace,  togetherwith about 40,000 sq.ft.  of shops and a new21,500 sq.ft. Cannon Row Police Station.The Government offices might be extendedto 459,000-519,000 sq.ft. when the additionalspace provided by the riverside road tunnelis available or,  alternatively, this extraspace might be used for public amenities.(2)    462,000 sq.ft. net of offices for 3,700-4,000 staff could be built on the ForeignOffice site (with 800 parking places) and522,000 sq.ft. net for 4,200-4,500 staff onthe site between Great George and KingCharles Street (with 650 parking places).All these development could take place without exceeding the height of the present buildings (approximately 80-90 ft.).    They could be linked by a main galleryrunning just south of King Charles Street and DerbyGate, crossing Whitehall and so linking the riversidewith St, James&apos;s Park.    On the Bridge Street site atground level,  the Gallery would provide a publicpedestrian way with a shopping concourse and a newentrance to the Underground railway.    On the upperlevels of the Gallery,  there would be a separatepedestrian way for official traffic and offices.    Afurther block of offices would run south of RichmondTerrace and Downing Street,  not linked across Whitehall,and possibly cut back in front of No.  10 Downing Streetto create a small &apos;place&apos;.    Other blocks of officeswould run at right angles to,  and link,  these offices and the main gallery (one of them linking the conferencebuilding in Broad Sanctuary through to Downing Street).A feature of the design envisaged by Sir Leslie Martinis the stepping back of the sides of the blocks of offices and the formation of courts opening to thesouth. ;14.    The report draws attention to the opportunity forrationalising services to Government buildings in the whithall area.4.

Related Areas15,    To form the southern enclosure to the precinct,and at the same time safeguard the future of this area for residential purposes, 4-50 flats to accommodate1,000-1,250 people could he built along the line ofGreat Peter Street and across the Victoria TowerGardens.16.    The redevelopment of the area at the rear of theCentral Hall could include accommodation for theR.I.C.S. , the I.C.E.   and possibly also the institution of Mechanical Engineers if their building is affectedby improvements in Birdcage Walk,  and also provideground-level parking facilities for coaches.17.    The implications of redeveloping the area fromTothill Street south to Horseferry Road along GreatSmith Street for Government needs should be seriouslystudied before individual development projectseliminate the possibility.18.    The alignment of Whitehall should be furtherstudied,  in the light of the suggestion that he makesthat the line of Parliament Street might be continuedacross Charing Cross Station to link up with theBritish Museum.Professor Buchanan&apos;s Report19.    Professor Buchanan studies the traffic problemsproduced by regarding the area under study as anenvironmental area from which through traffic would be excluded.    He also considers that very similar standardsshould be aimed at in adjacent areas of central London,and concludes that a primary route network of eight-lane highways would be needed to achieve this.    Themost important part of the network so Tar as the whithall area is concerned, would bei-(a) Along the line of Vauxhall Bridge Road up toHyde Park Corner, going below ground pastVictoria Station.(b) Through Hyde Park Corner,  south-east ofPiccadilly and behind Trafalgar Square -underground all the way.(c) Through the Trafalgar Square area andWaterloo,  above ground and over a newThames bridge on the line    of Charing Crossrailway bridge.(d) From Vauxhall to Waterloo,  south of theriver.20.    Meanwhile, Professor Buchanan considers that agood part of the traffic on the road in the parliament square area could be diverted by building a Thames-sidetunnel roadway,  to take north-south traffic fromWhitehall and Victoria Embankment making for Millbank,and by widening the Horseferry Road route acrossVictoria Street through Buckingham Gate andBuckingham Palace Road to Victoria Station,  to takeeast-west traffic,    If the primary grid were subse-quently provided,  these would be no more thandistributors for local traffic but their existencewould still be essential to keep traffic out ofParliament Square.5,
