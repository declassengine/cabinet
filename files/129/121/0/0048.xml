REPORT OF THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY COMMITTEE, 1965PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1969-70IntroductionThis is the fifth annual report on public expenditure. It deals with public expenditure in its widest sense and includes the current and capital expenditure of central and local government, the gross outgoings of the National insurance funds, and the investment expenditure of nationalised industries (although this isfor some purposes treated differently from the rest), but it excludes debt interest.2. The report is agreed by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee asgiving as realistic a costing as possible of the policies involved. It is acceptedhowever that the inclusion in this report of forecast expenditure figures, whether for basic or additional programmes, does not of itself commit either the treasury or the Departments to those figures.3. Wherever possible, projections of expenditure have been on specifiedpolicies and programmes. Where this has not been possible, predictions have beenmade on the basis of past trends or by whatever other means seemed most appropriate. In the case of defence expenditure, it has been assumed that her majesty&apos;s Governmenfs aim of holding it at the 1964-65 Estimates level in 1969-70will be achieved; this depends on the outcome of the Defence Review.Economic growth4. Ministers have already agreed that for industrial planning purposes the starting assumption should be that the Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) will grow by 25 per cent between 1964 and 1970 (or at an average rate of 3f percent a year over the six years). For the purposes of relating long-term programmes of public expenditure, other than for the nationalised industries, etc., toprospective resources, it has been agreed that it should be assumed that G.D.P.will grow by 22^ per cent in the same period (or approximately 3^- per cent a year).This difference reflects the fact that in planning public expenditure it is important to have regard primarily to what can be afforded, while for industrial planning andpublic presentation purposes it is desirable to aim rather higher, since such an aimwill of itself be a factor in the achievement of the desired end. In terms of public expenditure this means that investment by the nationalised industries has beenprojected on the assumption of a 25 per cent growth in G.D.P. over the six calendaryears 1964-70, whereas for the remainder of public expenditure the 22-1- per centassumption has been used wherever this assumption is relevant to the projectioninvolved.*Background5. The background to this year&apos;s Survey is contained in the.paper on public expenditure submitted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Cabinet inJanuary last (C. (65) 10), the proposals in which were approved by the Cabinet at ameeting on 28th January, 1965. The main proposal was that over the five-year period1964-65 to 1969-70 the planning of public sector expenditure (excluding the investment of the nationalised industries, etc.) should be based on an average annual rate of increase of A\ per cent per annum at constant prices (i.e., a rise of 23 per cent over the period).6. This decision was announced in Parliament on the occasion of thepublication of the 1965 Vote on Account, on 22nd February, 1965, when theChancellor of the Exchequer stated that &quot;... the Government have decided thatthe growth of public sector expenditure . . . will be related to the prospective increase in national production, which . . . means limiting the average increase . . .,taking one year with another, to A\ per cent a year at constant prices &quot;. this commitment was repeated in the Budget Speech on 6th April, 1965, in virtuallyidentical terms, and the staff of the International Monetary Fund took note of itin the course of the consultations with this country preceding the United Kingdom&apos;latest drawing on the Fund. The Governmenfs determination was again reaffirmedpublicly by the Prime Minister in his address to the Economic Club of New Yorkon 14th April, 1965. :_* As an exception to this, the figures for benefits and assistance, which are calculated withreference to the expected rise in real earnings per head in the community at large, are based on the25 per cent assumption.
7. At the same time as the Cabinet agreed to the 4J per cent per annumlimit on the growth of public expenditure, they agreed that for the major blocks of expenditure Departments should prepare basic programmes reflecting statedrates of increase for each block as laid down in the Chancellors paper. WhereDepartmental Ministers wished to exceed these stated rates of growth they wouldbe able to submit additional programmes reflecting any foreseeable changes ofpolicy which they wished to introduce if it proved possible. These main blockscover some 80 per cent of total public expenditure, and these are the blocks uponwhich Ministers will take decisions this summer. Of the remainder, much is not susceptible to accurate forecasting, but where it is possible to do so, figures havebeen agreed for the cost of existing policies at a minimum practicable level, andof any further developments of policy which Departments would wish to propose.Public expenditure to 1969-70: Category A8. Table 1 below sets out the figures relating to the main blocks (Category A)in respect of which decisions will be sought from Ministers. This table shows thecost of present policy in 1964-65 and 1965-66, and the cost of the basicprogrammes, in accordance with the limits laid down in January by the Cabinet,in 1969-70.* It also shows the cost of additional programmes in 1969-70. A fullerset of figures, showing the cost of basic and additional programmes in the intervening years, will be found in Table 4 in Appendix I.Table 1A.

Precise proposals have not been formulated and might well prove more expensive (see paragraph 113 (e) of Appendix II).* With two exceptions: the housing investment figure is higher, reflecting a subsequent cabinet decision; and housing subsidies, etc., was not, in fact, a block for which any specific limit was set by Cabinet, but in view of its close connection with the housing programme, and the major policy decisions at issue in this field, it is now included in this Category.
Public expenditure to 1969-70: Category B9. Table 2 below sets out corresponding figures covering both existing policies and possible future policy developments for Category B viz., theremainder of public expenditure (other than nationalised industries, etc.). It mustbe emphasised that at this stage the figures in this Table and in the correspondingpart of Table 3 are simply the result of adding together all the expenditure, bothin respect of existing policies and new proposals, for the services covered. As isexplained in paragraph 10 below, the total thus arrived at for 1969-70 will notnecessarily be the right figure to use in determining the allocation of resources for 1969-70.Table 2B.

Table 2 sets out the figures submitted by Departments for all expenditureoutside the Category A blocks. It covers a very wide variety of different types ofexpenditure. Some are in principle no different from the blocks in Category A,save that they are relatively small (e.g., civil research by the A.E.A.) or relateto services in respect of which interdepartmental discussion is not yet suffiently advanced for firm programmes to be fixed (e.g., technology). Some partake more of the nature of commercially remunerative capital expenditure (e.g., ports) andmight indeed be more properly classed with nationalised industries&apos; investment for the purposes of the present exercise. Some an appreciable part-cannot reasonably be forecast quantitatively for five years ahead and any figures enteredfor such items must of necessity be largely arbitrary (e.g., agricultural support).It is clear that in so heterogeneous a collection, and with so many uncertainties,it is not reasonable to arrive at a total for operational purposes merely by addingtogether all the component parts. At a later stage, therefore, it will be necessaryto make a broad estimate of the aggregate needed for Category B. But for thepresent the summary tables in this report are based on the sum of the individualitems.

It will be seen from Table 3 that between 1964-65 and 1969-70expenditure in the Category A blocks is expected, on basic programmes alone,to rise by 22 - 2 per cent Tor an average of 4 T per cent a year) at constant prices.This is in accordance with the limits for these individual blocks as set out in theAppendix to C. (65) 10 and agreed by Cabinet. If additional programmes areincluded the annual average percentage increase becomes 5-6.13.  The rise in the Category A blocks over the years is as follows:Per cent increase over preceding yearYear Category ABasic Basic -J- additional1965-66  .........       7-4 7-41966-67  .........       4-1 &quot;I Average 7-0&quot;!

These figures include Defence Budget expenditure, and assume that itis held to the 1964-65 level in 1969-70. If defence were excluded the figures would be:Per cent increase over preceding yearYear Civil Category ABasic Basic -f- additional1965-66  ...      ......1966-67  .........       5-1967-68  .........       41968-69  .........       41969-70  .........       3Average 8-9&quot;] Average^annual 7-1 (annual[increase 5-6 (increase4-4 5-5J    6-815. On the figures as submitted, even when defence is excluded, there isstill some apparent tendency for the rate of increase to fall. There are some further specific reasons for this: benefits and assistance have in the past gone upfaster than is provided in the formula used here. Then there is the inevitabletendency for future costs to be under-estimated; which creates the need for a
contingency allowance. If a due share of the proposed  150 million contingencyallowance were attributed to the Civil Category A basic figures, the increases inthe last four years would be steady at around 5-5  per cent each year.16. A major problem is presented by the fact that public expenditure islikely to rise more rapidly in the early years of the lustrum and less steeplytowards the end, whereas the growth of the economy is likely to be slow in theearly years and more rapid later. This incongruity, coupled with the likelihood ofmarked difficulty in the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments in the middleyears of the period, is bound to lead to a great strain upon available resourcesbefore 1969-70. This means that the level of public expenditure in the intervening years of the period is of crucial importance, and the course of expenditure up to1969-70 will need to be scrutinised just as carefully as the level to be fixed forthe final year.Contingency allowance17. When the Government took office, figures of forecast public expenditure were put before them relating to the period up to 1968-69. These included a contingency allowance of  300 million. In his Cabinet paper in January theChancellor proposed, in order to help meet a difficult situation, to run some degreeof extra risk by reducing this figure to  150 million. Such a reduction could perhaps be justified on the ground that now that the overwhelming bulk of public expenditure is to be planned and controlled within firm limits laid down by Cabinet,a larger provision may be less necessary than it was previously.^18. There are a number of reasons why an allowance of at least this amountis essential. First, there is the inevitable tendency to underestimate the cost of programmes some years ahead. One element in this is the fact that because, forwell-understood reasons, the P.E.S.C. figures are prepared on the basis of constantpay and prices, no allowance can be included for any pay increases in public services over and above those required to maintain this pay in the same relationship to that of wage and salary earners generally. This leads to the anomalythat if any such increases were contemplated (e.g., in order to stimulaterecruitment in a particular sector) no provision would be available for them.Secondly, there is always the possibility of unforeseen expenditure being required.19. In view of these considerations, an allowance of  150 million for 1969-70has been included as a contingency item against eventualities of this kind.Summary20. It is the Government^ declared intention that public expenditure,excluding the nationalised industries, between 1964-65 and 1969-70 shall on average rise by not more than 4J per cent per annum. Between 1964-65 and1965-66 it is expected to rise by 7-4 per cent. To meet that commitment it must therefore rise by an average of less than 4J per cent between 1965-66 and 1969-70.21. In this period (1965-66 to 1969-70) the major blocks of public expenditure Category A will, on the basis of the Cabinet limits fixed for basicprogrammes, rise by an average of 3-3 per cent ( 311 million) per annum; or - 2 per cent, if the additional programmes are included. For the total expendituresubject to the 4  per cent limit (including the additional programmes, the statistical adjustments and the contingency allowance) the average annual rise from 1965-66 to 1969-70 is 4-9 per cent ( 616 million).Appendices22. Appendix I to this report provides, in Tables 4 and 5, an expansion ofthe information given in Tables 1-3 by setting out the figures for the intervening years which, for simplicity, were omitted from those tables. Appendix II contains a summary table (Table 6), giving the full functional breakdown of total public expenditure, followed by detailed tables and notes on each heading. Appendix IIIprovides information on the methodology employed in arriving at the figures usedin this report.* The Conservative Government^ White Paper on Public Expenditure published in December,1963 (Cmnd. 2235) included a contingency allowance of  250 million.N
Comparison with 1963 White Paper on Public Expenditure (Cmnd. 2235)23. Because of changes in the price basis, in the classification, and in the assessment of such elements as imputed rents, no direct comparisons can be drawn between the figures in this report and those in the 1963 White Paper.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street,London, S.W.I.17th June, 1965.

APPENDIX ii summary OF PUBLIC expenditure table 6 sets out, under the main headings by v/hich public expenditure is classified, the figures corrected to a 1965 price basis for 1964-65 (as seen in lastyear&apos;s Survey) and for 1965-66 to 1969-70 inclusive (as seen in this year&apos;s Survey).For the major blocks of expenditure basic and additional programmes are shownseparately. For the remainder, the figures make provision for the cost of existing policies at the minimum practicable level and of any further developments ofpolicy which Departments have proposed.Table 6Summary of Public Expenditure	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Support of External Policy Defence Budget.........

In accordance with Ministerial decisions it is proposed to containdefence expenditure at  2,000 million at Survey 1964 prices (equivalent to 2,075 million at Survey 1.965 prices). A major review is being undertaken of our defence policies to see how this can be achieved. Notwithstanding the absence ofany guidance so far regarding possible options leading to a limitation of theDefence Budget it has been considered necessary to construct figures of expenditure to accord with the proposed level for 1969-70.3. The defence figures given in Table 7 are therefore purely illustrative ofthe level of expenditure which might be reached, on the assumption that the target of  2,075 million is achieved by 1969-70.Other Defence expenditure table 8Public Expenditure on Defence (other than Defence Budget)	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Allied services       .........

The figure of - 56-5 million for 1965-66includes a reduction of  35 million for the cancellation of the TSR 2.f The minus sign denotes receipts.4. This includes expenditure on allied services, civil defence and overseas military aid. Expenditure on allied services (which covers provision for accommodation, stationery and civil superannuation) for the defence deparment is the largest single item, accounting for more than  60 million in each year duringthe period.5. The review of the form of civil defence preparations, mentioned inparagraph 200 of this year&apos;s statement on the Defence Estimates, has not beencompleted in time to permit definite forecasts of civil defence expenditure in future years to be yet made. For the purposes of this report a tentative forecast has beenmade of  19 million per annum for each of the years 1966-67 to 1969-70.
6. Also included in this block of expenditure is provision for military aid to overseas countries. The figures cover disbursements in future years of grants and loans already offered, together with certain continuing liabilities for assistancein colonial territories and elsewhere. The total falls from  29 - 2 million in 1965-66to  8-2 million in 1969-70 in respect of existing commitments. A further 1-4 million has been included in 1969-70 for new proposals. Any unforeseenemergencies in this category will be met from the contingency allowance (seeparagraph 18 of the report). The principles on which the United Kingdom givesmilitary aid are about to be reviewed by a Ministerial committee.Aid programmeTable 9Public Expenditure on Aid: Basic Programme  million at Survey 1965 prices1964 Survey	Provisional Out-turn	1965 Survey				1964-65	1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70180-7	191-7	195-6	215-6	220-8	226-5	228-57. The figure of  228-5 million included for 1969-70 is designed to maintain in that year the same ratio between total expenditure on the aid programme and .N.P. as was achieved in 1964-65, on the assumption that over the six-year period 1964-70 G.N.P. will increase by 22^ per cent. Over the five-year period1964-65 to 1969-70 the rate of growth of expenditure allowed for is 19-2 per cent.Table 10Public Expenditure on Aid: Basic and Additional Programmes  million at Survey 1965 prices	1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

Total expenditure on roads embraces three main items:(a) the road programme, which comprises new construction and major improvements of major roads, i.e., motorways, trunk roads andclassified roads. (This programme was approved by the previous government for the five years up to and including 1969-70; it is nowbeing reviewed and recommendations on a new five-year programmeup to 1970-71 are being prepared);(b) other new construction unclassified roads, road lighting, car parks, etc.;(c) maintenance and minor improvements; this in turn can be subdivided intomaintenance of major roads and other maintenance.Only part of the field of expenditure covered by items (b) and (c) is grant-aided,and it is therefore less closely controllable and capable of being forecast than theroad programme proper.13. As agreed by Ministers, it was arranged that the Departments concerned would draw up a. basic programme covering total expenditure on roads for 1969-70representing a 40 per cent increase over the 1964-65 level. For the purpose ofthis base year figure the estimate of  397-2 million was taken from the 1964Survey. A 40 per cent increase on this figure indicated a total of just under 560 million for 1969-70. This was just enough to coyer the approved roadSECRET5800 c
programme for that year plus the estimates of other roads expenditure for thelatest year covered by the 1964 Survey, i.e., the year 1968-69, before taking account of price changes. In other words this formula made no allowance for a continuing rise in other roads expenditure beyond 1968-69 but embraced all expenditure covered by plans or projections which were known at the time of the1964 Survey.14. After taking account of price changes and other adjustments, the resulting total of roads expenditure which appears in this report as the basic programme for 1969-70 is just under  575 million. The difference between this and the previously quoted figure of  560 million is accounted for by an additionof  37 -1 million to cover estimated price increases (and a small further additionof  2 million to cover the inclusion of the Road Research Laboratory in thesefigures for the first time) partly offset by the elimination of a sum of  24 million of loan charges (&quot; imputed rents&quot;- see Appendix III) which was formerlyattributed to maintenance and minor improvements. But for this purely technicalchange, the cost of the basic programme at the latest available prices would be just over  599 million.15. Within these total figures, it is the road programme (new construction)which accounts for the bulk of the increase, rising from  164 million in 1964-65to  296 million in 1969-70 before price adjustments, and by a further  30-6 millionnet (to  327 million) if price changes and other factors are taken into account.The reason for this adjustment of over 10 per cent is that the road programme approved by the previous Government was drawn up on the basis of 1962 prices;new price index figures showing changes in road construction costs up to 1964have only recently become available. It has been agreed between the treasury and the Departments concerned that the adoption of these figures for the purposeof calculating the cost of the basic programme does not prejudge the decisions to be taken by Ministers on this programme. For all other road expenditure anincrease in price levels of only 2 .per cent since the last Survey has been allowed in this report, involving only a further  6 - 5 million.16. It is expected that about 480 miles of new motorways and about370 miles of new trunk roads will be completed between 1965-66 and 1969-70.Most of the new trunk roads will be at least to dual two-lane, but some to dualthree-lane carriageway standard.17. The bulk of the expenditure on classified roads is concentrated in the towns, where the relief of congestion rather than the construction of new mileageis the aim; and meaningful figures in terms of mileages cannot therefore be given.18. Included, for completion in the basic programme up to 1969-70 are 50classified road schemes, costing over  1 million each, and some 485 schemescosting between  100,000 and  1 million each.Table 13Public Expenditure on Roads: Basic and Additional Programmes  million at Survey 1965 prices	1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

The additional programmes proposed for roads expenditure involveamounts rising from  4-8 million in 1966-67 to  30 million in 1969-70.
20. Only part of this expenditure relates to the road programme proper, inthe sense of new construction (and major improvements) of motorways, trunk roads and classified roads. For the earlier part of the period under discussion the basic programme falls a little short of the road programme figures approved lastyear plus the extra amount required to maintain the value of the programme in real terms. The reason for this is that, even if it is decided to allow extra expenditure to cover cost increases, there will be a time lag before effect can begiven to this decision. The Departments concerned have therefore proposed thatthese involuntary underspendings should be made good in the last two years of theperiod. This would mainly affect the final year, 1969-70, for which the additional programme would cost  13-9 million.21. The other main additional programme consists of provision for increased expenditure on car parks by local authorities rising from  1 million in 1966-67to  15 million in 1969-70. These are highly speculative estimates of the expenditure for which local authorities might seek loan sanction in response to the guidancewhich has been given to them about the implications of the Buchanan Report sofar as car parking in towns is concerned. Whilst the specific plans of most localauthorities are not yet known, it is significant to note that the level of loansanctions in 1965-66 is already running at more than double that for 1964-65and it is the Governmenfs policy to encourage the construction of more off-streetparking facilities.22. Smaller additional programmes have been included for meeting thewhole of the cost (instead of only half) of certain trunk road lighting schemes fromthe Exchequer; and for setting up testing stations for heavy goods vehicles.Ministers have approved the latter scheme in principle, but the exact timing of its introduction is still open.Railways and waterwaysTable 14Public Expenditure on Railways and Waterways Deficit Grants	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	.1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70British Railways   .........

The expenditure consists of deficit grants to the Railways Board andWaterways Board.24. The waterways subsidy has been assumed to be at a constant level of 1*5 million. The Government are awaiting proposals from the Board about future policy. and a realistic reappraisal of the future requirement for subsidymust depend on the outcome of the proposed policy review.. 25. The railways subsidy figures are based on an estimate of the prospectivesize of the deficit made by the Railways Board. Their deficit in 1964 was 120-9 million, and the estimates for intervening years show a steady downwardtrend to something between a nil and a  20 million deficit figure estimated for 1970.In working out their figures the Railways Board have made various importantassumptions about wage levels, the implementation of policy proposals forre-shaping the railways, fares and freight charges. They have of course relatedtheir estimate to the forecast increase of 25 per cent in G.D.P. and, as a serviceindustry, will be adversely affected by any shortfall in this target. The ministry will shortly be discussing the figures with the Board in the context of settlinga financial target and until these forecasts have been completed (which will take some time), the figures must be regarded as tentative forecasts.

The cost of agricultural support in future years is affected by changesin the level of supplies and in market prices which cannot be forecast with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Further, it is not possible to forecast the natureor effect of adaptations or modifications in the system of agricultural support which may be made at future Annual Reviews. In these circumstances, the only practical course is to assume forecast figures for agricultural support of the same order as the estimate for 1965-66 adjusted to take account of the conclusions ofthe 1965 Annual Review.27. An examination of the development of the agricultural industry is currently taking place which will almost certainly lead to substantial expenditure during the forecast period designed to improve the structural efficiency ofagriculture and to make the best use of agricultural resources. It is, however,anticipated that this expenditure will in general form part of the system ofagricultural support and accordingly it is deemed to be accommodated within thepresent forecast.Other assistance to industry, transport and agricultureTable 16Public Expenditure on Other Assistance to Industry, Transport and Agriculture	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Ports...............	19 0	25-5	26-9	29-6	31-6	33-other transport (excluding roads and						railways)............	40-2	53-4	60-2	59-8	61-3	57-6Employment services      ......	34-8	37-8	43-7	46-2	48-6	51-0Shipbuilding loans.........	28-7	30-8	-5-7*	-5-7*	111	-7-4*Other industry and trade ...	76-5	80-0	94 0	113-2	114 0	113-4of which:						Assistance   to  the aircraft						industry   .........	18-1	17-1	26-3	26-9	24-9	24-0Promotion of local employment	33-0	36-7	35-9	50-0	50-4	49-other............	25-4	26-2	31-8	36-3	38-7	39-other services to agriculture, fisheries						and forestry      .........	71-3	71-1	79-9	80-3	79-3	76-1Total      .........	270-5	298-6	299-0	323-4	345-9	324-1of which:						Domestic capital ex-						penditure......	117-6	135-2	113-8	125-8	142-4	117-other expenditure ...	152-9	163-4	185-2	197-6	203-5	206-8* Loan repaymentAgricultural supportTable 15Public Expenditure on Agricultural Support
Ports i28. These forecasts relate to the investment expenditure of ports other thannationalised ports and those wholly owned by production industries for theirown use. They are based on information obtained from the port authorities aboutthe schemes they plan to undertake in the next few years and on the interimproposals of the National Ports Council for port development.29. The substantial increase in capital expenditure arises from the need forextensive modernisation of existing facilities and for the provision of new facilities to provide the capacity required to handle the trade expansion implicit in the basic assumption of the increase in national production.30. Also included under this heading is some relatively small expenditureon fisheries ports.Other transport31. It has been assumed that the British Airports Authority will be setup from 1st April, 1966, and capital investment amounting to  9-2 million in1968-69 and  6-7 million in 1969-70 has been included under this heading. Theremaining expenditure covers miscellaneous transport services including expenditure on road passenger transport by local authorities. Also included here is the Channel Tunnel; even if the project received early approval there wouldbe only relatively small expenditure on construction during the period and a sumof  0-5 million has been included to cover this.Employment services32. The increase forecast on employment services is very largelyaccounted for by the progressive coming into operation of approved schemesfor grants and loans to the new Industrial Training Boards. The level of assistanceto the Boards will be determined by the extent to which improvements are madein the quality and quantity of training in British industry; and the forecastsassume that every effort will be made to introduce such improvements as quickly as possible.Shipbuilding loans33. The forecasts for the shipbuilding loan scheme are based on theassumption that all payments except that for the Q4 will have been completed by 1965-66. The loan of  17-6 million to the Cunard Company for the Q4 isexpected to be taken up in 1968-69.Other industry and trade34. The basic programme for assistance to the aircraft industry only coversforecasts of expenditure on projects already approved (including the Concord) andcontains no allowance for any continuation of such assistance through the approvalof further projects.35. Government policy on location of industry and assistance to local employment is at present under review and there is every expectation that theexisting provisions of the Local Employment Act, which expire in 1967, will be modified to a greater or lesser degree in the legislation which succeeds it. Meanwhile,however, the basic programme for this expenditure has been calculated on theassumption that current policies and programmes will be continued with little or no change. Expenditure to 1969-70 has therefore in general been projected atthe estimated level for 1966-67, as accurate forecasts of fluctuations in expenditure are not possible; a small increase has, however, been allowed over the period forthe provision of Board of Trade factories. It has also been assumed that in 1968-69and 1969-70 the final part ( 2 million) of the loan for the Fort William Pulp and paper Mill-will be drawn.36.

As regards expenditure on the Research Councils and technology, thefigures simply represent estimates by the Departments of the amounts that theywould wish to spend over the period. None of the figures commits either theTreasury or Departments. The figures for expenditure on technology in 1969-70assume that there will be further legislation to increase the provision for theNational Research Development Corporation.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agricultureand Fisheries for Scotland for which  37 million has been included for 1969-70.The rest of the expenditure is made up of a number of miscellaneous items suchas the Development Commission.38. The figures in Table 16 include provision for the following additionalpolicy developments which have not yet been agreed:
Other research41. This includes Ministry of Aviation civil research and development, forwhich the figures cover both committed expenditure, and a number of quite largeuncommitted items (e.g., continuation of the initial European launcher development Organisation (E.L.D.O.) programme beyond end-1965, futureE.L.D.O. programmes, the small satellite launcher and research and development for civil communications satellites). The Ministry of Aviation committedexpenditure does not therefore include provision for any major continuing civilspace activity, national or international. (The European Organisation for space research (E.S.R.O.) and scientific space research are the responsibility of the science research Council.)

The Cabinet have agreed that in 1.965 156,000 approvals shall be givenfor local authority and New Town Corporation housing programmes. This will lead to about 149,000 houses being started in 1965-66 (about 6,000 of them in new Towns) compared with 138,000 houses started in 1964-65. No decisions have yet been taken for future years.43. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government have proposed thatthere should be a 5 per cent increase in the local authority programme each year.The Ministry contend that this is in line with the Governmenfs housing policy,and that the total forecast should feature in the basic programme. The Treasuryview, which has been taken as the basis for the Table, is that the 1965 level ofapprovals represents a substantial increase over the 118,000 local authorityapprovals which formed the basis of the 1964 review (the actual number ofapprovals eventually given in 1964 was 139,500), and that it would be reasonable to assume a constant level of 150,000 approvals a year for a basic programme, theremainder featuring in an additional programme. The Ministry of Housing areunable to accept this, and the matter remains unresolved. The figures shown inthe Table have been supplied by the Ministry of Housing on the understandingthat their position is reserved.44. New Town housing forecasts have been reduced over last year&apos;s forecasts for the early years to take account of difficulties mainly labour shortages being experienced. The figures represent the level of activity in the 17 New Towns alreadydesignated, and the additional programme relates to work in New Towns yet tobe designated. It is thought that the rate of activity will increase during theperiod, and the basic programme assumes that 11,500 houses wil be started in theNew Towns in 1969-70.45. The method of assessing the average cost of a dwelling has been changedfrom that employed hitherto. The Table is based on the average cost of a localauthority dwelling in tenders approved during the 12 months ended 30th September,1964, which represents the estimated expenditure on construction in 1965-66. Thefigure of  2,897 per house represents an increase of  298 or 10-3 per cent over thecorresponding figure of  2,599 for 1964-65.46. The average cost of a New Town house has been taken as  3,400, anincrease of  400 over the figures used last year.
Scotland47. The basic housing programme for local authorities has been drawn upon the basis endorsed by Ministers giving a 10 per cent growth over the period1964-65 to 1969-70. Taking into account New Towns this gives a forecast of32,500 starts in 1969-70. The case for the additional programme rests on the needfor housing in Scotland, and the ability of local authorities and New Towns to attain a target of 40,000 housing starts during 1969-70.48. The average cost per dwelling  3,100 for both local authority andNew Town housing is assessed in the same way as for local authority housing inEngland and Wales. The cost has increased by  100 since 1964-65.Table 19Public Expenditure on Housing Investment: Basic and Additional Programmes	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

The additional programme under this block allows for an increase of ,500 houses each year in England and Wales from 1965-66 onwards (i.e., 30,000additional completions in 1969-70). For Scotland, it allows for a programme rising to 7,500 additional houses in 1969-70.Public and private housing subsidies (including improvement grants)Table 20Public Expenditure on Housing Subsidies [including Improvement Grants):Basic Programme	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Subsidies    ......... of which: England and Wales	135-7 92-7	144-5 97-8	154-7 102-6	164 0 106-5	174-8 111-7	185-9 117-3Scotland     .........	43-0	46-7	52-1	57-5	63-1	68-6Improvement grants       ......	17-6	19-2	22-4	25-9	25-9	25-9Total      .........	153-3	163-7	177-1	189-9	200-7	211-850. Public subsidies comprise payments by the Housing Departments tolocal authorities in respect of houses completed and contributions by localSECRET5800 d
authorities from their Rate Funds to their Housing Revenue Accounts. Theincreased forecasts reflect the greater number of completions towards the end ofthe period and the higher average rate of Exchequer subsidy due to increasedbuilding of high flats.51. The number of private houses qualifying for payment of improvement grants from local authorities is expected to increase.Table 21Public Expenditure on Housing Subsidies (including Improvement Grants):Basic and Additional Programmes	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					. 1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

The forecasts for advances reflect the increase in advances by the housing corporation under the Housing Act, 1964, offset by a decrease in advances to housing Associations under the Housing Act, 1961, and repayments of advances made to BuiAding Societies.

Water55. A constantly increasing demand for water for industrial, agricultural and domestic purposes has been reflected in recent years in increasing investment expenditure in water supplies. The forecasts assume a continuation of presenttrends.Sewerage56. Capital expenditure on sewerage is expected to increase because of theneed to cope with the rapidly rising consumption of water, the increase in difficulttrade effluents requiring treatment, and growing public insistence on purereffluents, notably as affecting rivers and beaches.Refuse disposal and other public health services57. Expenditure in England and Wales is expected to increase because ofthe growing shortage of tipping sites, and the use of more plant for refuse disposal.Water conservation and coast protection58. Expenditure on coast protection in England and Wales is expected tocontinue at about the current level. Expenditure on water conservation by theriver authorities set up under the Water Resources Act, 1963 will begin in 1965-66.Provision, which was also included in the 1964 review, is made for two majorriver regulating schemes commencing in 1966-67.Parks, pleasure grounds and baths59. Expenditure under this heading includes provision for additional facilities for sport.Town and country planning and miscellaneous60. An increase in activity in England and Wales over the last year suggeststhat the forecasts made last year for expenditure on town and country planning were too low. In particular, there has been a substantial increase in the purchase by localauthorities of land in advance of requirement.Police and prisonsTable 24Public Expenditure on Police and Prisons: Basic Programme	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey		1	965 Surve	y		1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Domestic capital expenditure England and Wales......

England and Wales61. Expenditure on police arising from existing policies is expected to riseby 21-4 per cent in the period. About 80 per cent of this is on pay, etc. (mostlyfor police, also for civilian staff); strength is, therefore, the determining factor.An increase in uniformed strength from 80,700 to 94,000 is forecast. Of this increase of 13,300, it is estimated that 4,000 will be obtained as the direct resultof the introduction of a scheme to pay incentive allowances in areas of persistentlow strength. Civilians, including traffic wardens and cadets, are expected toincrease from 20,200 to 28,000. The 1969-70 estimates of strength for uniformedpolice are higher than the total establishment at present authorised but these arebeing increased.62. Expenditure on prisons is expected to increase by 19-2 per cent overthe period. The main assumptions underlying the figures are that (a) the prison/borstal population will remain constant but that by the end of the period 1,000new places will have been provided in detention and remand centres, (b) prisonstaff will increase by 3,200 mainly for the new establishments for which thebuilding programme provides, but also to implement agreed improvements in conditions of service.63. Taking police and prisons together, the overall growth rate implied inthese developments is 21-1 per cent, i.e., in excess of the target growth of 15 percent for the block. The figures given for the basic programme in Table 24 representthe 1964-65 figures increased by 15 per cent by 1969-70, plus  6 million for the implementation of the manning-up allowance arrangements, which were agreedafter the growth rate was discussed. The remainder required for the implementation of existing policies ( 6-7 million in 1969-70) is shown as an additional programmecovering police and prisons.Scotland64. The forecast provides for expenditure on police to grow by 14-7 percent; this covers an increase in uniformed strength from 10,347 to 11,250 by1969-70.65. The forecast for prisons provides for an increase in expenditure of 16-6per cent over the period. The underlying assumptions are that (a) although the prison population will remain at about the present level more appropriateaccommodation is necessary and the building programme aims ultimately toproduce about 380 places for adults and 280 places for young offenders; and (b)prison staffs will increase by about 215, mainly to fill new posts arising from theprovision of new institutions.66. The overall rate of growth for police and prisons together in scotland is forecast at 15 per cent by 1969-70.Table 25Public Expenditure on Police and Prisons: Basic and Additional Programmes	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

For the education block of expenditure, an increase of 30 per cent between 1964-65 (1964 Survey) and 1969-70 plus expenditure on school meals and milk would give a figure of  1,887-9 million for 1969-70. The figures inTable 26 are based on those submitted by Departments.SOCIAL services education (with school meals and milk)Table 26
Capital expenditure70. The basic programme assumes building starts for schools and further education at the levels already agreed up to 1966-67 i.e.,  84 million a year and 27 million a year, respectively, for England and Wales, and  17 million a yearand  7 million a year, respectively, for Scotland. The basic programme also includes an addition in the case of the school-building programmes for the raising of the school-leaving age in 1970-71. For teacher training, starts of  10 million a year in England and Wales are assumed for 1967-68 onwards, and starts of 1-5 million in Scotland (a little over  1 million in 1969-70). The balance needed to carry out existing policies, e.g., in the case of the school-building programme,the balance needed to keep pace with the increased numbers of pupils (includingthe effects of raising the school-leaving age), appears in the additional programme,together with the amount needed to maintain the present annual rate of replacement of wholly unsatisfactory schools.71. In the case of the universities, the basic programme takes account of approved building starts up to 1968-69 and assumes a continuance in 1969-70of the 1968-69 level of  25 million.OTHER EXPENDITUREPrimary and secondary schools72. The basic programme assumes that in England and Wales the numberof pupils will rise by 10 per cent between 1965-66 and 1969-70 and the teacherforce by nearly 17 per cent. The comparable figures for Scotland are 7 per cent and 11 per cent. The effect of this increase in pupils together with an allowance for improvement of standards at the current rates produces an increase in non--teaching costs in schools in Great Britain of 27 per cent.Further education73. The basic programme provides for an increase of 42 per cent, in Englandand Wales, in the number of students doing full-time and sandwich courses atadvanced level and of 24 per cent in part-time work. In Scotland there is provisionfor an increase of 40 per cent in the number of advanced students taking full-timeand sandwich courses. The expansion of lower level work in Great Britaingenerally is assumed to continue on the basis of the policies laid down in the white papers of 1956 and 1961 as affected by the Report of the Committee on DayRelease and by the Industrial Training Act, 1964. For further education as awhole teaching costs and non-teaching costs are expected to rise by 25 per cent and 36 per cent respectively in England and Wales and 43 per cent and 44 percent respectively in Scotland.Teacher training74. In the basic programme it has been assumed that students will increasein number by about 25 per cent in England and Wales in accordance withannounced expansion programmes which are in this period roughly commensurate with the expansion to 122,000 places in Great Britain by 1973-74 envisaged inthe Robbins report. The increase in Scotland is 33 per cent.Universities and Colleges of Advanced Technology75. The basic programme assumes that total student numbers will increase to the planning figures recommended by the Robbins Committee, i.e., 218,000 by1973-74. The provision for the earlier years is based on the approved quinquennialsettlement (to 31st July, 1967) and additions set out in Appendix I to the 1965-66Estimates (Class VII, 7). Some improvement is assumed in the next quinquennialsettlement. The figures also include provision for some expansion of technology.

The additional programme consists of a large number of developments,which vary greatly in cost. The following are the most important.Capital expenditure77. Expenditure in England and Wales is based on the following additionalbuilding starts:  million	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Primary and secondary schools	 	 	42-0	42-0Special schools         .......	 	1-0	1-5	2-0Minor works..........	3-0	6-0	5-0	4-6Further education     ......	 	50	60	7-0Teacher training       .......	 	 	7-0	7-0Universities     ......	3-2	10-8	13-5	15-5Youth service.........	0-5	0-5	0-5	0-578. After allowing for the cost of sites, equipment and professional fees, thetotal additional capital expenditure in 1969-70, including Scotland, amounts to 91 million, of which  20 million is for the universities.Schools79. For England and Wales, the basic programme assumes building startsof  84 million a year, and in Scotland  17 million plus some addition for raising the school-leaving age in 1970-71. The additional requirements for primary and secondary major building and for minor works are to provide places which cannotbe found in the basic programme for the growing school population and for raising the school-leaving age, and to maintain the present level of expenditure onimproving and replacing existing unsatisfactory buildings. In Scotland extrabuilding work of  4 million a year is included from 1966-67 onwards.Further education80. The additional provision in further education is to meet the consequences of the Industrial Training Act and to provide for a further 23,000 places inadvanced courses to match the expected growth in the number of qualified schoolleavers; increased grants for adult education are also included.Teacher training81. Broadly speaking, the additional programme would allow the presenttarget of 122,000 teacher training places by 1973 to be brought forward to 1970.SECRET5800 ei   Table 27Public Expenditure on Education (with School Meals and Milk):
Universities82. The additional programme for universities provides for extra buildingstarts of  7 million in 1967-68 and  8 million thereafter and  2 million a year tomeet the cost of a planned programme of site acquisition, as a result of currentreviews. It also includes provision for the North East Technological University,an increased rate of expansion at the Royal College of Art and the College ofAeronautics and a further expansion of medical education, including another newmedical school.Other expenditure83. This includes the additional current requirements resulting from the extra capital expenditure mentioned above. In addition, the main developmentsinclude:(i) A modest expansion in nursery schools to deal with the urgent problemsof slum areas and high flats, at a cost in 1969-70 of  1 million.(ii) A partial development of the plan to make places at independent schoolsavailable to a wider range of pupils, at a cost in 1969-70 of  8 million.(iii) Additional grants to voluntary schools,  at a cost in  1969-70 of 1 - 6 million.(iv) Various measures designed to make better use of the existing teachingforce and to encourage part-time and longer service in the profession,at a total cost in 1969-70 of  19 million (excluding  4-9 million for pensions).(v) Various measures designed to increase the supply of teachers, includingthe introduction of a four-term year in colleges of education and the wider use of part-time training, technical teacher training and in-service training, at a total cost in 1969-70 of approximately  12 million.(vi) Additional provision for the universities, costing  13 million in 1969-70,including some further improvement to recurrent grants in the quinquennium beginning in 1967-68, and provision for the North-EastTechnological University and the expansion of medical education.(vii) A number of miscellaneous developments in the field of recreational,social and physical education, including extending the facilities fortraining youth leaders, more direct Exchequer assistance to amateursport and further developments in the facilities for educationalresearch total cost in 1969-70,  2^ million.(viii)  20 million in 1969-70 has also been included as the possible capital and current cost of running the University of the Air on a fourth televisionchannel, assuming a decision to start in 1966-67.

The basic forecasts for health and welfare expenditure (other thanwelfare foods) show an increase of 21-9 per cent over the period 1964-65 to1969-70, i.e., they are within the target growth rate of 22Jr per cent. Despitedivergence between the rates of development for different services, the overallrates of growth for health and welfare in England and Wales and in Scotland are broadly similar.Hospitals85. The assumption in the programme is that hospital current expenditure will grow over the period at 2\ per cent per annum in England and Wales and atHealth and welfare (with welfare foods)Table 28Public Expenditure on Health and Welfare (with Welfare Foods):Basic Programme
3 per cent (3^ per cent in 1966-67) per annum in Scotland. The Health Departmentsconsider that growth at these rates will not be sufficient, and accordingly they haveeach included a bid for a higher rate in their additional programmes.86. The basic programme allows for investment in the hospital service torise in England and Wales from  74 million in 1965-66 to  94 million in 1969-70.The corresponding figures in Scotland are  9-9 million and  11-9 million.Executive Council services87. The total increase forecast for these services in England and Wales is 68 million or 27 - 9 per cent. The corresponding figures for Scotland are  7 million or 25-7 per cent. Four-fifths of the increase in Great Britain is accounted for by increased expenditure on the pharmaceutical services. Provision is made for the continuation of the trend towards more widespread use of modern expensive drugsand there is a small annual increase reflecting the growth of population, but by far the largest element is the estimated cost of the abolition of prescription chargesamounting in all to some  34 million. Of this about  24 million represents the lossof revenue and about a further  10 million a consequential increase in patientdemand.88. For general medical services, no long-term change in the number of doctors giving service is forecast. A modest annual increase in the generalexpenditure incurred in doctors&apos; practices has been assumed. The forecast providesalso for a sharp increase in the number of ancillary staff which would be expected from implementation of a scheme to reimburse directly to the individual doctorpart of the cost of employing such staff; provision is also made for expenditure onimprovement grants for premises and on free central provision of sterile syringes.These arrangements are estimated to result in increased expenditure of about 3 - 5 million by 1969-70. The future development of the service must now, however,depend on the outcome of the negotiations with the medical profession in whichalternative arrangements for the reimbursement of ancillary staff costs and forprovision of capital are under consideration. The additional expenditure which islikely to be required is forecast as an additional programme.89. For general dental services, provision is made for an expected increaseof 115 to 125 (including 5 to 10 in Scotland) dentists a year in the service and for increasing expenditure (2  per cent per annum) on practice organisation andequipment, which is expected to help to produce an increase in the average output per dentist. On the supplementary ophthalmic services, the only significant forecastchange is a small increase in the use of the service each year.Local authority health and welfare services90. The rate of development of local health services in England and Wales,including capital expenditure met from revenue, has been rising to reach 5 per cent to 5-1 per cent a year in recent years at constant pay and prices. The forecasts assume that the rate of development will further increase to about 6 per cent a year in1965-66 and 1966-67 (as allowed for in the General Grant Order, 1964) and toabout 6^ per cent a year in the later years covered by the Survey. Correspondingexpenditure on the local authority welfare services, the main element being forresidential accommodation for the elderly, has also been increasing rapidly, andthe forecasts assume a rate of development of rather more than 8 per cent a year in 1965-66 and 1966-67 (as in the General Grant Order, 1964) and of some\ per cent a year in the later Survey years.91. In Scotland, local health services have tended to develop at rather a slower rate than in England, and the increase expected on current expenditure over theperiod is about 25 per cent, from  8-3 million to  10-4 million. A faster rate of growth, at about 50 per cent over the period, is forecast for local welfare services where, as in England and Wales, the emphasis is on more residential accommodation for the elderly.92. The level of local authority investment in the local health and welfare services continues to increase, and the forecasts assume that work done, including that financed out of revenue and special funds, will reach  27-7 million (GreatBritain) in 1965-66, mainly as a result of loan sanctions already given, and will rise to  35-3 million by 1969-70.
Welfare foods93. The increased expenditure is related to the expected rise in the birthrate. If the price of welfare milk to the beneficiary remains unchanged, the increasein the retail price of milk following the recent Farm Price Review will add 1-2 million in Great Britain in a full year.Table 29Public Expenditure on Health and Welfare (with Welfare Foods): Basic and additional Programmes	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme......... Additional programme    ...... Total	1,237-5	1,316-3	1,361-4 54-5	1,409-7 591	1,456-1 70-4	1,504-0 88-3	1,237-5	1,316-3	1,415-9	1,468-8	1,526-5	1,592-3Hospitals94. The scale of expenditure on hospital building permitted under the definition of basic programme is regarded by the Health Departments as inadequate to improve the rate of replacement of very old hospitals and to provide additional accommodation to meet growing demands. To meet these requirements additional provision is sought during the period under review in England and Wales to theextent of  5 million in 1966-67,  6 million in 1967-68,  8 million in 1968-69 and 13 million in 1969-70. The corresponding figures in Scotland are  0-4 million, 0-5 million,  1-8 million, and  2-8 million. This will involve additional current expenditure most of which will mature in the 1970s.95. Similarly the rate of development in hospital running costs is held to be inadequate to permit of the orderly development of existing policies and the desiredexpansion of the capital programme. Accordingly bids to increase the rates above those permitted in the basic programme have been made in England and Wales tothe extent of \ per cent in the earlier years rising to 1 per cent by 1969-70. InScotland an increase of i per cent is sought from 1967-68 onwards. This wouldinvolve additional expenditure of  17-2 million in 1969-70.General practitioner services96. Whatever the outcome of the present discussions with the doctors thereis no doubt that additional expenditure will be incurred on improving doctors&apos;surgeries and providing ancillary staff. If agreement is reached with them, this will need to be regarded as having a prior claim on additional moneys available forthe health and welfare service. It is not possible at this stage to estimate at allclosely the extent and particularly the pace of development. The bid assumes that new premises provided by local authorities and Exchequer agencies together with additional Vote-borne running expenditure on these and on new premises built bydoctors with borrowed private finance will rise to  6 million by 1969-70 for england and Wales; and further expenditure on ancillary staff and equipmentbeyond that allowed for in the basic programme will rise to  2 million in 1969-70.Proportional expenditure of  0-8 million in 1969-70 is envisaged &apos;    Scotland.97. Some acceleration in the repayment of compensation to elderly doctorsis contemplated. Depending on the formula adopted, this could advanceexpenditure by  1-7 million in 1966-67 and by  1 million in 1969-70.98. Although no concrete proposals have been made, improvements todental practice have been assumed to require an additional  0-6 million a year
by 1969-70. (For this item, and for the items marked with an asterisk below, theScottish Home and Health Department have submitted additional programmefigures totalling  0-5 million in 1969-70.)Spectacle frames99. A modest extension of the range of N.H.S. frames available is assumed to cost  1-1 million a year by 1969-70, though if charges for spectacles were abolished the increased demand would raise this figure substantially (see below).Transport for the disabled100. The supply of motor cars, instead of tricycles, to N.H.S. patients onthe same basis as to war pensioners and other improvements in the conditions would increase the cost by  3-3 million in 1966-67 rising to  6-6 million in1969-70.Miscellaneous101. On the assumption that measles vaccination is adopted as a generalpolicy the cost will be  4 million in 1966-67 falling to  0-7 million in 1969-70.102. Replacement of the present transistor hearing aids by head-worn aidscould entail a capital programme of about  5 million and running costs of 1 million a year. The incidence of this is not certain but an additional cost of 2-2 million a year has been assumed starting in 1966-67.*103. Additional annual expenditure on health education was contemplated by the Cohen Committee at  0-5 million a year, falling jointly on central andlocal government.*104. Additional developments in the local health and welfare field areassumed to include some expenditure on family planning and care of the elderlyand are expected to add something of the order of  1 million, possibly rising to 3 million in 1969-70.Patients charges105. In addition to the cost of further development of the service, the health Departments&apos; additional programme contains an item for the cost of furtherabolition of charges to patients. The cost of abolishing the prescription charges in February 1965 has been included in the basic forecasts. The cost of furtherabolition will depend on the extent to which it is carried, but the cost for particular items is assumed to rise by 1969-70 to:  million(i) Dental treatment..................       6-7(ii) Dentures    ......      ...............       7-8(hi) Spectacles......................      12-0(This last item would rise to  15-3 million if abolition were accompanied by an extension of choice mentioned under &quot; spectacleframes &quot; above.)The cost in the intervening years would, of course, depend on the timing ofabolition.106.  There is no additional programme for welfare foods.

The forecast reflects the established trend in the number of childrencommitted to the care of local authorities or sent to Approved Schools and RemandHomes. Expenditure is shown as rising by 40-2 per cent in Great Britain in theperiod covered by the Survey. This provides in England and Wales inter alia for:(a) the number of field officers to rise from 1,500 to 3,000; and(b) the output of trained officers to rise to 400 a year by 1967-68 as comparedwith 240 in 1965-66.Corresponding increases are also anticipated in Scotland.108.

For calculating the trend of future expenditure, it has been assumed that:(a) the benefits and assistance rates introduced in 1965 will be increased by -6 per cent on 1st April, 1966, and each subsequent year, which isthe expected rate of increase of real earnings per head corresponding. to the assumed growth of the Gross Domestic Product of 25 per cent. between 1964 and 1970;(b) the rate of unemployment in Great Britain will remain stable at 1 - 5 per centin 1966-67 and subsequent years;(c) wage-related unemployment benefit will be introduced in the autumn of1966 at an approximate cost of  20 million in the first full year (1967-68),adjusted in subsequent years to take account of earnings increases.110. Even, if there were to be no further change in the rates of benefitintroduced in 1965, total expenditure (including administration costs) for the blockcomprising national insurance benefits, national assistance, war pensions and family allowances would continue to rise throughout the period, mainly because ofthe increasing number of retirement pensions, and by 1969-70 it would be 154 million higher than in 1965-66.111. Provision has been made in the above figure for the normal trend of anannual increase in the number of national assistance recipients arising from anageing population. There are, however, substantial numbers of old people who might have an entitlement to national assistance but who, for a variety of reasons,do not apply. The impact of an impending special publicity drive directed towardsovercoming this reluctance cannot be forecast with any accuracy. Further provision has, however, been made in the years 1966-67 onwards for the additional growthwhich might result.Benefits and assistance (including family allowances)Table 31
112. For the years 1966-67 to 1969-70 it has been assumed that there willbe no change in the level of rents payable to people receiving national assistance.It is possible, however, that during this period, rents may increase faster thanprices. It is not possible to quantify the difference in terms of national assistanceexpenditure. But, for illustrative purposes, it may be assumed that for each0-1 per cent per annum by which rent increases exceed the assumed average rateof price increases, the additional national assistance expenditure would be approximately  0-1 million per annum.Table 32Public Expenditure on Benefits and Assistance, (including Family Allowances) :Basic and Additional Programmes	  million at Survey 1965 prices						1964 Survey	1965 Survey					1964-65	1965-66	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70Basic programme.........

At the present early stage of the Governmenfs social security review,it is not possible to give detailed estimates of the cost of the main projects not covered by the basic programme. The following is, however, a general account ofthe proposals put forward by the Department but not yet considered by ministers collectively:(a) Wage-related sickness benefit.   Proposals are being prepared, for theSocial Services Committee, for introducing wage-related sickness benefit in autumn 1966 (along with its counterpart, wage-related unemploymentbenefit, which is included in the basic programme). The cost (allowing for some saving on national assistance and additional administrationcosts) might be of the order of  30 million a year by 1969-70.(b) Income guarantee.  The Election Manifesto committed the Governmentto the early introduction of an income guarantee scheme. Plans arebeing prepared for a scheme which might begin next year. It mightbe possible to make a modest start at a net additional cost (allowing for saving on national assistance) of something like  100 million a year and perhaps to maintain the scheme within much the same orderof cost up to 1969-70 assuming, among other things, that the guaranteed&quot; income for those covered (persons over minimumretirement age only) would be no more than a few shillings a weekabove national assistance levels.(c) National insurance revision.   Any major revision of the national insurancescheme consequent upon the current review would be unlikely to makea substantial impact on costs by 1969-70. But some interim reform of widows&apos; benefits may be needed within a net cost of up to, say, 20 million a year including possibly an allowance, for &quot;the initial period of widowhood, related to the husband&apos;s earnings.(d) Other improvements.  As in the past, minor improvements will be foundnecessary from time to time to meet particular problems. They are not likely to have any substantial bearing on the amount of totalSECRET58O0 f
expenditure under the schemes but might represent, say,  10 million a year by 1969-70. Examples of possible improvements are:(i) the proposals now being considered by Ministers for giving further help totalling rather more than  1 million a year to workmeninjured before 1948 with entitlement under the formerWorkmen&apos;s Compensation Acts;(ii) any extra cost resulting from changes in the national assistancescale rates and their relativities now being studied by theNational Assistance Board, or from making adjustments in thenational assistance provisions upon the introduction of an income Guarantee.(e) Family Allowances. In view of the substantial cost, it will, probably notbe possible to give a very high priority to the thorough reorganisation of family allowances promised in the Election Manifesto; the mostmodest proposals for allowances to increase with the child&apos;s age could hardly cost less than  40 million a year. It may, however, be necessaryto make some interim improvement to help the larger families. It isnot possible to predict what form this would take but, by way ofillustration, the cost of doubling the allowances for the fourth and subsequent children in the family (to make them  1) would be about 25 million a year in 1969-70 (allowing for some saving on national assistance).114.

The forecast provides for an increase in expenditure of 33-3 per cent over the period for England and Wales. (There will be a corresponding increasein income from fines, etc.) Provision is made for the number of Probation officers to increase from 2,250 to 3,500 and for the number of criminal cases in whichlegal aid is granted to increase from 21,000 to 32,000 in England and Wales. Thereare corresponding increases for Scotland.Fire services116. For England and Wales an increase in operational strengths of 800a year has been assumed in the light of current recruitment trends. Provision isalso made for additional civilian staff mainly for fire prevention work. these increases largely account for the increased expenditure of 25-9 per cent over theperiod. In Scotland the increase over the period is 28-3 per cent and allows foran increase of about 100 per year in operational strengths and for an increasein civilian staff.Libraries, museums and arts117. Forecasts of expenditure by local authorities in England and Wales on local libraries and museums, rising to about  54 million in 1969-70, assume animprovement in standards of the public library service consequent upon thePublic Libraries and Museums Act, 1964. In Scotland where similar considerations apply, such expenditure is estimated to rise to  2-5 million in 1969-70.
118. For the arts an increase in expenditure is forecast; this is no morethan a projection of current trends. There is no way in which a precise financialassessment can be made of the policy foreshadowed in the White Paper,&quot; A Policy for the Arts-The First Steps &quot; (Cmnd. 2601).Land Commission119. The figures include expenditure of  29 million in 1969-70 relating tonet expenditure on land acquisition, crown hold building costs and administrative expenses in respect of the proposed Land Commission.

For national accounting purposes figures of Gross National Productand of expenditure on this product include Northern Ireland. The figures for individual headings in this report exclude expenditure by the public sector ofNorthern Ireland and an overall adjustment has to be made for this. It coversexpenditure by the central government, local authorities and public corporations in Northern Ireland. The figures take into account the revised expenditure programmes arising from the Wilson Report.121. Sales of fixed assets are not deducted from the figures of public expenditure shown against individual headings of this report and hence an overalldeduction is included here to bring the total of public expenditure on the same basis as statistics of national expenditure. The figure for other sales represents a similar adjustment in respect of certain miscellaneous Extra-Exchequer Receiptswhich are regarded as an offset to public consumption expenditure but whichcannot be easily allocated to individual headings. The balancing item is an adjustment required to reconcile the figures submitted by Departments with those used for national accounting purposes because of differences, which it has notbeen possible to eliminate in time for this report, arising from differences in the sources of information which have been used.

APPENDIX inMETHODOLOGYDefinition of expenditureIn order that the figures of public expenditure set out in this report can beanalysed in terms of the demand made on national resources, and to enable themto be fitted in with statistics of national income and expenditure covering the wholeeconomy, expenditure has to be measured strictly in accordance with the methods,sources and definitions used by the Central Statistical Office in compiling the accounts of the public sector as part of the more embracing system of national accounts. The composition of total public expenditure in terms of economiccategories is set out in Table 47 of the 1964 Blue Book on National Income andExpenditure together with the receipts of the public sector which finance theexpenditure. At the back of the 1964 Blue Book there is a table providing figuresof past expenditure classified in the ways used for surveys of future expenditure.The figures in this report are an extension of these on a constant price basis.Price basis2. The constant price basis used for figures for each heading in this report is designed to show the change in expenditure from year to year after discountingany effect which price changes may have on the amount of money to be spent orthe amount of work that can be done.3. Figures for current expenditure on goods and services are as nearly aspossible on the same price basis as the 1965-66 Budget Estimates. Figures for capital expenditure are mostly at March, 1965 prices. In some cases, however(e.g., roads and education), it has not been possible accurately to assess prices for march, 1965, and it has then been necessary to use the price basis currently in use for planning purposes. Payments such as grants and loans to industry, subsidies and overseas aid which do not involve the direct purchase of goods and services are measured in terms of current levels of prices, not anticipated future prices.4. The treatment of figures for benefits and assistance is designed to show the change of expenditure from year to year, if there is removed from changesin rates of benefit, as and when these take place, the element that can be attributed to price changes since the date of the last change. Between April-May 1963 and march, 1965 the increase in retail prices was 5-7 per cent and this has been taken as the element attributable to price changes in the alteration of rates of benefittaking effect from April, 1965. The figures of benefits and assistance for 1964-65have been reworked by applying in place of the actual rates for that year rates ofbenefit 5-7 per cent higher. The resultant figures for 1964-65 of expenditure &quot; atSurvey 1965 prices &quot; when compared with the figures of expenditure for 1965-66show the change brought about partly by changes in numbers and partly by changes in the real value of the rate of benefit being applied. The figures for theyears after 1965-66 show the change in expenditure resulting from the same two factors, on the basis (adopted to reveal the trend) that rates of benefit are changedyear by year (instead of at intervals of two to three years as has been the practice)and the increase in rates of benefit apart from the effect of price changes will bein line with the increase in average real earnings per head.5. Where, as in the case of family allowances, there has been no change inthe rate of benefit, no adjustment is made. Although the real value of the benefit is being depreciated by the rise in prices, there is nothing in the change in theamount of money being provided from year to year that can be attributed to theeffect of prices changes. No adjustment is needed to obtain figures of expenditure&quot; at constant prices &quot;. The constant price concept, it should be understood, is notthe same as the concept of &quot; expenditure in real terms &quot;. For the latter it would be appropriate to adjust all expenditure by an index of the change in the purchasingpower of money, whether or not rates of benefit were changed.6. Figures on the basis just described are referred to as &quot; at Survey 1965prices &quot;. It must be remembered that this price basis is appropriate for comparing the increase in public expenditure in one year with another, and for relating thegrowth of the total to the agreed maximum increase of A\ per cent a year. It is nots
appropriate when calculating the proportion of total public expenditure to the gross Domestic Product and assessing the tax implications. For these purposes an assessment has to be made of the effect of future price changes on the amount ofmoney needed. Figures on this basis are referred to as &quot; at current prices &quot;, i.e., atthe prices current in each year in question.Pay increases7. The definition of &quot; constant prices &quot; used in this report means that no account is taken (even in the figures of additional programmes) of possibleincreases in wages or salaries, regardless of whether such increases are contemplatedmerely to keep the recipients&apos; incomes at the same relative level compared withother wage and salary-earners or to improve their relative position (in order, forexample, to promote recruitment). Although proposals for increases of the latterkind do not affect expenditure at constant prices, they involve an increasedproportion of the Gross Domestic Product being taken by the public sector and higher taxation.Imputed rent8. To be in accordance with national accounting definitions, the figures of current expenditure include, in some cases, an allowance for what is called&quot; imputed rent&quot; to measure the value of the use made of publicly-owned fixed capital assets in providing public services. These assets are treated as part of theresources available to the economy, whether or not they yield a monetary return,and the use of them is treated as part of expenditure on the national product just as much as the use of fixed assets for which a cash rent has to be paid.9. The methods of calculating imputed rent have this year been changed in three respects:(i) for hospitals, where nothing formerly was included, rateable values arenow used;(ii) for local authority education buildings, where formerly loan charges were used, rateable values are now. used; and(iii) for roads, where loan charges were formerly used, the attempt to measureimputed rent has been abandoned.
