IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Mem or andum by the Chancellor of the puchy of lancaster the Cabinet, at their meeting on 6th April (C. C. (65) 23rdConclusions, Minute 1), referred to the Home Affairs Committee forfurther consideration the question of the immunities and privileges tobe accorded to the senior officers of the Commonwealth Secretariat.The problem.      It has already been agreed that &quot;High Officers&apos;&apos; of the secretariat, i. e. the Secretary-General and his Deputy or Deputies,should have the full diplomatic range of h-ninunities and privileges.The question at issue is whether the remaining senior officers of theCommonwealth Secretariat should have the immunities and privilegesaccorded to members of diplomatic missions or those appropriate to senior officers of international organisations.    The senior officers inquestion are seven or eight Heads of Department of Counsellor orFirst Secretary rank.3.      The difference between diplomatic immunities and privileges and those accorded to international organisations (hi respect of whichthe protocol negotiated for the European Space Research Organisation(ESRO) is intended to form a model for the practice in this country)is as follows,    Diplomatic status implies personal immunity fromsuit and legal process for the diplomat and his family, inviolability ofhis private residence, continuing customs privileges and reimbursement of purchase-tax on British motor cars.    The ESRO scale confersimmunity from suit and legal process on officers (other than HighOfficers, who enjoy the diplomatic scale) in relation only to their official acts (and not on their families), and inviolability only inrelation to official papers and documents.    Official immunity does not extend to motor accidents or traffic offences.    Customs privileges are confined to the right to import furniture and personal effects on firstarrival and a refund of purchase tax on the first British car purchased.pi s a gr e em ent4.     Further discussion has not brought the Home Affairs Committeeto a solution of the problem.     There remains opposition to the grant of diplomatic status, but some members agree with the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations in thinking that the importance of puttingno obstacle in the way of the successful establishment of theCommonwealth Secretariat outweighs the objections.C.

Arguments against giving diplomatic status5,     Against the grant of diplomatic status it is argued:-(a) that diplomatic immunities and privileges have been evolvedspecifically for the protection of members of a diplomatic mission of one sovereign country in the territory of another.They can be justified on the ground that they are necessary if the mission is to be free to discharge its functions withouthindrance from the authorities of the country in which itserves;(b) that the Commonwealth Secretariat is not a diplomatic mission but an international organisation comparable to the specialised agencies of the United Nations and to bodies ouchas ESRO; and that international organisations of which thehost coxxntry is a member do not need for the discharge oftheir functions as high a degree of immunities and privilegesas diplomatic missions;(c) that to give senior staff of the Commonwealth Secretariata higher rate of immunities and privileges than the nature and functional needs of the organisation require will under-mine our policy of attempting to persuade other countries to limit immunities and privileges to those required for the efficient operation of the organisation in question;(d) that if we depart from this principle in favour of theCommonwealth Secretariat we shall be exposed to pressure which we shall not be able to resist from other Commonwealth,and a number of international bodies, including CommodityCouncils; ,(e) that there would consequently be a risk of a considerablylarger number of overseas officers and their families being placed in a position to commit offences with impunity and to inflict damage on British citisens who have no means ofredress;  and that this would be strongly criticised inParliament and by public opinion.Arguments in favour of giving diplomatic status6.     On the other hand, it is urged;-(a) that it is important that we should not be thought by the restof the Commonwealth to be reluctant to make a concessions which they insist is essential to the success of theCommonwealth Secretariat;(b) that there is reason to think that men of the high qualitynecessary to staff the Commonwealth Secretariat, whowould be qualified for senior posts on the staff of theircountry1 s High Commissioner in London, will be reluctant to a.accept posts on the Secretariat conferringa lower status and fewer tangible benefits;-2-COMFIDEMTSAL

(c) that as the senior organ of the Commonwealth, the secretariat will have a position in London which canrea.sona.bly be held to be unique; and(d) that, even if this proves over-optimistic, the successfullaunching of the Secretariat is of sufficient importance to outweigh both the possible embarrassment of creating a precedent for giving immunities and privileges not justified by functional need and the dislike of the public and parliament for a.ny increase in the number of personsenjoying immunities and privileges.Conclusions7.     No compromise has been put before the Home AffairsCommittee other than that submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations in C. (65) 55, i. e. that forrepresentational purposes (as distinct from personal consumption) the senior officers should be allowed reasonable quantities of duty-freeliquor and toba,cco under the control of the Secretary-General, andthat they  should be given a refund of petrol duty.    This compromisewas not accepted at the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion but if the Cabinetwish to look at it again the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations will be able to explain it more fully.    Otherwise the choiceappears to lie between conceding diplomatic immunitiea and privileges and adhering to the ESE.O scale, notwithstanding that the commonwealth countries have hitherto not found this scale acceptable.D.
