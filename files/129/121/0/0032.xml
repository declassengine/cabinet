(65) 82 Copy No.    599th June, 1965CABINETWORKMENS COMPENSATION-&quot; OLD CASES &quot;Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAt their meeting on 26th May, 1965, the Social services committee considered proposals by the Minister of Pensions and national Insurance to legislate this Session to improve the positionof people receiving Workmen&apos;s Compensation. The Committeewere unable to reach agreement on the proposals and thismemorandum summarises the proposals and the differing points ofview on them for consideration by the Cabinet.Ministers proposals. The Minister^ proposals in brief relate to men who wereinjured at work before 1948, who come under the old Workmen&apos;compensation Acts, and to whom the ordinary provisions of theindustrial injuries scheme do not apply. Their compensation underthese old Acts is generally at a much lower level than the benefits under the industrial injuries scheme, and since 1948 various specialsupplementary allowances have been created to improve their position. Nevertheless, a substantial number are still some waybehind&apos;the current standards of the industrial injuries scheme andthere are other deserving cases who get no supplementation. this last has been a source of much dissatisfaction and the Minister^predecessor under the last Administration did promise the TradesUnion Congress to look again into the practicability of wideningthe field in which the Industrial Injuries Fund could be used to supplement Workmen&apos;s Compensation. In accordance with thispromise he put in hand certain investigations with selected employers(of whom the National Coal Board was the most important) and,through the Trades Union Congress, with certain unions. these studies became known and because of them the miners&apos; group atthe time of the last general uprating Bill withheld their usualpressure, by way of a set of amendments seeking to achieve more for old cases. Since then, the miners&apos; group in particular have continued vigorously to press us to do something more in this field.The Minister has now worked out proposals which would absorb the earlier arrangements and bring in an additional category of men5789
receiving compensation which, by present standards, is inadequate.The cost would be rather more than  1 million a year to be met outof the Industrial Injuries Fund. A simple and short enablingenactment would be required which is unlikely to be contentiousand, if passed this Session, the scheme could come into operationabout the end of the year.The Minister^ view. Despite the difficulty in finding time this Session for additional legislation and the appointment of the ChancellorsCommittee of Ministers to review public expenditure, the Ministerof Pensions feels strongly that her proposals should go forward to legislation this Session, which will not be possible if they have to await the outcome of the expenditure review. In addition to thesocial and humanitarian merits of her proposals there are alsosubstantial political advantages in the introduction of legislationbefore the annual meeting of the National Union of Mineworkersand the Trades Union Congress on 5th July and 6th Septemberrespectively, and she feels that these advantages would be lost if legislation were deferred until next Session. In this she was supportedby the Ministers of spending departments on the Social services committee. Although the numbers affected by the proposals arenot very large (17,000) their case undoubtedly attracts widespreadsympathy among the unions and the Governmenfs supporters inthe House and there is a considerable expectation among the unions and Members concerned that very early action will be taken.Indeed, in the absence of such action it is the Ministers view thatcriticism at the National Union of Mineworkers and Trades UnionCongress Conferences must be expected. The Minister has pointedout the difficulty of arguing that the money cannot be found in face of the Government Actuary&apos;s Quinquennial Report on the industrial injuries Fund shortly to be published which will show a substantial increase in the balances of the Fund with further very large increases in future years. She has difficulty in accepting that her proposals are not analogous to the cost-of-living increases recently given touniversity students; or that there is any serious risk of repercussionselsewhere in the national insurance scheme.Treasury view4. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury considers, however,that no decision should be taken until the current review of projectsinvolving additional public expenditure is further advanced during june and July and the priorities worked out. The fact that any expenditure of this kind would fall to be met out of the industrial injuries Fund is really not relevant since from a budgetary point ofview there is no difference between this and other forms of public expenditure. The Chief Secretary points out that if a favourabledecision were reached in June or July, this should enable the Ministerto announce to the National Union of Mineworkers and the TradesUnion Congress Conferences the Governmenfs firm intention to legislate next Session. He considers that there is no analogy (as the
Minister has argued) between her proposal for additional expenditure and the recently agreed increases in maintenanceallowance for university students, which represent no more thancost-of-living increases and do not affect the forecasts of educationexpenditure at constant prices. He also suggests that the Ministersproposals would lead to increased pressure for other improvements in social benefits, for example, in relation to people with &quot; latent&quot;rights to workmen&apos;s compensation (i.e., those whose earning loss ascalculated under the Acts is not currently large enough to entitlethem to weekly payments of compensation) and perhaps even inrelation to the old people for whom Mr. Airey Neave has urgedaction.Matters for decision5.  The matters for decision are:(1) whether the Minister of Pensions&apos; proposals should beagreed in advance of the general review of additional expenditure; and(2) whether time can be found for legislation this Session.D.
