THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1965C. (65) 56 Copy No.   5 931st March, 1965CABINETREPRESENTATION OF THE VATICAN IN THE UNITEDKINGDOM AND OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AT THEVATICANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs there are two anomalies in our conduct of diplomatic relationswith the Vatican which I think it would now be opportune toremove.2. The first anomaly is that, although since 1928 Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have had a diplomatic representative with the rank of minister accredited to the Holy See in Rome, we have declined toaccept a Papal diplomatic representative in this country. the vatican have made it clear in the past that they would like toappoint one, but it has been felt here that certain sections ofProtestant opinion would object to a Papal envoy being received atthe Court of St. James&apos;s. The Pope&apos;s representative in this country,therefore, has the title of Apostolic Delegate only, i.e., he is thePapal Delegate to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Britain (and,incidentally, in Malta), but he has no diplomatic standing and no right to conduct business with Her Majesty&apos;s Government asrepresentative of the Vatican State. The Vatican is thus the only state with which our diplomatic relations are not upon a basis of reciprocity.I believe that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are alone in treating the vatican like this.- 3. A second anomaly, has developed since then, because in1964 our other remaining Legations (Bulgaria, Rumania, and hungary) were raised to Embassies. Since the closure of our Legationto the Yemen, our Minister to the Vatican has become the onlyHead of a British Diplomatic Mission who retains this title. Moreover,there are now only three other Legations at the Vatican, theremaining Missions all being Embassies. Thus our representative inthe Vatican is always one of the last in point of precedence which makes his position no easier.4. This situation is likely to attract attention in the immediatefuture because, for.a variety of reasons, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsrelations with the Vatican will be in the public eye more than usual:(i) The Prime Minister will be visiting Rome from 27th-29thApril as the guest of the Italian Government and will becalling on the Pope.5556
(ii) It has just been announced that Mr. Williams is being appointed as Her MajestyV Minister to the Holy See ini        succession to Sir Peter Scarlett and will take up his duties in May. I have already had one letter from an M.P.v : urging that Mr. Williams should be given the rank of Ambassador, and Sir Peter Scarlett has heard that the catholic Union, the leading organisation of. Catholiclaymen in this country, will soon be making representations to the same effect.(hi): We have been informed that Archbishop Cardinale, thei Apostolic Delegate in Britain and Malta, is about to be1 accepted as Papal Nuncio (i.e., Ambassador) in Malta byagreement with Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s Government. The,, contrast between Archbishop Cardinale&apos;s status in thiscountry and in Malta may provoke Press comment.5. The present would therefore be a suitable time to putrelations with the Vatican on a normal footing by raising our newMinister to the rank of Ambassador and by accepting a PapalAmbassador with the title of Nuncio or perhaps of Internuncio,which is, I believe, more normal in non-Catholic countries. We shouldnot be conferring any new or special recognition of the status of the pope as a temporal sovereign by receiving his Ambassador here.Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the Pope in this capacity in1928 when they appointed a representative to the Vatican. There is,moreover, no constitutional objection to receiving a Papalrepresentative here. The Attorney-General stated this view in a letter dated 11th April, 1957, to the Legal Adviser at the Foreign Office.6. There are arguments of substance in favour of improvingdiplomatic contact with the Vatican in this way. It might be helpful to the efforts which we make from time to time to aid Protestantminorities in Spain and other Catholic countries where they stillsuffer from certain disabilities. It might just possibly even be helpful to the general climate of our relations in Spain. The Vaticanalso has influence in many parts of Africa and Asia (e.g., SouthVietnam) and information about trends in these countries and in eastern Europe. A closer exchange on these matters could be of value to us.7. The argument against accepting a Vatican Ambassador isthat the move might be unpopular with certain sections of Protestantopinion in Britain. This is probably still true but the bulk ofnon-Catholic opinion is no longer predominantly or significantlyanti-Papal. Pope John and Pope Paul have both won respect in thiscountry by their efforts in the direction of Christian unity. Pope Paulhas also visited and been well received in a leading commonwealth country India. Some other predominantly Protestant european countries, the Federal German Republic, Holland and Switzerland,already exchange Ambassadors with the Papal Court and so do somenon-Christian countries, e.g., India and the United Arab Republic.8. There can be no doubt that the Pope would welcome an invitation to appoint a diplomatic representative here. It would,
however, be necessary to make it clear to him that there could beno question of according to the Papal representative the position ofDoyen ex officio of the Diplomatic Corps which is accorded toNuncios in Catholic countries and in certain others such as theFederal German Republic. The Papal representative in this country would have to take precedence among Ambassadors according tohis seniority.9. If my colleagues agree, I would propose to seek the approvalof The Queen to instructing our present Minister at the Vatican to approach the Holy See with the suggestion that diplomatic representatives with the rank of Ambassador should be exchanged.Perhaps we could do this in time for an announcement to be made before or during the Prime Ministers visit to Rome.M.
