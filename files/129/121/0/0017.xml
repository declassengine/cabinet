CONFIDENTIAL 1 2 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)C(65) 67 COPY NO. 94th May, 1965CABINETCOMPUTER PURCHASES BY THE government memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceMy Department is likely to be converting extensively to auto-matic data processing for the administration of the national insurancescheme, including payment of pensions and other benefits.    I have therefore had to consider the implications of the criteria suggested bythe Minister of Technology in his memorandum (C.(65) 66) on futurepurchases of computers.2.      In the development of some of our policies in the social securityfield we shall be relying heavily on very large computers, not simply to save money, but to enable us to implement our policies at all.    the speed with which we can implement them, once decisions have beenreached, will therefore depend on the speed with which we can instalthe necessary new computers.    I have in mind particularly our under-taking to equip ourselves to increase pensions much more quickly on future occasions and our undertaking to reform the present pensions scheme itself.    To have to delay the introduction of such schemes toany significant degree in order to give preference to the British com-puter industry would I am sure be quite unacceptable.3.       Nor can we tie ourselves exactly to a bare adequacy of Britishtendered equipment to meet our requirements.    We must have adequate reserves of capacity and assured performance in any equipment towhich we propose to commit the payment of pensions and other benefits.A breakdown of any such system due to inadequacy of equipment wouldbe a political catastrophe of the first order.    We cannot afford to takeequipment whose development has not been perfected,4. The Minister of Technology refers to the tenders received fo:the first of a series of computers to be installed in the Regions for thepayment of national insurance short term benefits. I have not yet reached conclusions on these tenders. But this too is a field in whichwe cannot take risks that the equipment offered will not come up to itspromised performance and in which delay would be expensive in termsof eventual savings forgone - these will be well in excess of  1 million a year.5.       I must urge therefore that if any criteria are established for decisions on future purchases of computers they should allowsufficient latitude for the meeting of special needs in particular cases.M. H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W, C. 2.3rd May, 1965
