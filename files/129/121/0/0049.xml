HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 99 COPY NO.       5 99th July, 1965CABINETPUBLIC SCHOOLS:   FINANCIAL. IMPLICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science understand that objections may he made to my paper C. (65) 88on grounds of cost.    I therefore add this brief note.TIMETABLE2,       The decision not to go ahead this spring will in effect put usback a year.    The timetable would now look something like this.November, 1965: Announce Commission and name ofChairmanEarly, 1966: Set up Commission1966-1968: Commission at work, includingpilot schemesEarly, 1968: Commassion reports;  it is by thentoo late to implement the Report inSeptember, 1968September, 1969: We begin to implement major integra-tion planThere could thus be no major cost to public funds until 1969-70.3.      (a)   Interim period, while Commission is sittingThe Commission itself might cost  55, 000 per annum;  pilotschemes might cost  135,000 in the first year and 335, 000 in the second.    I would find these trivial sums,if necessary, out of my Basic programme.(h)   1969/70: first real phase of integrationWe must make some commonsense assumptions as to what we may decide to do.    Let us assume that we start off by taking 50 per cent of the boarding entry in the Public,Schools as defined in my S, S. (65) 17.    (This does notnecessarily imply that the schools retain their present-1-

character - they could become boarding Sixth FormColleges or Junior Colleges cr anything else.)    The costin 1969/70 would then be o  the order of  2 million and in1970/71  4. 3 million (assuming free tuition and a parentalmeans test for boarding),(c)   The ultimate cost would depend upon our policy decisions.The maximum possible cost would be  23.6 million if weeventually took up all boarding places.    This assumesthe Governing Bodies would be content to look after thefabric etc. out of trust funds.    This all falls to be decidedthree years from now;  v/e could of course decide to do nothing.COMMENTS4,      I would add these general comments.(a) Once Cabinet agrees a policy in principle, and once the Treasuryhas allocated a global sum to a spending Minister, that Ministerpresumably has some freedom so to distribute his global sum as tocarry out that policy.(b) We are in danger of getting the public expenditure problem outof perspective.    Certainly we must be ruthless and stringent in thisimmediate period of economic difficulty.    But to sacrifice basicsocialist principles for a few million pciinds which cannot fall due for at least four years would suggest a certain lack of faith in our economic policies.(c) We are, after all, a rich country on a long-run view;  and taxationtakes an unusually low proportion of G. N/P. - 29 per cent as comparedwith Sweden and France (36 per cent), West Germany and Norway(35 per cent) and Netherlands (32 per cent).C. A. ft.
