SECRET ^ .50Wr DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 59 COPY NO.     5 96th April, 1965CABINETIRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of power at their meeting on 18th March, 1965, (C. C. (65) 17th Conclusions,Minute 3), the Cabinet approved in principle the proposals fornationalising the iron and steel industry worked out by the ministerial committee on Iron and Steel Nationalisation and asked me to circulate the draft of a White Paper describing these proposals and explaining thereasons for the exclusion of the British Iron and Steel Federation(B. I, S. F. ) and its trading companies from the projected legislation.2.     A draft White Paper is attached.    The key section is Part III,which sets out our case for nationalising the main part of the industry.I have sought to avoid any denigration or arguable criticism of theindustry and to concentrate on a positive presentation of our case.Paragraphs 10 to 14 set out the general case for nationalisation, supportedby specific examples.     Paragraph 15, which is necessarily morespeculative, is designed to show that common ownership of the main partof the industry should bring real gains in industrial efficiency.    This keysection is preceded in Part II by a section which shows the size and importance of the industry in the economy and that i% is not a normalprivate enterprise industry but has for over thirty years been necessarilysubject to a special, but still inadequate, measure of public supervision.Together, Parts II and EEI deal with the suggestion that we could achieveour objectives by strengthening the Iron and Steel Board.    On the otherhand, the draft does not discuss the suggestion that we should take ashareholding of only 51 per cent in the main steel companies.    I have considered including a paragraph on this, but I think that to do so wouldmake too much of this point and detract from the positive presentation of our proposals,3.     I invite the attention of my colleagues to the following specific points on the draft:-(a)    Productivity and Man-power (Paragraph 15(c))My colleagues should know that this may be a point ofconsiderable criticism and difficulty.    There are grounds for thinking that a proper use of man-power could lead.to a reduction of about a third in the industry&apos;s labour force of 315, 000 people.    The 3, LS. F, is arguing thatnationalisation will make it more difficult to deal with over-manning.    In fact, an important contribution towards a reduction in man-power may be to rationalisethe trade union and negotiating machinery of the industry.-1-

Nationalisation will provide an opportunity to do this, and I amconsidering with the Minister of Labour how we can best use it.    However, I think it would prejudice the difficult negotiations which will be necessary if we were to refertoo directly to this point at this stage.    The draft,therefore, rather glosses over this point; but I shallbe discussing the point with the Trades Union Congressbefore the White Paper is published, and I should like toconsider, in the light of their reactions, how we handleit in the subsequent debates.Compensation (Paragraph 24)This section is being dealt with separately but I proposethat the White Paper should set out the compensationterms in full.    To omit any reference to compensation would lay us open to the criticism that we were preventingproper discussion of the nationalisation proposals.    Tog v*e an incomplete account of the terms might lead to aspate of ill-informed Stock Exchange speculation for whichwe should be blamed.Safeguarding Provisions (Paragraphs 25 and 26 and Annex C)The nationalisation measure will contain provisions toguard against the dissipation of the property and assets of the companies to be nationalised in the period untilvesting day.    In most nationalisation measures these provisions have applied to transactions after the date of publication of the Bill.    The steel companies have,however, already learned much about our thinking andthey will learn more from the White Paper.    I therefore propose that the safeguarding provisions should apply totransactions after 4th November, 1964 - the date of theFirst Secretary of State&apos;s announcement of our intentionto nationalise the main part of the industry - except thatthose which make directors personally liable for lossessuffered by the Corporation should apply from the date of publication of the White Paper, which is the earliest date on which those concerned can be expected to know theircontent with certainty.    The draft makes it clear thatthis should not hamper the normal operations of the industryand that I am ready to discuss with the directors concernedany transactions of an unusual character.Compulsory Purchase of Land (Paragraph 29)The Ministerial Committee agreed that the corporation should have power to purchase compulsorily, with theMinister^ consent, land required for iron ore mining and that the Bill should be prepared on the assumptionthat this power should extend to land required for other purposes; but they asked that further consideration should be given to the latter point when the draft bill was submitted to Ministers.    I am drawing attention-2-

to this point now because I think we need to refer to it inthe White Paper to show that we are not overlooking thequestion of iron ore in the ground.    An extended power of compulsory purchase will undoubtedly be controversial and may give rise to difficulty with some local authorities.I think, however, that the Corporation, like most other nationalised industries (including the Iron and steel corporation of Great Britain in 1951), should have this power and the White Paper is drafted accordingly.Without this power, the Corporation1 s development programme could be hampered or they could be held toransom over small areas of land needed to complete a site for a major project or to expand an existing works.(e)    British Iron and Steel Federation (Paragraphs 43 to 45)I think this section meets the views expressed by theCabinet on 18th March that we should encourage theB. L S. F. to adopt a responsible attitude in its negotiationswith the National Steel Corporation but should leaveno doubt about the Government^ determination tosecure a satisfactory solution, if necessary by further legislation.The bill.     A submission has now been made to the Speaker on the questionwhether the Bill will be hybrid.    He has replied that he does not wishto be consulted before the Bill is published because, until then, he cannot hear both sides.    Parliamentary Counsel, and the Houseofficials (with whom he has been in constant consultation) are,however, confident that if, in due time, the Speaker is asked for, and gives, a   ruling, it will be that the Bill is not hybrid.    I should have preferred to obtain the Speaker1 s ruling before either the White paper or the Bill are published; but clearly no more can be done and we must now rely on advice which is the best available.conclusion.      I ask my colleagues to approve the draft White Paper.F. L.Ministry of Power, S. W. 1.5th April, 1965-3-

The Federation performs the normal functions of a trade association.    It also provides important central services for theindustry,  including,  through the British Iron and Steel CorporationLtd. and its subsidiaries,  the import of iron ore and certain other raw materialsoThe^jgole^j^b-.      The iron and steel industry occupies a focal and dominatingposition in the British economy.    First,  it is one of our largestindustries.    Its sales in 196k (over  1,000 million) were greaterthan those of the coal industry.    At the end of 1954 it employedover 315,000 people, more than the electricity supply or aircraft industries.    Its capital expenditure on major schemes (includingthe strip mill expansion programme) over the five years i960 toI96I4- averaged  130 million a year or 11 per cent of all investment in manufacturing industry.    Second, the iron and steel industryprovides &quot;basic materials for British industry.    Key industriesthat are eminent growth points in our economy, particularly amongthe engineering industries, which account for about two-fifths oftotal output of manufacturing industries, depend significantly on steel.    Third,  the iron and steel industry is of crucial importanceto the export drive.    In 196)4., manufactured goods containing steelaccounted for almost half our total exports.    A further five percent of total exports was accounted for by exports of iron andsteel as such.Public Supervision of theIndustry5.      It has &quot;been accepted for more than thirty years that thespecial characteristics of the iron and steel industry and its importance to the national economy demand a special measure ofpublic supervision.    From 1932 until 1939 this public supervisionwas exercised by the Import Duties Advisory Committee whichencouraged the establishment of the British&apos; Iron and steel federation in 193k and which from 1936, by a voluntary arrangement with the Federation,  supervised the prices fixed by the Federation&apos;sconstituent bodies.    On the outbreak of war in 1939?  direct controlof the industry was assumed by the Ministry of Supply which itselffixed maximum prices under statutory powers.    The Ministry ofSupply continued to fix maximum prices after the war;    but from september,  19u7 until March,  19^9!, more general supervision overthe industry,  including supervision of production, distribution,raw materials supplies and modernisation schemes was exercisedunder the Minister of Supply by a non-statutory Iron and steel board,  which also advised on prices.6.      The latter were, however,  interim arrangements,  superseded the action of the Government of 19U5/1951.    That government decided that the iron and steel industry had such characteristicsand involved such a concentration of economic power that it ought not to be left in private hands.    They considered too that theexistence of a large number of separately-owned undertakings, the boards of which were responsible to their own shareholders, made it &quot;difficult for the industry to achieve the necessary freedomof movement in reorganisation and to change the physicalcharacteristics of many of its undertakings1&apos;.(2)   Moreover,  the/ra ising(2)    The Lord President of the Council,  the Rt. Hon. herbert morrison, M.P,  (later Lord Morrison of Lambeth) - SecondReading Debate on Iron and Steel Bill - 17th November,  19U8,Hansard Col. 1+90.

SECRET   . &apos; 55raising of the very large -sums of capital which would be needed for the industry&apos;s expansion programme would he faciliated if theycould he raised under Treasury guarantee.    The Iron and Steel Act,19U9,  therefore provided for the vesting in the Iron and steel corporation of Great Britain of the shares and securities of allhut the smallest iron and steel companies,,    Vesting took place on15th February,  1951,7-      Despite a lack of co-operation from the British Iron andSteel Federation a start was made in the preparation of plans forthe reorganisation of the industry when the General Election ofOctober,  1951 resulted in the return of a new Government pledged to denationalise the industry.    On 13th November,  1951,  theMinister of Supply(3) gave the Corporation a general direction thatthey should not make any alteration in the financial structure ormanagement of any publicly-owned companies without the consent ofthe Minister.    This was followed by the Iron and Steel Act,  1953which provided for the transfer of the iron and steel undertakings and other property of the Corporation to the Iron and Steel holding and Realisation Agency, which was given the duty of returning themto private ownership.    By 1961 the return of the iron and steelindustry to private ownership had been largely completed except forRichard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd., which is still owned by the agency.i8.      The Iron and Steel Act,  1953 also established the present arrangements for the supervision of the industry by an Iron andSteel Board appointed by the Minister of Power.    The Board arerequired &quot;to exercise a general supervision over the iron andsteel industry ...... with a view to promoting the efficient,economic and adequate supply under competitive conditions of ironand steel products&quot;&apos;.    In particular,  they have to keep underreview production capacity, prices and the arrangements forprocuring and distributing raw materials and fuel,  for research,for the promotion of the safety, health and, welfare of employees and for joint consultation on matters of mutual interest to employers and employees other than terms and conditions ofemployment.    Their most important power is to determine maximum prices for iron and steel products.    The Board have used this power to set what they regard as reasonable delivered prices,which until recently the steel makers agreed that they would generally charge to their customers.    The Board also have power,subject to appeal to the Minister,  to control substantial projects for the provision of additional facilities for the production of iron and steel in Great Britain.    They have reserve powers (a) toarrange for the import or distribution of raw materials or theimport of steel products and (b) to make grants and loans for research relating to the iron and steel industry and for thetraining and education of persons employed in that industry.9o      The Minister&apos;s powers under the Iron and Steel Act,   1953are limited.    He can require the Board to determine a maximum price or to vary a determination;    he has a reserve power toprovide or arrange the provision of production facilities whichare required for the efficient, economic and adequate supply of iron and steel products and which the industry is unable or unwilling to provide;    he can acquire -production facilities whichit is proposed to close or he can arrange with other persons tokeep them in use;    and. he can direct the Board to exercise their power to arrange the import of steel products.    The only one of. /these(3)    Rt. Hon. Duncan Sandys,  M.P.

these powers which the Minister has in practice used is the powerto arrange for the provision of production facilities,  and thisonly to make loans to Colvilles Ltd. and Richard Thomas and baldwins Ltd. for the provision of additional strip mill capacity.III. The Reasons for Nationalisation10.    The Government are convinced that the reasons which led tothe passing of the Iron and Steel Act,  19U9 are still valid.    Theydo not believe that the system of private ownership in the mainpart of the steel industry, combined with the present form ofpublic supervision, or indeed any workable variation of suchsupervision,  can be reconciled with the national interest and withthe proper functioning of private enterprise itself.11.    In the Government&apos;s view, the steel industry has a dynamicand positive role to play in sustaining a satisfactory rate ofgeneral economic development and the balanced distribution of such development between regions.    The powers of the Iron and steel board under the Iron and Steel Act,  1953,  are essentially negative.They can, within limits, prevent action which is clearly contraryto the public interest:    they cannot insist on positive develop-ments which are in the interest of the nation but which,  forlegitimate commercial reasons,  individual companies may be unwilling to undertake.    Conflict between the requirements ofprivate enterprise, with its responsibilities to its shareholders,and the requirements of the public interest, have arisen in thepast and are,  in the nature of things,  likely to recur in thefuture so long as the industry is in private hands.    Thus,  therewere differences of vie?/ about the timing and location of theprovision in recent years of the new strip mill capacity in SouthWales and Scotland;    and a settlement of these problems was achieved only with Government intervention and the injection ofpublic funds on a large scale.    While adequate capacity has nowbeen created to cover requirements for some years ahead, newdecisions will have to be taken in that period.    It is,  in theGovernment&apos;s view, wrong to allow a situation to persist in whicheffective plans to meet these vital needs should continue to be dependant on the initiative of private interests;    and in whichstate control over the industry results in the granting of substantial and perhaps exclusive privileges to particularprivate concerns to develop.12.    The financial aspects of future expansion are also relevant.With the growth In the size and complexity of units,  massiveamounts of capital will be required to support the next majorexpansion programme.    For example, a. single new large integrated&quot;works may cost over  150 million.    Over the past ten to fifteen years several hundred million pounds of public money (includingloans from the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency aswell as the loans from the Minister of Power) have had to beprovided to secure development on an adequate scale.    The Govern-ment think that if the industry continues in private ownership,the need for further public assistance is likely to recur overthe years,  or,  alternatively, that prices will tend to be fixed at an unnecessarily high level.13.    The steel industry has historically shown a persistenttendency towards larger units and arrangements of a monopoly andcartel type.    This is not confined to this country.    The capital-intensive nature of the industry, and the effects upon it ofcyclical fluctuations in demand,  are well known.    Thus, theindustry in the United Kingdom entered into arrangements to/ensure:iij:::v7- k -

ensure that members generally observed, as actual selling prices the maximum prices fixed by the Iron and Steel Board, under theIron and Steel Act,  1953 and sought to defend this as justifiablebefore the Restrictive Practices Court0    One of these arrangementswas the subject of an enquiry by the Court which,  in its judgment of 22nd June,   196h,  found that it &quot;must be declared contrary tothe public interest&quot;,    Since then,  that agreement and others ofthe same type in the industry hove been abandoned,  although it is too early to say, especially in view of the current high level ofeconomic activity,  whether effective price competition will emergeor with what results.    The industry, however,  in view of the size of its units and the nature of its market,  like the steel industries in so many other countries, may well develop some formof arrangement about actual prices charged, for example,  throughprice leadership.    In the Government&apos;s view,  this basic industry with these monopoly characteristics should be in public and notin private hands.lh.    More generally,  the achievement of the nationalised industriesover the last 15-20 years is one of which the nation can be proud.They are some of the best managed industries in the country andthey are among the world leaders of technological progress in theirrespective spheres.    The Government believes that State ownership and direction of the iron and steel industry will have a similarlydynamic effect in that field.Objectives of New Arrangements15.   Against this background,,  it is not sufficient merely to try to remedy the manifest weaknesses inherent in the arrangementsintroduced in 1953.    In making the changes needed to deal with thefundamental problems discussed in paras. 10&apos;to 13?  furtheradvantages will be secured as follows:-(a) Investment and CapacityCommon ownership and central control will ensurepositive planning of the investment programmes of themain part of the industry as a whole, including suchmatters as the total new capacity to be provided,  the location of major new units of plant,  and. the timelywithdrawal of obsolescent plant,(b) PjlQ,duct.ion ^and.....MarketingCentral planning of production and marketing overthe main part of the industry will make it possible to concentrate production in the most advantageous fashionin the national interest and to eliminate uneconomicpractices such as unnecessary cross-hauls.    Thedevelopment of new management techniques,  includingthe central use of computers,  makes it possible to plan production and marketing centrally in some detail;and under common ownership,  full advantage can betaken of these techniques by using them to secure thebest pattern of production and marketing for the nationalised industry as a whole and not merely forthe individual companies.    This will improve theindustry&apos;s service to consumers generally.- 5 -

(c) Pr o clue t i vi ty , nd JJgJipjqwe rIntegrated, investment planning and the improvementof the &quot;pattern of production and marketing should in themselves increase labour productivity in the nationalised sector as a whole,    Efforts are alsoneeded to increase more rapidly productivity insideindividual units of the industry.   With public ownership,there will be new opportunities for increasing co-operation between management and the trade unions so asto improve the use of manpower and increase productivity,,and for applying rapidly throughout the nationalised industry improvements in techniques developed in one ofits units,(d) ExportsExpansion of exports of iron and steel as suchbecomes increasingly difficult as more countries develop their own steel industries.    The Iron and Steel Boardand the British Iron and Steel Federation foresee some reduction in such exports between 19 6h and 1970.    Theimprovement in competitive efficiency undernationalisation will assist the British steel industryto meet these difficulties.    Common ownership of themain units should further help the export drive by making possible a better organisation of exports, forexample by concentrating them on works best placed tomeet overseas requirements.    Even more important is the contribution which the efficiency of the nationalisedsteel industry will make to exports of the engineering and other steel-using industries,16.    In addition,  common ownership should make it possible toimprove the central services, particularly in the fields of rawmaterials and research, which the industry has already developedwithin the limits set by the existence of a large number of companies in separate ownership.    It will enable the finances ofthe main part of the industry to be dealt with as a whole, whichis an essential concomitant of the central planning of investment,production and marketing,17.    It is essential in the interests of the British economy as awhole that the improvement in the efficiency of the iron andsteel industry, which can be obtained from the com.rn.on ownership of its main units,  should be secured as quickly as possible.    Itis unlikely that common ownership could be brought about by private mergers.    In any event,  there would be obvious and very strong objections to private ownership of a unit of suchoverwhelming power and importance to the economy.    In theGovernment ,&apos;:s view, nationalisation of the main part of the ironand steel industry is the only appropriate means of securingquickly the benefits of common ownership.IV.

Ltd.Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd.Round Oak Steel Works Ltd.South Durham Steel and Iron Co. Ltd.The Steel Company of Wales Ltd.Stewarts and Lloyds Ltd.The United Steel Companies Ltd.19o    The Government are satisfied that the public ownership ofthese fourteen companies will secure the essential objectives of nationalisation:    and that nationalisation by the acquisition of shares, which means that the companies will be taken over intheir entirety as going concerns,  is the right course and willease the transfer to public ownership.20.    These fourteen companies own or control the 22 integratedworks (5) and 1+2 other iron and steel works.    They employ on theiriron and steel activities about 220,000 men and women - about70 per cent of the total manpower of the iron and steel industry.Details of their production and capacity are given in Annex A.They each have a. potential output of more than half a million tons of crude steel in 1965 and account for over 90 per cent ofthe production of iron ore, pig iron,  crude carbon steel, heavysteel products,  sheet and tin plate.    They occupy a strong position in the production of most of the other main steel products.    They control about 60 per cent of known reserves of iron ore in the United Kingdom,(p)21     Pour of the fourteen corrroanies - English Steel CorporationLtd.;    G.K..N. Steel Co. Ltd.;&quot;&apos; the Park Gate Iron and Steel Co.Ltd.  and Round Oak Steel Works Ltd.    - are subsidiaries ofVickers Ltd., Guest, Keen end Kettlefolds Ltd.;    and TubeInvestments Ltd.    The Government have given much thought towhether the national interest would best be served by retainingvertical integration between these companies and their parent/groups

SECRET- 8 -groups or by securing horizontal integration between them and themain part of the steel industry.    They have decided that thebalance of advantage lies with the nationalisation of the companies in these groups,  specified in paragraph 18.    These steel companies had an output of 3.h million tons of crude steel in the twelvemonths July,  1963 to June,  I96/4 and have a. potential output ofh.k million tons in 1955.    Their exclusion from nationalisationwould seriously prejudice the possibility of national planning ofproduction and marketing and would make it more difficult to rationalise the structure of the industry.    The Government will,however, expect the National Steel Corporation to conduct their affairs with due regard to the existing close links between the steel-producing units and. other units of Vickers, Guest, Keen andNettlefolds and Tube Investments;    and these concerns,  like otherconsumers of steel, can expect to benefit from the improvements in efficiency which should result from common ownership of themain part of the industry.22,    Two other companies - Dorman, Long &amp; Co. Ltd.  and theLancashire Steel Corporation Ltd. - are holding companies forgroups which have important interests outside the iron and steelfield, particularly in structural engineering, bridge building andwire manufacture.    The position of these groups is, however, quite different from that of the Vickers, Guest,  Keen and Nettlefoldsand Tube Investments groups because their main interests are clearly in iron and steel activities.    The Government think thatthere are substantial advantages in acquiring these two groups asa whole,  thus taking them over as going concerns and strengthening&apos;the nationalised steel industry&apos;s base for diversification (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below).Vesting Day23.    Vesting day will be the day after thirty-six weeks have passed from Royal Assent to the nationalisation measure, or an earlier day fixed by order of the Minister of Power.CompensationmSafeguarding Provisions25.    The nationalisation measure will contain provisions toguard against the dissipation of the property and assets of thecompanies to be nationalised and their subsidiary companies inthe period until vesting day.    Annex. C contains a summary ofthese provisions which will apply in some cases to transactionsentered into after  date of publication of White Paper/7 and in others to transactions entered into after hth November,  196U -the date of the announcement by the First Secretary of Statethat the Government intended to take into public ownership themain part of the iron and steel industry,

This is clearly required&quot;in the national interest and in the interest of the industry itself.    Althoughthe safeguarding provisions are necessary,  they should not hamperthe normal operations of the companies.    Actions taken in good faith, and in the normal course of business are unlikely to be challenged under these provisions;    and the Minister of Power is ready to discuss with the directors concerned any transactions ofan unusual character.QTiLg-Qisation of the Nationalised Industry27.    The National Steel Corporation, will consist of a chairman andfrom ten to sixteen other members appointed by the Minister of power.    The Corporation will initially be in the position of a holding company in relation to the nationalised companies.    However,as sole shareholder,  they will in practice be able to exercise all necessary central control over the organisation as well as thepolicy of the nationalised companies.    They will be able to securethe regrouping of assets among the existing companies or the replacement of the existing companies by a completely new companystructure or the  setting up of a unitary organisation under whichthe underlying assets would be directly owned by the Corporationwhich would wind up the companies and set up their ownadministrative substructure.28.    One of the main tasks of the Corporation will be to combinenecessary and. desirable centralisation of the main policy decisionswith the maintenance of vitality and a sense of respohsibillty inthe subordinate units.    This problem is common to all largeorganisations whether in the public or private sector of the economy.    In this connection,  special attention will have to begiven to the substructure of organisation below the Corporation.The Government think it would be wrong to lay down a rigidsubstructure in legislative provisions which would be inflexiblefor the future and which would have to be framed before theCorporation have had an opportunity to offer their advice on theappropriate organisation.    The nationalisation measure will,therefore, not contain a detailed scheme of organisation for the nationalised industry;    but it will require the Corporation toundertake an immediate review of the organisation for carrying onthe activities under their ultimate control and to submit a reportto the Minister within twelve months of vesting day (or a longer period allowed by the Minister).    The Corporation will also berequired to submit further reports whenever they think it necessary or the Minister asks them to do so..    The Minister will have thepower to give the Corporation specific directions on organisation;and he -will, of course,  be answerable to Parliament for the usehe makes of this power.Powers of the Nationalised Industry29.    While a company structure is retained, the powers of the nationalised companies will in general be those in their memorandaof association,,    The National Steel Corporation will be empowered(a) to hold the securities which, vest in them;    (b) to carry onany activities which the nationalised companies are or have been authorised to carry on by their memoranda of association and(c) to form or acquire by agreement other coinpani.es whetherengaged in iron and steel or other activities.    The corporation will also have power,  subject to the Minister&apos;s approval, topurchase compulsorily land required for their own purposes or those of the nationalised companies.

SECRET- 10 -30,    The nationalised steel industry will he able to diversifyits activities when this appears commercially advantageous.Diversification is a. common practice among private companies,including the steel companies,  and has advantages.    It enables an industrial organisation to adjust its activities to keep pace withchanging technologies and market conditions.    The Government thinkthat the efficiency of the national economy as a whole will be improved by giving the nationalised industries an opportunity todiversify like &quot;private companies.31.    The nationalised iron and steel industry will acquire a firmbasis of diversified experience on which to build through theacquisition of the wider interests of the Dorman Long andLancashire Steel groups and certain other companies, particularlyStewarts and Lloyds.    A major extension of its activities outsidethe iron and steel field will, however, not he solely a matter forthe commercial judgment of the Corporation.    It may raise issues of national policy.    Both the Corporation and the nationalisedcompanies will,  therefore, be required to obtain the consent ofthe Minister of Power before acquiring interests in companiesoutside the iron and steel field;    and the Corporation &quot;will berequired to obtain similar consent before themselves undertakingactivities outside that field.Duties of National Steel Corporation32.    The specific duties of the Corporation will be to:-(a) Promote the efficient and economic supply of iron andsteel products in such quantities and at such prices asmay seem to them best calculated to meet the reasonabledemands of consumers and to further the public interest.(b) Avoid,  and ensure that the nationalised companies avoid,undue preference or unfair discrimination betweencustomers but without prejudice to such variations inthe terms and conditions on which their iron and steel products are supplied as may arise/ from ordinary commercial considerations or from the public interest.(c) Promote the safety, health and welfare of their employeeand the employees of the nationalised companies, and setup machinery for negotiation and joint consultation.(d) Promote the export of iron and steel products and anyother products they or the nationalised companies-produce.(e) Promote research and development in iron and steelactivities and in any other activities which they or a nationalised company carries on.Finance33.    The Corporation will be statutorily responsible for the finances of the nationalised industry as a whole,  including theservice of debt to the Exchequer.    They will be required to ensurethat the Industry&apos;s revenues are not less than sufficient to meetoutgoings properly chargeable to revenue account,  taking one year with another,   and to establish and maintain a general reserve.The Minister of Power will be empowered to give the Corporationspecific directions about the disposal of surplus revenue and theestablishment and management of the general reserve.    It is theGovernment&apos;s intention to apply to the nationalised steel/industryr*    ---^ -:&apos;) ^ ir-i

SECRET ec-0 t- 11 -industry the principles end procedures set out in the White paper on Financial and Economic Obligations of Nationalised industries,(7)under which financial objectives are agreed with, the boardsconcerned,5h.    The nationalised iron and steel industry will be required to borrow on a long-term basis from the Minister alone.    It will beempowered to borrow on a temporary basis from the Minister or,with the consent of the Minister and the Treasury, from other persons,  and the.Treasury will be able to guarantee such borrowings.Total outstanding borrowings in addition to the industry&apos;scommencing capital debt for compensation and the public moneyalready invested in it will be limited to / 50ti/ million.    Thislimit should be sufficient to meet the industry&apos;s need for borrowingto finance capital expenditure already planned and to re-financecertain loans to the companies concerned from outside bodies,  andshould also allow a margin for any further plans over a period ofabout five years,    however,  it will be provided that the industrycannot borrow more than / 200/ million without a resolution of theHouse of Commons,35.    The Minister will be empowered to give the Corporationspecific directions about servicing the nationalised industry&apos;scommencing capital debt and any further sums advanced.    TheMinister will be required to send a yearly account of payments and receipts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will berequired to lay it before Parliament together with his own reporton it.36,    The Corporation will be required to keep proper accounts and each year to submit their audited accounts and those of the nationalised companies to the Minister, who will be required to lay them before Parliament.The Role of the minister er37.    In addition to the powers to give the Corporation specificdirections referred to in paragraphs 28,  33 and 35 above,  theMinister of Power will be able to give the Corporation directions of a general character on matters which appear to him to affectthe national interest and specific directions to discontinue orrestrict activities or dispose of production facilities,  otherthan iron and steel activities or production facilities in GreatBritain,    The Corporation will be required to obtain the Minister?approval for the general lines of their programmes of capital development and research and development,  to provide any information the Minister requires and to submit an annual reportto the Minister who must lay it before Parliament.Protection of^Cojisumers38.    The increased efficiency resulting from nationalisation ofthe main part of the  industry should benefit consumers of ironand steel through prices lower than might otherwise be necessary and improvements in the quality of products and services.    the nationalisation measure will impose no restriction on imports of iron and steel.    Consumers will be free to buy from the private sector any products it can provide.    The nationalisation measure will provide for the establishment of a Consumer Council and consumers will be further protected by the specific duties to be imposed on the Corporation described in paragraph 32 above.Although the nationalisation measure will not give the Ministerany specific powers on prices, he can be expected to be concerned/with(7)   Cmnd. 1337.

(8)    There will also be about 90 steelfounding and 1,200 iron-founding establishments outside the nationalised part ofthe iron and steel industry.hi. ZilETwith questions of price policy in the nationalised iron and steelindustry in the same way that the responsible Ministers in successive governments have been concerned with questions of price policy inthe other nationalised industries.The Private Sector of jthe^ Iron j^^,.SjLgj^^Xfi.4.ug.Jr.y39*    Although the main part of the industry will he nationalised,the private sector will still consist of about 210 companies(8)having an annual output valued at about  200 million and employingnearly 100,.000 people.    The Government attach much importance tothe private sector&apos;s having a healthy and efficient life of itsown and so making a full contribution to the national economy.The private sector will have a particularly important role inthose specialist finishing operations which lie on the borderlinebetween the steel and engineering industries but it will berepresented in most sections of the industry.    The government propose to abolish the controls now operated by the Iron andSteel Board.    In the interests of proper planning of the investment programmes of the Industry as a whole,  the Minister will retain areserve power to control substantial development projects by theprivate companies in the basic fields of iron and steel-makingalone.    The Minister will also be responsible for collecting and publishing statistics relating to the industry as a whole.U-0.    There will be a need for arrangements for appropriateconsultation and co-operation between the nationalised and private sectors.    The precise form of these arrangements will be a matter for consultation between the two sectors of the industry,  thetrade unions and the Government:    but the Government envisagethat there might he established, on a. non-statutory basis:-(a) An advisory committee including representatives of the twosectors of the industry,  the trade unions and GovernmentDepartments,  to provide for the participation of thewhole industry in national economic planning.(b) A joint forum between the nationalised and private sectors to discuss matters of a more commercial character which are inappropriate to the advisory committee.(c) An advisory council on research and development appointedby the Minister of Power and covering both the nationalised and private sectors.hi.    The nationalisation measure will specifically permit  joint action by the nationalised and private sectors in negotiationsabout terms and conditions of service and in the fields of safety,health and welfare.   The arrangements for the supervision oftraining in the whole industry by the Iron and Steel IndustryTraining Board,  appointed by the Minister of Labour under theIndustrial Training Act,  196b, will not be disturbed.The Iron and Steel Board and the Iron and Steel Holding andRealisation Agencyh2. When the new arrangements described in preceding paragraphshave been brought into operation,  there will be no functions for/the

the Iron and Steel Board and the Iron and Steel Holding andRealisation Agency to perform.    The nationalisation measure willprovide for the dissolution of the Board and the transfer of itsproperty, rights,  liabilities and obligations to the Corporation.(Provision will be made to ensure that records relating to thecompanies which remain in private ownership are not transferredto the Corporation).    The Agency will be dissolved by means of a treasury Order made under the Iron and Steel Act,  1953.The British Iron and Steel Federationh3.    The Government intend that the nationalised companies should withdraw as soon as possible and on equitable terms from theconstituent bodies of the British Iron and Steel Federation andthat the central trading services operated by the Federation shouldbe transferred to the Corporation.    The companies to be nationaliseare the predominant users of the central trading services but theCorporation would make them available on equal terms to the private companies if the latter wished.hix.    The Government think that the main consideration in makingthe new arrangements should be to ensure in the national interest that the central trading services continue without interruptionfor the benefit of both the nationalised and private sectors.    Thearrangements,  including contractual arrangements, on which these services are based are extremely complicated and the Government^present knowledge of them is necessarily somewhat incomplete.    TheGovernment,  therefore, propose that these matters should,  in thefirst instance, be left to negotiation between the Corporation andthe Federation,    They hope that the Federation will co-operate inthe national interest in reaching a settlement which, whilesafeguarding the legitimate interests of the private sector, willcorrespond with the realities of a situation in which the centralservices will be used almost entirely by the nationalised sector of the iron and steel industry.    If, however,  a satisfactory solution is not reached by negotiation within a reasonable time,Parliament will be asked to enact further legislation.h5.    When the nationalised companies have left the constituentbodies of the Federation and the central services have beentransferred to the Corporation,  it -will be for the iron and steel companies remaining in private ownership to decide whether toretain the Federation as their trade association or to make new arrangements.V -      C_on.clui-.ionu.6.    An efficient and dynamic steel industry,  fully co-ordinatedinto the Government&apos;s general economic plan,  is of paramount importance to the country.    The proposals in this White Paper are designed to enable the industry to realise its full potential inthe national interest.    But legislation is only a beginning.    Fullsuccess in achieving the objectives will require a major effortfrom all concerned.Ministry of Power,5th April,  1965.- 13 -

Summary of Proposed Compensation ProvisionsANNEX   CSummary of Proposed Safeguarding ProvisionsThe National Steel Corporation will be empowered to direct the disclaimer of any agreement or lease entered into- by a. companycoming into public ownership, where the Corporation consider thatthe agreement   or lease was unnecessary for the purpose of thecompany-:&apos;s ousiness or was entered into by the company withunreasonable lack of prudence, regard being had to the circum-stances at the time.      This power will be available in relationto any agreement or lease made or varied on or after the hthNovember, 19&amp;U and before vesting date.2o      The Bill will contain provisions about the payment of interest or dividends oy the 1U companies listed in paragraph 18 of theWhite Paper^n respect of periods between / date of publication of white Paper/ and the vesting date.      Defined limits will beapplied to the rate of any dividend or interest paid by any ofthese companies injursuance of a resolution of the directorspassed after the /date of puolication of White Paper/ in respectof the last complete financial year before that date or any subsequent period before the vesting date.&apos;      If such a resolutionhas authorised the payment of any dividend or interest,  in respectof that financial year or period, at a rate exceeding the maximum rate permitted oy the Bill,  the directors of the companyw ill bemade personally liable to the National Steel Corporation to repay the amount of interest or dividend paid out by the company inexcess of the permitted rate.The maximum rates of interest or dividend permitted by theBill for the above purposes will be formulated as follows (regard being had in either case to any previous payment of interest orinterim dividend for the same year or period)(l)    Interest on Loan CapitalThe permitted rate is that which is the minimum necessary to prevent the company from defaulting inrespect of its obligations.(2)    Dividends on Share CapitalDividend must be paid only out of the company&apos;s ne trevenue (as certified oy the company&apos;s auditors) for theyear or period to which the dividend relates or,  inaccordance with normal practice, from the company&apos;sANNEX    B

dividend equalisation account or other reserve maintained for the like purpose;  out that net revenue may,  in thecase of cumulative preference shares, be applied towardsmaking good the shareholders&apos; accumulated right toparticipate in the profits of previous years.      Subject tothe foregoing, the maximum permitted rates of dividend areas follows(i)    Ordinary SharesThe rate, calculated as an annual rate, paid(otherwise than as a capital dividend)  in respect ofthe last financial year injrespect of which a divi-dend was paid before the /date of publication of iWhitePaper/ on the same class of shares.*(ii)    Preference SharesThe minimum rate required to enable the company to pay,  in accordance with the constitution of thecompany and the rights attaching to the various classes of securities,  the permitted rate on theordinary shares (see (i) above).In the case of securities issued after the /date of public-ation of White Paper/ either at a price oelow market value or free,the Minister of Power will have power to direct that the maximumpermitted rate of interest or dividend on these securities is tooe less than that stated under heads (l) and (2) above, or that no payment of interest or dividend is to be permitted.Any payment, however described, by a company to its members in their capacity as members,  if made out of the net revenue ofthe company, will be treated as a payment of dividend for thepurposes of the foregoing provisions.,/References above to payments of interest or dividend, are tobe construed as references to the gross amount in question,   thatis to say,  the amount of the interest or dividend before deduction of tax.     Any payment expressed to be made free of tax will Toetreated as a net amount paid after deduction of tax and willrequire to be grossed up accordingly,  the limiting provisions ofthe Bill applying to the gross amount.3.      The Bill will contain provisions whose combined effect is tosecure that the principal assets as at the hth Novemoer, 196U ofthe Ik companies listed in paragraph 18 of the White Paper will fall into the ownership or ultimate control of the National steel corporation notwithstanding any intermediate assignment of suchassets to other companies or persons.For this purpose,  the Minister will oe given power to serve a notice on any company, not being one of the Ik companies,bringing it into public ownership either in addition to, or insuostitution for one or more of,  the Ik companies.      The circum-stances&apos;in which this power can be exercised are that:-In the case of any shares on which a final dividend has never been paid, the rate will be such as the Minister of Power mayapprove.

secret -3-(l)    the company in question for the time being owns oroperates any iron or steel works which on or at anytime after the hth November, 196k were owned or operated by one of the Ik companies or oy one of their subsidiaries,or(2)    the membership of the company was on the hth November,1964 such that,  if it had not subsequently changed, thecompany would have come into public ownership under theBill.If a company is brought into puoiic ownership under this procedure, the compensation and safeguarding provisions of theBill will apply, and be deemed always to have applied, to it inthe same way as they apply to the Ik companies:  in particular, thedate on which the securities of the company vest in pursuance of&apos;the Minister&apos;s notice will be treated as &quot;the vesting date&quot; inrelation to that company for ail purposes of these provisions.The corollary of the above-mentioned power is that of excluding one or more of the Ik companies from coming into public ownership,  if since the hth November,  I96U it has ceased to owner operate any iron or steel works, or to have any subsidiarywhich does so.      This power also will be conferred on the Ministerand will be exercisable by the service of a notice on the companyconcerned.ko      If at any time after the hth November, 196k and before the&apos;date on which it comes into public ownership, a company has enteredinto any transaction involving the assignment of a right of owner-ship or user in respect of works, a right to any invention ordesign, or a right to iron ore in the ground, the Corporation willoe enabled under the Bill to serve a &quot;notice of acquisition&quot; onthe current owner of the right concerned and compel its re-transfer to the Corporation or one of the puoiicly-owned companies.Similar provisions will apply to rights transferred by subsidiaries of companies which come into puoiic ownership.      Compensation inthe form of Government s took will ce paid in appropriate cases tothe person from whom the asset is recovered.5.      The Bill will contain provisions protecting the National steel corporation against losses due to transactions taking effect afterthe /date of publication of White Paper/ and resulting in thedissipation of a company&apos;s assets before it comes into publicownershipo      The transactions covered by these provisions are:reduction of share capital by abnormal payments to members;premature redemption of securities; payment to holders of securitiesout of the company&apos;s capital and assignment of the company&apos;s assetsto, or for a consideration payable to, holders of the company&apos;ssecurities.     Personal liability for any loss suffered by thecompany may fall on directors who have been party to any of theabove transactions and,  in certain circumstances, on the other parties to the transactions.6.     Provision will also be made enabling the National steel corporation to recover any losses sustained as a result of certain other transactions entered into by companies, which come into public ownership under the Bill after the /date of publication of white Papery7 and resulting in dissipation of their assets.      Suchtransactions include payments, or assignments of assets, withoutconsideration or for an inadequate consideration; and unduly onerousor imprudent contracts whose disadvantageous character substantiallyoutweighs any benefit accruing therefrom to the company.     Again,

personal liability to repay to the Corporation the amount of any loss occurring to the company from such transactions will attach to any persons who were parties thereto, including the directors of the companyo7-      Transactions such as are mentioned in paragraphs 1 to above will be exclud-ed from the effect of the safeguardingprovisions if they have been approved by the Minister of Potver(either before or after the Bill passes into law).      TheMinister&apos;s approval will normally be effective for this purposeeven though given subsequently to the transaction in question,,This, however, will not apply in the case of payments of interest or dividend above the :maximum permitted limits (see paragraph above): for such payments, the Minister&apos;s approval must be sought in advanceo8.      The Bill will contain provision for arbitration, on the linesadopted by the Iron and Steel Act, 19^9,  in cases of dispute asto the applicability of the safeguarding provisions to particular circumstances and,  in particular, as to the personal liaoility of directors and other persons on account of their participation intransactions to which the safeguarding provisions are found toapply.9.      The question which companies &quot;come into public ownership&quot;for the pxirposes of the safeguarding provisions will be determinedby reference to a definition,  to be comprised in the Bill, ofthe expression &quot;publicly-oimed company&quot;.     This expression willnot oe confined to the Ik companies whose securities vest in theNational Steel Corporation by virtue of the Bill,  out will include certain subsidiaries and associated companies.     Afternationalisation, a company will be &quot;publicly owned&quot; if it isone of a group of oodies corporate to which both of the following conditions apply:-(a)    every body corporate in the group is either the NationalSteel Corporation or a suosidiary of the Corporation,and(b)    every member of every company in the group is (by director nominee shareholding)  either the Corporation or another company in the group0Any company which becomes &quot;puoiicly owned&quot; within the meaning of the above definition will be treated as &quot;coming into public ownership&quot;.10.      &quot;Works&quot; will be defined so as to cover(l)    factories, mines, quarries or premises used for storage,^transport or distribution or the supply of electricityar other forms of power.(2)   machinery or equipment installed in, and land occupiedfor the purposes of,  such factories, mines,  quarriesor premises.5th April, 1965-k-
