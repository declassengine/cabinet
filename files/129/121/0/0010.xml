5C. (65) 60 COPY NO.   06th April, 1965CABINETMILITARY AID TO INDIA AND PAKISTANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the annexed memorandum sets out the background against which I ask the Cabinet to agree to certain military aid to India and pakistan.2.     Decisions on these matters are of the greatest political importance.    In 1962 the previous Government took immediate stepsto assist India in face of a Chinese attack and since then we have repeatedly, in the Nassau and Birch Grove communiques, in the Houseof Commons, and in the communique after Mr. Chavan&apos;s visit l3.stNovember, given an assurance that we would assist India to meet anyattack from China.    It is particularly important after the explosion ofthe Chinese atomic bomb that Indian public opinion should continue to feel assured that in the last resort she can count upon the West forassistance.    If we refuse to give further military aid at this stage thepolitical effect on India would be very great, not least because india has such high expectations of support from a Labour Government.3. The proposals which I now make are,,in my view, the minimum necessary to achieve our political objectives.    These are:-(a) to maintain close and friendly relations with India;(b) to continue to have an effective voice in India1 s defence plans and policies;(c) to ensure that, as far as we can, Indials resourcesagainst a possible Chinese attack should be effectivelydeployed;(d) to remain in partnership with the United States in pursuing these policies;(e) to set some limits to the increase of Soviet influence in the armed forces and as far as possible to ensurethat the Indian forces remain British equipped.4.      What we do for India will have important effects on ourrelations with Pakistan.    Unless we heed Pakistani susceptibilitiesand are prepared to help them with their problems, especially in thenaval field, we shall in trying to achieve our objectives in India find ourselves making an enemy of Pakistan.     Military aid to India and pakistan must therefore be regarded as one problem.-1-SECRETN;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

5.     What is proposed is a modest expenditure in relation to the vital political issues at stake.   We spend large sums to sustain our policies East of Suez,     If we lose India or Pakistan we should besuffering a political set-back which could not fail to affect our whole position East of Suez which we are at present maintaining at such cost.6.      The implementing of any decisions to give military aid to Indiaand Pakistan will need most careful handling in a rapidly changingsituation^    To announce military aid to India at this stage, whenPresident Ayub is about to visit Moscow, would be a tactical error.We have somehow to re-assure the Indians that we propose to help them without giving the Pakistanis an occasion for a further outburst against us.    Moreover, the Americans are still considering what line theyshould take with President Ayub during his visit to Washington from25th April.    We must clearly concert our tactics with the Americans.7.     We must have special care about presentation with our owncreditors in mind.    The proposals I have made about Hunters inparagraph 22 of the attached memorandum and about the other items in paragraph 23 are designed to help in this connection.8.     I recommend to my colleagues that we agree, as regards india(a) to offer to finance the construction of an Oberon submarine( 4&quot;! million) on ten-year credits.    It should be possibleto arrange with the Indians to delay publicity for some weeks;(b) to explain to the Indians that our offer to finance thesubmarine is made on the assumption that they do not intend to purchase submarines or frigates from Russia^(c) to explain our difficulties in releasing a Daring at thisstage, or of suggesting an economic and acceptablealternative arrangement for escorts; and to say that weare continuing to examine the situation in the light of our defence review;(d) to accept that India has a reasonable requirement forthirty refurbished Hunter fighters; to agree to provideas a. gift the four to be completed in 1965-66 at a costof  0. 5 million and to assure the Indians (as we did inthe case of the Leanders) that we will consider sympathetically the question of financing the balance indue course on ten-year credits.    This will amount to a commitment, but it will be unnecessary to give  anypublicity to this transaction this year.    It will benecessary to give some form of assurance to Hawkersthat they will get paid for all thirty.

9,     I also recommend that we agree, as regards Pakistan:(a) to offer to finance the construction of an Oberonsubmarine ( 4f million) on ten-year credits, leavingme discretion to settle the timing of negotiationswith the Pakistani sj(b) to make no offer at present to Pakistan on escort vessels;(c) to offer certain radar and electronic equipment to pakistan up to a total of   1 million, to be financedon ten-year credit.A. G. B.commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1.5th April, 1965

ANNEXMILITARY AID TO INDIA AND PAKISTANFollowing the Chinese attack on India in October 1962, theUnited Kingdom Government, for the first time, gave military aid( 19 million agreed at Nassau, and subsequently further aid in 1963amounting to   8 million and in 1964 to  5 million) to strengthenIndia&apos;s defences against China.    We have not committed ourselves toa long-term programme of military aid.    But we have agreed that theIndian five year defence plan, which has been reduced to take accountparticularly of United States criticisms, is reasonable in the light ofthe Chinese capacity to attack.2.      The Indian Armed Forces are still basically British equipped.India is receiving adequate assistance to cover purchases from theSoviet bloc and from the United States, but the financing of sterlingpurchases presents difficulties for India.    The Indians have, forinstance, asked for help in financing the purchase of up to forty Hunterfighters ( 4f million).    We must expect other requests.    In the field ofmilitary training and technical assistance we can for a small expendi-ture achieve important results.3.      The provision of thirty refurbished Hunter aircraft can bejustified, at a cost of a little over  3 million, to replace expectedattrition in the Indian Hunter squadrons over the next few years.Unless India places an order for them now, there is a danger that theywill soon be unobtainable, as the last secondhand Hunters coming on tothe market are disposed of.    Hunters are the backbone of the Indianfighter force.    If they are not maintained at their present strength,the Indian pressure for newer and faster !planes (e. g. F. 5s from the americans, MiG 21s from the Russians andlielp from us for theHF. 24 engine) will increase.    Only four of the thirty Hunters couldbe delivered in 1965-66.    In the public presentation of any help wegive to the Indians in acquiring these Hunters we must take account ofthe angry reaction from the Pakistanis which will be provoked, butthis reaction would be much stronger if more modern aircraft had tobe provided.4.     The Indian Navy presents a particular problem.    Expenditure on it cannot be justified by the threat from China, but the replacement ofits over-age ships has become urgent if its efficiency and morale is tobe maintained.     Partly to check Soviet influence in India and theIndian Ocean, and partly to maintain links between the British and indian Navies, we offered last year finance for the reconstruction ofthe Mazagon dockyard and the building of Leander frigates (at a totalcost of   13. 66 million of which  4. 7 million has been promised overthe next four years).5.      The Indians now want help to finance the building of a submarine( 41- million), necessary for effective anti-submarine training, andthe provision of escorts on loan or acceptable terms to bridge theperiod until the Leanders are ready.    They have already receivedattractive offers from the Soviet Union for these items, which theIndian Government will be under strong pressure to accept, unless we meet these Indian requests.-4-

6.     As for interim escorts, India has pressed us hard for Daring-class ships, but our own needs make it impossible for us to supply them.    An examination is being made of whether other escort vesselscan be made available after refit, but it is doubtful whether it is ajustifiable use of our resources to refit such ships, if indeed they canbe made available, at such a high cost for interim use for a short period.Arguments for Military Aid to India7.      The Chinese have a capacity to deliver a strong attack againstIndia   in the mountains.    It is of the greatest importance to the Westthat India   should be in a position to meet any Chinese attacks in thefrontier areas and to prevent them from escalating into a major war,8.      This is relevant to another major issue for us, i. e. that Indiamay wish to develop an atomic bomb.    To the extent that India is confident that the material aid she is receiving is adequate to enable her to meet any conventional Chinese attack, it is arguable that the pressure to build an atomic bomb may be reduced.    These two considerations have particular weight in respect of the proposedprovision of Hunter aircraft.9.      The Indian five-year defence plan postulates an expenditure of 30 million per year on purchases from sterling sources.    India canmeet this expenditure from military aid, use her foreign exchange resources to the detriment of her   economic development (which sheis bound in any case to do to some extent), change to United states or Soviet equipment or reduce her defence expenditure to the detriment of her preparedness to meet a Chinese attack; or anycombination of these.    We have both an economic and political stake in her economic development, her remaining basically Britishequipped and in her effective defence against China.10.     A judicious aid programme will weight the scales in favour ofBritish equipment for the Indian forces as a whole.    It might be inour economic interest to commit further resources to military aid toIndia and Pakistan to the extent proposed, as this should lead tocontinued orders to Britain from India&apos;s free foreign exchange of larger sums, which would otherwise begin to be diverted to other sources of supply.11.     British influence in India remains strong.    But India is now,after eighteen years of independence, less influenced in Britain*s favour by the ties of history, the legacy of administration or even bya common language.    We now have to deal with an India less over-laid by British influences.    We give about 5 per cent of India&apos;present economic aid, which is far less than the United States and rather less than the Soviet Union and West Germany are now giving.Our expressions of support for India will require to be translated into practical assistance if they are to be made effective; andmilitary aid has a particular political significance.-5-SECRETN

12.     The United States Government expects us to continue to be associated with them in giving military aid to India; indeed this is animportant element in our co-operation with the United States in Asia.In particular they have limited their aid to equipment for the Army andAir Force directly related to the Chinese threat from the North, andhave looked to us to prevent the Indian Navy turning to the Soviet Union,This is important if we are to maintain our influence on the nature ofUnited States defence aid to India.13.     The Soviet Government are giving substantial economic aid toIndia.    They are also assisting the Indian AirForce.    They have offered tanks to the Indian Army and ships (including three modernsubmarines) to the Indian Navy;  only a limited number of old lighttanks have yet been accepted.    The Indians see value politically in accepting Soviet military aid since it emphasises their policy ofnon-alignment and Soviet opposition to the Chinese.    While a small increase in Soviet aid may not be significant in itself, because of theadvantages of a single source of military equipment it might start aswing to dependence on Soviet sources of supply.14.     It is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage a united States naval presence in the Indian Ocean, and conversations with the United States about the establishment of joint supportfacilities on the Diego Garcia have made some progress.    The UnitedStates could justifiably claim this was scarcely consistent withapparent indifference on our part to the establishment of Soviet navalinfluence in the Indian Navy, with all that this might imply.Arguments for Military Aid to Pakistan15.     Pakistan has been our ally in CENTO and SEATO for ten years.She has received military aid from the United States but none from us.She sees aid to India as a danger to her neighbours and is convincedthat arms aid to India has been responsible for the refusal of the indians during the lsst two years to make any significant attempt tofind a basis for the solution of outstanding differences between the twocountries.    We offered Pakistan last July specified military equipment for the Pakistan Army and Air Force to attempt to mitigate Pakistanishostility to our policies and to try to improve our relations withPakistan, and we set aside  3 million for the purpose.    We have,however, been unable so far to engage the Pakistanis in staff talks on the subject and no commitments have yet been entered into.Meanwhile the Pakistanis have asked for help with their Navy, whichthey cannot get from the United States.    They face a navalreplacement problem even more acute than that of the Indians as it affects their entire escort fleet.    If we give further assistance to the indians the Pakistanis will expect comparable help.16.     The Pakistanis have made it clear that they are determined to acquire a modern submarine (irrespective of whether India, makessimilar purchases).    They are seeking help from other countries,including it is believed the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic,France and Japan, but they would be interested in building an Oberonsubmarine in this country if we could help with finance, totalling 4-fr million.    As regards escort vessels, previous negotiations for-6-SECRET

Battles failed because we could not offer them refitted at a lowenough price.    If we offer no escorts to India immediately we needmake no offer on escorts to Pakistan at this stage.     Pakistan also has an urgent requirement for radar and electronic equipment, whichis not available under United States aid programmes, and which wehave supplied to India on a considerable scale.    The cost of this equipment would be about  1 million.    The Oberon submarine and theradar and electronic equipment might be offered to Pakistan in replacement of the offer of equipment made to Pakistan last July.Timing17.     We undertook to Mr. Chavan, the Indian Minister of Defence,to reconsider our &quot;future proposals for military aid to India in thelight of our defence and financial reviews.    Decisions are nowurgently needed, in particular because the order for a submarinemust be placed soon, if delay in building is to be avoided, andHawkers are pressing for a decision on Hunters.Method of Financing18.     Until 1964, our military aid to India has taken the form ofgifts, but in 1964 the  4. 7 million provided by us for the Leanderfrigate project took the form of a Defence Credit for ten yea.rs a tour normal lending rate and with no grace period on repayments.It is proposed that the provision of the Oberon submarines to Indiaand Pakistan and the radar and electronic equipment to Pakistanshould be financed by Defence Credits on the same terms.    the expected phasing of disbursements from our existing commitments and from those now proposed is set out in the Appendix.19.     It is of course true that India&apos;s balance of payments prospectsand also those of Pakistan are such that they should not accept anymedium-term credits of this sort and all their creditors are currently under pressure to re-finance the servicing of loans givento them in the past for economic development.    We may similarlyhave to re-finance the Defence Credits proposed as they fall due for repayment.    Nevertheless there is advantage in using Defence Creditsin this field.    This should reduce the appetite of India   and Pakistanfor defence aid.    The United States Government are financing halftheir defence aid to India in this way.    There is value in maintaining the principle established in the case of the Leander frigate project and in fact we are a good deal less likely to be asked to re-financeDefence Credits than loans for   economic developme nt provided underthe auspices of the India Consortium.20.     What is proposed would impose little direct charge on our balance of payments.    Resources would, however, be employedwhich might be otherwise deployed to the advantage of our economy and perhaps in part on exports for which we would obtain cash andthere could thus be indirect effects on our balance of payments.On the other hand the shipbuilding and aircraft industries are likelyto be under less strain than others.-7-

21.     Yfe cannot cut down our economic aid to India and Pakistan tohelp balance defence aid to them without doing serious damage totheir economy, which needs all the balance of payments support it can get.    Indeed our economic aid to both is likely to have to beincreased in future years.22.     It is of course important to convince our own creditors that weare taking effective steps to correct our balance of payments,particularly at this time.     Public presentation is thus of great significance.    It might help in this connection if we avoid a public announcement about the Hunters.    We could do this by confining ourdefinite commitment to the four Hunters to be completed in 1965-66and by financing these at a cost of  0. 5 million from the balance of aid on a gift basis still remaining from previous defence aidprogrammes, which has been set aside to cover contingencies and possible increases of cost.    In that event it may prove necessaryperhaps next year to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to replacethis amount to enable any unexpected contingencies to be met from aidfunds.    It would also be necessary to give some assurance to the indians that we shall consider favourably the financing of the balanceof twenty-six Hunters in the next two financial years.23.     It should also be possible to avoid any publicity about theOberon submarines and the radar and electronic equipment forPakistan for some weeks.Liaison with America24.     The decision should be communicated to the United Statesbefore anything is said to the Indians or Pakistanis.    If the decision is against any further military aid commitments to either India orPakistan, it is important that the United States should be informed in case they may wish to reconsider their present position.    We areinformed that this is unlikely, but they should at least be given theopportunity.    Moreover, they have a right to know in advance, since there would be implications for their plans in the Indian Ocean.    Ifthe decision is to give some further aid to India, with or without any counter-balancing aid to Pakistan, presentation and timing would need to be considered in relation to President Ayub&apos;s visit to the UnitedStates in the last week of April.-8-SECRET\
