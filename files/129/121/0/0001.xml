THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C- ^ 51 Copy No.    5926th March, 1965CABINETEUROPEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe way things are developing in Europe demands our attention. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is backon the rails, but the European Economic Community (e.c.) is becoming a power unit of the kind that EFTA can never become.Our present attitude and policies are not enough to preventGeneral de Gaulle achieving his object of making this unit intoa closed shop.2.  If this happens, we face the following risks:(a) The United States will be forced to make deals with the six, by-passing Britain, as they now look like doing overthe Kennedy Round.(b) The Commonwealth will fix up their own arrangements with the Six, as Nigeria is now trying to do and as, if she succeeds, the East African territories will also try to do, in which case the e.c. will inherit our place ina large part of Africa. This is a process which couldspread to other areas.(c) EFTA countries will be under pressure to transfer to the eec as Austria already is.(d) The continuance of an integrated Atlantic policy in defence will become increasingly difficult.3. There can be no question of renewing our application tojoin the Common Market as things stand. But one day we may wish to, and it is very much to our interest that we should keepthe option open. To do so, we must not only follow the right policiesourselves but encourage those powerful elements in the Six which,for all their emotional attachment to the Common Market, mistrustGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s political and defence aims and want us in asa counterweight and guarantee.4. Most of the things we are doing are in the right direction;it is on the question of encouragement to our friends in the Six5543
that we need to do more. This is largely a question of presentation.We must:(a) Do more to present our policies as a coherent and positivewhole;(b) Give them as &quot; European&quot; a slant as we can, short ofsuggesting that membership of the e.c. is a real practicalissue.5. We should dwell as little as possible on what we cannot do and as much as possible on what we can do. It serves littlepurpose to reiterate our inability to join the Common Market now.We need not spell out the conditions which we should have wantedin 1963. It is suggested that possibly in public and at any rate inour discussions with European leaders, we should make it clear that,provided our essential (but unspecified) interests are safeguarded,we should ultimately want to join a wider European market withany other members of EFTA who also wanted to go in. We shouldmake it clear too that membership of the Commonwealth and our relationship with the United States are not incompatible withmembership of the right sort of Europe: they are complementarypolicies.6. By the same token, we should not give the political talksof the Six undue advertisement by emphasising our wish to take part in them. While we should discreetly support Dutch efforts to delay progress and to keep the door open for us, our public line should be simply that talks on the future of Europe among the six alone and without us make no sense. In particular, defence,especially nuclear defence, is an Atlantic matter.7. Against a general background on these lines, we should present our policies towards Europe (and such developments ofthem as may be devised) as a practical, constructive and consistentapproach towards the effective working unity of Europe within an atlantic framework. Some of the ingredients of such a policy are set out in the Annex to this paper.8. If the line set out above is agreed we must bring it home to our European allies by constant repetition in bilateral exchanges and in international organisations. Given the headway which general de Gaulle is making, this is the time to resume our rightfulplace on the European stage and set about helping Europe towards a better relationship with the United States within the atlantic alliance.M. S.Foreign Office,24th March, 1965.
AnnexELEMENTS OF A PROGRAMME LOOKING TO THEWORKING UNITY OF EUROPE(a) First and foremost, we should press forward with the atlantic Nuclear Force. Our purpose in proposing this was not tokill the Multilateral Force but to provide an answer to the real and continuing problem of the relationship of the European non-nuclearPowers to the Atlantic deterrent. The United States, Germany and Britain are the kernel of the Atlantic Alliance; we should of coursewelcome France if she would come in, which she is not at presentwilling to do. The first objective is to start multilateral talks, andthis should be our overriding task in Bonn.(b) In the defence field, there are other ways of enhancingEurope&apos;s place in the Atlantic Alliance. For example, a widerEuropean industrial base would help us to achieve a real divisionof labour within the alliance on arms production, and avoid thepresent waste of Western resources on competition. Similarly, moreunified logistic support for NATO conventional forces in Europemight provide forces equally effective militarily for less men and money. There may be room for British initiative on both these points.(c) We need not, at this stage, commit ourselves to institutionalintegration across the whole field of European activities. But wecan show our readiness to take part in specified forms of european co-operation, such as:(i) More effective political consultation in the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO), the Western european union (WEU), the Council of Europe and EFT A. Thiscalls for more frequent attendance by Ministers toexplain our present policies and consult about futuredecisions.(ii) Technical co-operation in the bilateral and multilateralfields, e.g., the Concord and European Conference onSatellite Communications.(iii) Further development of our bilateral activities includingthe Joint Economic Committees, Joint SteeringCommittees on Arms Development and Joint Staff Talks.id) We should build up EFTA, not as an end in itself but asa step towards the ultimate wider unity of Europe. We supportEFTA, not to divide Europe but to unite it.(e) Our ultimate vision of Europe should of course include theEastern European countries too. But we should not over-emphasisethis when it antagonises those Atlanticists in Europe on whosesupport we rely to defeat General de Gaulie&apos;s purposes. Ourrelations with Communist countries will always be sui generis.N
