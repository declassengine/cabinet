(65) 53 Copy No.   5 930th March, 1965CABINETTHE -OUTLINE P$LANMemorandum -by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic affairs it was originally our intention ;to publish an Outline Plan sometime m March a? ^background to the Budget and to give ,axi interimreport ,on -work on the main plan which would not be complete ,ymtilthe summer. A ^draft ,of ;a White Paper prepared fQT this purpose isattached. I have now come to the conclusion, however, that on balance it would be best not to publish such a document at this timefor the following reasons.2. Any White Paper published now while work on the plan isin mid-stream is bound to consist largely of a recital of policy decisions already announced, together with an outline of problemsnot yet fully resolved. First there is the balance of payments gapwhich seems likely to persist unless further measures.are taken. Anyfigures published now could prove embarrassing internationallyduring the next few months. Secondly there is the general problem ofthe heavy conflicting claims on resources. The need to put the balanceof payments right and to invest heavily in order to achieve faster growth will, even if we can keep within the 4  per cent limit on government expenditure, keep down the rate of increase of personal consumption in the next few years to quite a low level. It is clear,moreover, that within the 4  per cent limit on government expenditure we shall not be able to have programmes for social services which are in any way adequate for our needs (or satisfy our election commitments) unless defence expenditure is brought to thelevel of the 1964/65 estimates or below.3. With all these issues unresolved, I believe that we should do more harm than good by publishing a White Paper now. when a suitable opportunity arises to explain this decision in public, Iintend to say that, despite our original intention to publish some sort of interim report in the form of an &quot; Outline Plan &quot;, it provedunsatisfactory in practice to publish such a document while the keydecisions on the plan had yet to be made in the light of the
information now coming in. Most of the material available for publication can more appropriately be incorporated in a speech, e.g.,during the Budget debate, and in our regular monthly progress report.4. The first stage of work on the plan is now nearly complete.Trie results of the industrial inquiries covering most of private andpublic industry are now coming in, as are the expenditure proposalsup to 1969-70 which Government departments are submitting tothe Treasury and the Department of Economic Affairs.,5. During the next four months work on the plan will go through three further stages:(a) the information now coming in will be analysed and further discussions will be held with industries. This stage willlast until mid-May.(b) Policy decisions on the outstanding problems must be takenbetween mid-May and the end of June.(c) A document must be completed by the end of July for publication during the summer. This will not be easy:a good many of the difficulties affecting publication nowwill still be with us then.Throughout this process we shall have to consult the national economic Development Council and I am taking steps to try toimprove the security of the Council for this purpose.6. I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the proposal notto publish a White Paper on the Outline Plan at the present time.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,29th March, 1965.
THE PLAN FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 1964 TO 1970A PRELIMINARY OUTLINEi. The Government are drawing up, in consultation withthe National Economic Development Council, a national plan for economic development covering the period to 1970. The first resultsof the industrial inquiry are now coming in and detailed work on government expenditure and policy is in full train. The variousprojections and policy issues involved in all this work will be pulledtogether over the next few months to complete the plan in the summer. In the meantime the object of this paper is to describeits broad outlines.The national economic objective2. Clearly we shall only achieve the higher living standards we want if we make production grow faster. But we shall get neitherhigher living standards nor faster growth unless we correct our balance of payments deficit. The nation&apos;s Economic Objective must therefore be to secure the sustained expansion of our national output, coupled with the establishment of equilibrium in our balanceof payments. To attain these objectives we must work within the framework of a consistent plan. Otherwise decisions and actionsare in danger of being taken in a way unrelated to one another andto the achievement of our objective.The rate of growth3. How great an increase in output can we achivee between now and 1970? The answer largely depends on two things:(1) the increase in our labour force; and(2) the growth of output per man.4. As to the first, the increase in the labour force is likely tobe small, mainly because of the effects of the lower birth rate in the1950s. In addition more young people are staying on longer infull-time education, and women are getting married at an earlierage. On present trends the labour force would rise by only about  per cent a year between 1964 and 1970, compared with nearly  per cent a year over the last 15 years. This makes it particularly important to make fuller use of the available labour in parts of thecountry suffering from high unemployment.5. The main source of faster growth, however, must be a more rapid increase in output per man. This calls for better management and more rapid exploitation of technological advance by modernisingout-of-date plant and out-of-date methods of working throughoutthe economy.6. Output per man has recently been growing faster, and theannual rate of increase of output per man is now nearly 3 per cent.This is not good enough, but given a sustained effort and the right
measures, there is every indication that we can do better. TheGovernment have therefore decided that it would be reasonable to aim at an increase of 25 per cent in national output over the whole period 1964-70. If we are to achieve this increase, output per manwill have to rise on average by nearly 3^ per cent a year. This wouldmean that output in 1970 would be  8,000 million higher in to-day&apos;smoney values than in 1964.7. To reach this objective, action is required both by industryand by the Government. What is being done, and what needs tobe done, in each of the main fields of action is discussed below.The first aim must be to encourage fuller and more effective useof manpower in management, on the shop floor and throughoutthe country as a Whole.Regional policies8. We cannot hope to get the growth we need if we fail tomake full use of human and other resources in many areas whileallowing others to become over-stretched. Regional policies havebroader aims than industrial development alone: the balanced useof our economic resources is a prerequisite for securing rapid expansion. The Governments policies will therefore be directed toinfluencing industrial and social development so that further strain on resources in areas of labour shortage wil be avoided, and thefullest possible employment of manpower and other resources in less prosperous regions will be achieved. Regional economic planning Councils and Boards have been set up in Scotland, wales and each of the new economic planning regions of England exceptin the South-East. They will make detailed studies of the pattern of population growth, industrial and employment trends and the programmes for housing, transport and other social investment.These will be fed back to the centre so that national planning can take full account of regional considerations.9. A number of important decisions on regional policy havealready been taken. Measures to control office building in the LondonMetropolitan Region were announced in November. The Governmentare studying the possibility of encouraging future expansion of officeemployment in other parts of the country. The criteria for grantingIndustrial Development Certificates have been made stiffer; and afurther 29 advance factories are to be built in the development districts. In addition a comprehensive review of the scope of policies to influence the distribution of employment^ both private and public,is in hand; and the possibility of further decentralisation ofGovernment establishments is being examined. The growth of research and development work in those areas where it would contribute to more rapid growth will be particularly encouraged.10. An urgent review of the last Governments proposals for south-East England is in progress; but this has not been allowed tohold up the interim programme announced in February to meetLondon&apos;s existing pressing housing needs. In the North-WeSt a largenew town will be established in the Leyland-Chofley area to
contribute both to Manchester&apos;s housing needs and to the economic growth of the whole region. The last Governments programme forCentral Scotland is being reviewed to take more account of economicand industrial considerations, and legislation has been introduced toestablish a Highland Development Board with executive powers. TheNorthern Ireland Government have recently published a report onthe economic development of the area.Increasing the supply of trained manpower11. We are still short of skilled and trained men and women.The industrial inquiries now being undertaken are intended toprovide more precise knowledge of the actual and prospectiveshortages of particular types of labour and skill, and of the industries where there may be surpluses of manpower. Continuing information on this subject will be provided by the work of the Ministry ofLabour&apos;s Manpower Research Unit, by the Economic development committees and by the Committee on Manpower Resources for science and Technology.12. The responsibility for training or retraining work-people to fill these gaps will fall primarily on industry. The Industrial TrainingBoards will play a central role in this field. Five Boards have alreadybeen established and consultation is now in progress with a numberof industries for the establishment of further Boards with a minimum of delay. The improvement and expansion of skilled and trainedmanpower in the coming years depend largely on the effectiveness of the Boards, and the Government are determined that they should succeed. In addition the Government is working in close collaboration with trade unions and management to enlarge the facilities providedby Government Training Centres.Encouraging labour mobility13. We must introduce new technologies and changes in theindustrial structure if we are to achieve faster growth and higherliving standards; but if they are not properly handled, such changescan lead to serious hardship for many individuals, and fear of theconsequences of change can be a major obstacle to industrial advance.The Government therefore believe that policies to deal with the human problems involved have a key role to play in speeding upindustrial modernisation. To this end the Government intends to:(1) legislate to provide compensation for workers who becomeredundant;(2) introduce wage-related unemployment benefits;(3) improve transfer allowances for workers who have to moveaway from home;(4) ensure the wider transferability of occupational pension schemes.Improving efficiency14. In the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, prices and Incomes representatives of management and of the unions
undertook &quot; to encourage and lead a sustained attack on the obstacles to efficiency, whether on the part of management or workers andto strive for the adoption of more rigorous standards of performanceat all levels &quot;. The Government, management and unions are workingtogether to improve efficiency through the Economic development committees which have been set up so far in nine industries. Aswell as considering the contribution of their industries to the nationaldevelopment plan, their purpose is to identify and stimulate action required to remove specific obstacles to efficiency and expansion.15. Raising management standards is a crucial part of improving Britain&apos;s economic performance. We need a growinginterest in new management techniques, and measures are being takento expand management education and training. These include theestablishment of two graduate business schools at London and manchester, and encouragement for more and better managementcourses at universities and establishments for further education aswell as by individual industries and firms.16. There is still an urgent need for more technologicalawareness in top management. The new Ministry of Technology will undertake the task of speeding up the introduction of new technicaldevelopments into industry. Increased capital resources have beenmade available to the National Research and development corporation for supporting innovation in industry.Investment17. Better use of manpower must be matched by more productive investment. The need to modernise industry and achieve the structural changes in the economy necessary to correct thebalance of payments will create heavy demands for industrial investment. Manufacturing industry in particular will need to increase its total investment more rapidly than the growth of thenational product. Programmes for modernising energy production,communications and transport will mean heavy investment in the nationalised industries. Investment in housing and the fabric of thesocial and public services will also need to expand. The growth ofpublic services in the form of education and health cannot be met without a corresponding growth in the investmeent in these services.Priorities will have to be established between these various fields;but it seems to be reasonable at this stage to envisage total fixed investment rising by 35 to 40 per cent between 1964 and 1970. Thesefigures may well need revision in the final plan but it seems clearalready that there will be heavy demands on the construction industries and the engineering industries producing technologicallyadvanced and labour saving equipment.The balance of payments18. The sharp rise in imports and the slackening in the rateof growth of exports led to a marked deterioration in the balanceof payments in 1964 and a deficit on current account of  374 million.At the same time there was an exceptionally heavy outflow of
long-term capital bringing the total deficit on current and long-term capital account to  745 million. 1964 was a particularly bad year forthe balance of payments. The measures taken by the Government,together with an easing of some of the exceptional factors at worklast year are already leading to an improvement. The remainingdeficit must be eliminated quickly, and we must achieve the longer term structural improvement in the balance of payments needed tosecure steady economic growth, to repay debt and to give more economic aid.19. Every aspect of the balance of payments is being reviewedto this end. A major part of any improvement, however, must comefrom a better performance in international trade. The increase in imports needed to support a 25 per cent expansion of output willrequire a faster rise in the volume of exports than the 3 per centannual average of the last 10 years. The Government have taken action to improve export credit facilities; they have provided rebatesof indirect taxation to exporters worth  80 million a year; they areprepared to bear part of the cost of overseas market research andare contributing an increased amount to the financing of trade fairs.Consultations are being held with industry to explore all practicablefurther ways of increasing exports.20. The Economic Development Committees are examiningclosely the reasons for the rapid growth in imports of manufacturedgoods and every effort will be made with the co-operation of industryto identify and rectify weaknesses in our competitive positionwhether due to quality, design, marketing or lack of capacity.Improvements in these directions will both help our exports and enable us to meet competition from imports more effectively.21. But increases in exports and savings in imports will dependheavily not only on an improvement in our competitive positionthrough a faster growth of efficiency, but also on greater stability of prices and costs as a result of a successful prices and incomes policy.Prices and incomes22. Management and the unions have jointly pledgedthemselves to keep increases in money incomes in line with increases in real national output and to maintain a stable general price level.Machinery has been agreed for examining both the general movementof prices and incomes, and particular cases. It is particularly important to change the attitude of mind in which cost increases are too easily accepted and too readily passed on in the form of higher prices. The Prices Review Division of the National Board for prices and Incomes can review not only price increases, but also cases inwhich there is reason to expect that prices ought to have fallen but have not done so. The Incomes Division can review claims, settlementsor other questions. All these references will be made by theGovernment either on request or on their own initiative.23. The next stage, which should be completed very shortly, isto reach agreement on the considerations which should govern those responsible for determining prices and incomes and by which the
Board will be largely guided in examining individual cases. all parties to the agreement intend that the policy on prices and incomes should be effective. It is an agreed policy and, therefore, putsobligations on all concerned to make it work. Since it covers price as well as incomes, it puts pressure on both management and unions to avoid income increases that push up costs, and should have an increasingly important effect in improving our internationalcompetitive position.The use of resources24. The table below sets out the broad dimensions of the25 per cent growth plan so far as they can be assessed at this stage of its formulation.25. The first main claim on increased output is the need toimprove the balance of payments. The exact amount of resources which will have to be diverted to the balance of payments between1964 and 1970 will depend partly on changes in the long-term capital account and on the future movement of the terms of trade. taking all the relevant factors into account it seems prudent to allow for an extra  700 million at 1964 prices for the net improvement in thebalance of trade in goods and services and net investment income from abroad between 1964 and 1970.TABLETHE BROAD DIMENSIONS OF THE PLAN 1964 TO 1970  million at 1964 market prices	1964	Growth 1964-70 per cent	1970	Increase  m.

The 1970 figure is consistent with the Defence Budget at constant prices being limited to a total equal to the Estimates for 1964-65, Lei,  1,998 million.
26. Another major claim is for-increased investment, both public and private, which is discussed above. Then there are theclaims of public expenditure and personal consumption. final decisions on individual public expenditure programmes up to 1970will be reached in drawing up the plan, but meanwhile theGovernment have announced that central and local government expenditure must be related to the prospective increase in national production; on present judgment this means limiting the average increase from 1964-65 to J 969-70 to 44; per cent a year at constant prices, taking one year with another.*27. Defence expenditure puts a special burden on many of our most scarce resources and on the balance of payments: theGovernment are therefore conducting studies with the object of limiting defence expenditure by 1970 to around 1964 levels in real terms. This would leave room for a substantially faster rise than44-per cent a year in expenditure on other public services as a whole,many of which make an important contribution to our ability toremain an advanced industrial nation and to secure faster growth.28. This leaves personal consumption. On the provisionalassumptions made here, this would rise on average by about 3 percent a year from 1964 to 1970. There would, however, be a considerably faster expansion of communally provided services suchas education and health, which provide some of the most essentialelements in our standard of life, and where improvements in thequality of many of these services are urgently needed. In the initialyears of the plan, the necessity of securing a substantial improvementin the balance of payments and a high level of investment will keepdown the resources available for increasing personal consumption;in the later years of the period there should, however, be scope fora faster rise. Throughout the period we must expand savings. personal and Company savings have been increasing as a proportion of income and to the extent we can increase them further, the less taxationwill have to be used as a means of limiting consumption.Further work on the plan29. Further work on the plan will continue over the next fewmonths both within the Government and in discussion withindustries. The aim of planning is not merely to define objectives and to set quantitative guidelines for industry and Government, butto devise the policies and ensure that the action is taken needed to achieve those objectives. In the initial stages the need to collectand assemble a great deal of detailed and complex material in orderto shape it into an agreed plan has meant that much work has hadto be compressed into a shorter period than would otherwise bedesirable. It will continue to be necessary to work to a very tighttimetable this year in view of the need to produce a generally agreed* This limit applies to all central and local government expenditure including theoperations of the National Insurance Funds but excluding debt interest, i.e., it includescash payments such as pensions, as well as current and capital expenditure on goods and services as shown in the table.
plan of action as soon as possible; in future years, however, it ishoped that it will be possible to allow longer for the different stages of work on the plan.30. In a political and industrial democracy such as the UnitedKingdom the success of this new venture in planning will depend upon mutual understanding and effective co-operation betweenthe Government, management and unions, and the population ingeneral. The Government intend to continue the work of elaboratingthe plan in close consultation with management and unions throughthe National Economic Development Council, and to encouragejoint discussions of these problems and their solutions at every stage. Only in this way will the final plan command the support and agreement to action needed to achieve the desired goals.

FUTURE UNITED KINGDOM PARTICIPATION JJJ THB EUROPEAN launcher development ORGANISATION (ELDOTThe Committee had before them memoranda by the Minister of Aviation(MSO. 31/5) and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (MISC. 31 A) on thefuture level of United Kingdom participation in the European launcher development Organisation (ELDO)oTEE MINISTER OF AVIATION said that it was necessary to give instructions to officials for the ELDO Conference which was to bereconvened in Paris on 7th April.     The Conference held on 19th Januaryhad been inconclusive and contrary to expectation it had not been theUnited Kingdom delegation Vihioh was isolated, because of our doubts about future ELDO programmes leut the French, who had unexpectedly produced theproposal that the development of ELDO A should be abandoned and an immediatestart made on the development of ELDO B launchers.     This proposal, withalternatives, had been referred to a working group, -which had subsequentlyreported that the best foundation for the ELDO B programme would becompletion of the ELDO A and A/3 programmes, but that an alternativefoundation would be a compromise based on the original ELDO A programmeinvolving the development of a two-stage instead of a three-stage launcher.He agreed that there was no economic case for further participation in ELDO programmes.     But there was a strong political case for our continued participation, as the Organisation had had its origin in theUnited Kingdom proposals for alternative uses, for the BLUE STREAK rocket, and considerable ill feeling vrould be generated in Europe if we withdrew.The second argument against our withdrawal from ELDO at this stage was thatto do so would involve almost irrevocably abandoning space technology.There was no question of our mounting an effort competitive with theUnited States and the U.S0S.R0, but grave danger that we might allow theUnited States to have a monopoly in the West If we were to abandon the ELDOprogrammes.     Less important considerations vjere difficulty in maintaining the Vvbomera range if ELDO were withdrawn, and the possibility of industrialdislocation in certain areas of the United Kingdom (particularly atSpadeadam in Cumberland where  20 million had been invested).     Theestimate of our future commitment had been carefully drawn, and though it wassubstantial it was not over-large in relation to the nature of the programme.He therefore recommended that the United Kingdom delegation to the ELDOConference should be instructed to agree in principle to the developmentof an ELDQ B launcher on the basis that the best foundation for this wouldbe the completion of the ELDO A programme, and that we should meet our

share of the cost of work during 1965 whilst the details of such a programme were determined.   Alternatively, the delegation should agreeto the completion of the ELDO A programme as a two-stage launcherpreliminary to the development of an ELDO B launcher.     If the french were to insist on their proposals to move straight to the ELDO B programme,the United Kingdom delegation should reserve their position so that our continued participation in it might be reviewed*THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that it was common ground thatthere was no economic justification for the ELDO programmes.     Theadvantages of &quot;technological spin-off&quot; might better be realised by pursuit of projects of greater viability.     So far as our relations with Europewere concerned, it would be better to support fruitful projects (such asEuropean Space Research Srganisation (ESRO) and the Anglo -French striketrainer) than programmes such as ELDO which would probably lead to furtherembarrassments.     The estimate of a future annual United Kingdom commitment of  8 to  9 million was based on two unlikely hypotheses, that costs would not increase beyond the estimate, and that our future share of costs would be reduced to 25 per cent.     It was most important that the implications of the ELDO 33 programme be fully considered and it was noteworthy that theFrench proposals would also remove work from Weomera to their proposedequatorial launch site in French Guiana.     ELDO programmes were of no economic importance and should therefore enjoy a low priority in their claims on our resources;   we should take this opportunity to avoid any further commitment to ELDO programmes.In discussion the following points were made -(a)   It was doubtful whether there would be any appreciable benefit by wayof &quot;technological spin-off&quot; from further participation in the ELDOprogrammes, particularly as the technology of BLUE STREAK was welldeveloped,     There was hardly any scientific interest in ELDO programmes, and.there was no commitment on ESRO to use the ELDO launcher when it wasdeveloped.   Past experience suggested that present estimates would increase as had those for the ELDO A programmes (from  70 million to approximately 150 million) and it was probable that further participation in ELDOprogrammes would constitute a future commitment which it would be even moredifficult to terminate later.     We bad accepted dependence upon the UnitedStates for the launching of both military and civil communicationssatellites, and it was probable that in &quot;1971* when ELDO B might be capableof launching a communications satellite, that there would be littlepotential demand for it for communications purposes, as synchronous

satellites would already have been launched for the civil system and theAmerican Titon 30 would be a more efficient means of launching replacements.Nor was it a corollary of withdrawing from ELDO that we should abandon space technology.       The BLACK ARROW programmes and our co-operation with theFrench on DIAMANT would retain our interest in launchers, though of a smaller capability and there were other fields of space technology in whichwe could fruitfully engage,   The arguments for continuing to participate in ELDO were therefore primarily political,   and it was not clear thatour continued participation would yield any long-run political advantages.(b)   Against these considerations must be set the political odium whichwould be incurred if we withdrew from an organisation in which we had originally taken the lead, and the danger that doing so might cc interpreted as loss of confidence in Europe.     Australia attached great importance tocontinuance of the ELDO programmes at Woomera which were about a quarter ofthe current Woomera programme.     We were not yet entrenched in space technology, nor was it possible to forecast what the situation would be inten years1 time.     Whilst we might with impunity contract out cf programmes in technologies in which we were established, to do so in this case mightexclude us from a field of advanced technology and have an extremelyadverse effect on our own technologists.     Our current national programmes of spaae technology did not at present envisage the launching of acommunications satellite, and the consequences of relying on the UnitedStates for launches had not been fully considered, and might ultimatelyinvolve unacceptable costs and conditions.     The consequences of withdrawing from this co-operative European technological programme, whioh was avowedlyuneconomic, might have repercussions in other more fruitful fields.Although it was not possible to attribute absolute certainty to the ELDOestimates they included a. 1+0 per cent contingency allowance, and it was arguable that when the ELDO A programme was complete we could look for areduction in our contribution to 25 per cent.     The political objective in continuing our ELDO participation was to retain the goodwill not of theFrench (who might in any case welcome our incurring the blame for the collapse of the Organisation) but the other five European participants.(g)   It would be necessary to keep in close touch with the Australianson our future policy, having regard to the importance which they attachedto Woomera and the possibility that the ELDO B programme required anequatorial launching site.     But further consideration should be given (if we continued to participate) to the choice of a suitable launching site either in the North-West of the present Woomera range or elsewhere in Australiasufficiently close to the Equator,

(&amp;)   It was certain that the United Kingdom view would be sought earlyin the Conference, and it would be impossible for the delegation totemporise.     It would therefore be necessary to give them clear instructions on the nature of our future participation in ELDO.   There was, indeed,some demand from European members other than Prance for discussions priorto the Conference on the line to be taken then, and it would be useful if the Foreign Office could be authhorised to undertake these discussions.(e)   A major objection to our continued participation in the ELDOprogrammes was that   the ultimate commitment was not clearly defined.,Whatever the outcome of the Conference, every effort should be made to limit our contribution within a defined ceiling.Summing up the discussion, THE. PRIME MINISTER said that thearguments were finely balanced.     A majority of the Committee supported theproposals by the Minister of Aviation.     But the political, economic and technological issues and the level of expenditure involved were such as tomake it necessary to bring the matter before the Cabinet.The Committee -Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for futureUnited Kingdom participation in KLDO to be discussed %y theCabinet on Thursday, 1st April.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.29th March, 19^5-4-
