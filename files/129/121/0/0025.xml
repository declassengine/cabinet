(65) 75 Copy No.18th May, 1965CABINETTELEVISING PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMr. Iremonger, M.P., has given notice that he will move on28th May a Motion to &quot; call attention to the need to consider thedesirability of televising the proceedings of Parliament &quot;. His Motionis first order and it is necessary to consider what attitude theGovernment should adopt towards it. Proposals to televiseParliamentary proceedings raise a number of questions can it bedone, should it be done, and, if the answers to these questions areaffirmative, in what form should it be done, should programmes cover both Houses of Parliament and should facilities be provided for independent television as well as the British Broadcasting Corporation(B.B.C.)?Technical possibilities2. The B.B.C., who undertook a reconnaissance in 1960, believethat it is technically possible to televise the proceedings of the Houseof Commons. At present it would be necessary to install four cameras,one in the corner of the Official Box behind the Speakers chair, one in a corresponding position on the Opposition side, one behind theSerjeant-at-arms&apos; chair, and one at the back of the Strangers&apos; Gallery.It would also be necessary considerably to increase the strength of lighting in the Chamber. The B.B.C. have recently sent me amemorandum on the subject, however, in which they forecast that in12 to 18 months&apos; time they will have in use highly sensitive miniaturecameras which would be easy to conceal, could be operated by remotecontrol and would need only a slight reinforcement of the presentlighting.3. A full Parliamentary service enabling viewers to tune intoHouse of Commons proceedings at any time (as Aneurin Bevansuggested in 1959) could be provided only by using the fourthchannel, and must presumably be ruled out on this ground even ifthere were no others. But it would be possible to transmit ourdebates as part of the ordinary B.B.C. services on special occasions,or to transmit an edited review of the day&apos;s proceedings on theexisting services late at night.5720*\
4. It does not follow that any facility given to the B.B.C.would have to be given to independent television, but if it were thiswould presumably double the number of cameras in the Chamberand the amount of accommodation required elsewhere in the Palaceof Westminster, e.g., as interview rooms.Cost5. The capital cost of using the fourth channel wholly for a parliamentary service would be about  35 million. The transmission of an edited version of the proceedings within an existing programme was estimated in 1960 to cost about  250,000 in capital and 60,000 in annual expenditure. I have no information about theeffect on the cost of introducing the more sensitive camerasmentioned above.Is the televising of Parliamentary proceedings desirable in principle?6. In considering whether the televising of parliamentary proceedings is desirable, we need to examine its effect both on theproceedings themselves and On the relationship between parliament and the public. It is said that the introduction of live broadcastingof proceedings would tend to alter the character of our debates.Members would address set speeches to a national or a constituencyaudience instead of-following the course of the debate. There wouldbe unseemly jockeying for peak hours, and Members fortunateenough to catch the Speakers eye during those periods would speakat inordinate length. If this occurred the reputation of parliament with the public might well be damaged. Experience in othercountries suggests that there is some substance in these fears. Forexample, in 1959 the Bundestag of the Federal German Republicdiscontinued live television transmission of selected debates onprecisely these grounds, and similar effects have been observed inAustralia and New Zealand, where debates are transmitted live on sound radio.7. The advocates of televising proceedings urge, on the otherhand, that if the public could see the House of Commons in actionour activities would seem less remote, and that on major andcontroversial topics it is better that the public should be able to listen to the statements of policy made by the leading spokesmen ofthe parties in Parliament than to get them either secondhand ininterviews or studio discussions or through party political broadcasts.They suggest that most of the objections to live transmissions wouldbe avoided if an edited record were transmitted at the end of theday, since Members would not then be addressing a mass audience,would derive no advantage from speaking at peak hours, and wouldhave a better chance of inclusion in the summary if they could maketelling contributions briefly. Clearly the task of condensing a debateinto, say, an hour of recorded extracts would be difficult and the choice of extracts, might in itself give rise to considerable political controversy. The B.B.C. believe that they could do it fairly andpoint out that the technique is similar to that employed insummarising party conferences; but there might be a risk that what
would emerge most clearly would be the dramatic incident ratherthan the exchange of argument. An edited report would, however,make it possible to give some impression of Question time, sincethe commentator could interpolate the Question, and it would not be incompatible with an occasional showing of a major debate, such asthat on the Budget, live in the B.B.C.&apos;s ordinary programme.Should further consideration of the problem be undertaken?8. The B.B.C. have suggested that they should be permitted toexperiment with sound recordings, using the existing public addresssystem, as a means of demonstrating their ability to edit recordingssatisfactorily, and that they should subsequently experiment withtelevision so as to give Members an opportunity of considering whether the transmission of proceedings, either live or in an editedversion, might be expected to&apos;enhance the prestige of Parliament andthe public understanding of political affairs. If the B.B.C. were allowedto experiment the question would arise whether similar facilities should be given to independent television. Mr. Iremonger, or otherspeakers in the debate, may suggest that a Select Committee shouldbe appointed to go into the questions both of principle and offeasibility, at least in relation to edited programmes.9. Previous Administrations have taken the line that the matter was one for the House of Commons and that there was any generalwish among Members to have the proceedings televised. The PrimeMinister said on 10th November, 1964 (Hansard, Col. 828-829) &quot; I have the impression that in the previous Parliament therewas not anything like a majority of Members in favour of thetelevising of our proceedings.We now have many new Members and we should of coursemove in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. This question could be discussed through the usual channels and I know that,in addition, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the house would be glad to receive the views of individual hon. Members.So long as there is no indication that the majority of the Housewant our proceedings televised, I do not think there is any pointin conducting experiments.&quot;It may be said, however, that it is difficult for Members to form evena provisional opinion unless they can see what the possibilities, andparticularly the possibility of edited recordings, are. In this situationwe can either (a) adhere to the line taken hitherto, i.e., no action without a clear indication that the House wants it, but with the implication that if the Motion received strong support wewould do something about it;(b) undertake to consult the Speaker and the Lord Chancellorwith a view to the B.B.C. being given facilities to takesound recordings and to produce programmes of editedexcerpts, not. for transmission to the public but fordemonstration to Members, leaving ourselves free toconsider thereafter whether to allow the B.B.C. to go on
.   to an experiment with closed circuit television. We should at the same time make fuller enquiries than were made in. 1960 about relevant experience abroad;(c) agree to the appointment of a Select Committee which coulditself arrange for whatever experiments it thought necessary to enable it to reach conclusions.Conclusion -&apos;am10. I doubt myself whether there is any strong demand eitherinside or outside Parliament for a visual record, in whatever form,of our proceedings. I am inclined therefore to recommend that weadopt initially the approach at (a) above. If we found that asubstantial number of Members were in favour at least of exploringthe question further, then I think it would be appropriate to propose the appointment of a Select Committee.H. B.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,17 th May, 1965.S
