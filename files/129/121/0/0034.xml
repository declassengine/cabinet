THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1965C. (65) 84 Copy No. y   5 914th June, 1965CABINETSUNDAY OBSERVANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department the Report of the Departmental Committee on the Law on sunday Observance was published in December. It was debated inthe House of Commons on 15th February, and in the House of lords on 17th March. In both Houses speedy action on the Report was urged, and assurances were given that it would not be pigeon-holed.2. The recommendations made by the Committee fall under three general headings, relating respectively to entertainment andsport, trading and conditions of employment. The recommendations on Sunday trading, which are less radical than those relating toentertainment and sport, are being considered in conjunction with proposals to amend the law relating to week-day shop closing hours; and it will be appropriate to have a single Bill dealing with both week-day and Sunday trading and a separate Bill on Sundayentertainment and sport.3. This memorandum is concerned with entertainment andsport only. The recommendations of the Committee on this subjectare set out in the Appendix.4. The debate in the House of Commons was poorly attended,which may indicate, though this cannot be said with certainty, thatany proposals to relax the lav/ in this field would now meet with lesshostility than would have been the case only a few years ago. Mostspeakers said that they would welcome a moderate relaxation,provided that Sunday retained a special character as a day primarilydevoted to recreation and family pursuits. In the House of Lords theReport was welcomed by all speakers, including the representativesof the Church.5. In the debates, criticisms were directed mainly to recommendations 4, 6 and 7. In recommendations 4 and 7 theCommittee proposed that no theatres, cinemas, circuses or publicdance halls should be free to open, and no sports for people to watch should begin, before 12.30 p.m. on Sunday. The debates in both Houses showed that 12.30 p.m. is regarded as unduly early and that 2 p.m. would be more generally acceptable.5805
