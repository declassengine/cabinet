ANNEXTEE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ALLOCATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-The group of Ministers were set up to consider the conflictingclaims of the various public expenditure programmes and to make recommendations to the Cabinet.    This memorandum sets out the background for the group&apos;s discussions.2.     The Cabinet decided in January, and this has since been announced, that the planning of public sector expenditure shouldbe based on an average annual rate of increase of 44* per cent,per annum at constant prices from 1964-65 to 1969-70.    TheDepartments have prepared programmes accordingly, within limitslaid down by the Cabinet.    These have been collated arid examined by an interdepartmental committee, whose factual report is nowbeing circulated.3.     The task of this group is to fit these programmes into thetotal amount of money which is available for them.    In doing this,they must make a judgment on the priorities:    and their recommendations must be consistent with the Plan as it is now taking shape.Category A Programmes-Li-a-Li--4.     To make the task manageable, it is proposed to concentrate on the eight main programmes (Category A).    Those, together with defence, represent about 80 per cent, of total public sector expenditure (central and local government), and probably something approaching 95 per cent,  of that expenditure for which it is at&quot;present possible to have long-term programmes effectively underDepartments&apos; control.    The remainder (Category B) can be settledla,ter on.5.     Each of these eight programmes covers all public sector expenditure on its subject (central and local government, current and capital, and the gross out-goings of the National insurance funds) for the period to 1969-70, all at 1965 prices.    The groupneed to treat all public sector expenditure together, in order toget a complete statement of the claims of each programme.    Ifthey tried to work on the basis of central Government expenditurealone they could not handle such topics as education because muchof the expenditure on education is incurred by local authorities.Again,&apos; the group must deal with hospital current and capitalexpenditure together, for the building of new hospitals createsincreased requirements for current expenditure;    and so on.

SECRET ,       *i 9 pe) .4 0&quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Additional&quot;6.     The programmes are distinguished as &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;additional&quot;.The Cabinet laid down the limits of the &quot;basic&quot; programmes, whichwere broadly intended to represent the continued expansion impliedin existing policy.    The Ministers were left free to put forward&quot;additional&quot; programmes as they pleased;    they have been asked to circulate -papers to the group describing and justifying their&quot;additional&quot; programmes, and it will be necessary for the group to discuss each of them with the Minister concerned.7.     The programmes submitted are as follows;-  million at 1965 prices	1964-65 Programmes	Increase in basic progrnirimes to -    rQ69-70   ,                     fo		Basic total at 1969-70	Additional programmes requested by Depts, Total 1 969-70	Defence Budget	2,075			2,075*		Overseas Aid	181	48	26.5	229		106Roads	406	169	41 .6	575		30H ous i ng;    pub1i c capital expenditure	520	106	20.4	626		106Housing subsidies	153	59	38.6	212		63Police and prisons	230	41	17 .8	271		18Education	1 ,459	429	29.4	1 ,888		166Health and welfare	1 ?238	266	, 21 .5	1 ,504		88Benefits and assistance	2,120	740	34.9	2,860		185	8,382	1,858		10,240	762	^-Equivalent at 1965 prices to the target of  2,000 million at 1961]. prices.8.     The &quot;basic&quot; programmes show an increase of  1,858 million;and the &quot;additional&quot; a further  762 million.    It will be open tothe group, if they wish, to recommend a reduction in some &quot;basic&quot;programmes;    but the main task will probably be to recommend how much money shall be allocated to each &quot;additional&quot; &quot;programme.9.     The &quot;basic&quot; programmes show a major redistribution of public sector expenditure compared with the programmes which theGovernment found when they came into office.    Defence in 1969-70was then put at  2,400 million at 1964 prices, and the presentplanning decision reduces this hy  400 million;    the previoushousing programme has been increased (as a result of the february Cabinet decision to increase local authority approvalsin England and Wales to 150,000 houses in 1965) by about 50 million within the &quot;basic&quot; allowance;    the &quot;basic&quot; programmes for benefits and assistance include the large increases announcedlast November ( 325 million);    the health figures show theremoval of the prescription charges ( 25 million).    these changes already reflect a considerable reshaping.-2-

The Size of &quot;the &quot;Kitty&quot;10.   Firstly, how much can be allocated to the &quot;additional&quot;programmes?    The starting-point is the increase in total public sector expenditure (Category A and Category B) which would be permissible under the Government&apos;s undertaking to keep theincrease within Aa per cent, per annum at constant prices for&quot;1964-65 to 1969-70.   This permissible increase, excludingexpenditure in Northern Ireland and certain minor statisticaladjustments, is  2,435 million.11. Before the &quot;additional&quot; programmes, there arc the followingclaims upon this  2,435 million increases-Category A &quot;basic&quot;Category BC ontingency allowanc e2,185-2,235Available for Category A&quot;additional&quot; 200-250Permissible increase 2&quot;,435Category B in 1964-55 was  2,225 million.   This categorycontains a mixed bag of expenditures.    Some will, it ishoped, go down, e.g. the British Railways Board subsidy.Some will go up, c.g. science arid technology.    Somecannot be predicted at this stage,  e.g. the cost ofagricultural support, which depends upon theUnited Kingdom production and upon world prices.    TheTreasury and the Department of Economic Affairs advise that it is essential to allow for an increase of atleast  225 million (or 10 per cent.) in the Category Btotal by 1969-70.This must provide both for unforeseen events and forthe tendency, very definite in previous expendituresurveyss for the future level of costs to be under-estimated.    The White Paper on Public Expenditurepublished in December,  1963, included a contingencyallowance of  250 million.12.    Thus, the &quot;kitty&apos;-&apos; available for the &quot;additional&quot;Category A programmes is  200-250 million plus whatever can be gained by reducing the &quot;basic&quot; programmes.    As presented, the&quot;additional&quot; programm.es total  760 million;    and to fit theseinto  200-250 million is the measure of the task.Problems, of -Physical aoooareos&quot;13.    This operation is carried out in terms of expenditure (allat 1965 prices);, and it will have to be made consistent withthe assumptions in the Plan about the availability of physicalresources.  million,860   (paragraph 8)225(a)100-150^(a)(b)

14.    The first field in which this could be of importance isconstruction.    The position is being studied in detail.Preliminary conclusions are that, provided maximum use is madeof industrial building of houses,  the demand (including thatimplicit in the At per cent, increase in the public sector,i.e. with &quot;additional&quot; programmes not exceeding  200-250 million)could   probably be met, but only with some difficulty,particularly in the supply cf manpower.    This tightness is,however, -probably no worse than in other industries and is areflection of the general pressure on resources throughout theperi od.15.    Second is the problem of manpower.    The preliminary resultscf the Industrial Inquiry for the Plan suggest that the additional demand for manpower of ail types by 1970 will be 900,000, whilethe expected increase is only 400,000.    The requirements set outin these programmes for education, health and public administration are by themselves sufficient to absorb the wholeof the increase in supply.    This again is a measure of thegeneral pressure on resources.   Even more important, however,are the demands made by these services on educated manpower.16.    There are serious questions here of how far the substantialexpansions of public services envisaged in the &quot;basic&quot; programmes and even more in the &quot;additional&quot; ones can be regarded asrealistic in terms of manpower.    The demand in each programmemay be reasonable.    But when we take all the public servicestogether, many of them are competing with each other and with industry for the same kinds of workers;    and tho expansionprogrammes bid up the wages and salaries (and thus the cost)while failing to accomplish their purposes.    All this emphasises the need for maximum efficiency in the use of manpower in thepublic services.Problems of Timing17-   The group1s recommendations will be for the expenditurelevels in 1969-70, for the object is to make a framework for theDepartments&apos; forward planning.    The decisions to be taken andthe policy commitments to be announced in 1965 for thedevelopment of public services will not generally make their fullimpact upon expenditure until 1968 or 1969 or even later.They must be based on the best present judgment of what the economy will be able and willing to afford some years ahead;and the year 1969-70 is now taken for this purpose.18.   But expenditure planning is a continuous xjrocess.    Theexpenditure&apos; limits for 1969-70 to be decided by the Cabinet inJuly will be examined and adjusted again in a year&apos;s time, andlimits fixed for 1970-71;    and in two years&apos; time for 1971-72,and so on from year to year.   These annual adjustments and extensions will take into accounts-(i)    the developing prospects for the growth of the economy;(ii)    the expected needs of the private sector and thobalance of payments;(iii)   the changing pattern cf requirements for the publics or vie es:.

19.   The room for manoeuvre will never be great; at any one time.Once an expenditure policy has been announced it is difficult tomodify it, and its costs tend to grow.   Nevertheless, as national production grows, an increasing amount of resources will become available for the public sector;    and provided that defence can beheld steady, and the rates of expansion of the main public services can be kept under effective control, there should be more scope for constructive development in the future.20.   The greatest difficulty is the absence of room for manoeuvrein 1966 and 1967.   This is the period of critical significancefor putting the balance of payments right and for building upindustrial investment as the foundation for future faster growth.Public expenditure is now increasing fast, and the greater this increase the less is available for private investment, private consumption and the strengthening of the balance of payments.It will clearly be desirable to postpone expenditure as far aspossible from these earlier years to the later years of theperiod;    and in particular to consider very carefully the timingcf the &quot;additional&quot; programmes which are decided upon, in orderto reduce to a minimum the additional expenditure to be incurredbefore the end of 1967.C onelusion21.    If this analysis is accepted, the group should then proceedto allocate tho  200-250 million between the &quot;additional&quot;programmes, after making such adjustments to the basic programmes as may be appropriate, and with regard to the timingc 0113i derati ens above.22.    The Government have undertaken to publish a White Paper on public Expenditure later in the year, to fill out and perhaps in some respects to make more precise the material about thepublic sector which will be included, in the Plan.    It is too early to say precisely what will have to bo published;    butit will obviously bo necessary to demonstrate that theGovernment&apos;s plans are within the 4i per cent, for 1964-65 to1969-70;    and it will be necessary to show figures foreach cf these eight main programmes and defence.23.    The First Secretary is in agreement with this memorandum..l o j   0   0   oT rea sur y C hambe r s, S.W.121st June,  1965-5-

ANNEX Beducation pioca^iasMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science the Cabinet has agreed that in assessing priorities for future public expenditure, the greatest weight should be given to proposals that would assisteconomic growth.   Among such proposals education ranks high, for while it may bedifficult to establish an exact quantitative relationship the connection betweeneducation and economic growth is not in dispute..   As the Prime Minister said inBradford on the 11th June, &quot;the aim of equal opportunity in the nation&apos;s schools and establishments of higher education is not merely a question of philosophicalequality.   It is a matter of national survival for Britain that we fight for theeducation of every single one of her citisens.&quot;2.     During the period 1952-53 to 1962-3, the Gross National Product rose (at constant prices) at an average annual rate of about 2.8 per cent.   In the sameperiod, educational expenditure rose by 6.1 per cent., of which about 3-0 percent was due to increased demand (measured by the numbers of pupils and students) and about 3=0 per cent to improvement in the standard of the service.There was an increase of some 4-2 per cent per annum in the ratio of educationalexpenditure to G-.N.P.Jfm     The Basic programme for education for the five years 1964-65 to 1969-70shows a very different picture, assuming a 3i&quot; per cent growth in G.N.P.   The30 per cent &quot;Basic&quot; increase in educational expenditure gives an annual increaseof 5&quot;4 per cent.   But of this 3-3 per cent is accounted for by increased demand,leaving only 2 per cent for improvement in standards - a markedly slower rate ofimprovement than in the last ten years.   The ratio with G.N.P. would improve by only 108 per cent per annum.4-o     If educational expenditure rises by the 4-2 per cent involved in the Basicand Additional Programmes together, the ratio with G.N.P. would still rise by only 3*8 per cent per annum compared with the 4.2 per cent over the earlier tenyear peariod.   At the end of the period education would take only 5*9 per cent ofC-.N.P.j a proportion which looks like being at least equalled and probablyexceeded in other western countries *   This would not give any large improvements in standards since the whole situation is dominated by the increase in thenumber of children of school age.   In 1964, there were 7 million children inschool in England and Vales;   by 1974 there will be 9 million.Basic programme*     I turn now to the Basic Programme for England and Vales (the Scottishposition is dealt with in paragraphs 14 - 16 below).   The details are given inTable 26 and paragraphs 69 - 75 of the P.E.S.C. Report.    I must emphasise thatthe implementation of this programme and nothing more would mean a virtualstandstill in educational policy;    almost all the increase would be absorbed by additional numbers.

6.     The three most important elements are(a) the supply of teachers:   the programme assumes the provision of the110,000 places in colleges of education approved by the Government inJanuary.   But this will mean waiting until about 1978 before we canreduce class sizes to the maxima prescribed twenty years ago (i.e. 4-0for primary and 30 for secondary classes), and until 1983 before wecan carry out the pledge in our Election Manifesto to reduce classsizes to 30 and 30-   Moreover, in the primary schools, no significantimprovement will begin to show until about 1974-(b) School building:   the need for new school places is rising sharply -partly because of the continuing growth in the birth rate, partly as adirect result of new housing.   In addition we are committed to the raising of the school leaving age in 1971- and we have published our predecessors&apos; survey of school buildings showing that at present ratesit will take 30 - 40 years to eliminate substandard schools.   the basic Programme alone will not enable us to meet all these needs;    itwould thus mean a positive going back on current improvement policies and would not enable me to say that substandard schools would ever be eliminated.   The Government would in fact be faced with the odium of either refusing places to children entitled to them, or putting back the raising of the leaving age, or drastically curtailing even themeagre improvement programme for which we criticised, the previousAdministrat ion .(c) Higher Education:   the Basic Programme provides for the number of places recommended by Bobbins and accepted by us, but it means acomplete standstill on development otherwise.7.     My colleagues will realise therefore that the Basic Programme provides no opportunity for progress beyond existing policies and in the case of capitalexpenditure would not permit even that.Additional Programmes8.     The same three heads of teachers, building and higher education account forthe greater part of the additional programmes which I am requesting.   The presenttarget of 110,000 teacher training places would be brought forward to 1970;    thisacceleration would not only advance by about two years (i.e. to 197b) the date when we might expect an end to oversize classes as at present defined;    moreimportant, the schools would begin to feel the relief some three years earlier than under the basic programme.So     On school building I must reiterate that unless the full amount of theproposed capital investment is agreed, the first programmes to be announced bythis Government will achieve even less improvement than was done by our predecessors,    (indeed, further work since the figures were prepared suggeststhat to be sure of maintaining the improvement rate we need an extra  15 million in the additional programme).10.   In higher education it is now clear that the number of qualified studentswanting places will be higher than Bobbins forecast;   the additional programmeprovides almost all of them in colleges of further education where they arecheapest.   Without this additional provision we should have to sacrifice theRobbins principle (accepted by both us and the Conservatives) that all who wantand are qualified for higher education should be given their opportunity,   even with the additional programme university entry will become more and more competitive, for the only provision we propose here is some expansion of themedical schools and the first stage of a new Technological University in theNorth-East.   Unless we do this much we shall again be seen to be doing even lessthat our predecessors.

11 .   Turning to current expenditure it will be appreciated from what I havealready said, and from the Report itself, that the Basic Programme containsnothing for new developments.   It provides solely for the application ofexisting policies to an ever growing number of pupils and students..12.   But there are of course a number of most desirable developments that Ishould like to go ahead with.   Indeed, if I am unable to do so it will be an admission that we cannot do better than the previous Government.   From a verylarge field I have selected a number of matters on which we should make at anyrate some advance.   They are summarised in paragraph 83 of the Report andrepresent a modest programme of expansion for the coming five years.   But thereare, as my colleagues will realise, some notable omissions;    the expansion ofnursery education for which there is a growing demand and which is likely tofigure in the recommendations of the Plowden Council is not provided for;   nor is there anything additional for comprehensive school reorganization - nor forimmigrant children.13 e   The figures for Milk axidJfejaljs in table 2b of the Report reflect simplyincreased numbers and present policies.   But I have in hand investigations whichwill, I hope, enable us to make some reductions in Exchequer expenditure and soenable us to meet a little more easily the growing need for expenditure on education.Scotland12f.   Details of the size and composition of the basic programme for Scotland aregiven in table 2b and paragraphs 69 - 75 of the PESC Report.15*   On the school building side the Secretary of State for Scotland facesincreasing demands of much the same kind as those in England and Wales.   the investment proposed in the basic programme is essential to meet the needs arisingfrom growing and shifting population, to provide the additional accommodationrequired for raising the school leaving age and to continue a limited amount of replacement of the worst slum schools.   The additional programme (aQ+in. &amp; year) isintended to cover two very important items -(a) the provision of school places required consequent upon the furtherprojected increase in the rate of housebuilding;   and(b) - the provision of residential hostels for pupils vi-o can-..ot live athome following tho continued re--organisation of secondary schoolprovision in tho highlands end islands.16.   The additional programme also contains provision for places in Colleges ofEducation -which will be required to accommodate tho numbers expected to come forward and some residential provision for student teachors-in-training of whichthe Scottish Colleges are extremely short.DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE, W.1 .21st June, 1965-8-

sec re Ie) a dAMSX CHEALTH AND WELFAREMemorandum by tho Minister ofiHealthThis paper has been prepared in consultation with officials of thoScottish Office, and applies to Great Britain,20     The basic programmes (at 21,9 per cent) have been contained within thotarget figure of 22-g- per cent growth by 1969/7O even though provision hashad to be made in the period for the cost of abolishing prescription charges which, when the estimates were made, were thought would amount to about 34 million by the end of the period, or about 2% per cent.     This decisionto abolish charges was taken following a policy decision of the Party when in opposition and the fact that it comes out of the 22-g- per cent means thatour basic programme barely provides for the maintenance of the policies whichpreviously the Party criticised as totally inadequate.     The proportion ofour resources currently devoted both to capital and to running costs ofhealth service is, on the latest information available, lower than in anyother important country for which we have figures,-50     Hospitals - Current expenditure the basic programme covers growth at the rate of 2-2 per cent per annum in England and Wales and 3 per cent (3^ per cent in 1966/67) per annum inScotland,     The additional programme - details in the attached note - looksfor an increase in England and Wales to 3 per cent in 1966/67, rising to3&quot;f per cent by 1969/70*     Eor Scotland an extra \ per cent is sought for1967/68 onwards.The rate of growth under the basic programme is wholly inadequate,even for carrying out existing policies.     For 1966/67 it is already clearthat in England and Wales the net additional cost of running new capital projects will take about lip per cent out of the 2-g- per cent - 2-g- per centout of 3i Per oent in Scotland.     These costs must be a first charge on thedevelopment monies - the alternative of building hospitals end not usingthem is unthinkable - but there are other costs to be met also.     Morepressure is being put year by year on the diagnostic services, e0g. thelaboratory services, and staffing generally needs to be improved.    the hospitals need extra funds to meet the costs which inescapably arise fromadvances in medicine such as exfoliative cytology, renal dialysis (a life-saving measure), ;organ transplantation, and to provide for the new and-9-

costly drugs which nust be used first in the hospital services     Soirresistible is the pressure to improve medical services that hospitals have tended to devote insufficient money to maintaining buildings and replacingequipment, and there is still a backlog of many millions.     Moreover, themore inadequate our capital programme, the more we must spend (uneconomically).1on making do and mending.     A minimum addition of I4 per cent is needed forall these things in 1966/67, making a total of 3 per cent for the year, andthis must grow to 3i per cent by I969/7O, partly because of fee increasingcapital programme.     Similar considerations apply to the Scottish bid forI967/68 onwards.     This would cost  3 million in I966/67 and  17.2 million for Great Britain by I969/7O (including  1.2 million for Scotland).if.     Hospital - Capital expenditure the purpose of the hospital capital programme is to proceed as fast aspossible in replacing the greater part of the nation&apos;s hospitals.   Many are inobsolete buildings, about 4-5 per cent having been erected before 1891 and21 per cent before 1861.    These, and many others, are unsuitable in designfor hospital work to modern standards.In Cmnd. 1604 our predecessors assumed that  500 million would be spent in the ten years to 1970/71 and in its second revision this was raised to 750 million for the ten years to 1973/74.   This was intended only as a startin the programme of modernisation.   The programme specified, amongst other things, the start by 1970/71 of 90 new hospitals and the virtual reconstruction of 134. otbsr   hospitals.   It soon became apparent that the individual hospitalschemes had been imprecisely defined and costed and deferment of the programme on a considerable scale has been talcing place steadily.   When in opposition weseverely but realistically criticised the inadequacy of our predecessors&apos;programme.A further review of the programme is now being undertaken by hospital authorities in England and Wales to bring more realism into it.   But it isalready clear that the review will demonstrate with the resources at presentallocated that less work can be done than was envisaged by our predecessors.Once again the review will produce the appearance of further cuts.   Further-more, the population is growing faster than was estimated when Cmnd. 1604- was written with the result that we shall need 4-0,000 more beds by 1981 thanCmnd. 1604 planned for in   1975*   This means that further work to the value ofabout  300 million will need to be started by 1975/76 to provide for theincreased population, quite apart from the extra resources needed to providethe amount of modernisation that the country had originally been led to believemight be achieved by 1975*-10-SECRETN.

The basic programme is that agreed for planning purposes between raypredecessors and the Treasury.   It is entirely inadequate.   The additional programme of  5 million,  6 million,  8 million and  13 million, proposed for 1966/67, 1967/68, 1968/69 and 1969/70 respectively,- in no wayrepresents a judgement of all that needs to be done to modernise thehospital service.   It is not an attempt to add specific schemes to a programme which is making a reasonable contribution to the problem;   it is all I have felt I ought to ask for in the present economic situation.   Itis doubtful whether at present we are making any progress in overtaking thebacklog of work which needs to be done and there is undoubtedly waste in having to patch up old buildings which we know ought to be pulled down.   Theadditional programme would enable us to plan more sensibly, and made anoticeable impact on our work.   In particular, we need to start at 5 million in I966/67 if we are to keep the hospital Boards&apos; planningmachine, so laboriously built up, from running down.In Scotland, our predecessors&apos; original programme to 1970/71 was 70 million raised to  105 million for 1964/65 to 1973/74.   They acknowledgedthat this increase was insufficient to enable the programme originallylisted to be maintained:    and apart from specific major deferments andcancellations which they announced only the lengthening of the span of theprogramme without the addition of   schemes   has enabled the restrictedprogramme to remain in reasonable balance. &apos;This programme, when carried to completion, will make only a very limited contribution to the modernisation of the Scottish hospital servicereplacing only about one-sixth of the existing beds and leaving unfilledconspicuous gaps in geriatric and maternity services.The basic programme is a part of the  105 million programme with minor adjustments.The additional programme of  0.4 million,  0.5 million,  1.8 million and 2.8 million proposed for the next four years is designed, to enable a snailpart of the deficiency in geriatric and maternity beds to be made up and topermit a start tc be made to one of three district general hospitals whichwere deferred at the time of our predecessors1 last review of theirpro gramme.

For the rest thebasis programme provides for the continuation of steady progress of the dental service, for maintenance of the Supplementary Ophthalmic Service atpresent standards and for maintenance of the present general practitionerforce with very little in the way of development, apart from schemes already accepted by the Government to increase the use of ancillary helpers and promote improvements in practice premises.

The basic programme includes some provision for more ancillary -staff but otherwise makes no allowance for the increased rate of capital and operating expenditure (quite apart fr*on the net pay of the practitioners)which is necessary for a viable service.The forecasts are of necessity conjectural in the absence of detailedknowledge of needs and of the pace at which they will be met0     The provisionof purpose-designed modern buildings where ever they are needed could wellcost some  50 million or more in total.     But doctors will in most cases beraising the capital for this themselves with the help of the proposed newFinance Corporation^ .. In view of this and in the absence of any plan for a major programme of Government of local authority building, the forecastsallow only for a small part of the total (an additional  5 million a yearby 1969/70) to be met from public sources, such as might result from some increase in the volume of health centre and similar provision and the schemealready agreed for improvement grants.,The forecast also allows for an additional  3 million for running costs( 1 million for premises and equipment and  2 million for ancillary staff scheme to encourage doctors to employ more such staff and thus enablescarce medical nan-power to be more effectively used has already been agreed.The pace of this development also can only be conjectured?   an increase ofabout 50 per cent is covered by the basic programme and the additional 2 million would bring the number employed up to about one whole-timer perdoctor at an average rate of pay of  500 a year - not a costly way of reducing the calls on the time of expensively trained doctors in a period ofgreat shortage,

SECRET &quot;       32 7A corresponding provision will also be required for these services inScotland.Finally there is increasing pressure to pero.it repayment to servingelderly doctors of the compensation due to them for loss of the right to sell the goodwill of their practices.     The present rule that payment nay only he made on retirement or death, except in cases of hardship, has for years beenthe source of growing ill-will among the doctors and. repayment at age seventy,dropping in yearly stages to sixty-five (by 1971/72) would remove some of the sense of injustice which they feel and with which the Review Body recentlyexpressed sympathy.     The forecast covers repayment on this basis,DentistsSome small and intrinsically desirable consequential on improvements in doctors&apos; practice conditions will be difficult to avoid, e,g* selectiveencouragement to better practice premises and stimulation of the service inpoorly covered areas.Ophthalmic services the present National Health Service range of spectacle frames is out-moded and does not nearly match current demands (for every three people who take a National Health Service frame, five buy a private one).     It isproposed to include two or three new National Health Service franes of modern but established pattern.6*    Transport for disabledPowered transport is provided for certain disabled people with limitedwalking ability,     War pensioners in this category may choose between a smallmotor car or a single-seater invalid tricycle, National Health Servicepatients may receive only an invalid tricycle.     Pressure has been mounting-over the years for the National Health Service patient to be given the sanechoice as the war pensioner.     The increased cost of this concession mightbe about  4-0 million over the first eight years.7.     Hearing AidsThe National Health Service will be exposed to increasingly heavycriticism if it does not replace the present type of aid by head-worn aidsnow only available commercially and at high prices.     Head-worn aids,though not technically suitable for all patients, could be used by the greatmajority.     A-advantages are convenience and comfort and, for some people(e.g. children and workers of various types) the elimination of the cordwould be a major benefit.8.     Mgf^ie^JVaccina^ionTrials are nearing conclusion and the experts are expected to recommendvaccination of children against measles.     On the assumption that this policy would be adopted we would try to cover children below age seven before anexpected epid.emic in autumn 1966 and thereafter the annual births,,SECRET    &quot;13-

9 o     health education the Cohen Committee recommended in 1964- substantially increased expenditure as a means of preventing ill-health and thus reducing demands for health services,10o   Local Health and^ Welfare ,Seryjic-ej3-Local authorities in England and Wales have budgeted in their ten-yearplans for substantial and very necessary development of the comunity careservices, and the basic programme no more than reflects the steady growth ofrecent years, and can be generally seen as a fair measure of what is likely tobe physically and financially practicable for authorities.Some additional special developments are, however, both likely and necessary,.     Powers to provide general welfare services for the elderly are essential, and this may lead to a further expansion of domiciliary services.It is socially better, and should be cheaper, to keep old people in their ownhones as long as possible than to provide more hospital beds in geriatricwardso     Some increase in hone help services through moderation of charges for it is also urgently needed,     Family planning is another service for which public pressure is very properly increasing,,     The additional cost of these(and other possible developments in policy) is uncertain but should notexceed the estimates shown.Though there is no ten-year plan as such in Scotland, there is broadly the same need for development and expansion of services, especially in the mental health field.11.   GeneralThe additional programmes mentioned above would cost about  24o9 million in 1966/67 and  58o4 million in 1969/70.     They do not include provision forthe abolition of charges for the dental and ophthalmic services on whichthere is an election pledge.     The main arguments for abolition, which might cost  26.6 million ( 29.9 million if the range of spectacle frames were increased), Involve political considerations rather than health matters and,in my view, if we proceed with these neasures the cost should not be i-eckonedagainst the health and welfare share of the funds available for additionalprogrammes.     The &apos;healthl developments totalling  5804 million and the costof abolishing charges at  29o9 million make up the grand total of  8803 million,,for Great Britain which appears in the P.E.S.C, Report.ICR.Ministry of Health, S.E.1.18th June, 1965

ANNEX DPROGKAIME FOR BENEFITS AND ASSISTANCE (INCLUDING FAMILY ALLOWANCES)Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance the Social Security section of our Manifesto began with the pledge thats&quot;Existing National Insurance benefits will be raised and thereafter linked to average earnings so that as earningsrise so too will benefits.&quot;My basic programme reflects this by providing for the rates of insurance benefit;, war pensions and national assistance which weintroduced this year to go up year by year in line with the assumedrise in real earnings per head.   The precise timing and amounts ofparticular increases we cannot expect to be able to decide long inadvance5 but we could hardly contemplate making an assumption which left the standard rate of pension ana other benefits as a lower (or at any rate a significantly lower) proportion of average earnings in1969-70 than they are today, particularly as in recent years they havebeen rising faster than earnings.    The only other item in my basic programme is wage-related unemployment benefit and this I discuss later on.2.     In my additional programme. Income, Guarantee predominates.    Inour Manifesto this was the only social security project which weexplicitly excepted from, the proviso that the speed at which betterbenefits could be introduced must depend upon the rate at which the economy advanced.   Beth as a Party and as a Government, we are committed to the hilt to the early introduction of an Income Guarantee scheme.It is only the prospect of this which has enabled us to resist themoves by Mr. Airey Neave, H.P., and others to provide pensions outof the National Insurance Fund for old people who have not qualifiedby their contributions.   But, quite apart from our pledges, this isnot a matter which any of us would wish to defer longer than the needsof administrative preparation dictate.   For we have to rely on income guarantee to help those old people who, for whatever reason - perhapsfalse pride - are trying to struggle on with an income appreciablybelow national assistance standards.3.   I am hurrying on the planning of the Income Guarantee in discussion with my colleagues on the Social Services Committee. I hope to have everything ready for a start by the autumn of 1966.   But,until I begin to get information at the end of July free, my enquiry into the circumstances of retirement pensioners, I shall not be ableto make a reliable estimate of cost.   On my present information ascheme set a few shillings a week above national assistance levelswould cost the Exchequer something like  100 million a year net;taking Into account the consequent savings from the national assistance expenditure provided for in my basic programme.-1 6-

341&apos;:i I4.     However good our progress in the preparation of plans forcompletely recasting the long-term benefits of the national insurancescheme, we cannot expect that there will be much impact on expenditure by 1969-70, the end of the period with which we areimmediately concerned.   But, in the meantime, strong pressures arelikely to develop for making some further improvement in theprovision for widowhood, particularly as, despite what was said inthe Manifesto, widows below pension age will not, initially at anyrate, be brought within the scope of Income Guarantee.    I have suggested 20 million a year as the possible cost of an interim reform ofwidow&apos;s benefits.   This dees not reflect specific proposals, but itwould, for example, cost about  10 million a. year to reduce the qualifying age for widow&apos;s pension from 50 to 45 and roughly thesame amount would be involved in providing a temporary benefitrelated to the late husband&apos;s earnings for the first six months ofwidowhood, which the previous administration proposed in conjunctionwith wage-related unemployment and sickness benefit.5.     I now come to wage-related unemployment and sickness benefit.The first of these was assigned to my basic programme primarily oneconomic grounds.    On social grounds the two go together.   This isnot only because the needs of the sick are at least as urgent as thoseof the unemployed but also because the introduction of wage-related unemployment benefit in isolation would throw us back to the pre-1948situation in which men unfit to do so held themselves out as availablefor employment so as to secure the higher rate of benefit.   on political grounds also it would be tnrd to justify exclusion of the sick, especially as the previous administration undertook to bring them in along with the unemployed, and the T.U.C. have always beensternly ojrposed to the introduction of wage-related unemploymentbenefit without wage-related sickness benefit.6.     We must also face up to the other implications of a move to wagerelation in this sector.   The most difficult derives from the factthat the dependency allowances of the present insurance scheme alreadymake some low wage-earners with large families as well off on benefitas in work.   A wage-related scheme must either give smaller dependencyallowances than at present or be on so modest a scale as to leave thetotal benefit of the single man far short of his earnings.   I haveanalysed this situation in detail in a memorandum (S.S.(C.B.)(65)4)for the Social Services Sub-Conmittee on Social Security cash benefits and have outlined a variety of schemes which would providewage-related unemployment and sickness benefit of six monthsduration, within very roughly the same order of cost (about  50million a year) as has been allowed for these items in my basicand additional programmes.   But in Parliamentary discussion of anyof these schemes the dilemma to which I have referred above would be bound to come out starkly and would lead to developing pressure for family allowances to be increased so as to make possible a reductionin national insurance allowances for children.    If this were done,the family would receive all the time something they now get only when the father is on benefit and this would leave room for a biggergraduated element without bringing the family man&apos;s income on benefittoo close to his income when at work.   But the cost would be substantial.-17-

7.     It is not only Iron the introduction of wage-related,unemployment and sickness &quot;benefit that pressures for better family allowances will come.   In our Manifesto we referred to &quot;re-organisedfamily allowances, graduated according to the age of the child, witha particularly steep rise for those remaining at school af;ter thestatutory leaving age&quot;.   The Manifesto also said that re-organisedfamily allowances would replace school maintenance grants.   Apartfrom radical re-organisation ef the system of allowances for children,bringing in not only family allowances but also income tax reliefs,it will be very expensive to carry out this commitment in full.    If,for example, in order to enable the allowances      replace the schoolmaintenance grants, allowances were paid for all first children infamilies and a very small element of graduation according to age woreintroduced, the cost might be of the order of  200 million a year.Even if first children were excluded, except for those over school-leaving age, the cost could hardly be less than about  40 million ayear. By contrast, I understand that the cost of the existing schoolmaintenance grants is no more than about  1 million a year.8.     I recognise that the cost of our proposals about family allowancesmade in the Manifesto makes it quite unrealistic even to contemplatecarrying them through at the present time.   I am, however., particularlyworried about the situation in which some men are having to keep their families at a lower level of income than the ordinary national assistance scales would provide.   This comes to the surface when such men fall out of work and a special &quot;wage stop&quot; has to be imposed ontheir assistance payments to avoid giving then a higher income thanwhen working.   This is more particularly a problem affecting families with relatively low incomes and a number of children.    I should like tohave it examined to see whether it is possible to find some selective-way of dealing with it, or at least reducing it, at a reasonable cost.If we can find such a way it would, I think, be an important reformwhich we ought to carry through as soon as we can. Because of this,I have allowed an amount of  25 million a year in my additional programme for improvements in family allowances.   Until I have studied the matter further, I cannot say what would be the rightmethod or the amount required.9.     Finally, I have included a contingency allowance representing an extra  10 million a year by 1969-70.   In the nature of things I cannotsay whether this will prove to be the right amount.   But urgent problemsof a limited nature are always presenting themselves and we could not possibly preclude ourselves from introducing timely adjustments to ease the pressure here and there as circumstances may demand. The sort of thing I have in mind is the improvement needed, at a cost of about 1 million a year, in the benefits for men on workmen&apos;s compensation,which has recently been before the Cabinet. Another example may well beprovided when we have the report of Lord HcCorquodale1s Committee who arat present examining certain problems arising in connection with the assessment of disablement under the war pensions and industrial injuriesschemes.10.     In the light of what I have said, I an sure my colleagues will agree that my basic and additional programmes allow for no more thanmodest progress towards the reconstruction ox social security to whichwe are pledged.Ministry of -Pensions and National Insurance, W.

ANNEX EPOLICE AND PRISONSMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home DepartmentPoliceBasic programme . Within the target growth set for the police and prison block,expenditure on police is expected to increase from  199.-2 to 233.9m. (17.U2 per cent) over the period under review,,   Afurther  6.7m. is required in 1969-70 for the implementation ofexisting policies and is shown as an additional programme(see paragraph 2 below).2.     The present strength of the police service in England andWales is a little over 81,000.   Police establishments (whichhave in the past not been increased in areas where the level cfrecruitment did not permit the existing establishment to be filled) are at present under review,  so as to obtain a truepicture of deficiencies.   This review should be completed by theend of the year.    In the meantime, the best estimate is that onthe basis of existing conditions of service at least 15,000more policemen are required in England and Wales, together with at least another 1,000 wsmen.   The standard working week forthe police is h2 hours, but overtime has to be worked in manyforces and in the Metropolitan area the regular working week isstill U8 hours.   If a UO-hour working week were effectivelyadopted (and this must be considered a probability as the resultof normal processes of negotiation) there would be an additionalshortfall of between h.,000 and 5,000 men.   The figure of9h,000 uniformed police envisaged in 1969-70 d*aes not thereforerepresent the full requirement but rather the extent to which itis thought that progress could be made towards the full require-ment during the next five years.   Even so, the prospective costof providing this regular strength and ancillary civilian staffin 1969-70 is  6.7m. more than the target growth for the police and prisons block allows, and this sum has therefore had to be shown as an additional programme although needed in fact to implement existing policies*3.     The target growth was awarded in the light of the figuresincluded in the 196h Public Expenditure Survey.   Since lastyear&apos;s estimate was made I have been paying special attention to police manpower problems, in accordance with the governments intention,  announced in The ^ueen&apos;s Speech, to build up thestrength of the police, and it is apparent that the rate atwhieh police strength, together with ancillary civilian staff and traffic wardens, could be built up was underestimated (bysome  3.hm. in the case of the latter two categories) and that insufficient provision was made (to the extent of seme  1.6m.)for the provision by provincial police authorities of houses forthe police in lieu of rent allowances.   The remainder ( 1.7m.)

is due to a modest re-assessment of the requirements for operational buildings and to a miscellany of minor increases.h.     If the additional  6.7m. were not available restrictionson police recruitment, outside the special areas of persistentlow strength tfhere it is proposed to pay additional manning-upallowances, would have to be considered, beginning not later than 1967-68 and designed to confine the total strength ofuniformed police in 1969-70 to, say, 90,000 instead of the9h,000 envisaged.   Police recruitment has never been restrictedsince the 1929-31 financial crisis,  and public confidence wouldbe seriously shale en if steps were to be taken to restrictrecruitment at a level below the establishments officiallyapproved for each area after careful scrutiny of its needs byH.M, Inspectors of Constabulary.,   It is relevant that in Englandand wales the number of indictable offences known to the police in 19 6h was, for the first time, more than one million - over9 per cent more than the 1963 figures which in turn was 9 percent more than the 1962 figure.   The number of crimes of violencewas 17 per cent higher than in 1963 and there was a 23 per cent increase in robberies.   The percentage of crimes detected fellfrom 1+3 in 1963 to 39 in 19 62+.   At the same time the problems ofregulating the constantly increasing volume of road traffic and enforcing the traffic laws are graver than they have ever been, and it is generally accepted than an inciease in policemanpower on the roads is essential.   The Minister of transport would,  I know5, agree.5.     It therefore seems essential to continue vigoriously tobuild up police strength, while at the same time enabling agreater proportion of the service to be employed on duties which only they can undertaken by the recruitment of more ancillarycivilians and traffic wardens.6.     The position in Scotland is essentially similar (provision is made for an increase in uniformed strengths from some10,h00 to some 11,300) except that it has been possible to accommodate this increase within the target growth because theexisting relationship between strengths and requirements ismore favourable in Scotland than in England and Wales.PoliceAdditional Programme(i)   Lengthening the Courses at Police Training Centres7.     Provision is made for additional expenditure of  lm.during the period ( 0.2m. in 1969-70) of which one half wouldbe capital expenditure and one half would be current expenditure mainly on staff.

SECJSH73458.     Except for the Metropolitan Police who have theirown training school, arrangements for training recruits tothe Police Service in England and Wales are made by theHome Office at a number of district police training centres.At present there is a basic course of 13 weeks followed,during the first two years of service, by supplementary courses of two weeks each.    It has for some time been apparent thatwith the increasing complexities of police work, more time should be devoted to this training during the probationaryperiod and that an additional four or five weeks arerequired.(ii)   Residential Centres for Cadet Training9.     Provision is made for additional expenditure of  5.0m.during the period ( 2.0m. in 1969-70) to establish fourcentres,   each for about hOO cadets, to improve the trainingarrangements for the police cadets of certain forces outside london.10.   The employment of police cadets for two or three years before they are old enough to be taken into the regularservice is encouraged by the Home Office because experience has shown that the system attracts into the police service,school leavers who would otherwise establish themselves inother careers, that a high percentage join as constables andthat wastage, during the early years of service,  is in their case much less than amongst recruits with no previous experience.    Local training arrangements have not hitherto been co-ordinated and in some of the smaller forces havebeen unsystematic and rudimentary.   A working party of officials has recommended that where forces have few cadetssome measure of residential training would be desirable.Residential training has been given with good results inthe Metropolitan Police for some years.    Outside london the larger forces have made reasonably satisfactoryindividual arrangements but the smaller forces could notefficiently or economically provide their own residentialestablishments.    It is mainly with a view to assisting thesmaller forces (from whom, as with recruit training proper,half the cast would be recovered) that this additional expenditure is proposed.

(iii) Computer jfor,JIrimina 1 Tiecpjids11.   Provision is made for expenditure of  2.5m. to be incurred in each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 on the provision of a computer to provide a national criminal records service.12.    There are at present a criminal records office at New scotland yard, to which information about criminals and serious crime isfed by all police forces in the United Kingdom, and a number of smaller regional criminal records offices;    in addition, all police forces maintain their own local criminal records.13.   An investigation *f the application of automatic data processing to Police Criminal Records and Indexes is being made by home Office and police experts.     It appears clear, from consideration already given to the problem that (a)  computerisationwould be feasiblei   (b)    a more efficient and comprehensive service would be provided;   and (c) in order to obtain the maximumadvantage from computer installations already available on themarket, it is desirable to plan for a national computer systemserving the police forces of England and wales, and possiblyScotland.      It may be that a central installation, possibly withsatellite computers in the different police districts, will presentthe best solution.     The installation, which would have to providefor 2J!-hour real-time working, would inevitably be expensive butthe operational benefits would be considerable.1h.    It may be that an installation of the kind envisaged wouldalso serve the purpose of mechanising the Home Office records of aliens and commonwealth immigrants, since this presents manytechnical similarities to the application of A.D.P. to criminalrecords.     The police aspects would, however, be the larger partof the project.15.   A number of individual police authorities are already pursuingthe possibility of computerisation of criminal records and cannot in principle be discouraged in the absence of a national scheme.A national computer system is preferable because uncontrolleddevelopment of separate police computer systems in different partsof the country, either by Police Authorities on their own, or in collaboration with other Police Authorities, or by police authorities using computers purchased for other purposes by CountyCouncils and County Borough Councils, would lead in a short time toa series of different kinds of computers and approaches many ofwhich would be incompatible.     The development of separate systemswould also be more costly than a national scheme. rijscusBasic Programme16.   Expenditure is expected to increase from  31.3m. to  37.1m.(18.53^) over the period under review.-22-

17.    There are two main elements accounting for this increase.Although it is assumed that the Prison/Borstal population willremain constant, capital expenditure on building programmes isnecessary to eliminate three-in-cell sleeping and, generally, toreduce overcrowding and, in time, to replace outdated accommodation.It will also enable about 1,250 new places to be provided for young offenders in detention and remand centres.     Also the scale of provision of workshops is still inadequate and all prisoners cannotbe fully and usefully employed.     Unless a substantial building programme is undertaken implementation of the Governments plans for the introduction of more enlightened and modern methods of thetreatment of offenders will be greatly prejudiced.18.   The second main element of growth is that by 1969-70 prisonstaffs should be increased by about 3?U00 mainly for the newestablishments for which the building programmes provide, but alsoto implement improved conditions of service of prison officerswhich have already been agreed.PrisonsAdditional Programmes19. Provision is made for the following expenditure to be incurred on a scheme to enable prisoners throughout Great Britain to be paidwages at industrial ratest-1233-31 15.67^68 1968-69 1.969-70. 0.1m.  0.6m.  1.3m.  6.6m.About 200 prisoners live in prison hostels, go out to work for private employers and receive normal wages, out of which they pay their expenses, including board and lodging, maintain their families and are usually able to save a sum of money to help them ondischarge.     The great majority of prisoners work &quot;inside&quot; and receive in return for their work small sums ranging from 3/6d, toabout 11/Od, weekly.     This is little more than pocket-money forspending in the prison canteens.     In the earnings paid to &quot;inside&quot;prisoners this country has fallen behind many other countries, suchas the United States and Sweden, and the Advisory Council on theEmployment of Prisoners has recommended substantial increases.20.    The prison hostel scheme is a valuable part of the penal system and is being expanded as quickly as possible.     Among ot.her things,it encourages prisoners in making provision for themselves andtheir families by normal, honest work.     But within the foreseeable future it will be necessary to employ most prisoners for most oftheir sentences in prison industries and other forms of employmentwithin prisons, and it is desired to extend part of the benefits ofthe hostel scheme to these prisoners by paying at least some of-them amounts which are more commensurate with the value of their work than the mere pocket-money which they at present receive.Apart from any question of equity it is thought that this wouldmake a real contribution to the constructive treatment and trainingof prisoners and their preparation for release.21 .   Ways and means of doing this are at present being considered and all prison industries are being costed to ascertain what additional payments to prisoners would be covered by the profits made by the industries.     Until this examination has been completed and firm proposals are available the forecast expenditure as shown

above can &quot;be no more than conjectural.     It assumes a modestbeginning but an expansion by 1969-70 amounting to full wages for most prisoners.22.   The figure of  6.6m. for that year has been calculated byestimating the additional cost of average industrial wages andsubtracting amounts representing the contributions the prisonerswould make to their board and lodging and to the maintenance oftheir families, who would thus cease to need national assistance.It is therefore the maximum conceivable cost on present day prices and with the present prison population.     The actual cost may bemuch less according, for example, to the number of prisoners inreceipt of higher payj    the number for whom work can be found with private employers;   whether and to what extent amounts fallingshort of full wages are paid;   the existing profitability of prisonindustries, as established by the costing exercises, and how far this can be improved.F.S.Home Office,  S.W.1.24th June, 19^5-24-

THE ROAD PROGRAMMEjfempjpandum by thei Minister of transport o     The Road Programme is a five-year rolling programme of Exchequerexpenditure on new construction and major improvement of major roadshe. motorways, trunk roths and grants to classified (mainly urban)roads.   This last item is complemented by the contribution (on average 30%) of local authorities towards the cost of classifiedroadso2.     The previous Government in 1 96U approved and announced a road programme for the five years 1965/6 to 1369/70 which involvedExchequer expenditure rising as follows;-(i)    in the case of England and Wales from  ikkopm. in thefirst year to  223m. in the final year (making a total of 91km. over the five years);(ii)    in the case of Scotland from  21.9m. to  28o6m0 (totalling 122.6m.)oIt is this same programme which is no-sv at issue, modified only totake account of price changes assessed since last year.3*.     Most public expenditure programmes covered by the 1 96k P.E.S.C.Survey v/ere cn the basis of prices as calculated, at that time andthey have been brought up to date by one year in the current survey0But the road programme approved in 196k. was pn the basis of 1962cost levels ice. on the basis of prices extracted from 1962 roadcontracts which at that time were the latest available figures.Since then data on prices have become available from a detailed analysis of 136k road contracts.    Thus, it is necessary to take account of price changes over two years and not merely over a singleyear.ho     This analysis shows that road construction prices rose on average by 85-/0 ever these two years, while the cost of land for roadshas been assessed by the Valuation Office as having risen between22^o and 32)o according to area (rural or urban) .    The full effects ofthese cost increases are delayed;    in the last year of the current programme they amount to a cost increase of roughly 10^.5.     These figures have been examined by an inter-departmentalworking party of statisticians who are satisfied, that they are thebest possible indication of the increase in the cost of roadcontracts let in i96k over those let in 1962.   A general study ofthe trend of road construction prices will,  it is hoped, be made bythe recently appointed Economic Development Committee for the civil engineering Industry.6.     The road programme figures approved by the previous Governmenthave been re-appraised by the Ministry of Transport against progressin the preparation of schemes in the programme and re-costed to take-25-

account of price changes.    Eut in the earlier years of the period itis estimated that some small part of these scaled-up figures will &quot;beunderspent because it is too late to adjust the rate of physicalprogress of the work, and a deduction has been made on this account.Thus, the basic programme figures for England and Wales are made upas follows:-Existing road programme up to 1 969-70Plus price increasesLess underspending in the earlier years (1965-68)This same approach holds good generally for Scotland also.7.     The Ministry of Transport, the Welsh Office and the scottish development Department have proposed that the underspendings in theearlier years should, be made good in the later years and they have entered these amounts as &quot;additional programmes&quot; for the currentP.E0S0C0 Survey.8.      Thus, for the five-year period up to I969-7O there are three alternative programmes between which a decision is required j1965/61966/71967/81968/91969/70Column 1	Column 2	Column 3Old	Basic	 rn.	 m.	&quot;  m.187c2	I92.7	192.7207*8	222.2	223 c 3239.3	257-2	257*8270o0	296.6	3010 7296o3	327oO	31+0.81200*6	1295-7	1316.3The implications of(a)these three alternatives are as follows;-(c)confirmation of Column 1 would mean ;terms i.e. in terms of the amount of as compared with the road programme previous Government up to 1969-70j1 reduction in realnew road construction,innounced. by thethe programme in Column 2 would maintain the real valueof the announced programme except for the under spendingsin the earlier years %Column 3 would maintain the real value of the announcedprogramme over the five years taken together but wouldinvolve an increase in work in the later years to compensate for underspendings in the earlier years.10.    The main considerations seem to(i)thesethis is no new or increased programme.   What is a tissue is the maintenance in real terms of a programme already announced by the previous Government and onwhich action by both central and local government isalready in hand;(ii)    it is a modest programme which the Departments concerned have already assessed and. agreed as to the strength ofthe case for it;(iii)    it is a programme which will contribute significantlyto a basic infrastructure of the country&apos;s economy and help its expansion.    The motorways and improved trunk roads are directed at the important industrial and commercial traffics between towns (including ports)

most of which is over relatively short distancese    Theseroads are also of hey importance to regional development,both within regions and between them.,    another important feature of the programme is the provisionforroads in new and expanded towns.   Economic growth within our existing towns is increasingly geared to deliveryby road, and the construction of improved road networks,though far from being the whole answer, is necessaryfor this and for sound urban redevelopment and renewal,11o   -The basic Road Programme figures include  lc5mo in 1965/66rising to  8.9m. in 1969-70 for expenditure in England and Waleson classified roads in new towns and on schemes approved under theTown Development Act, 1962.12.   As from the beginning of the current financial year, theMinistry of Housing and Local Government have bcome responsible forthe programming of this expenditure, and a review of the requirementsby that Ministry has lea to proposals for a small additional programme of  1.1m. in 1966-67 falling to  0,1m. in 1969-70.These amounts are included in the additional programme.    They relateonly to schemes already approved.   A number of large new scheme shave been announced e.g. Ipswich, Northampton, Peterborough, whichare likely to require further additional expenditure towards theend of the period under review.Other new construetion13.   This consists of expenditure by local authorities asfollOWSS-(a) en iinclassified roads, amounting in England and -&quot;alesto  9o5mT in 1^5::^rand  12.1m. in 1969-70;(b) on car parks - see para. 16 below;(c) on street., l igfat ing installations7- see para. 19 below;lli.   In Scotland, expenditure on these items taken together risesfrom  5.0m. in 1965-66 to  5.1m. in 1969-70.15.   Amounts included under these heads are forecasts rather thanprogrammes.    The central government has only a very loose controlover this expenditure by way of loan sanctions.    If anysubstantial restraint was to be applied it would have to be backed by a Government announcement of an intention to restrict this expenditure.Car Parks   (England and &quot;Vales)Basic programme16.    Thi^ ii? based on the. trend, of expenditure in previous yearsand current loan sanction applications.    It amounts to  8.2m.in 1965-66 rising to  10.5m. in 1969-70.Addi tional &quot;programme-17.   Recently, however, the Government has issued a Planning Bulletingiving general guidance to local authorities on the subject ofparking in town centres.    It stresses the importance of comprehensiveparking policies and explains that the Government regard this asan essential step in securing the use of road space and will,therefore, have regard to parking policies when considering proposalsfor classified road grants.

n r* o18.   A considerable increase in the scale of car parkingprovision is expected as a result of this, and an additional programme of  lm. in 1966-67 rising to  15m. in 1969-70 hasbeen proposed to cater for this.Street lighting (England and Wales)19.    The basic -programme provides for expenditure at a constantrate of  6m. a year.    This is met entirely by local lightingauthorities, apart from a small amount met by the Ministry ofTransport by way of 50 per cent contributions towards the costof lighting certain trunk roads to an approved standard,20,   An additional programme rising from  0.6m. in 1966-67 to 1.1m. in 1969-70 is now proposed to enable the Ministry tosecure the provision of adequate lighting on further lengths oftrunk road.   The Treasury have agreed in principle that infuture the whole cost of provision and maintenance of lightingon trunk roads should be met by the central government.   It isknown that good street lighting can reduce the number of accidents after dark by at least 30%,   The present rate ofinstallation is inadequate, but is limited by the ability of lighting authorities to meet their share of the cost.   In manycases where lighting is known to be needed, thei^e is no prospectof its provision under existing arrangements.   It is, therefore,proposed to install lighting on h50 miles of trunk road over thenext three years (for payment in 1966-67 to 1968-69) accordingto a system of priorities based on cost and anticipated saving in accidents.   At the end of the period an assessment will bemade, of the need for lighting on the remainder of the trunk road network.   Per present purposes it is assumed that expenditurein 1969-70 will continue at the level of the previous threeyears.Maintenance and Minor Improvements21.    This provision covers the following;-(a) motorways;     1.0m. in 1965-6   rising to  2.0m. in19 69^70/&apos;(b) ^uuk^rpjad^s;,    provision averaging  20.km. a year.(c) classified roads in countijgsj    the provision averagingabout  61 ,&quot;9mT&quot;a&quot;year of which about 70% is borne bythe Exchequer and the remainder by the County Councils.(d) classified roads in county boroughs;     37.3m. in 1965-6rising to  39.0m. in 1969-70.(e) unclassified roads;  57.0m. in 1965-6 rising to  61.0m.in&quot;1969-70.(f) maintenance of street lighting;     18.7m. in 1965-6rising to  21,3m. in 1969-To,22.   The increase under (a) is due to the rapid, increase in themileage of motorways.23.   The provisions of (b) and (c) are governed by the 10 yearprogrammes agreed by the previous Government and, in the case ofclassified roads, publicly announced last year.   The object ofthese programmes is to secure long term economies in the repair of roads (by improved foundations and long life surfacing) and toget better value out of the system by increased provision for

minor improvements of great traffic value (widening andstraightening of sub-standard roads).   These improvements willbe accompanied by a decrease in expenditure on maintenanceof&quot; less permanent value (short term repairs, patching etc.),,2h.    Much of the trunk road system is not up to a satisfactorystandard, and it is likely that the present programme will prove to be inadequate.   The Ministry&apos;s reassessment of needsis not yet complete, but proposals may have to be made in future years for an increase in the programme for maintenance and minor improvements of trunk roads.25.   Expenditure under heads (d)  (e) and (f) is met by the localauthorities themselves and is not subject to control by theMinistry.   The amounts provided for are a projection of theknown expenditure in earlier years.Testing of Heavy Goods......Vehicles26,   Provision is proposed as an additionaI programme for thecapital expenditure which will be required for the inrolementationof the scheme for an annual testing of heavy goods vehicleswhich was announced on 2nd June with the agreement of theHome Affairs Committee (item 2 of H(65)9th Meeting) - 1966-67 2.1m. and 19^7-68  2.0m.    The amounts provided are provisionalbecause the number of testing stations and the cost of the equipment cannot be forecast with reasonable accuracy pending further discussions with industry and the testing of prototypeequipment.   It is intended that both the capital and running costs of the schemes should be recovered by the charging of fees for testing,27.    There is a general public feeling that the annual testing of heavy lorries is long overdue.   Parliamentary and publicopinion, including those sections of the industry who hadwanted the testing facilities to be provided by private garagesand not by the Government, will be critical of delay.   It is most important that authority should be given for expenditureon the purchase of sites for stations in the financial year1966-67&quot;, although the greater part of the expenditure willprobably fall in the following year.T.F.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1 .21st June, 19^5

SECRET *       354ANNEX G!    THE AID JPROC^MI^mMemorandum by the Minister of Overseas development .     Introduction.     Britain&apos;s aid programme is part of a sustained inter-national effort to raise standards of living in the underdeveloped countries.This effort has grown since the war from small beginnings to a total net flow of official funds of nearly  2,160 million a year.     This flow is itself farless than the admitted need;   and Britain&apos;s contribution is not outstandinglyhigh.2.     The purpose of our aid is to transfer real resources, that is goods and services, from ourselves to the recipients, and it is sometimes supposed thatthe resulting burden on our balance of payments is equal to the amount of our expenditure.     This is not so.     Over 40 per cent of our aid is formally tiedto the provision of British goods and services and a great deal of theremainder returns to the United Kingdom.     It is true that if, as at present,our economy is working at full capacity, increases in public expenditure(at home as well as abroad) place some strain on our balance of payments andthat some aspects of aid have special balance of payments effects.     Thegeneral effects are not different from those of other public expenditure.The special effects are being considered interdepartmentally.     On the basisof the detailed investigations already made, it is the view of my officialsthat under normal conditions the additional foreign exchange saving from a restriction of the aid programme in relation to other forms of expenditure,does not exceed 25 per cent to 30 per cent.     This is a lower figure than has previously been quoted because of the efforts we are making to hold down this burden.3.     The fundamental object of our aid programme is to contribute to develop-ment overseas.     This is our duty, together with other aid donors, as anindustrialised country;   but it is also in our own national interest.    Aidis now a major factor in international relations.     In the long term, higher standards in the less developed, countries will be essential to the maintenanceof peace and will be to our own benefit as a trading nation.     In the shorterterm, British aid to a number of countries, especially in the Commonwealth,which have had close relations with us for many years, is a necessity fortheir continued independent existence.-30-

4.     To be effective, our programme has to have continuity.     developing countries must know what to expect from donors.     Disbursements of aid inany one year often do not result from commitments in the immediate past;they more usually relate to pledges or agreements entered into two or more years previously,     For this reason it is not possible to increase or reduceaid expenditure significantly over a short period.     The word i,commitment,,can be variously interpreted.     In the broadest sense, we are &quot;committed&quot; tosupply aid to, for example, Malawi for as long as they need it for solvency,and to India while we remain a member of the international group dedicatedto providing aid for its development.     In the narrower sense, we are&quot;committed&quot; to aid. those and other countries to the extent that we havealready made firm pledges of definite amounts over a specified, period ahead,some of which have been set out in formal intergovernmental agreements.     Itis not realistic, however, to seek to distinguish between our formal commit-ments, defined in this marrow sense, and the obligations which we cannotescape in continuation of our aid policy,3*     The Programme.     The &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;additional&quot; programme submitted bythis Ministry for the Public Expenditure Survey must be seen against the background described in the preceding paragraphs,     The figures submittedwere:--1963/4      1964/5Outturn   Estimated   1965/6   1966/7   1967/8   1968/9   1969/70^OutturnBasic 167.8        191.8      198,3     215,5     220.0     226,0     228.5Additional 265.0     285.0     315.0     335.0The basic programme was a construction within the strict limits formulated bythe Treasury for this part of the forecast.     These required that theestimated outturn for 1964/5 should be increased by a total of not more than18.8 per cent over the next five financial years;   and that the element ofvoted expenditure in the 1965/6 figure should be restricted to the amountincluded, in the substantive Estimates for that year.     The additional programme was to assume an increase in expenditure corresponding to the forecast requirements of policy as at present formulated.     This increase would bring our total to - 335 million by 1969/70 or approximately 1 per cent of the then estimated G-ross National Product.     No allowance has been made inthese figures for rising prices in the meantime,6..    The Basic Programme.    The framework laid down for the projections ofthe basic programme meant, of course, that they bore no relation to theMinistry&apos;s estimates of likely disbursements in the years in question.     Thereis evidence-ence that the high interest rates on our aid loans - the result of thenecessary internal measures taken by the Government in the autumn of 1964 -resulted in artificially low drawings on them in the latter part of the

financial year 1964/5.     (The final outturn was less than that for the calendar year 1964.)     Our base figure for the projection was thereforeartificially low.     The 1965/6 forecast contained, by definition, no allowance for Supplementary Estimates (and we can include in the substantiveEstimates only expenditure which can clearly be foreseen as a result ofexisting policies and decisions).     Our actual forecast expenditure for1965/6 is ,-5210 million to  220 million - exceeding the basic programme figure for the following financial year and perhaps equalling that for 1967/8.     Aswill be seen below, the projections for the ba.sic programme are unrealisticeven in relation to our existing commitments to developing countries.7.     The additional programme.     The rate at which we advance must depend onour own economic recovery and future progress;   but, in view of our pastpronouncements, we should find it hard to justify to Parliament and the publica target for 1969/70 of less than 1 per cent of G-.N.P. for our grossGovernment disbursements on aid.     Nor in practical terms, could we managewith less.     As we show below, total expenditure of about  335 million in1969/70, which would approach this percentage of G-.N.F., would be theprobable outcome of our existing aid policies, with little allowance for theintroduction of new measures which we believe to be necessary to the effectiveness of our future aid programme.8.     Existing Commitments.     In the Appendix we show our forecast disburse-ments over the next five financial years.     Column (a) in each year gives a forecast on the basis of actual formal commitments (in the narrowest sense)now existing;    column (b) shows this figure plus expenditure from new and likely commitments resulting from existing policies and necessary new measures.     It will be seen that the existing commitments figure declinesfrom  207.5 million in 1965/6 to  110.5 million in 1969/70.     But we could notin fact restrict our expenditure in this way..     To do this would mean offeringno further aid and opting out of all inter-national relations which involve it.This would inflict grave damage on the economies of a. large number of developing countries, virtually destroy our good relations with them, and put us in an impossible international position,     Eor example, our bilateralfinancial aid to the independent Commonwealth would decline to less than 10 million.     This would mean that our vital contributions to the developmentof such sensitively-placed countries as India, Pakistan and Kenya, would almostcease, as would our already small amounts of add to foreign countries.     Evenin the shorter term, our position would be hardly less serious.     Our figure

r*  &apos;for existing commitments in 1966/7 ( 189.5 million) includes only half ofour present level of aid. to East Africa (where, in Kenya, the problem ofland, settlement involves in a high degree our good faith) and would, entailcutting off altogether our general purpose aid to India,     Among foreigncountries, aid to such high priority areas as Turkey and Jordan wouldvirtually cease.9.     We must in fact regard ourselves as committed by our existing policies to a level of expenditure of about  250 million in 1966/7.     The increase over the figure of  210 million to  220 million for 1965/6 (paragraph 6) is mainly accounted for by the rise in disbursements on India, including Indiandebt, referred to in paragraphs 11 and 14 below, and by increased expenditureon technical assistance to which Ministers have already agreed.     But wecannot effectively continue our existing policies without leaving some roomin our programme for new projects and new initiatives to make the programmemore effective.     The recommendations which we now put forward make somemodest provision for this,10.   The Programme Envisaged.     A programme building up to  335 million in1969/70 would represent the fulfilment of our present obligations and make areasonable (though not generous) allowance for necessary new initiatives.11.   The sum included in it for our primary obligation, aid to the Dependencies( 33 million), is only a little over  2 million more than the current annual rate of disbursement at to-day&apos;s prices, and is in accordance with the levelof aid envisaged in the recent Oversees Development and Service Act.     the allowance for bilateral aid tc the independent Commonwealth must include anincrease in our aid to India..     This is likely to rise to well over 50 million a year within the next year or two, including  20 million fromfunds already committed, between  15 million and  20 million for theDurgapur Steelworks, to which we are virtually committed, and a further 20 million which represents little more than the present level of aid for essential imports to maintain the Indian economy.     A total allowance forIndia of between  50 million and  55 million a year by 1969/70 is the leastwe can envisage, with some consequential increase for Pakistan.     With an allowance of only  10 million for increases in other Commonwealth countries(including such important areas as East Africa, and Nigeria.), our bilateralfinancial aid to the Commonwealth would then total  145 million in 1969/70.

12.   For foreign countries, an average annual level of expenditure of 30 million to the end of 1965/6 was agreed in 1963.   Our present forecast for that year is in fact  26 million including the refinancing of debt( 0 million) which is dealt with separately below.   If we are to play our full part in international aid, the share of foreign countries in our programme should be increased, and a level of about  37 million (excludingdebt) by 1969/70 would be no more than reasonable.   This is a small sum inrelation to the needs in the Par and Middle East, Africa and Latin America.13.   Our bilateral technical assistance (the pait of the bilateral programme to which we attach the greatest importance) will cost  32 million in 1965/6.The continuance of our present programme is indispensable to the stability and well-being of the recipients; and Ministers have recently approved anumber of new initiatives, including the Special Institution for DevelopmentStudies,    the   corps  of specialists and the extension of the home base,which are all needed if the effectiveness of our bilateral aid is to bemaintained.   Expenditure will reach  37 million by 1966/67 and a total of 45 million by 1969/70 may be expected.14.   Increasingly we shall be called upon to assist, together with othercreditors, in the refinancing of debt for developing countries.   V.&quot;e are committed to  6 million of this expenditure in 1965/6, which is the level ofrecent years.   Ministers have already taken note, however, of the next major problem of Indian debt, for which we may have to find  10 million a year.Other cases will certainly arise.   A total of  20 million for 1969/70 is a conservative estimate.15.   secret the Exchequer drawings of the Commonwealth Development Corporationwe allow an increase of only  2 million to  10 million a yoar.16.   Our multilateral aid (which consists mainly of our contributions tothe international agencies dealing with the various kinds of developmentassistance) will total  29 million in 1965/6.   The leading agency is theInternational Development Association, which lends for development projectson very soft terms.   The Association plans to increase its operations saidif this is agreed we shall have to contribute a proportiona,te share to itsfunds.   The present level of our subscription is  11 million to  12 million

a year, and. we expect this to be  20 million by 1 $69/70 if other donors alsoplay their part.   A new initiative which we took at the TJNCTAD is a scheme(Supplementary Financial Measures) designed to assist countries whosedevelopment plans are frustrated by adverse fluctuations in export earnings.A relatively modest scheme of this kind would be likely to cost us 10 million a year, in a few years time.   These, together with other new proposals, are likely to raise our multilateral programme as a whole to some 51 million in 1969/70.17.   A programme significantly less than  335 million in the final year ofthis Survey would force us to make radical changes in our existing policies which would damage the developing countries, especially those of theCommonwealth, and our relations with them; would preclude us from talcing newinitiatives of our own, or participating in those of multilateral agencies,designed to improve the effectiveness of our own and western aid.   In eitherevent, the widening gap between the standards of the advanced and the developing world would be worsened, at great risk to world peace and stability.B.A.C.Ministry of Overseas Development, S.17.121st June, 1965-35&quot;

In the figures we have submitted we have defined formal commitments verystrictly - perhaps too strictly.     For example, we have excluded fromColumn B (Formal Commitments) and included under Column C budgetary anddevelopment aid to Malawi because, with theobject of being in the best position to influence Dr. Bands&apos;s development policy, I have refused to comiaimyself to any figure for aid after the current year;    but it is in factinescapable that our aid to Malawi should continue if the administration ofthe country, to which we are virtually the only donor, is not to collapse.Again, because this is committed annually, we have excluded from Column Bnon-project aid to India, i.e. aid to help supply India&apos;s needs for essential imports;   but this is a form of aid which we have been regularly giving as a-38-

member of the Indian Consortium and which is regarded by the Governmentof India and ourselves as having the highest priority.     We have limited the figure in Column B for technical assistance to the amount for whichwe have actually made detailed specific commitments.     But this figure isquite unrealistic as an estimate of v/hat we must actually spend if forexample the number of people we recruit for service overseas is not to fall.It is in fact  10 million below the current rate of expenditure.     technical assistance is a continuing process and we cannot suddenly turn off thetap,   I give these examples to show that in practice the total for firmcommitments under Column B is much below our minimum requirement for 1966/67*5.     The composition, in broad terms of the figures in column C (continuation of present policy) is as follows:-(i)   Commonwealth0     Roughly  14 rn. is for India;    this includes thegeneral purpose aid at its present level.      The total figure forIndia would be  10 m. higher but for the estimating adjustment whichwe have made, referred to at the end of paragraph 3.     Because ofthis increase for India we must allow for at least a small increase( 2.3 m,) in aid to Pakistan.The Commonwealth figure includes nearly  10 m. for Malawi,which for the reasons given above we cannot avoid.     It includes afurther  12 m. spread over a number of African countries, to providefor a continuation of aid broadly at the same level as the presentand to help land settlement in Kenya,     These countries are heavily dependent on us as the major supplier of financial aid and we cannotturn off the tap without going back on our existing policies.       nor can we escape expenditure to help settlement in Kenya withoutinflicting grave damage economically and politically on that countryand causing ourselves considerable embarrassment in Parliament.This expenditure in effect consists of a continuation of existing policy with regard to settlement.     The Stamp Mission has sharplyscaled down the Kenya Government&apos;s original request to us for this type of aid.

-AO-SECRETSince the programme contains nothing for contingencies, theCommonwealth figure makes no provision for rescue operations forCeylon and Ghana,     We shall certainly be pressed within the nextfew months to take part in such international operations for both countries;    the precise amounts required cannot yet be foreseen,but might easily add a further  10 m. to the figures.     There is noslack in the programme from which such a sum can be found,(ii) Foreign Countries.     Nearly  4 m. is to provide continuing aid to turkey and about  2 m. to Jordan.     The remainder consits of relatively small amounts for a number of countries.     The total of 11 m. for foreign countries in table C, when added to the  11 in.representing firm commitments in column B, makes a total programme for foreign countries for 1966/67 below the level agreed by the lastGovernment as the aid allocation for foreign countries, so that in asking for this we are simply continuing existing policy,(iii)Debt.     Virtually the whole of the increase consits of what we shallhave to provide if we join with other members of the Indian Consortiumin meeting the Indian request for relief on the service of outstandingdevelopment loans.     My colleagues have already agreed to ourdiscussing this step in the Consortium. Relie f on the debt burden isin my opinion inevitable if Indian development is to proceed on anything approaching an adequate scale.     The estimate for Indiandebt is  10 m. in1966/67.(iv) Bilateral technical assistance.     As I have explained above  10 in,of the total of approximately  15 m, in column C represents thedifference between formal specific commitments to supply experts, etc,into which we have entered, and the present level of expenditure.The process of accepting new detailed commitments goes on throughoutthe year from week to week, so that the figure for formal commitmentsat any one time is quite arbitary;    and we could not in practicecut expenditure below its existing level.     The remaining  5 m. is

mainly for new initiatives in recruitment etc.. which have recentlybeen approved by Ministers&apos;.     I attach the highest priority tothese and I cannot abandon or delay them without departing fromone of the central features of our aid policy which has just been endorsed by Ministers.6.     The conclusion which I draw from the above figures is that we cannot budgefor less than  251 m, without abandoning existing policies which are crucial tcour relations with the countries concerned, to our aid programme and to our international standing.     In arriving at our figure we have made an estimatingadjustment of  30 ra. in all (including adjustment for India) to allow forslower disbursements than the figures in the estimates.     We cannot go further than this.     V/e have to recognise that the figure of  251 ra, does not includeanything for rescue operations to Ceylon and Ghana which are likely to be obliged to undertake.7.     Onthe programme up to 1969/70, I will only say   this.     We must inmy opinion provide for an increase over the figures for 1966/67.     Takingmultilateral aid first and dealing only with major items, we must provide inthe years after 1966/67 for the Supplementary Financial Assistance which theprevious Government took the lead in promoting at UNCTAD last year;    this isestimated at  10 in. per year.     We shall be called upon to increase our contributions to the International Development Association - accounting for another  6 m.     This is the most effective of all forms of multilateral aid,and experience has shown that it actually benefits our balance of paymentsbecause we sell more British goods than the money we put in.     On bilateralaid we must provide for our Colonial territories the amounts made available under the Overseas Development and Service Bill now before Parliament - theincrease over 1966/67 is only  2-g m.     We shall not in my opinion be able to escape a further increase for debt;     the increase put at  &apos;-; m. over 1966/67may well prove an under-estimate.     And we cannot expect the rest of our

sat,,.  ; .bilateral programme to remain static;    some increase must be provided forbilateral technical assistance, my own highest priority.     Some increase must also be provided for capital aid to independent countries, both commonwealth and foreign, if we are not to damage our political relationships.Ministry of Overseas Development, S.W.1.6th July, 1965NOTE:     An Itemised statement of estimated expenditure in 1964-65and 1965-66 and of firm and prospective commitments in1966-67 is attached as an Appendix to this note.

housing memorandum Toy the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment1. The two housing items in Category A are Item h, Public HousingInvestment; and Item 5, Housing Subsidies (public and private) and.improvement ovement Gr ants.Public Housing Investment2.      This comprises the housing programmes of local authorities andnew towns in England,  Scotland and Wales.3.      The rate of approvals is running this year for England andWales at 156,000 houses (including 6,000 for new towns), in line with the Cabinet decision in February;    and the &quot;basic&quot; programmeshown in the P.3.S.G. Report assumes continuance at this rate overthe next four to five years, except for some increase in housebuilding in new towns.      The Secretary of State for Wales and Icontend that, as an essential element of the Government&apos;s policy,the local authority housing programme for the two countries mustincrease steadily each year as productivity increases;    and thatthis decision of policy cannot be left to the mercy of what is available in some remainder item.      Thus our proposals are notdivisible into basic and additional;    and the figures in the Report(which assume this division) have been produced without commitment.What we propose is most clearly expressed as on annual increase of5/o in the local authority programme over and above the level approved for this year;    which means an additional 7,500 housing&apos; approvals for local authorities each year, bringing the 1969-70 local authorityprogramme to 180,000 approvals.      The monetary figures would be asshown in the Table annexed.h.      The Secretary of State for Scotland has broadly the sameapproach; and his P.E.S.C. figures, which were divided into basicand additional programmes, meet the Cabinet decision in Februaryabout the permissible rate of growth for housing.      In his view theannual rate of increase necessary for Scotland is about 6-7h -because the main weight of housing provision there falls on thepublic sector - and the programme would move from 31,000 approvalsin 1 965-66 to 40,000 in 1969-70.5.      On this basis the number of house completions by public authorities in Great Britain in 1970 would be of the order of250,000;    and assuming that private enterprise, after a probabledip this year, recovers and. then continues at about last year&apos;s levelof 2h7,O0O started (and I am discussing with the building societiesways and means of assuring this) that v/ould give us a total housingoutput of about 500,000 by 1970.      This should not be beyond the capacity of the building industry, especially given the steady increase in the use of industrialised building methods for which Iam planning.

Housing Subsidies and Improvement Grants6.      The size of Item 5 depends partly on what is decided aboutpublic housing investment;    and partly on the extra cost of(i) a revised subsidy structure for local authorities and (ii) ascheme for reducing the interest burden on new mortgages taken out by owner-occupiers.      The details of these new policies arebeing worked out and final proposals will be brought before theCabinet in due course.      Allowance has been made in the total figure of  278m.  shown against Item 5 for all these factors(including a provisional  3m. for the additional cost of the rising public sector programme proposed);    but until thefinancial schemes are finally settled this figure can only beprovisional.E.
