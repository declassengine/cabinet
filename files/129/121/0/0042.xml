THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1965C. (65) 92 Copy No.    g g7th July, 1965CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartmentI summarise in this paper general conclusions on theMountbatten Report, and what from a departmental point of view regard as of importance.2. I take as my starting point that in addition to the nearmillion, or thereabouts, coloured immigrants now in the UnitedKingdom we are committed to allowing entry to their wives andchildren under 16, that is, their dependants, who are given a rightof entry (if they can satisfy the immigration officer that they are infact dependants) under section 2 of the Commonwealth ImmigrationAct 1962 (to which I will refer as &quot; the Act&quot;). As has been said, ona very rough estimate, they may number anything up to half a million.I will refer to them as &quot; the half-million dependants &quot;.3. The Commonwealth Immigration Committee has givenconsideration to the suggestion that, although we accept and affirmthe legal entitlement of these dependants to enter, we should amend the Act so as to provide that dependants of commonwealth immigrants who are accepted for settlement after a certain date inthe future, say 1st October, 1965, should not have a statutory rightto enter, but should only be allowed to enter at our discretion as isthe case with dependants of aliens admitted here for settlement.Against such a change, it may be argued that though it would impresspublic opinion as a drastic measure, it would by itself have littleimmediate effect on the actual figures of intake, if, as we would haveto, we allowed, in the exercise of our discretion, Commonwealthdependants to enter in the like circumstances as those in which weallow alien dependants to enter. (The comparison between alien and commonwealth entrants is not entirely appropriate. This is because a very high percentage of alien immigrants depart again after a shorter or longer period. This is true of some commonwealth immigrants, such as doctors and nurses; but in general immigrants from the new Commonwealth countries come to settle here for good.)Although, however, such a change would have little short-term impact on the figures of dependants entering from the new commonwealth countries, it would enable us to say that at any future time, if in thenext few years the burden on our social services becomes unbearableCONFIDENTIAL5872 a
owing to the number of immigrants arriving, we can in the exerciseof our discretion impose terms on the entry of dependants or reduce their number, or, should it be unavoidable, even refuse to admitdependants whether of alien or Commonwealth immigrants. (Forthe sake of clarity I except from this, of course, the &apos;; half-million &quot;dependants of Commonwealth immigrants already settled here orsettled by the future date chosen as above suggested, say 1st October,1965.) It would for example enable us at any future time, should wethink it necessary, to say that in the case of dependants of futuresettlers (whether alien or Commonwealth) they will only be admitted by us in the exercise of our discretion when the settler here canestablish that he has proper housing accommodation for his dependants when they arrive. The actual conditions to be imposedcould be more or less stringent according as circumstances require.To impose such conditions in the case of the &quot; half-million&quot;entitled dependants (i.e., those of existing settlers) would I think bea breach of faith, and inconsistent with speeches made on behalfof the Government. On the other hand to impose such conditions on the entry of &quot; future &quot; dependants, if I may so describe them,would I think (though the contrary view is plainly arguable) not bea breach of faith, and would not be in any sense inhumane orimmoral. On the contrary, to allow dependants to come toovercrowded conditions in an atmosphere of developing ill-will andfriction with the indigenous population could I think be described as immoral. If the announcement were made now that this was our intention in the case of settlers, settling in the United Kingdom asfrom, say, 1st October, 1965, it would not be unfair to them; as theywould come with full knowledge that whilst in principle we were certainly in favour of their dependants following them so far aspracticable, their dependants might have to wait for example untilour housing and social service facilities were adequate to accommodate them. As the conditions would apply equally tocoloured, white and alien immigrants we could not be accused ofcolour discrimination. I think it likely that sooner or later, whether we like it or not, the sheer pressure of numbers arriving may forcesome change of this sort on us. It would be better to take the presentopportunity of doing it, rather than wait until ill-will between the immigrant and indigenous population has become still moreexacerbated. It would enable us to make some significant progressin integration. I would accordingly support the making of such achange.4. If it is accepted that we are committed to allow entry tothe &quot; half million &quot; dependants of existing immigrant settlers, then(whether or not we make the change in relation to dependants of future settlers discussed in the previous paragraph) it seems to mequite indispensable, if we are to have any hope at all of allaying thepresent growing public disquiet, that we should be able to givepositive assurances in our public statements that, so far as entrantsother than dependants and voucher holders are concerned, we havetaken powers sufficient to ensure that we can prevent, if not 100 percent, at least a very high percentage, of evasion by other entrants,that is to say, in substance visitors and students and a few
nondescripts. I include in the term evasion both entry by fraudulentmeans, and failure to comply with conditions of entry such asstudents taking employment instead of pursuing a course of studies,or visitors overstaying their leave. My own opinion is that publicopinion expects that really drastic proposals will emerge as the resultof the Mountbatten Report, and if a large number of students andvisitors are allowed entry as heretofore (as they clearly must), I am sure we would be in a completely indefensible position electorallyand otherwise if we had to concede that we had not taken sufficientpowers virtually to put an end to evasion. I accordingly think that thefollowing are quite indispensable:Repatriation5. (i) The Home Secretary should be given a general powerto &quot; repatriate &quot;, or in other words deport. At present, in the case of commonwealth immigrants, he can only repatriate if, following upona conviction, the Court has recommended deportation. There must bea power to repatriate without any recommendation having beenmade by a Court. This power exists in the case of aliens.This power is recommended by the Mountbatten Report.(ii) the power should (subject to (hi) below) be exerciseable inthe case of all Commonwealth immigrants, i.e., voucher-holders and dependants as well as students and visitors. One may well get avoucher-holder who is just a lay-about and generally bad character,who refuses to do the work for which he has been admitted, andprefers to maintain himself and his family on National Assistance,being merely a burden and of no value to the community. At present,unless a Court recommends him for deportation on conviction fora crime, there is no method of compelling his departure. The powerto repatriate would be very rarely exercised in the case of voucher-holders and their dependants, being far more often exercised in thecase of students and visitors.(iii) the power to repatriate should continue until the immigranthas been resident here five years, this being the statutory period after which a Commonwealth citizen can exercise his right to be registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and thus become a citizen in the full sense. This registration is the equivalent in the case of a Commonwealth settler to naturalisation after fiveyears residence in the case of an alien (except that the alien has noabsolute right to be naturalised, this being a matter of discretion;whereas the Commonwealth settler has an absolute right to be registered after five years). Up to the time that he is registered,the legal status of an immigrant settler is that of a &quot; British subject and citizen of [e.g., Pakistan, or India, or whatever is theCommonwealth country of his origin] &quot;; or, in some cases, &quot; a british subject without citizenship &quot;, (i.e., of any particular commonwealth country). Once he has become registered, the power to repatriateshould no longer be exercisable against him, even if he originallyobtained entry intd the country by a blatant fraud after five yearsbygones should be allowed to remain bygones.CONFIDENTIAL5872 a 2
(iv) So far as appeal against a repatriation order is concerned,the Commonwealth immigrant should have the same facilities as areavailable in like case to aliens that is to say, if he has been lawfullyresident here for more than two years he should be able to make representations to the Chief Magistrate (except when a question of security is involved, or when a Criminal Court has recommendeddeportation). The Chief Magistrate may uphold or disagree with theHome Secretary&apos;s decision to repatriate or deport; but the HomeSecretary is not bound by the Chief Magistrate^ view though it isonly in very rare cases that he does not give effect to the ChiefMagistrate^ decision. For purposes of administration I would greatlyprefer that there should be no recourse to the Chief Magistrate whenthe repatriation is on the ground of breach of conditions of landing.Conditions, including condition as to registration6. The Mountbatten Report recommended that there shouldbe a general power given to the Home Secretary to impose conditions,and I am given to understand that it was the clear intention of thereport that the conditions would include a condition that the person concerned should register with the police and furnish them with aphotograph. It was recommended in the report that the power toimpose conditions (at any rate as to registration) should be sparinglyused; but it was pointed out in the report that it would be appropriate for the Immigration Officer to impose conditions when he entertainedsuspicions about the bona fides of the entrant, but not suspicionssufficiently strong to justify the refusal of entry.I am convinced that we need a power to impose conditions,including a requirement that the entrant should register with thepolice, and supply a photograph; but I also accept that the powerto require a would-be entrant to register should be sparingly used,and that a requirement to register should in general only be imposed in cases such as mentioned above, namely when the immigration officer suspected the entrant but not strongly enough to refuse himentry. Without the power, I would be obliged to concede if questionedthat I could make little impact on the scale of evasion, because therewould be precious little chance of keeping track of or finding theevader, even if I could repatriate him when found. Even with thepower to require registration, I could often not prevent thedetermined evader from slipping through the net; but there wouldbe a much better chance of doing so. If I had the power, theapparently bona fide visitor would as now pass through the immigration barrier without particulars being taken by the immigration Officer. For example the apparently genuine Indianbusiness man would be treated exactly as at present. The immigration officer would look at his passport, stamp it for, say, a six months&apos;visit, put a tick in the appropriate part of the &quot; cage &quot; to record thatan Indian visitor had passed the barrier, no entry would be madein the &quot; traffic index &quot; at Holborn, and when the same man passed through the barrier on his way back to India, the Immigration Officerwould simply again put a tick in the &quot; cage &quot; to show that an Indianhad left the United Kingdom. If, however, the Immigration Officer
entertained suspicions about a would-be entrant, he naturally couldrefuse him entry. To refuse entry might seem harsh if the immigration Officer had only a &quot; hunch &quot; based on no very solidevidence. The Immigration Officer would in such a case (it mightbe one in ten or one in fifty) take full particulars about him, stamphis passport (if he were a visitor) for a visit of three months or less,and allow him entry for three months on condition he went straightto the police nearest to his address, and registered, depositing as soonas possible a photograph. The police in question would be notifiedand particulars of the entrant carded into the traffic index. If theentrant did not register, it would be possible to search for him atonce. As I stated earlier, the determined entrant might well evadethe control, but there would be much more chance of finding himif a search started at once than if three months had gone by and it only then became apparent, because the traffix index did not showhe had departed, that he was an evader. I am advised that with this power, Immigration Officers with their &quot; nose &quot; for the evader could make a significant impact on the present scale of evasion.Indeed the power to require registration may be of advantage to many would-be entrants. It might be necessary for the HomeSecretary in order to reduce the scale of evasion to directImmigration Officers to refuse entry even if they have no more thana &quot; hunch &quot;. I should be reluctant to give such a direction, but if thefigures of net intake increase, as they are at present, a HomeSecretary may well feel he has no alternative. This might well causehardship in the case of persons who may appear suspicious, butare really perfectly genuine. I accordingly regard the power asindispensable. In my view it should be exercisable in the case ofentrants of all types, because fraudulent entry is not confined toany category of entry. For instance fraudulent entry by bogusdependants is not at all uncommon.Apart from special conditions as to registration, the general power to impose conditions would naturally be used for the purposeof prescribing, for example, the length of the period of stay in thecase of a visitor and requiring that he should follow a particular course of study in the case of a student, and so on. Naturally insuch cases the condition would be imposed in the case of all visitorsand students, not only those with regard to whom the immigration officer entertained a suspicion.7. Apart from the general powers above mentioned, I wouldmention the following changes which I think of great importance inthe case of individual categories of entrant.A.   Dependants(i) Apart from wives and children under 16 who are undersection 2 of the Act entitled to entry, it has been the practice of theHome Office to admit as a matter of discretion other dependants,for example, children between 16 and 18 accompanying or joiningtheir parents. The Mountbatten Report recommends that this practice should cease, although the Home Secretary should still
admit &quot; non-entitled&quot; dependants in exceptional cases when hethought there was special compassionate grounds. I entirely agreewith this.(ii) As I stated earlier, I think we would be in breach of faithif we did not allow entry to the &quot; half-million &quot; entitled dependants of existing settlers. Under section 2 of the Act however we are onlybound to allow such entry to persons who &quot; satisfy&quot; the immigration Officer that they are in fact the dependants they claimto be. It does not seem to me to be inconsistent with our obligation,to make it clear that we will require compliance in advance withcertain steps we think necessary to enable our Immigration officers to check on the identity of those arriving. For example, as hasalready been proposed we could make it a requirement that anysettler should by a certain date (in time to enable us to check) state to the immigration control or to our High Commissions overseas,as the case may be, particulars of the dependants he will in due course wish to bring to this country or by whom he will be accompanied on arrival and deposit identity documents andphotographs supporting the particulars he gives. It would be made clear that ordinarily dependants will not be admitted unless therehas been compliance in advance with such requirements. other methods of checking may as circumstances dictate also be found tobe worthwhile and could also be imposed, provided that they arein no sense oppressive and are completely non-discriminatory asbetween coloured, white and alien immigrants.B. VisitorsThe report recommended that, in order that Commonwealthvisitors should receive more favourable treatment than aliens, a bonafide Commonwealth visitor should be admitted for six months. an alien is only admitted for three months and if he is allowed to staylonger is required to register. I agree to this.C. StudentsThe report recommends that their High Commissions should be encouraged to vouch for them. This would be not unuseful so faras it goes; but it will have little application in the case of the studentwho decides after being admitted, either immediately or after aperiod of time to give up his studies. At present students are admittedin the first place for one year, and their position is then reviewed. Iwould propose to continue this practice.I think consideration should be given to amending section 2 ofthe Act to provide for a more limited definition of the kind of educational establishment for which students can be admitted.Establishments which for example train hairdressers, are, I shouldhave thought, not the kind of educational establishments envisaged in the Act; but they have in fact been used to secure entry for a would-be student at such an establishment.
D.   Voucher holdersI would support the recommendation in the report that theyshould be able to speak English.8. There is I think little reason to preserve the statutory rightto enter of the visitor who can maintain himself from his own resources. Surely his right should be discretionary as in the case ofother visitors. Few in fact are. involved.9. The above requirements I think are necessary from theHome Office departmental point of view, if any real impact is to bemade in reducing the present-day scale of evasion.F.
