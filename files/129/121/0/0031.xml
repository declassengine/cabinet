(65) 81 Copy No.      0 08th June, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMESMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs must draw the attention of my colleagues to the intensification of pressure on incomes and prices since I last reported on thesematters three months ago (C. (65) 30).Prices2. In April 1965 the retail price index for all items was-6 per cent higher than a year earlier; wholesale prices rose byabout 5 per cent over the same period. About 2\ per cent of theincrease in retail prices was attributable to increases in taxation,leaving a rise of about 3 per cent attributable to other factors. In thefirst four months of this year retail prices rose by about 2\ per cent,of which about half was attributable to the Budget. In March Iforecast a rise of 4 per cent in the retail price index for 1965 as awhole; the latest forecast is 4  to 5 per cent.Incomes3. The latest figures of wage settlements show that the average rate of increase in hourly wage rates has been rising and the interval between settlements has been falling steadily from 15 months inthe first quarter of 1964 to 11 months in the first quarter of 1965.The annual average rate of increase in wage rates during the first quarter of 1965 was 5-9 per cent, compared with 4-5 per cent for1964 as a whole (and in the first quarter of 1964). The average rateof increase was lower in settlements reported from the public sectorthan those reported from the private sector, but settlements followedeach other faster in the public sector than in the private sector, withthe result that the annual average rate of increase was about thesame in both sectors. Weekly wage earnings increased during 1964at an annual rate of between 8 and 9 per cent (compared withbetween 3 and 4 per cent during 1962 and the first part of 1963). Wemust expect an even higher rate this year.4. After a steep rise in 1963 aggregate company profits rose by per cent in 1964: the rate of increase was slowing down in the lasttwo quarters. The trend of dividend payments was if anything slightlydownward from the. middle of 1962 to the middle of 1964, but in thelast quarter of 1964 there seems to have been a rise of over 10 percent, despite the relative stability in profits. This rise was no doubt5786
partly attributable to&quot; injticipaitioh of the introduction of the capital gains tax.Prospects and policies5. On prices, the index figures do not yet reflect last month&apos;sincreasesin postal charges, nor of course the increase in the; televisionlicence fee and in the price of milk that have been announced but will not come into effect until later in the year. An increase in coal prices cannot be deferred indefinitely, and we must expect widespreadincreases in bus fares in the coming months. On incomes, the outstanding recent developments in the private sector have been thesettlement for printers, which I have referred to the National board for Prices and Incomes, and recommendations by a committee of inquiry for increases representing an annual rate of 5-j per cent forcompany busmen. The Ministerial Sub-Committee oh Prices and incomes have been considering a complicated series of leap-froggingclaims in the iron and steel industry, which may well have to bereferred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes. We facemajor claims in the public sector: for day wage men in the coalmining industry, for London busmen, for atomic energy workers and later in the year for railwaymen. There is a dispute on the pay and allowances of white-collar workers in the electricity supply industry, and there is a claim to reopen a three year agreement for white-collar workers in local authority employment.6. There is no doubt that the movements of prices and incomes and the success of our policy are carefully watched overseas andhave an important bearing on confidence. If the rise in prices and incomes gets out of hand, it may do irretrievable damage to our prospects of achieving the growth objectives of the plan. We havenow completed the process of introducing our prices and incomes policy: the criteria have been laid down and the National Board isat work. The time has come when we must be seen to mean business.7. Though the recent increases in the pay of postmen may havebeen justified in themselves, they have been widely interpreted asflouting incomes policy and are quoted as a precedent by everygroup, inside and outside the public sector, seeking to obtainincreases above the norm. I do not suggest that we have to insistrigidly on the norm in every case. What is essential is that thereshould be clear evidence that the policy is having an influence in individual cases. This is just as important in the public as in theprivate sector. This is going to mean difficult decisions for all ofthose Ministers who have responsibilities for determining orapproving increases of prices, wages or salaries in the public sector;but failure to take the right decisions on these matters could wellmean that we should all be faced with even more unpleasantdecisions over a wider area later on. I ask for my colleagues&apos;understanding and support when I have to urge these difficultdecisions upon them.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,3rd June, 1965.
