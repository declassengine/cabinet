C.(65) S3Uth June, 1965ROAD TRANSPORT:   REPORT OF GEDDES COMMITTEEON CARRIERS&apos; LICENSINGMemorandum by the Minister of transport i seek the agreement of my colleagues to the terms of the state-ment at Annex A which I would propose to make on publication shortlyof the Report of the Geddes Committee on Carriers&apos; Licensing.2.       The Committee was appointed by the previous Administration inOctober, 1963, with terms of reference &quot;In the light of present day con-ditions, tc examine the operation and effects of the system of carriers&apos;licences first introduced by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, and assubsequently modified by statute;  and to make recommendations&quot;.The system of carriers&apos; licences is that operated under the Road traffic act by the Area Licensing Authorities for granting A licences (for public carriers), 3 licences (for traders carrying other people&apos;s goodsas well as their own) and C licences (for manufacturers and traderscarrying goods on their own account only),    A copy of the Committee&apos;sReport is attached at Annex E.3.       The Committee set out (in Appendix 3 of their Report) the mainstatistics of the scale and nature of road transport operations.    Corn-pared with the position in the early 1950&apos;s road transport has shown avery large increase and in terms of ton mileage is now carrying muchmore traffic than the railways.4.       The Committee&apos;s findings and recommendations are convenientlysummarised in Chapter I of the Report.    Briefly, their main conclusion is that the licensing system as at present constituted fails to achieveany of the objects which may be regarded as relevant objectives ofGovernment policy, namely promotion of public safety, promotion of efficiency in road transport operations, reduction of harmful effects onamenity and environment, promotion of increased use of rail facilities and reduction or control of congestion,,    The Committee see no meritin the operation of quantitative controls or restrictions on use of road transport and recommend abolition, in the interests of greater efficiency, of restrictions on the capacity of the road haulage industryand on the work for which a lorry may be used, introduction of a systemof permits to ply as a carrier of goods to enforce safety requirementsmore vigorously and the use of measures other than quantitativelicensing to pursue Governmental aims of transport policy,5.       The Committee have thus limited their task to considering the effectiveness of a quantitative licensing system, as a tool of policy.They have not taken co-ordination of transport as one of the aims-1-secretn,COPY NO.50CABINETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

against which they judge licensing, because they see it as the synthesisof the ether aims enumerated.    They also see co-ordination as usuallytaking the form in practice of adjustment of the road/rail balance, butthey do not offer any view on what the balance should be, or whetherthe existing balance is right or, if not, in which direction it should be altered or on what principles.    The Report, therefore, leaves completelyopen to Government further pursuit of the aim of co-ordination.6.       In this situation, it is clearly not possible to pronounce for or against the Geddes recommendations.    On the one hand, they arguemuch sound sense against a system which fails now to achieve thepurposes for which it was (30 years ago) set up;  on the other hand,they offer no guidance on how to achieve the right balance of investmentbetween road and rail, to remedy the lack of co-ordination at the operational level and to secure the right pattern of organisation.    in short they offer no specific alternative to licensing nor were they required to do so.    They may well be right in their estimate of theineffectiveness of the present system of licensing to achieve moderntransport policies.    But clearly we cannot commit ourselves to sweepingaway that system until we know more confidently than we yet do what should be put in its place or whether, indeed, it might be retained butmodified.    In this sense I think we can publicly justify suspendingjudgment on the main Geddes recommendation by -(i)  accepting that powerful criticisms of the present system havebeen made;(ii)  restating our belief that total lack of control over goods trans-port is quite unsxceptable;(iii)  and. emphasising that until we are in a position to devise analternative, whether by licensing or Otherwise, more appro-priate to the needs of the 1960&apos;s than the system devised in the1930&apos;s, we do not propose to abolish that system, but neither dowe endorse it.7.       It is clear that some regulation of road transport is essential, butwe ca.n only determine the precise form it should take when we have completed the studies on means of achieving co-ordination of transportwhich are in hand (including those being carried out by Lord Hinton, theprogress of which I will explain when we meet).    I am now engaged inthe preparation of a draft White Paper showing, for the information ofmy colleagues, the progress being made in transport policy and the kindof work that still needs to be done.    It may be useful to publish such a paper.    Meanwhile I propose publication of the Geddes Report as soonas practicable (I have already announced that I hope to publish it by theend of June),   and seek the agreement of my colleagues to my proposed statement.T  T?Ministry of Transport, 8.

ANNEX ADRAFT STATEMENTGEDDES REPORT ON CARRIERS&apos; LICENSINGWith permission, I wish to inform the House that the -Report ofthe Committee of Carriers&apos; Licensing, under the chairmanship of LordGeddes, which was appointed by the previous Administration, is being published today.    Copies will be available immediately in the VoteOffice and from H.M. Stationery Office.The Committee say, in brief, that the present system of licensing does not secure any existing or conceivable aims of transport policy.    They consequently recommend abolition of all quantitativelicensing restrictions on the capacity of the road haulage industry andon the work for which lorries may be used.They positively recommend the introduction, in the interests of safety, of a system of permits to ply as a carrier of goods;  a.nd of asystem of carriers&apos; permit identification plates, liable to forfeit.For other aims of Government policy they suggest that measuresdifferent from the present quantitative licensing system should be examined.The Committee thus make it clear that they were concerned withthe effectiveness of the present licensing system as a tool of policy and -quite properly - did not think it within their terms of reference tosuggest either what the aims of transport policy should be or v/hatmight be the alternative methods of accomplishing them.For my part, I believe that total absence of regulation overroad goods transport is quite unacceptable.    I certainly accept that the geddes Committee have shown that in many respects the presentlicensing system provides ineffective regulation.    But whether thissystem can be brought up-to-date or whether it must be abolished and replaced by something different, I am not yet prepared to judge.The Government has in hand studies into the means whereby andthe extent to which the transport of goods and passengers can best become-ordinated and developed in the national interest.    These studieswill take full account of the Geddes Committee1 s conclusions andrecommendations.    Until the studies are completed, I cannot say whether the Commit tee&apos;s recommendations will prove acceptable ornot.    Meanwhile, I shall welcome views on the Report of Members ofthe House and of interested organisations.I wish to take this further opportunity of expressing to LordGeddes and his colleagues my appreciation of the hard work and devotionwhich they brought to their task.Of one thing I am certain - the nation cannot afford a completelyunregulated, unco-ordinated road and rail transport system;  if we agree that the present licensing system is inadequate for the purpose,other means must be found.

COMMITTEE ON CARRIERS&apos; LICENSINGReportTo the Rt. Hon. Tom Fraser, M.P.,Minister of TransportIntroduction0.1 We were appointed by your predecessor the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples,M.P., on the 18th October, 1963 with terms of reference:&quot; In the light of present day conditions, to examine the operation andeffects of the system of carriers&apos; licences first introduced by the Road and rail Traffic Act 1933, and as subsequently modified by statute; and to make recommendations.&quot;We now have the honour to submit our Report.0.2 Following our appointment we issued a general invitation to interested parties to let us have evidence in the form of memoranda. In addition we wrote to 165 persons and organisations whom we thought to have a special interest incarriers&apos; licensing, explicitly to draw their attention to our task and to the generalinvitation we had issued.0.3 We received written evidence from 173 Associations and individuals,singly or in combination, some of whom amplified their evidence in further sub-missions in response to our enquiries, so that in all we received 168 memoranda.28 organisations and individuals accepted our invitation to give oral evidence.A list of those who have given evidence is attached at Appendix A of this report.0.4 We wish to express to all these many people our appreciation of the helpthey gave us in our task. All had clearly given careful thought to the views theyput before us, and many must have spent much time and effort in preparation.Since the views of some conflicted directly with those of others, we have in-inevitably not been able to endorse them all, but aii have found a place in ourstudies. The thoroughness, courtesy and patience we met throughout our taskhave been a great help, and we are most grateful to everyone concerned.0.5 We met on 25 days in all, of which 14 were devoted in whole or in part tothe hearing of oral evidence. Variously we attended public inquiries held byLicensing Authorities into applications for carriers&apos; licences, hearings on appealbefore the Transport Tribunal and roadside checks by your Department on the mechanical fitness of goods vehicles.0.6 We have been most excellently served by our Secretary, Mr. J. M. Moore,D.S.C. We have received collectively and individually from him a much higher
degree of assistance than we had a right to expect. His experience has been ofbutstanding benefit in unravelling the many technicalities with which we were faced. He has skilfully kept our work well ordered, and our Agenda logical and well organised. His contribution to the drafting of the Report has been of theutmost value. Our thanks are due beyond measure to Mr. Moore.0.7 He has been most capably supported by Mr. A. J. Rdsenfeld and in turnby Messrs. J. W. Baker, J. R. Fells, P.R. Caswell and D.O. McCreadie; and wehave all been much indebted to Mr. P. J. Reed, M.B.E. and Miss M. S. Hickey,who have untiringly seen to our papers and other needs. To all of them weexpress our gratitude.General Approach0.8 Our terms of reference were perhaps deceptively concise. At first readingthey might seem to suggest that our task was narrow and that we should be concerned only with the details of the present licensing system and its operation.As Chapter 13 below will show, certainly enough points were put to us in evi-dence, both orally and in writing, dealing exclusively with such matters, toprovide us with material for an extensive detailed review of the system.0.9 We had no hesitation in deciding that a limited approach would be wrong,and that we had to take a wider view. Your predecessor indicated in the Houseof Commons, in announcing his intention to put our work in hand, that theCommittee&apos;s task would be &quot; to re-examine the fundamental bases and workingof the licensing system &quot;* (a statement to which we drew attention in invitingevidence). Clearly we could not carry out this remit without considering theprinciples underlying the licensing system. And even without this guidance, itsoon became clear to us that we would have to examine the licensing system interms of its original aims and of other objectives which we thought that govern-ment might wish to consider. Only thus would we be able to give you our viewson how it has worked, and how, if at all, it should be changed.0.10 We have therefore tried to address ourselves widely to the problems put before us. These problems proceed almost infinitely onwards one from another in ever-widening scale and implication. Hard though it is to draw a boundary,we have thought it right not to pursue matters whose direct connection withlicensing was somewhat tenuous. Some problems we considered to be outsideour terms of reference yet well within the field of general transport policy. Insuch cases we have felt it right to draw attention to relevant considerations thatwe have encountered in the course of our enquiries and study and to say howlicensing might bear upon them. We have not, however, attempted completestatements of these problems or comprehensive analyses of possible solutions.It is thus that we have nothing to say as to the extent of public ownership of road transport of goods. We make no recommendations as to where lies theappropriate balance of social and economic advantage between road and rail.Nor explicitly do we discuss the precise nature and degree of co-ordination,integration or similar joint working between forms of transport which ought toprevail. All these matters, we felt, involved considerations of general transport policy on which it was not for us to proffer views.*House of Commons Official Report, 29th April, 1963 Col. 739.2
1Glossary0.11 It is convenient to explain here our use throughout this report of certainwords as terms of art:&quot; lorry &quot;&quot; heavy &quot; lorries&quot; hire or reward &quot;&quot; own account&quot;&quot; road haulage &quot;or &quot; road hauliersoperatoras meaning any road vehicle constructed or adapted for the carriage of goods (and therefore includingvans and many specialised vehicles);as meaning those weighing more than three tonsunladen;to denote carriage of goods for others (i.e. under acarriers&apos; A, A Contract or B licence) as opposed toto denote carriage of goods solely in connection withthe trade or business of the owner of the vehicle (i.e.under a carriers C licence);as applying solely to the carriage or haulage of goods for hire or reward (and not therefore includingcarriage or haulage &quot; on own account&quot;);as applying to any holder of a carriers licence.
CHAPTER summary, Conclusions andRecommendations1.1 In Chapters 2, 3 and 4 we set out briefly the history of the system ofcarriers&apos; licensing and its present form, we survey the industry operating under that system and we review the way some other countries regulate theroad transport of goods. The most important points in this part of our Reportcan be summarised as follows:(i) The present system of licensing, after 30 years of evolution, is now an elaborate process of regulation of what lorries may carry, and provides a sanction (albeit little used) against the unsafe use of the roads bylorry operators.   (Paragraphs 2.1-2.55)(ii) Circumstances have changed profoundly since the introduction of licensing. Lorries are now the main means of carrying goods in thiscountry.   (Paragraph 2.2)(iii) Most of the work is done by roughly 325,000 heavy lorries.   (Paragraph3.2)(iv) C licensed vehicles account for nearly half the work done by heavylorries.   (Paragraph 3.14)(v) Lorry traffic has grown in recent years mainly because the industries which find road transport best for their needs have grown relatively tothose industries for which rail is the best form of transport. (paragraphs.17-3.19)(vi) There was no evidence that users are dissatisfied with the services ofthe road haulage industry.   (Paragraph 3.26)(vii) The rate of bankruptcy in road haulage is not unduly high, and doesnot suggest any serious lack of stability in the industry. (paragraphs.27-3.37)(viii) Although local circumstances vary widely and in important basicrespects, most foreign countries regulate road transport of goodsfairly closely.  (Paragraphs 4.1-4.17)(ix) But in the few cases where there is little restriction, this seems to have brought benefits, without any dire consequences. (Paragraphs 4.18-4.19and 4.23-4.28)1.2 In Chapters 5-13 we examine the licensing system against the aims ofpolicy which we think government might have as regards road transport ofgoods. We also look at the question of C licensed operation and of track costs,and set out some of the many detailed proposals made to us for reform of thepresent system. Our main conclusions on these matters can be summarised asfollows:
possible aims of policy(i) The main possible objectives of government policy in regulating road transport of goods are:the promotion of the safety of the public;the promotion of efficiency in road transport operations;the reduction of any harmful effects of road transport on amenityand environment;the promotion of increased use of available rail facilities for ihemovement of goods;the reduction or control of congestion on the roads. (paragraphs.3-5.8)(ii) The consideration of licensing in terms of these five objectives make sit unnecessary for us to consider co-ordination of transport as a separateobjective of transport policy.   (Paragraphs 5.9-5.11)licensing and safety(iii) Licensing has not had any significant bearing on road safety. (Para-graphs 6.15-6.32)(iv) No practicable system of quantity control can achieve greater safety.(Paragraph 6.33)(v) A revocable permit to carry goods can have a vital place as a disciplinarymeasure.   (Paragraphs 6.37-6.38)(vi) Removal of a conspicuous permit plate from any lorry whose ovvncr&apos;spermit has been revoked or which has been found on the road in badrepair or overloaded can provide a simple means of enforcing revocationof a permit and a ready and effective deterrent to these offences.(Paragraphs 6.39-6.40)(vii) Action can with advantage be increased to detect and punish offences against safety.   (Paragraphs 6.48-6.52)licensing and efficiency(viii) The restrictions imposed by licensing reduce efficiency, and licensing asa whole offers no off-setting advantages in this field. (Paragraphs 7.10-7.14)licensing and amenity(ix) Quantity control by licensing cannot usefully check the potential oflorries for nuisance, which is best met by attacking the causes of the noise and smoke they make.   (Paragraphs 8.6-8.10)licensing and the railways(x) It is for government to decide whether steps should be taken to increasethe carriage of goods by rail relative to their carriage by road; in sodeciding, it would be important to balance the possible gains against possible losses.   (Paragraphs 9.2-9.3)(xi) Licensing has not in recent years helped the railways. (Paragraphs9.6-9.12)
(xii) It cannot be made to do so without an inordinately large and complexadministrative machine and without placing a heavy burden on industryand trade.   (Paragraphs 9.13-9.32)(xiii) If the policy was to divert goods traffic from road to rail, taxation oflorries and preferably the increasing of the attractions of rail service arelikely to be more efficient instruments than any attempt to use licensing.(Paragraphs 9.38-9.41 and 9.48-9.50)licensing and congestion&apos;(xiv) Licensing has not been and cannot be a useful way of reducing orcontrolling road congestion.   (Paragraphs 10.18-10.24)own account operation(xv) There is little inefficiency in C licensed operation, and what there is can best be reduced by allowing traders and manufactures to use theirlorries free of restriction as to what they may carry. (Paragraphs11.3-11.11 and 11.23)track costs(xvi) We cannot give a final answer to the question of track costs.

(Paragraphs13.1-13.2)(xix) The number of these proposals suggest that the present system is a longway from satisfying even those who agree with its present basis.(Paragraph 13.38)(xx) The proposals also show the complexity of the apparatus of licensingwhich has grown up.   (Paragraph 13.38).General Conclusion as to Present System of Licensing1.3 Neither the present system of licensing nor any variant of it based oncontrol of the number of lorries and restriction of what lorries may carry offersa useful way to achieve what we think might be the main aims of government policy in regulating carriage of goods by road. In three respects such licensingacts adversely. It reduces efficiency. It tends to confer positions of privilege.And it tends to add to congestion on the roads.recommendations.4 We therefore recommend:(i) The abolition of all restrictions on the capacity of the road haulage industryand on the work for which a lorry may be used. There should be no
statutory bar to entry to the hire or reward sector of the road transport industry. Traders and manufacturers should be allowed to use theirown vehicles for any work they choose to undertake, including carriagefor hire or reward.(ii) The introduction of a system of permits to ply as a carrier of goods(whether for hire or reward or on own account or both). These permitsshould be available on demand, but held subject to good behaviour asregards all aspects of safety of lorries. The issuing authority shouldhave power to suspend, revoke, or curtail any permit for offences against lorry safety or for failure to comply with prescribed standards in this field. This power should be used vigorously.(iii) The introduction of a system of carriers&apos; permit plates, one to each lorry.The plate would be forfeit during any period of suspension, revocationor curtailment of the owner&apos;s permit to ply and would be summarilyremoved from any lorry found to be mechanically defective or over-loaded.(iv) The use of measures other than the present licensing system to pursue anyfurther aims of policy which the government might have.1.5 We believe that our first recommendation will commend itself to most people outside the road transport industry. We are also aware that it may be looked on with apprehension by some road hauliers, who may be fearful of theloss of the protection which the present system affords them. But wc think thatefficient and enterprising operators have nothing to fear, and indeed much to gain from the removal of the irksome restriction about which many of themcomplained to us. We are sure they would find after a little experience that forthem, as for the country generally, the change had been for the better.
CHAPTER 2History and Present Form of the licensing System(i)   HistoryThe Background to Licensing2.1 The present system of carriers&apos; licensing derives its statutory authority from the Road Traffic Act 1960, which is a consolidation of previous measures.The main framework of the system was first established over 30 years ago, bythe Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933. This framework has been modified in minordegree by subsequent Acts of Parliament, and the application of some of itsprinciples has been slowly transmuted by process of case law. But, in essence,the system has stood unchanged for 30 years.2.2 It is to be noted that this durability cannot have been because of thepermanence of the basic circumstances which led to licensing. These circum-stances have changed profoundly. Up to 1933 the railways were the main carriersof goods and were subject to strict controls. Road transport, carrying a relatively small proportion of the country&apos;s goods traffic, was free from almost any obli-gation or limitation. Now the railways enjoy almost complete commercialfreedom, but carry only the lesser share of the traffic, while road transport, the predominant carrier, is hedged around with restrictions, though not withobligations.Conditions before Licensing2.3 In 1921, the railway companies were required by the Railway Act of thatyear to revise their charges scheme. It took until 1928 to bring the new schedulesinto effect. The schedules were simpler than those they replaced, but were stillbased on the principle of charging what the traffic could stand. The charge was thus in part decided by the basic value of the goods concerned. Low priced rawmaterials were carried at low freight rates, regardless of the cost to the railwaysof doing the work. The schedules were designed to secure equity between traders,uniformity as between one place of consignment and another and as between onetransaction and another. Against the old background of railway monopoly thearrangements seemed appropriate. Yet in this very period while the new railwayschedules were being produced, the railways&apos; virtual monopoly of all but short distance freight was being attacked for the first time. The new schedules made it more difficult for them to meet the commercial challenge. With charges related to the value of the goods carried rather than to the cost of carrying them, withan obligation not to discriminate in their charges to similar users, and with acommon carrier obligation to boot, the railways were extremely vulnerable tothe aggressive and fast developing road transport industry.
2.4 The end of the First World War released on to the roads many motor vehicles for use, virtually without restriction, as commercial goods vehicles.Road hauliers needed little capital and their unit of operation was extremelyflexible. They were able to provide a personal and direct service and, at the sametime, to relate charges closely to the cost of the individual load and journey. As-a result, the railways tended to lose to road their more valuable traffics (i.e. those where the profit margin was greatest) and to be left with low value traffics oftencarried at a substantial loss. In these circumstances, the small haulier could and did flourish.2.5 There can be no doubt that, at the same time as it made its first serious-inroads into rail freight, the road transport industry earned a bad name for theoverdriving of both men and machines in a fiercely competitive situation. It hasalso been strongly argued, both at the time and more recently, that this periodof free competition resulted in excessive rate cutting, financial anarchy andinstability damaging to the industry and so to its customers. It is particularly difficult to judge the extent to which these claims were justified. Some evidence we have received suggests that the position may not have been so bad as hassometimes been maintained. Because of the relevance of the point to our work,we sought out specially the recollections of some of the people who had directexperience of road haulage before licensing was introduced. While their viewsdiffered, we gained the impression that competition did not prevent transportusers from getting a reliable service from road hauliers. No doubt many smalloperators got into financial difficulties, particularly when rates were generallylow in the depression years. But in the circumstances of the times it would perhaps have been surprising if this had not been so. Work done by ProfessorWalters of Birmingham University in 1958 suggested that the bankruptcy rateamong hauliers before licensing was introduced was lower than in some other trades consisting largely of small men, and that it declined from the level in theimmediate post-war years in spite of the depression. This tends to support theview that the troubles of the industry may have loomed larger than was strictlyjustified. They were perhaps the natural growing pains of a new industry made up mainly of small operators, rather than the malaise of a chronically over-competitive situation.2.6 Nevertheless, the view was widely held in the late 1920&apos;s that:(i) in the interest of safety and amenity, some controls would have to be imposed on the road haulage industry, and(ii) that the greater commercial freedom enjoyed by road as compared withrail would lead to an inequitable and uneconomic distribution of good as between road and rail.Royal Commission on Transport2.7 To examine this situation a Royal Commission on Transport wasappointed in 1928:&quot; To take into consideration the problems arising out of the growth of road traffic, and with a view to securing the employment of the available meansof transport in Great Britain (including transport by sea, coastwise and byferries) to the greatest public advantage, to consider and report what
measures if any, should be adopted for their better regulation and control,and, so far as desirable in the public interest, to promote their co-ordinatedworking and development&quot;.The Commission resolved its task into three distinct spheres:(i) that concerning the free and easy movement of motorised vehicles onthe roads and their control, mainly from the point of view of safety;(ii) that concerning the licensing of public service vehicles and the co-ordination of the various forms of passenger transport; and(iii) that concerning the general co-ordination and development of all available means of transport, taking particularly into account the rapid growth of road haulage.Three separate reports were issued dealing with each of these aspects in turn.The first and second were the genesis of the Road Traffic Act 1930, in which public service vehicle licensing was introduced. The Act also embraced speedlimits, driving licences, vehicle lighting, maximum weights and dimensions,construction and use of vehicles, and compulsory insurance, and placed limit-ations on the hours of drivers of commercial vehicles.2.8 Control of goods vehicles was considered in the third report. The reportcontained, inter alia, the following recommendations:(i) that heavy goods vehicles (over 4 tons unladen weight) should payconsiderably more duty for each successive extra ton weight, as a meansof discouraging the use of heavy vehicles and of protecting the railwaysfrom further loss of traffic, in the national interest;(ii) that road haulage should be licensed so as to put the industry on to an organised basis and as an essential precedent to any attempt to co-ordinate transport generally; and(iii) that it should be a condition of issue of carriers&apos; licences that theauthorising Traffic Commissioners should have regard to the fitness ofthe vehicle concerned and the wages and conditions of employees of theapplicant for a licence.Salter conference.9 These recommendations were not immediately implemented. In April1932, the Minister of Transport convened a Conference of railway and road haulage representatives under the independent chairmanship of Sir ArthurSaltcr (now Lord Salter) to consider:(a) the incidence of highway costs in relation to the contribution of thedifferent classes of mechanically propelled vehicles;(b) the nature and extent of the regulations which, in view of moderneconomic developments, should be applied to goods transport by road and rail, and(c) in general, any measures which might assist the rail and road industries to &quot; carry out their functions under equitable conditions, whichadequately safeguard the interests of trade and industry &quot;.
2.10 The Conference Report stated:&quot; in our recommendations we can only offer an alleviation of one of theprincipal causes of (railway) loss, by dealing with any existing unfairness inthe incidence of highway costs and inadequacy of the regulations to protect the public and other users of the roads against undesirable forms of road traffic by goods vehicles &quot;.2.11 The Conference did not seem unduly worried about the handicap of therailways in being tied to ad valorem charging schemes. They said:&quot; it is the fact that the railways are so organised (in large units) and not theexistence of statutory regulation, which mainly accounts for the handicapof the railways in this respect &quot;.In his most helpful oral evidence to us, Lord Salter drew on his remarkablememory to add that in any event, drastic departure from the old railway pattern of rates would have been unthinkable when so much of industry had been located on the expectation of those rates. An abrupt change to rates based onthe costs of each movement would have been disastrous.2.12 As to highway costs, the Conference worked out, from information to hand and by some rough and ready estimating, a detailed scheme of taxationfor road vehicles which, when taken together with fuel tax, would in theirestimation fairly meet the track costs of road goods vehicles. The exercise in-volved working out the total annual &quot;cost &quot; for roads; deciding the share ofthis cost appropriate to goods vehicles; and calculating tax rates for each classof goods vehicle, according to the cost it imposed, so as to bring in the revenue to cover that cost. With the statistical and other information available at thetime, some of the data had to be estimated, with little to go on. But nobody elsewas in a position to do better. The Conference of course recognised that if the basic facts changed the taxes they proposed would have to be recalculated to reflect the new circumstances.2.13 Both the Royal Commission on Transport and the Salter Conferenceregarded the establishment of satisfactory working conditions in road haulageand better maintenance of vehicles as compelling arguments for some kind of licensing. Paragraph 99 of the Salter Conference Report says:&quot; we agree without hesitation that all such vehicles should be required tohave licences which are conditional. . . also upon the observance of properconditions as to fair wages and conditions of service, and the maintenanceof vehicles in a state of fitness &quot;.They recognised implicitly however (see paragraph 2.14 below) that the attainment of these ends would not necessarily mean limiting the quantity of road transport.2.14 The Salter Conference gave as the main reason for advocating a systemof quantitative restriction of road haulage the evil effects of excessive competi-tion. We cannot do better than to quote at length from the report in order togive an idea of how the balance of advantage was seen by the Conference:&quot; We approach a much more difficult question when we consider whether such a licensing system should be used to deal in any way with what theRoad Haulage Association rightly term the evils of overcrowding and
unbridled competition in the transport industry. It is clear that these evilsexist and that though they will be reduced by the changes in the incidence of highway costs which we propose, they will not be thus entirely removed.Any individual has at present an unlimited right to enter the haulage industry, without any regard to the pressure on the roads or any existingexcess of transport facilities. He is able to purchase his vehicle on theinstalment system and is often tempted to force his way in by offering rates which are completely unremunerative and necessarily lead to bankruptcywhich, nevertheless, does not discourage others or perhaps even himself from following the same course in perpetual succession. This unrestrictedliberty is fatal to the organisation of the industry in a form suitable to acarrier service purporting to serve the public. On the other hand we are equally impressed with the evil of any system which would prevent tradeand industry from securing the form of transport which is adapted to itsever changing needs at the lowest practicable cost that can be obtained on a salutary basis. Every form of transport needs adaptation to the changingrequirements of economic enterprise; and any system which discouragedthis adaptation would obviously be against the public interest&quot;.2.15 To meet the aims of the Conference as to condition of vehicles and ofworking of drivers, and as to competition in road transport, the Conferencerecommended that:(a) all goods vehicle operators should be licensed;(b) the grant of a licence for both public and private carriers should be conditional on the payment of reasonable wages, the observance of proper conditions of service for drivers and an undertaking to maintainthe vehicles properly;(c) a licence should not be granted to a public haulier where it would be against the public interest, that interest being determined in terms of:(i) any excess in the existing transport facilities suitable to meet thepublic requirements to be served by the applicant;(ii) any actual or prospective congestion or over-loading of the roads;(iii) any convictions registered against the applicant or his employeesfor the previous year in respect of offences in connection with hisroad transport vehicles or previous bankruptcy;(d) licences for own account operators should be issued without restriction,but the operators should not be permitted to carry for hire or rewardoutside a radius of 10 miles from base.2.16 In applying for a licence the applicant was to specify the carrying,capacities as well as the registration numbers and unladen weights of the vehicleswhich he wished to have licensed, and these particulars should appear on the vehicle. Licensed vehicles should also carry a plate giving the o\vner&apos;s licencenumber and an individual number for each vehicle.2.17 The Conference also recommended that drivers should be required tokeep records so that the limitation on driving hours could more readily been forced.
2.18 The Conference made few recommendations on the subject of co-ordination between road and rail but expressed the hope that the good relationsbetween road and rail representatives in the Conference might bear fruit in collaboration thereafter with a view to the co-ordination of services between road and rail and in particular the development of combined services making useof containers. They also supported the view of the Royal Commission that it wasnot &quot; in the national interest to encourage further diversion of heavy goodstraffic from the railways to the roads &quot; and recommended that &quot; the Minister ofTransport should obtain powers to prohibit by regulation classes of traffic whichare borne by rail and which having regard to the character of the commodityand the distance together, are unsuitable for road haulage, from being transferredin future to the road &quot;&apos;.Action on the Salter Conference&apos;&apos;s recommendations.19 The Conference^ recommended schedules of excise tax on goods vehicles were put into effect, virtually unaltered, by the Finance Act 1933. the vehicle tax position remains substantially unchanged to this day. The Con-ference&apos;s proposed level of petrol tax was in fact the then prevailing rate, andthis was continued, at Sd. per gallon. As the untaxed retail price of petrol wasthen only about 1 Ud. a gallon, the tax was about 42% of the total price. the cash amount of the fuel tax today is of course much higher (currently 3s. 3d. a gallon) but this is on an untaxed price of Is. 8d. and Is. lOd. per gallon forstandard grade petrol and derv (diesel oil) respectively, or 66% and 64%respectively of the total retail price. It must also be borne in mind that the yieldsfrom both taxes are now much higher, because of the great increase in thenumber of goods vehicles.2.20 The other recommendations of the Conference, as to licensing andconditions in the road haulage industry, were incorporated with few significantchanges (notably the omission of any explicit reference to road congestion or ofany power for the Minister to prohibit road carriage for certain classes of traffic)in the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933. The same Act also gave to the railways acertain measure of freedom to negotiate freight rates with individual traderssubject to the approval of an independent rates tribunal. The Act was thus a deliberate attempt to impose a balance on road/rail competition and thereby onthe distribution of goods between road and rail.2.21 In essence the Act provided for three types of licence: the A licence for public carriers; the B licence for traders carrying the goods of other people aswell as their own; the C licence for manufacturers and traders carrying goods ontheir own account only. In addition, provision was made for a special form ofA licence (the A Contract licence) where there was only one customer, with whom the haulier had a contract for exclusive use of the vehicle for at least ayear. Issue of licences was made the responsibility of Licensing Authorities, whowere at the same time the Chairmen of Traffic Commissioners established underthe 1930 Act to control public service vehicle licensing. In considering the grantof A or B licences, Licensing Authorities were required to have regard, inter alia&quot; to the interests of the public generally, including those of persons requiring,as well as those of persons providing facilities for transport &quot;. They were to take
into account objections, on the grounds that grant would lead to over-provisionof suitable transport, from persons already providing transport facilities. Butgrant of a C licence could only be withheld where the applicant had previouslyhad a licence revoked or suspended. All licences were made conditional on theapplicant satisfying requirements as to the safety, construction and use of vehicles, and as to drivers&apos; hours, the keeping of records and payment of properwages. Provision was made for appeal against the decisions of licensing authorities, to a specially constituted tribunal with status akin to that of theHigh Court.Early Development of the Licensing System, and the War years.22 The licensing system as laid down in the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933came fully into effect in October 1934 (by which date all public haulage vehicleshad to be licensed). As the system got under v/ay, case law in the hearings beforethe Licensing Authorities and the Road and Rail Traffic Appeal Tribunal began to settle a number of important principles of application of the statute. these included the following:(i) &quot; It is not sufficient for the applicant for an A licence to discharge theburden of proving that there are persons ready and willing to employhim. He must also satisfy the Licensing Authority that the haulage he proposes to do cannot for some reason be done by other carriers already engaged in carriage, whether by road or rail &quot;.(Enston and Company v. London, Midland and Scottish RailwayCompany, 1933).(ii) [But] &quot;. . . if the applicant is an operator already established during the basic year it is sufficient to show some expansion in the business of hiscustomers . . .&quot;.(Hawker v. Great Western and London, Midland and Scottish RailwayCompanies, 1935).(iii) &quot; Another suggestion which was in substance made, was that the licensing -ing Authority should make a classification of goods which should in normal circumstances be carried by rail and in normal circumstances byroad. We can find nothing in the Act even to suggest that it is part of theduty of a Licensing Authority to make such a classification &quot;.(Four Amalgamated Railway Companies v. Bouts-Tillotson, 1936).(iv) &quot;. . . that the burden of proving an objection that the applicants haveabstracted traffic from the objectors does not lie on the objectors, butthat it is for the applicants to disprove the objection &quot;.(London, Midland and Scottish, Great Western and London and NorthEastern Railway Companies v. Motor Carriers (Liverpool) Ltd., 1935).(v) &quot; It would not be in the public interest to grant a licence to carry goodshitherto carried by another carrier, provided that the previous carriersfacilities were suitable. The fact that the latter were slower did not render them unsuitable in the absence of evidence that a more expeditiousdelivery was reasonably necessary to the trader &quot;.(H. W. Hawker Ltd. v. Great Western and London, Midland and Scot-tish Railway Companies, 1936).
(vi) &quot; that in considering whether objectors&apos; facilities were suitable licensing Authority ought to take into consideration neither the factthat road rates were cheaper (unless they were uneconomic) nor the factthat warehouse accommodation would be provided . . .&quot;.(London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern RailwayCompanies v. Stevenson Transport Ltd., 1937).(vii) &quot; If the holder of an A licence applies for the authorisation of extravehicles to be normally used for carrying from a particular base, he must first prove a need for these vehicles to carry goods outward from thatbase. If he proves that need, evidence as to return loads may be helpful,though not, strictly speaking, necessary. If he does not prove that need,evidence as to return loads will not support his application &quot;.(Moss Brothers v. Southern Railway Company, 1935).(viii) &quot;. . . the Commissioner must not grant an ordinary A licence forvehicles which would be principally used for the business of a singlecustomer, so that they were gem rally loaded only with the goods of thatcustomer, even though none of the vehicles would ever be used for thepurposes of a contract for the carriage of goods for a year &quot;.(Southern Railway Company v. Hardy and Sons Ltd., Hardy and SonsLtd., v. Southern Railway Company, 1935).(ix) &quot; Where an applicant seeks an A licence for an increased number of vehicles on the ground that particular customers propose to use thosevehicles his proper course is to apply for contract licences under Section7, Sub-Section 1 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act &quot;.(Ridgewell and Company v. Southern Railway Company, 1934).(x) &quot; An applicant who proposes to provide a new type of service, such as a regular daily service, is not bound to satisfy the Licensing Authority thatthe haulage he proposes to do cannot for some reason be done by othercarriers already engaged in carriage, whether by road or rail &quot;.(Smith v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, 1935).(xi) &quot; A coal merchant who is unable to discharge the ordinary burden ofproof should nevertheless be granted a B licence if:(1) his business is genuine;(2) he requires the vehicle for carrying goods in connection with hisown business and these goods cannot satisfactorily be carriedotherwise;(3) taking the year as a whole the vehicle cannot be economicallyoperated unless used during the off season for hire or reward;and providing a special condition be attached preventing him carryingfor hire save during the offseason and preventing wasteful competition &quot;.(Southern Railway Company v. Lambert, 1936).2.23 These principles settled by case law sometimes had an important bearing on the whole course of development. But in its main features the system continuedunchanged up to the outbreak of war in 1939. Its full operation was then formallysuspended to allow a greater freedom of administration more in key with theneeds of the times. But the framework of the system remained. The Licensing
Authorities, under a different title, issued &quot; defence permits &quot;, which were broadly similar to licences, and followed the licence categories; but the pro-cedure for consideration of applications was made simpler. (There were no public hearings or appeals to the Tribunal). Rationing of motor fuel gave anotherstrong Governmental control over road transport. This control was strengthened by the conferment in 1944 upon the Governments Road Haulage Organisation(comprising most of the major long distance road operators, and operating underdirect government orders) of virtually monopoly powers. The main aim of policy was to cut down consumption of fuel oil and rubber, and to this end the use of rail transport was insisted on by the Government to the practical limit.Nationalisation and Denationalisation of Long Distance Road Haulage (TheTransport Acts of 1947 and 1953)2.24 In August 1946 licensing was reintroduced, but the old order did not stand for long. The Transport Act of 1947 put long distance public road haulage,together with the railways and inland waterways, into public ownership underthe British Transport Commission. The Act made little amendment to the car-riers&apos; licensing system itself, but exempted from licensing the Commission^goods vehicles. All &quot; long distance &quot; road haulage concerns, apart from those incertain specialised traffics, were acquired either voluntarily or compulsorily andwere transferred to the management of the Road Haulage Executive of theCommission. (A long distance concern was defined as one more than half of whose operations in 1946 entailed journeys of 40 miles or more during whichthe vehicles went outside a radius of 25 miles from their operating centre). Thetakeover and digestion of the many firms and assets involved inevitably tooktime and drew on much of the resources of the Commission and the Executive.The processes of acquisition were not really completed until 1951. So during thisperiod not much experience was gained of the workings of the operational systemenvisaged by the Act.2.25 By December 1951, the British Transport Commission had, in additionto the road haulage collection and delivery fleet of the railways, some 41,000road haulage vehicles (i.e. about one quarter of the national A and B licensedfleet). Those A and B licensed operators not taken over were only allowed tocarry goods outside a 25 mile radius from their operating centre if they had a permit granted by the Commission. C licensed vehicles were unaffected by theAct and continued during the period to grow as competitors to rail and road haulage alike.2.26 The Transport Act of 1953 sought to restore the essentials of the positionas in 1939. The Commission was to dispose as quickly as was reasonably practicalof the vehicles and property held for the purposes of the Road Haulage ExecutiveThe vehicles sold were given A licences as of right for up to 5 years, after whichthey came under the ordinary regime. In the event, reasonable offers were not forthcoming for all that was put on sale, and under the Transport (Disposal of road Haulage) Act 1956, the Commission were relieved of their obligation to dispose of all their vehicles. They were left with some 14,000 vehicles, a fleet bigenough then (as now) to make them far and away the biggest road haulageundertaking in the country. This fleet was however made subject to the licensingprocedure in the ordinary way, but the initial grant of licences was madeautomatically for the vehicles then in the Commission^ hands.
Other Changes made by the Transport Act 19532.27 The 1953 Act also made two other potentially important changes of emphasis in the licensing system. The 1933 Act and the 1953 Act both enjoinedthe Licensing Authorities to have regard to the interests of the public generally.But with a view to securing more freedom in the issue of carriers&apos; licences forroad goods vehicles, and thereby increasing competition, these criteria were amended by the 1953 Act to give priority of consideration to the interests of tradeand industry, as users of transport, over those of the providers of transport (the1933 Act had had no specific difference of emphasis as between user andprovider). The Licensing Authorities were in future to have regard &quot; to theinterests of the public generally including primarily those of persons requiringfacilities for transport and secondarily those of persons providing facilities for transport &quot;. (Transport Act 1953, Section 9(1)).2.28 The 1953 Act also specially empowered the Licensing Authorities for thefirst time to consider charges and efficiency. The provisions were:&quot; in considering whether existing transport facilities arc to be treated assuitable, the Licensing Authority shall have regard to the relative efficiency,reliability and adequacy of the existing facilities at the date of the application and the facilities which the applicant will provide if his application is granted, and to all other relevant considerations, including, to such extent,as may in all the circumstances appear proper, the charges made and to bemade in respect of those facilities respectively &quot;.(Section 9(3)(b)).Consolidation of Earlier Legislation into the Road Traffic Act, 19602.29 The Road Traffic Acts from 1930 to 1956 were consolidated in the road traffic Act of 1960. Part IV of the latter Act is substantially the road haulagelicensing part of the 1933 Road and Rail Traffic Act, and is the present rulingstatutory basis of the goods licensing system.(ii)   THE PRESENT LICENSING SYSTEMCarriers&apos; Licences2.30 An operator must obtain the appropriate carriers1 licence before he mayuse a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods for hire or reward, or forhis own trade or business. A &quot;goods vehicle &quot; is defined as a motor vehicle ortrailer constructed or adapted for use for the carriage or haulage of goods.There are 3 main types of carriers&apos; licence and 1 sub-type:the public carrier&apos;s or a licenceThe holder of an A licence may use the authorised vehicles for the carriage of goods for hire or reward. No conditions can be attached to this type oflicence, but an applicant for an A licence must make a declaration (whichhas come to be known as his &quot; normal user &quot;) of the main work he intends to do with the authorised vehicles. This declaration usually deals only withtraffic outward from the area of the vehicles&apos; base, if he is not to risk hislicence, he must in general do what he said he was going to do; but he is free to do anything else which is compatible with compliance with his declar-ation.
the contract a licenceWithin the A category, a licence to operate a vehicle solely for the useof one customer, and under a contract accordingly with a term of atleast a year, is called a Contract A licence.the limited carrier^ or b licenceThe holder of a B licence may use the authorised vehicles for the carriage ofgoods either in connection with any trade or business carried on by him or,subject to any special conditions attached to the licence, for hire or reward.Conditions usually limit the type of goods that may be carried, the persons for whom goods may be carried, the area of operations, or some combin-ation of these factors.the private carrier^ or c licenceThe holder of a C licence may use the authorised vehicles for the carriage of goods in connection with any trade or business carried on by him but not for the carriage of goods for hire or reward.2.31 A licence in any category may authorise the use of one or more vehicles.An authorised vehicle is usually specified in the licence by its registrationnumber. However, where an applicant needs to hire vehicles from time to time,vehicles may be authorised by enumeration and description in terms of unladen weight. Trailers (which have no registration mark of their own) are authorised by enumeration and description, usually in terms of unladen weight. A and Clicences arc normally issued for a period of 5 years. The normal currency of Blicences is 2 years. Short term licences may be issued for special purposes.The Licensing A uthorities2.32 Carriers&quot; licences are granted by Licensing Authorities appointed by theMinister of Transport. There are 11 Licensing Authorities, one for each of the11 Traffic Areas into which Great Britain is divided. The Licensing Authority isalso the Chairman of Traffic Commissioners, who administer the licensing system for buses and coaches. The functions of a Licensing Authority may alsobe exercised by a deputy appointed by the Minister.2.33 Each Licensing Authority has a permanent office in his Area with a staffprovided by the Ministry of Transport. This staff includes the Vehicle and traffic Examiners who, in co-operation with the police, are responsible forenforcing the law on fitness of vehicles, on carriers&apos; licensing and on drivers&apos;hours and records. Fees are charged for carriers&apos; licences to cover the costs ofthese offices.Criteria for Grant of Licences2.34 A Licensing Authority must grant any application for a C licence unlessthe applicant has previously had a carriers licence revoked, suspended orcurtailed for misbehaviour. He must grant a Contract A licence if he is satisfiedthat the vehicles concerned will be used exclusively for the purposes of an appropriate contract for a period of not less than 1 year, unless he is satisfiedthat in view of the applicants previous conduct as a carrier of goods, he is not afit person to hold a carriers&apos; licence.
2.35 In dealing with an application relating to an A or B licence a licensing authority has full power in his discretion to grant, to gxu,J- in modified form, orto refuse, subject to the considerations and exceptions set out below. TheMinister cannot intervene in his decision. The Licensing Authority must haveregard to &quot; the interests of the public generally including primarily those ofpersons requiring facilities for transport and secondarily those of personsproviding facilities for transport &quot;.2.36 Licensing Authorities must publish all applications for new A or Blicences, or for variations extending the scope of such licences. There must be asuitable opportunity for objections to be lodged (unless the application is of atrivial nature, is for a new licence to replace an existing licence in respect of a business which is being acquired by the applicant, or is for a licence for a period not exceeding 3 months which is required for an urgent purpose). Applicationsare published in a special journal issued by each Licensing Authority weekly orfortnightly and named &quot; Applications and Decisions &quot;.2.37 Any person already providing facilities, by road or otherwise, for carriage of goods for hire or reward in the district concerned is entitled to lodge an objec-tion to an application. But the Licensing Authority is not required to take account of an objection lodged by a B licence holder against an application foran A licence. An objection to be relevant under the terms of the Road traffic act must be made on one of the following grounds:(a) that suitable transport facilities will, if the application is granted, be inexcess of requirements ;(b) that any of the conditions of a carriers licence held by the applicant hasnot been complied with ;(c) that the applicant has suffered a conviction for an offence, or pro-hibition of the use of his vehicles, of the kind referred to in paragraphs.43 and 2.44 below.2.38 Licensing Authorities have power to hold public inquiries to hearevidence from applicants and objectors, and invariably do so in contested cases.They may also do so in cases which are not contested but in which they wish tosatisfy themselves of the bona fides of the applicant. Public inquiries arc held at such places in the Traffic Area as may be convenient. Applicants are normallyexpected to provide evidence from prospective customers who have had difficultyin obtaining suitable transport facilities. The objectors may then try to show thatthey can provide facilities adequate to the witness&apos;s needs. In considering whetherexisting transport facilities are suitable the Licensing Authority must haveregard to their relative efficiency, reliability and adequacy, and all other relevant considerations including, to the extent he thinks proper, the charges made.The Transport Tribunal2.39 An applicant or an objector who is dissatisfied with the decision of the licensing Authority can appeal to the Transport Tribunal.2.40 The members of the Tribunal consist of the President who must be an experienced lawyer, and two members, one a person experienced in transportbusiness and the other a person of experience in commercial affairs. members are appointed by Her Majesty on the joint recommendation of the LordChancellor and the Minister of Transport.
2.41 Appeals under Part IV of the Road Traffic Act 1960 are heard by theRoad Haulage Appeals Division of the Tribunal which may at the discretion ofthe President include persons nominated to a special panel by the Lord Chan-cellor, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Transport. TheTribunal is empowered to hear appeals not only on points of principle, but alsoagainst the Licensing Authority&apos;s exercise of his discretion. A further appeal on points of law is possible to the High Court. Appeals to the Tribunal are inpractice commonplace, those to the High Court very rare.Exemption from the system.42 Vehicles used for certain purposes* are exempt from the requirementsof the licensing system. The concession of widest effect is that applying to useof &quot; farmers&apos; vehicles &quot;. A goods vehicle used by a farmer solely to convey the produce of, or articles required for the purposes of, his farm is classed as a*&apos; farmer&apos;s goods vehicle &quot; and is exempt, while used solely for these purposes,from the requirement to have any carriers licence. As a further exemption,which is unique, if the farmer does take out a C licence for his vehicle he mayuse it not only to carry his own goods but also to carry for hire or reward thegoods of other farmersf in the same locality.Revocation, Suspension and Curtailment of Carriers&apos;&apos; Licences2.43 A Licensing Authority has power to revoke, suspend or curtail a licencethat he has granted for:(a) persistent or wilful breaches of the conditions of the licence;(b) frequent convictions for poor maintenance, excessive speed, over-loading etc. of the vehicles or for infringement of the law on drivers&apos;hours and records;(c) frequent prohibitions of the use of vehicles found unserviceable byVehicle Examiners (see paragraph 2.45 below);(d) a single conviction or prohibition for an offence of a wilful or partic-particularly dangerous nature.The Thirteenth Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 1960 and the Regulations adding to that schedule may be loosely interpreted as freeing from the carriers&apos; licensing system:(a) vehicles used by a farmer solely to carry his own produce or goods required for his farm;(b) the drawing of trailers by private cars (other than for hire or reward);(c) carriage of goods in buses, coaches and taxis;(d) funerals;(c) use by, or on behalf of local authorities of vehicles for sanitary and certain otherspecified purposes;(f) police, fire brigade, ambulance, and other fire fighting and rescue vehicles includingvehicles used to carry lifeboats;(g) breakdown vehicles;(h) vehicles used by the armed forces;(i) vehicles on test;(j)  vehicles travelling limited distances along public roads between parts of private premises;^k) vehicles used in road maintenance and repairs:(I)   vehicles used by dealers under a limited trade licence;(m) carriage of samples by a commercial traveller or the tools of trade of the driver orpassenger;(n) carriage of instruments or apparatus by doctors, nurses and veterinary surgeons;io) tower wagons;(p) pedestrian controlled vehicles;(q) vehicles with built in machinery (e.g. mobile cranes, etc.);see paragraph 13.22 below.
2.44 A and B licences may also be revoked, suspended or curtailed if the holder of the licence:(a) has made or procured to be made for the purposes of his application astatement of fact which was false or a statement of intention or expect-ation which has not been fulfilled;(b) has placed other licence holders at an unfair disadvantage by persistentlycharging rates below the cost of providing his transport services.If so requested by the licence holder, a Licensing Authority must hold a public inquiry before revoking, suspending or curtailing a licence. A licence holder hasa right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal in respect of any revocation, sus-pesnion or curtailment of his licence.Prohibition of Unfit Goods Vehicles2.45 Licensing Authorities have a general responsibility for supervising theroadworthiness of goods vehicles. For this purpose they have the assistance ofVehicle Examiners appointed by the Minister. Vehicle Examiners have power to inspect goods vehicles whether or not authorised under a carriers licence. If the vehicle appears unfit for service or likely to become so, the Examiner mayprohibit its use for carriage of goods either immediately or with delayed effect.This only affects the use of the vehicle when loaded. The Examiner has no powerto prevent an unfit vehicle being driven away unloaded. He may remove theprohibition when satisfied that the necessary repairs have been made. A personaggrieved by the refusal of the Examiner to remove a prohibition can apply to licensing Authority to have the vehicle examined by an Area MechanicalEngineer, who is a professionally qualified official senior to the Vehicle Examiner.If still dissatisfied an aggrieved operator can appeal to the Minister.Drivers&apos; Hours and Records2.46 By Section 73 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (and formerly by Section 19of the Road Traffic Act 1930) the periods of duty of a driver of a commercialvehicle are limited for safety reasons. As an aid to enforcement of these pro-visions, drivers of vehicles authorised under carriers&apos; licences must keep records of their hours of work and of journeys made. Licence holders are required toensure that such records are made out, and to hold them for a period for inspec-tion by the staffs of the Licensing Authorities.2.47 There are exemptions from this requirement. Drivers of C licensedvehicles weighing no more than 16 cwt. unladen are not required to keep recordsif the vehicle is used only on journeys within 5 miles of the place where it is normally kept. There are also exemptions for vehicles used in agriculture onjourneys within 25 miles of base and for vehicles used by travelling showmen onjourneys of less than 50 miles.Case Law2.48 The preceding paragraphs describe the present licensing system as it is laid down in the Road Traffic Act. In statutory form the system differs verylittle from that originally introduced in 1933. But in the course of 30 years the licensing system has evolved much case law and custom. The development ofthe system has been much influenced by the decisions of the Transport Tribunal
and its predecessor bodies over the years. These bodies have adopted a legalisticapproach and have tended to decide appeals by fairly close reference to prece-dents. As a result Licensing Authorities have also had to consult precedentsbefore giving decisions. This has led to the growth of a system of caselaw of no little complexity. It is interesting to note that the Salter Reportcontemplated the issue of instructions to the Licensing Authorities by theMinister* and considered it of great importance that even the appeals procedure should be so designed to make the employment of Counsel unnecessary andunsuitable!. The hope was expressed by the Conference that as in the case ofthe Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act the system would be run without the inter-vention of lawyers.2.49 Because of the developed intricacies of the system, it is not always easy for hauliers to be sure where they stand. To guard against complications whichcan be fatal to an application, it is usually necessary to take legal advice, and itis normal for applicants and objectors to be legally represented at public in-quirics. (But legal representation is not compulsory and Licensing Authorities go out of their way to see that an applicant putting his own case has a fair hearing).Every aspect of the application may attract the complexities of case law the type of licence which should be obtained for particular types of work, the kindof evidence which applicants and objectors are expected to bring in particularkinds of case, the statement of intention which must be made in an applicationfor an A licence, and the reasons for which a licence may be suspended or revoked are all subject to argument by precedent and reference to case law.Normal User2.50 The most important development in the licensing system since it was setup concerns the &quot; normal user &quot; of the A licence. This licence was apparentlyconceived originally as giving freedom to carry any kind of goods anywhere in thecountry. But to consider the need for new licences in relation to existing facilities,Licensing Authorities had to ask what work an applicant for a licence intendedto do. The 1953 Transport Act tightened this (perhaps inevitable) control byempowering Licensing Authorities to revoke or suspend a licence if a statementof intention made in the application was not fulfilled. The logic was inexorable,but the result has been that a haulier may lose his licence if he does a substantial amount of work outside the terms of his original declaration of normal user.Tims in effect the A licence &quot; normal user &quot;, declared on the application for thelicence, becomes a condition which curtails the freedom of the holder. An a licence haulier with a narrow &quot; normal user &quot; may even be more confined in hisoperations than the holder of a B licence with wide conditions.2.51 The tendency for A and B licences to grow more alike has been enhanced by the practice of granting B licences to hauliers who have no other business.The B licence seems originally to have been intended to meet the needs of thetrader who wished both to carry his own goods and also to operate as a haulierin a limited way as an adjunct to his main trade. But the difficulty of obtaining a new A licence in face of the objections of the established operators has en-couraged hauliers and would-be hauliers to apply for a B licence, since objectionscan often be avoided or reduced by agreement to accept strict conditions.*Rcport of the Saltcr Conference, paragraph 107.flbid. paragraph 11 IF.
-    199Road-Rail Negotiating Committees2.52 There is in each Traffic Area an unofficial body known as the Road-RailNegotiating Committee. This consists of representatives of British Railways andcertain organised road hauliers. Committees invite applicants for A and Blicences to meet them to discuss the scope of their applications and what can bedone to secure the withdrawal of objections lodged against them. Applicantsneed not appear before the Committees, which have no official status. licensing authorities are not bound to accept any settlement negotiated in this way. TheCommittees often succeed, however, in getting the applicants to clarify orreduce the scope of their applications and hence in persuading the objectors towithdraw their objections.Entry to the Road Haulage industry.53 In practice the volume of objection by existing licensed operators and bythe railways seems to have made it very difficult for a new entrant to road haulage to obtain an A licence. B licences are somewhat easier to obtain. Wehave heard that most new-comers gain entry to the industry by what are described as &quot; backdoor &quot; methods. They obtain (as of right) a Contract a licence to carry goods exclusively for one customer. After a period they apply for a full A licence, relying on the work they have been doing for their onecustomer as their proof of need. Since they have no trading or manufacturingbusiness of their own for which they might need to use the vehicle, they claim that they should have an A rather than a B licence.2.54 Another way into the industry is through the right of manufacturers ortraders to a &quot; C-hiring &quot; margin. This entitles the manufacturer or trader to usehired vehicles as well as his own vehicles up to a number specified in his licence.This right is useful to manufacturers and traders who need to employ a fluetu-ating number of vehicles or who for any other reason prefer not to own vehiclesover which they need from time to time to have full control. But we have been told that the hirer can operate what is in effect a haulage business by hiring out his vehicles to manufacturers and traders, sometimes the same vehicle to severaldifferent users on a day to day basis. The manufacturer or trader is entitled onlyto hire vehicles as chattels and must employ his own drivers; but this rcquirc-ment is sometimes evaded by taking the hirer&apos;s drivers as a matter of form onto the manufacturers or trader&apos;s pay-roll. Eventually the work done throughlegal C-hiring arrangements may be used as evidence of customer needs in an Aor B licence application.Summary and conclusions.55 To sum up, the present system of licensing was introduced in 1933 to implement fairly closely the recommendations of the Salter Conference to dealwith what the Conference regarded as the evils of excessive competition. Despiteconsiderable changes in basic circumstances, the system has endured for over 30years without major amendment, though it has developed an intricate system of case law which has made it much more complex and legal in flavour than was perhaps intended by its originators. The distinctions between the classes oflicence have become considerably blurred. The system is now an elaborateprocess of regulation of what a lorry operator may carry.
CHAPTER 3Road Transport of Goods in Great BritainTodayThe Vehicle Fleet Sizes, Numbers and Licences3.1 According to Ministry of Transport statistics1&quot;, there are now 1,476,000goods vehicles (out of a total road motor vehicle population of 11,400,000)operating under carriers&apos; licences in this country. 929,000 of these weigh under  tons unladen, and are mainly what are generally recognised as light vans.225,000 weigh between 2 and 3 tons unladen, and form an intermediate class.Over 3 tons unladen, the lorry is what the layman would call &quot; heavy &quot;; thereare 322,000 of them. In the &quot; heavy &quot; class, the number in each size range goesdown sharply as the size increases. Thus there are:244,000 of 3-5 tons unladen weight61,000 of 5-8 tons unladen weight17,000 of over 8 tons unladen weight.3.2 The 322,000 heavy lorries, usually carrying larger loads for longer dis-tanccs, carry out over 80% of the work done (measured in ton/mileage), j Onthe same basis, 929,000 vehicles in the light class do less than 6% of the totalwork. In other words, the smaller vehicles, though numerous and useful at theirown tasks, contribute very little to the main flows of goods about the country.For longer journeys (i.e. over say 100 miles) the contribution of the light vehicleis negligible (roughly 1 % of the ton/mileage moving this distance).3.3 The 929,000 light vehicles are almost wholly (98%) under C licence,carrying goods in connection with the main trading, manufacturing or servicebusinesses of their owners. Of the 225,000 in the intermediate class, roughly75% are also C licensed. Of the heavy class, about 60% are under C licence.The remainder (57,000 intermediate and 125,000 heavy) are engaged, under A,Contract A and B licence, primarily on haulage work for others.The Operators&apos; Fleets Sizes and Licences3.4 In the hire or reward field the size of an operators fleet varies widely, witha general tendency to small units including a significant number of single-vehicle units.3.5 The nationally-owned fleets of the Transport Holding Company (i.e. theBritish Road Services group) with some 12,000 licensed haulage vehicles, andBritish Railways with the same number of licensed haulage vehicles, are ex-exceptional in size.J British Road Services Limited, the general haulage part of the*Sce Appendix B (ii), Table 6.see Appendix B (i), Tables 25 and 26.JB.R.S. own about 16,000 vehicles, and British Railways about 14,000. But not all are currently licensed.
Transport Holding Company&apos;s fleet, is far and away the largest trunk haulageunit in the country. The work of the British Railways fleet isjprimarily collection and delivery of goods whose trunk haul is by rail, and the vehicles used are oftenspecialised for the purpose. The remainder of the haulage industry is generallyorganised in company fleets of at most about 150 vehicles. In recent years,however, there has been a development of larger groups, through the acquisition by holding companies of other haulage companies. The acquired companies arethen left a high degree of independence in the running of their day to day affairs.No great pressure is apparently put on them to seek to integrate the running oftheir lorries with those of other companies in the group. The grouping processhas so far produced only a handful of really large units, with a total vehiclestrength for each group of from 500 to 3.000 vehicles.3.6 The distribution of haulage lorries by fleet size is as follows:*34% of the total vehicle strength is run by operators of 5 vehicles or less;44% is in fleets of 6-50 vehicles;22 % is in fleets of over 50 vehicles (made up of 5k % British Road Services,51 % British Railways and 11 % others).3.7 The size of fleet of any one C operator varies widely from one vehicle to several thousand. We understand that an analysis by your Department of heavyC licensed vehicles comparable with that for hauliers will be available later thisyear. All that can at present be said with confidence is that a large number of thelight vans running under C licences are those of the small retailers each with only one or two vehicles in use. At the other end of the scale, there is also anumber of fleets in the very large class, most of them owned by major industrial concerns known throughout the country.The Organisation of the Market for Haulage services .8 There is no deliberately organised and clearly defined road haulage&quot; market&quot;. But many hauliers in conjunction with their haulage businessoperate to greater or lesser extent as clearing houses for traffic, sometimes sub-contracting and sometimes only acting as brokers. Organisations functioningsolely as clearing houses exist up and down the country, but their number is small in relation to the traffic and by and large they seem to work independently of one another.3.9 This absence of a consciously integrated and extensive network of clearinghouses seems surprising in the light of the important effect a return load can have on efficient and economic use of vehicles and therefore on profitability.We think there are a number of reasons. The most important is that in a smallcountry like ours, the lorry&apos;s journey is usually short.! The lorry may well takeless time to get back to base than is needed to seek out and take aboard a returnload. Where this is so, it may well be better for the operator to get his lorry backto base to get on with the next outward job, than to have it return laden but later.Secondly, the regular consignor of traffic usually prefers to know the carrier towhom he is entrusting his goods, rather than to put these goods on the first*See Appendix B (iii), Table 2.tYour Departments statistics show that over 90% of journeys by heavy lorries are under100 miles and about 80% of journeys by heavy vehicles are under 50 miles. See AppendixB (i), Tables 21 and 22.
lorry &quot; going that way &quot;. (We heard much evidence of the damage which adriver or carrier inexperienced in a particular commodity can do throughignorance. There is also the fear of loss of valuable goods through robbery).Thirdly, hauliers build up their own ad hoc arrangements for tapping possiblesources of readily available return traffic.3.10 But whatever the reason, we found no widespread sense of need forspecialised market intermediaries or market institutions.Competition in Road Haulage3.11 Within the framework of quantity control by licensing, the degree of competition varies in the different parts of the road haulage industry. In some parts e.g. tipper work, competition in rates is intense. In other parts of the in-dustry competition is less. Sometimes this is so because the number of haulagefirms is limited by the special requirements of the particular traffic. The largeroperators may have advantages over smaller competitors because, as we heard in evidence, a consignor handling large flows of traffic linds it uneconomical todeal with a multitude of small hauliers. In such circumstances competition islikely to be limited, regardless of whether or not there is quantity control bylicensing. However, in general competition in road haulage seems to be strong.We understand that the Road Haulage Association, the principal organisationof road hauliers, has at times been unable to secure the implementation ofrecommended increases in freight charges even when there have been generalincreases in operating costs. Nevertheless the support of organised and individualhauliers for the licensing system suggests at least in part that this system pro-vides some real protection of established hauliers from the full force of competition.Operations of Road Goods Transport3.12 It is perhaps astonishing to find that there was until recent years practi-cally no information about the operation of road transport of goods. But latterlymuch useful statistical work has been done in this field by your Department. the resultant publications* provide a mine of detailed information covering manyaspects of the industry. This information has been of great help to us and wehave drawn heavily on it. It is already available in published form and for convenience we reproduce extracts from it at Appendix B. So in the following paragraphs wc do not need to present more than the most important features onthe present operations of road transport of goods.3.13 The lorry is now the principal carrier of goods in this country. 80 %j ofthe tonnage and 55 %J of the ton mileage is by road. The difference in these*Ministry of Transport Statistical Paper No. 2-Survey of Road Goods Transport 1962.Final Results Part I.Ministry of Transport Statistical Paper No. 3-Highway Statistics 1963.Ministry of Transport Statistical Paper No. A Survey of Road Goods Transport 1962.Final Results Commodity Analysis.Ministry of Transport Survey of Road Goods Transport 1962.

figures is explained by the greater average lengths of haul by rail or coastal shipping. The average length of haul by road is about 25 miles, by rail 70 miles(for all traffic) and 135 miles (for general merchandise), and by coastal shipping200 miles (for oil) and 270 miles (for coal)*. The figures of the road transportshare in the total give a misleading impression, unless it is remembered that avery large number of short or very short hauls are carried out by road which isthe only possible means of transport for them. A more useful comparison is perhaps the shares of long distance transport i.e. over 100 miles. The estimatehere is that road transport accounts for about 40%, rail 30% and coastal ship-ping 30 % of total ton mileages.3.14 Of the work (ton miles) by heavy lorries, somewhat under half (43%) isin C licensed vehicles. This minority share of the work, by what is the major part of the heavy fleet (paragraph 3.3 above) is explained by the shorter averagehaul by C licensed vehicles. The following table shows the position:!Journeys	Proportion of Work-Length	it on miles)(miles)		Heavy         Heavy	C &apos;         A &amp; BUnder 50	45%           25%50-99	25%           20%100 and over	30%           55%3.15 C licence work also differs from that of A and B vehicles because of thehigh proportion of journeys where many part loads are picked up or set downen route. Journeys by hauliers are primarily of the type where the same goods are carried from end to end of the journey.3.16 A large proportion of the C licence fleet is in the distributive trades, thebuilding and construction industry and the food, drink and tobacco industries.These trades engage nearly 60 %J of the heavy C licensed vehicles.The Trend from Rail to Road3.17 Much has been said in recent years about the &quot; swing &quot; to road trans-port. But the use of this term may be misleading. There is no doubt that the share of road transport has increased greatly relative to that of rail.5 But thegrowth of trades or industries for which road transport has proved to be speciallysuitable has been fairly high, compared with that of the industries for which railhas special advantages. This growth may account for more of the apparent total&quot; swing &quot; than any actual transfer of custom from rail to road. For example, inthe main rail-using industries, mining output \\ fell by 10% between 1952 and1962 and iron and steel output rose by only 13% (and was accompanied bydevelopments which reduced that industry&apos;s demands for transport in relation*Distances for coastal shipping are from origin to destination by inland route, not by sea.The figures are thus comparable with those for road and rail.see Appendix B (i), Tables 25 and 26 Ministry of Transport Statistical Paper No. 2 Survey of Road Goods Transport, 1962,Final Results. Part T, Table 12, Page 34.$See Appendix B (i), Tables (i) and (vi).I!See Appendix B (i), Table (vii).
to production). In the same period the output of predominantly road-using industries like the manufacture of food, drink and tobacco, and the construction industries, increased by 30-40%.3.18 We do not know to what extent the same situation differences in ratesof growth or decline of predominantly rail-using as against predominantlyroad-using industries applies more widely to the transport of general merchant-dise. When coal and mineral traffics and iron and steel products are excluded,the remaining rail general merchandise traffic has in fact declined by some 25%over the last ten years.3.19 All in all, it seems fairly clear that a substantial part of the fall in thetotal volume of rail traffic arises from decline in the total transport needs oftraditional rail users. The growth in road transport equally owes much to thedevelopment of industries for whose work road is specially suitable. In the overall change which has taken place there must have been an element of transferof traffic from rail to road, but this element is probably a minor part of thewhole.3.20 A contributing factor may be that transfers of traffic once made tend tobe permanent. If factories have been sited or trading estates laid out on thebasis of road service, goods traffic will tend to continue to go by road. It may bedifficult or even impossible in these cases to send any goods economically by rail, however much the general standard of rail service is improved.Load Factors3.21 There are no statistics available from which load factors (i.e. the amountcarried in relation to the transport capacity provided) for road goods transportcan be precisely calculated. The nearest approach to a calculation is by way ofyour Departments &quot; Survey of Road Goods Transport 1962 &quot;, which givesfigures of the proportion of empty mileage run by various categories of vehicleon different types of journey. On intermediate journeys, on which goods werepicked up and set down at several points, 17% of the total mileage was runempty. On end-to-end journeys 36% of the miles were run empty.* The averagemileage run empty on end-to-end journeys was 27 % for A licensed vehicles, 41 %for Contract A vehicles, 45% for B licensed vehicles and 38% for C licensedvehicles. The lower figure of A as compared to Contract A and C vehicles was confined to heavy vehicles.3.22 The survey showed that substantial empty running occurs with all butthe heavier A licensed vehicles, and that the degree of empty running tends to be greater for those vehicles whose freedom is more restricted by the terms of theirlicence. The degree of empty running moreover is greater than the figures atfirst show. For instance, some end-to-end journeys defined as loaded are madewith only small part loads. If the vehicle is large there may be just as much unusedcapacity on such journeys as when a somewhat smaller vehicle runs empty. this problem of measurement was recognised by your Department in its 1952 and1958 surveys, and figures of the number of journeys more than and less than half loaded were then included. We understand however that these figures were regarded as very unreliable and that they were discontinued because of the*Scc Appendix B (i), Table (x).
difficulty of obtaining an adequate measure of the degree to which a vehicle isloaded in any particular case. The results tended to show that a fairly largeproportion of &quot; loaded &quot; mileage was in fact with the vehicle more than halfempty in the case of C licensed and the smaller A and B licensed vehicles, whilethe larger A and B vehicles generally operated either fairly fully loaded or empty.3.23 The difficulties of measurement in this field are clear. With light bulkyloads a vehicle may be full before it is carrying anything like the weight it could.With dense loads like steel sheet the maximum weight may be reached whilemuch capacity by volume remains. Some goods can be stacked, others cannot.Some can be mixed with other goods, others demand sole use of the vehicle.3.24 We do not however regard load factor as a useful and reliable measureof efficiency. A high load factor might be obtained at the expense of the efficient use of vehicles on their main function, or of a poorer service to the customer anddisproportionately high costs in other operations. (It was argued before us that even if he were free to carry return loads for others, it would normally suita C licence operator better to get his vehicle back to base quickly, ready for anew journey, than to have it search around for return loads.) It is hard to see how the circular delivery trip or the highly specialist vehicle characteristic of much C licence work can ever show a high load factor the nature of the jobjust does not allow it.Customer Satisfaction3.25 In an enquiry into the system of control applying to an industry, it is relevant to consider whether that industry seems to be failing to satisfy itscustomers.3.26 In all the evidence put to us, there was no general criticism by users ofthe services provided by road hauliers. In weighing this evidence, we must ofcourse have regard to the relative ease with which those dissatisfied with theservice from hauliers might have gone over to their own C licence vehicles. Thereis also the general inarticulateness of consumers to be taken into account.Nevertheless, it is appropriate to record that we have had no evidence fromusers of dissatisfaction with the road haulage industry, and that no specificcomplaints were made to us. (What complaint there was, and fairiy widely andpersistently at that, was from those who felt that the physical presence of theroad goods vehicle was unwelcome, not that it gave a bad service either to itsuser or to those who benefited directly or indirectly from the work it had done.)Bankruptcy in the Road Haulage industry.27 A feature of the road haulage industry to which several references weremade in evidence to us was the incidence of bankruptcy. Our attention was invited to the figures published by the Board of Trade, showing that in 1962 thenumber of road haulage contractors who failed in bankruptcy was exceeded only by the figure for builders. In the previous year the figures were again high,exceeded only by builders once more and the hardware and electrical retailers.We were invited to take account of these facts as showing the tendency to in-
stability in road haulage, even licensed as it was. We were also invited to draw the further inference that licensing controls should be tightened, to reduce thenumber of bankruptcies and the instability explicitly or implicitly attributed toit.3.28 While not in any way under-estimating the effects of bankruptcy, wewould not necessarily accept the premise that it was the duty of government soto arrange matters that bankruptcy in any particular occupation became ex-extremely unlikely. Few would think it wrong that men of enterprise should beentitled to set out on a business venture which has financial risks. If there is risk,there will always from time to time be failure. Whether this is socially seriousor not must be judged against the scale of each individual failure and by thenumber of failures. In any one industry, the number of failures whichmight be significant must depend in turn on how many there are engagedin that industry. If the number of concerns in the industry is large,the total number of bankruptcies might be quite high without necessarily givingcause for general alarm. This would be particularly true if the concerns were mainly small.3.29 We thought it might be useful to sec whether further research into the published figures of bankruptcy in road haulage would give any guide to thekind of firm which appeared to be most liable to fail. With the co-operation ofthe Board of Trade and of the Licensing Authorities, to whom we are muchindebted, wc sought to trace the carriers&apos; licensing history of the road haulagecontractors who according to the Board of Trade&apos;s returns had failed in the last three years. Our picture was bound to be incomplete, since it included neitherreceiverships nor liquidations of companies (which were left out because of thedifficulty of distinguishing voluntary from compulsory liquidation). Moreover,bankruptcy could not always be ascribed to business failure debts in privatelife might be to blame. (These cases would however be shown according to theoccupation of the bankrupt, irrelevant though this might be). Nevertheless it seemed that wc might be able to throw more light on the subject than previousinformation had allowed.3.30 The first and most important fact which emerged from our investigationswas that more than half of those classified as road haulage contractors in theBoard of Trade&apos;s figures were not holders of carriers&apos; licences. Many were completely unknown to the Licensing Authorities; others no longer held licencesat the time of bankruptcy, or holding only C licences, almost certainly failed intheir main line of business, and not because of transport factors. Counting onlylicensed hauliers, there were roughly 100 failures in each of years 1961-63 outof a total of roughly 46,000 A and B licensed operators in this industry. bearing that mind that number of &quot; private life &quot; bankruptcies inevitably included in thefigures, and the total number of hauliers in the country we do not find in thesefigures any great cause for concern. Indeed, a significantly lower rate might even be taken as evidence of the degree of protection afforded by the licensing system.3.31 The number of failures by licensed hauliers would have placed themseventh, eighth and tenth respectively in the order of occupations with the mostfailures, as against third, second and fourth according to the published classi-fication.
3.32 The 293 A and B licence holders who went bankrupt in the years 1961-63operated a total of 900 vehicles or, on an annual basis, about 0.2% of the totalhaulage fleet operating in each year. 64% of the bankrupts had only one or twovehicles and only 4% had fleets of more than 10 vehicles. So failure by a largerhaulage firm is clearly rare.3.33 Analysis of the 1961-63 failures by category of carriers licence showed that 56% of the vehicles were specified in A contract licences, 31 % in B licences,and 13% in A licences. The higher proportion of bankrupts operating under contract A licences and B might seem to support two possible explanations. Asthe rate of failure goes up when the licence is in one of the categories which iseasier to obtain, it might therefore seem that those with less real prospect ofsurvival make their way in by the easiest road. On the other hand, as the failurerate is highest when the licence conditions are most restrictive, it might seem that the severity of restriction is a contributory cause of the higher failure rate.We cannot draw a firm conclusion from the evidence here.3.34 Another fact which emerged from the committee&apos;s investigations wasthat most bankrupt licensed hauliers had not been in that business long. Only32% of those failing in 1961-63 had been operating for more than live years and only 1 % had held licences before the war.3.35 70% of the A licensed vehicles of the bankrupts were authorised to operate over long distances, including 38% with a &quot;general goods&quot; normaluser. Only 11 % had short distance &quot;general goods&quot; normal user, so it docs notappear that bankrupts holding A licences suffered from particularly restrictivenormal user.3.36 Failures under Contract A and B licences show a clearer pattern. A largenumber of bankrupts worked in the tipper field. 55% of the bankrupt ContractA licence holders&apos; vehicles were tippers (which form 35% of the national licet of contract A vehicles), and. 70% of the B licensed vehicles involved in bankruptcywere tippers (which form 40% of the national fleet of B vehicles). As might beexpected these tippers were engaged largely in working for the construction industry and in the carriage of solid fuel. These arc fields where the demandvaries quite widely from time to time, and this may well have had a bearing.3.37 Our investigations of bankruptcies suggested that the vulnerability ofthe road haulier to bankruptcy was not as great as many people thought, thatthose who failed were nearly always in a small way of business and not longestablished, and that the nature and scale of bankruptcy in the industry were notsuch that any special measures by Government were called for on that account.Summary3.38 (i) Of nearly H million goods vehicles, only 322,000 arc in the heavyclasses which do 80% of the work. Nearly all the light vehicles arcunder C licence, as are 60% of the heavy ones. Fleet sizes varywidely, but most are of small or medium size (i.c. of under 50vehicles).(ii) There is no organised market for haulage services, but no evidencethat this is a serious defect.
(iii) In most sections of the industry competition is strong and some-times intense.(iv) Road transport carries 80% of the tonnage of goods moved in thecountry and is responsible for 55 % of the ton mileage. Of the tonmileage done by heavy lorries, 43 % is in C vehicles.(v) The growth of the share of road transport in total inland transport is probably due mainly to the faster growth in recent years of those industries for which road transport is particularly suitable, thanthat of those industries for which rail is particularly suitable.(vi) Load factors are hard to measure, may be expected to vary widely,and do not provide a useful index of efficiency.(vii) There were no complaints to us by users about the services pro-vided by road hauliers.(viii) The incidence of bankruptcy in road haulage is not high in relationto the number of firms in the industry.
CHAPTER 4Regulation of Road Haulage inOther Countries4.1 In the preceding two chapters we have looked at the road haulage industry in Great Britain, and the history and operation of the licensing systemused to control it. Before going further into the working and effects of licensingin this country we think it useful to examine the nature and aims of regulationof road haulage in other countries.4.2 In nearly all advanced industrial countries road haulage is subject to a degree of regulation which is not generally found in other industries. However,both the extent of such regulation and the means by which it is applied vary from country to country and in recent years a number of governments have examined afresh the policies and principles behind such regulation.4.3 We have relied in the main on information currently available from your Department and from other sources. As might be expected, there was much more material available to us about transport regulation in european countries than elsewhere. But as we did not formally take evidence on practiceabroad, we do not purport to present more than a broad survey of some different methods of regulation of road transport of goods. We did make specificinquiries to supplement the available information on some points but we didnot attempt to get much detailed evidence on foreign practice since we thoughtthat the wide differences in conditions would make comparison between one country and another of limited value.THE COMMON MARKET4.4 We look first at the development of the common transport policy inthe European Economic Community. Apart from the obvious significance ofthe Six as a group of some of the most important European countries, theCommon Market includes our nearest neighbours, and it is between them andthis country that most of our international road transport of goods flows.The Treaty of Rome which set up the European Economic Community doesnot lay down any specific plan or policy for transport. It merely states that the member countries shall adopt a common transport policy and forbids dis-crimination in transport charges between different countries or different industries. The absence of specific provisions for transport in the Treaty of Romewas mainly the result of the considerable differences of outlook among the six members of the community. These differences have so far held up any substantial measure of agreement on a common transport policy.National Transport Policies4.5 In many ways European experience of the development of goods trans-port has been similar to that of this country. In all cases railway systems were
built in the 19th century when they were subject to stringent public regulationin order to control exploitation of their monopoly position. In every case therailways have been subject to very severe competition from road transportsince the 1930&apos;s and their share of freight transport has been declining. As in britain, the State has had a substantial financial interest in the railway system.But the maintenance of obligations on the railways to provide services atcontrolled charges, often below the actual cost of carrying goods, has been regarded as an important safeguard for many industries which are dependenton the railways. The use of the railways to pursue social aims such as the encouragement of under-developed regions like Southern Italy by the provisionof many passenger services at sub-standard fares is a prominent feature ofEuropean railway systems. Perhaps the most significant difference betweenthe British situation and that among the Six is that several of these countries,notably the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, have flourishing inland water-way networks which carry a very substantial part of inland freight traffic. InGermany and Belgium the three forms of transport road, rail and inland waterways are of approximately equal importance, while inland waterwaysare the major freight carrier in the Netherlands. The problems of inland trans-port policy among the Six are correspondingly more difficult. The closestparallel to British conditions is found in Italy, where inland waterways play aninsignificant role and road transport carries a very much higher proportion of inland freight traffic than do the railways. In France on the other hand therailways are still the predominant freight carriers partly because of extremelystringent control of long distance road transport.4.6 There are no direct controls over own account transport in any of the Sixthough in Germany a special tax is levied on it. But some control over entry into the professional road haulage industry is practised in all of them. Theextent to which the quantity of road haulage is seriously restricted varies very greatly. In France and Germany, central government decides the number of vehicles that provincial authorities may licence for long distance haulage. The&quot; quotas &quot; have been increased very little since before the war. Short distanceroad transport is also subject in some cases to quota restriction but the quotasare much more liberal. At the same time the French and German Governmentsexercise close control over the charges made for road haulage in the same way as railway rates are controlled. Indeed, in Germany the rate schedule forlong distance road transport was until recently identical to the railway rateschedule. In France an exceedingly complicated form of rate control including provision for variation of rates within a &quot; fork &quot;* of 30% was established in1961.4.7 In Italy and the Netherlands, although entry into the road haulage industry is subject to licensing, the system seems to be administered in a liberalfashion and not significantly to impede the growth of road transport. In theNetherlands, quite strict professional qualifications are demanded from appli-cants for licences who must have passed an examination on their knowledge of road transport law and practice. In the Netherlands too the railways have amuch greater degree of commercial freedom than is usual in Europe and their freedom of charging is in practice only restricted by control of maximum rates.*&quot; Forked &quot; tariffs stipulate maximum and minimum rates, the operator having freedom to charge as he thinks fit within these limits.
They have also been able to close down a substantial part of the system andare at present the only European railway system which is making a profit. Wcunderstand that Dutch policy is to leave the development of transport as far aspossible to the operation of market forces. This is sharply opposed to the concept of a controlled transport market in which the State plays the role ofco-coordinator, a concept which is principally expounded in France. Dutch policyis much influenced by the fact that road and waterway transport provide animportant invisible export. It is therefore particularly important for the Nether-lands that international transport should be as free as possible.4.8 There have been some signs recently of a move away from the more restrictive forms of control. In Germany we understand that there is pressure for greater liberalisation and the long distance road transport quota was recently increased. The heavy taxation levied specifically on own accounttransport has also been substantially reduced. The most striking example of liberalisation has been in Belgium. Before 1960 professional haulage waslicensed on a strict &quot; proof of need &quot; basis under which licences were generallyrefused if the railways wished to carry the goods in question. This was said tohave caused the rapid expansion of own account transport at the expense of professional haulage. This development did not commend itself to the BelgianGovernment, and a new system of carriers&apos; licensing was introduced by whichlicences were issued automatically to applicants with the requisite successfulexperience in a more limited field.The Action programme.9 In default of any common ground between the Six, the initiative in formulating proposals for the common transport policy fell almost entirely tothe Commission whose &quot; Action Programme for a Common Transport Policy &quot;was put before the Council of Ministers in May 1962. They took the view thatthe common transport policy should not only contribute to the achievement of the general common market but should also aim at the organisation of thetransport system at the community level.4.10 For road haulage the &quot; Action Programme &quot; proposes that restrictionson entry into the industry should be relaxed and that bi-lateral quotas for international transport should gradually be replaced by a community quotawhich would entitle licensed hauliers to engage both in international transport and domestic transport in any member country. Quantitative control wouldbe retained but should be operated in a flexible manner so that the supply oftransport could be matched to the demand with a suitable margin for compcti-tion. The Commission suggest that the authority responsible for licensingshould judge the need for increased capacity by reference to market indicatorssuch as the profit margins obtaining in road haulage, delays experienced byusers and the development of transport on own account.4.11 At the same time the railways should be relieved of some of their moreonerous public service obligations. In particular they should be permitted toabandon unprofitable lines or services or replace them with road transportexcept where there were particularly pressing reasons of public policy why suchlines or services should be maintained. The railways should receive compensa-tion for undertaking unprofitable services for reasons of public policy.
4.12 The most important proposal of the Action Programme for the regula-tion of transport is that rates for all forms of transport should be subject tocontrol. Undertakings would be free to charge within the limits of a forked tariffdrawn up by each form of transport and approved by the public authorities.The tariff&apos;s upper limit would be fixed so as to prevent the exploitation of apossible monopoly situation, the lower limit so as to cover the variable costs of the operation with the addition of a certain percentage of fixed costs. TheCommission suggest that the width of the fork might vary between 10% and30 % but that there should be provision for exceptional rates outside the limits of the forked tariff to take account of special circumstances such as a long term contract which by ensuring greater regularity of traffic would enable costs to bemarkedly lower than usual.4.13 The proposals of the E.E.C. Commission for the organisation of trans-port are obviously important. But the existence of widely differing transportpolicies in the Member States meant that any proposals had to have a strongelement of compromise if they were to have any chance of being accepted.That the Common Market countries may adopt a transport policy involvingsome control of rates, and that the Commission accept the need for somequantitative limitation on entry into road transport, is not therefore necessarilya strong argument for accepting the same kind of control of road transport in this country.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA4.14 One of our number who was in the U.S.A. at the outset of our worktook the opportunity to make a short but intensive study of the situation there.In this he received much help from the American authorities and various trade organisations, who provided much printed material as well. For this most valuable assistance we arc indeed grateful.4.15 We understand that the form of control envisaged by the E.E.C.Commission was influenced to some extent by practice in the U.S.A. TheFederal Government exercises control only over inter-State transport; trans-port operations which are confined within the borders of a single State are subject solely to the jurisdiction of that State, (which may however be larger than the whole of Great Britain). The different geographical conditions inAmerica, particularly the much greater distances to be traversed, have an appreciable affect on the pattern of transport. The railways are still the majorfreight carrier, carrying in 1962 43% by ton miles of inland goods transport;road transport carried 24%, inland waterways 16%, and pipe-lines 17%. Thecharacteristic feature which distinguishes the United States from almost every other country is that its railway system is not owned by the State but is in thehands of a large number of private companies. Amalgamations of competingrailroads are subject to official scrutiny and control. The railway system as awhole is still viable but many individual companies have run into severedifficulties as a result of competition from road transport.The Inter-State Commerce Commission4.16 Transport regulation in America developed in the 19th century in asimilar way to that in Europe. When the railways were the only significant
long-distance freight carriers, and despite competitive railway building, itwas necessary to protect users and the public generally from the monopolisticactivities of the railroad companies. As a result federal control over railway rates developed with the setting up of the Inter-State Commerce Commissionin 1887. The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 extended the control of the Commissionto road transport.4.17 Inter-State carriers for hire or reward must be licensed by the Inter-State Commerce Commission. To obtain a licence the applicant must prove&quot; public convenience and necessity &quot;. Licences are issued in perpetuity. no restriction is placed on the number of lorries which may be operated by a licenceholder. Conditions may be and generally are attached to the licence laying down the types of goods which may be carried and the routes or areas whichmay be served. We understand that no new licence has in fact been issued sincethe original issue on the introduction of the restrictions. In addition all carriersare obliged to file their rate schedules with the Commission which has the rightto approve or reject them. Both carriers and users have the right to object to a proposed rate but it is generally competing carriers who in fact do so on thegrounds that the rate does not cover the full costs of the operation. Individualcarriers are free to propose any rate schedule they please but in practice road transport rates are determined by associations of carriers functioning as ratebureaux.The Agricultural Sector4.18 Certain classes of goods, particularly certain agricultural and fisheriesproducts, arc exempt from this system of control. This means that any carrier,whether haulier or own account operator, licensed or unlicensed, is entitled tocarry these goods and may charge whatever rate he pleases. Road transportoperations in the agricultural sector arc therefore an example of road transportcompletely free of any government regulation beyond safety requirements,operating side by side with a highly regulated industry.4.19 The agricultural exemption was included in the 1935 Motor CarrierAct under the influence of pressure from the farming industry. Farmers have consistently opposed any attempt to withdraw the exemption and it is clearthat they believe that as a result of freedom from regulation they obtain bettertransport service at lower costs. The clearest evidence that rates arc lowercomes from the freeing from regulation of the transport of poultry and frozenfruit and vegetables, by interpretation in the courts in the early 1950&apos;s. Wcunderstand that road transport rates on poultry dropped by about one-third and rates on frozen foods by about one-fifth from their previous regulatedlevels. When regulation was restored to the carriage of frozen food, rates didnot immediately increase again but some additional charges seem to have beenlevied. Studies by the Department of Agriculture have tended to confirm theview that rates for exempt products are lower than common carrier rates for similar services. The investigations of the Department of Agriculture suggestthat rates tend to be relatively stable but that there is some variation becauseof seasonal fluctuations in demand. Similarly exempt carrier rates, determinedby unrestricted competition, have not been accompanied by instability withinthe industry or by uneconomic operations and high rates of bankruptcy. And
while there is strong competition for the carriage of agricultural products we heard of no evidence that the standard of service had suffered as a result.Present United States policy.20 There does not appear to be any noticeable public demand for a drasticchange of policy in the United States. There is some evidence, however, ofdissatisfaction within Government circles with the present transport policy.In 1960 the Department of Commerce published the &quot; Rationale of FederalTransportation Policy&quot;. This publication criticises the present methods ofcontrol on the grounds that they encourage the use of the form of transportwhich is in many cases not the most efficient for carriage of the particular goods.Control of rates has meant firstly, that the railroads are forced to chargeuneconomically low rates for some products, and unnecessarily high rates for others, which they often lose to road competition; and secondly, that commoncarrier traffic in general is being eroded by the competition of private andexempt carriers. The &quot; Rationale of Federal Transportation Policy &quot; arguesthat ideally there should be no control over entry into the road haulage industry but suggests that this aim is impracticable in the circumstances and that more modest relaxations must be aimed at. The &quot; Rationale &quot; considers it important that charges should be more closely related to long-run marginal costs.JAPAN, CEYLON AND AUSTRALIA4.21 The general practice of almost all countries has been to impose some measure of control over the road transport of goods. In these circumstances the experience of such countries as did not apply close control could be signifi-cant. We understood that in Japan and Ceylon, and in Australia (for inter-state carriage) there was practically no control.4.22 We did not find that experience in Japan or Ceylon was particularlyrelevant to our problem, because the basic conditions were so different fromthose in this country.4.23 Conditions in Australia offered a closer though far from completeanalogy to ours and we looked at experience there with some interest. Australiahas been faced with the same transport problems as European countries. Therailways, which are in general owned by the individual States, have been losingtraffic to road competition and are making substantial losses. The position isaggravated by the fact that the State Railways were built to different gaugeswith the result that a great deal of long-distance transport involved tranship-mcnt at State borders. Transport statistics available from Australia are very limited but we understand that, for inter-State transport, coastal shipping is the prime mover carrying nearly 50% by ton-miles of goods transported;road transport carries just over 30% and rail just under 20%. The State Govern-ments have all applied transport policies aimed at protecting their railways.This has been done either by licensing road haulage on a &quot; proof of need &quot;basis or by levying a surcharge on road transport beyond a certain distance.Until 1954 these restrictions applied to road transport between States as wellas within State boundaries. But in that year a judgement of the Privy Councilfreed inter-State transport from all forms of restriction. Since then in Australia
as in the United States there has been a sector of the road transport industryoperating free from specific controls, while the rest of the industry has continuedto be subject to strict supervision by the public authorities.4.24 Information we received from the Australian state transport authoritiessuggests that the initial result of the Privy Council judgement was very severecompetition in inter-State transport. This resulted sometimes in uneconomicallylow rates and numerous bankruptcies. However more recently the industry has settled down and rates while still low are stable. Inter-State road haulageis considered to provide a satisfactory service. The high proportion of owner-drivers might be expected to suggest an industry in which new entry and failuresoccur frequently, but in fact their organisation into companies providingthem with administrative, maintenance and load booking facilities has helped to stabilise the composition of the industry.4.25 This picture of the inter-state road haulage industry was confirmed by an article by Mr. Stewart Joy in the July, 1964 issue of&quot; Oxford EconomicPapers &quot;. This article further suggests that the larger operators offering a more comprehensive service are comparatively little affected by competition from thesmall men. The intensive competition of the main inter-city routes is not foundin country districts where the limited amount of traffic on offer and the im-portance of local knowledge means that a single haulier often has a virtualmonopoly of the local traffic.4.26 Experience of unregulated traffic in Australia tends to confirm theimpression given by the agricultural sector in the United States. Conditions arcof course not necessarily similar to those obtaining in this country. It doesappear however that in those cases in which experience has been obtained of road transport operating under conditions of freedom the fears of those whothink that this situation would result in chaos, danger and a reduced standardof service to the user have not been borne out, while they provide some evidenceof the effect of greater competition in the reduction of rates.SWEDEN4.27 We have seen that most countries apply much stricter control to road transport than to other sectors of the economy. In paragraph 4.8 above wedescribed some of the indications that policies within the Common Marketwere moving away from the more severe forms of restriction. A most interestingchange of policy has taken place in Sweden, where a committee of experts wasappointed in 1953 to review national transport policy. It published threereports during the years 1961 and 1962. The recommendations of the com-mittee have been implemented by legislation passed at the end of 1963.Previously the railways were subject to the same kind of public service obliga-tions as other European railways (comprising an obligation to run services,not to discriminate between users and to observe maximum rates fixed by theGovernment). Road transport for hire or reward was subject to a licensing system whereby the applicant had to demonstrate the need for his proposedservice and existing carriers were able to object to his application. The objectof the system was to secure the best division of transport between competingforms from the standpoint of the national economy.
4.28 The committee of experts found that the regulatory system did notachieve these aims and that the licensing of road transport had promoted thegrowth of monopolistic groups and given excessive encouragement to transport on own account. The railways were operating at a substantial deficit. Thecommittee argued that the aims of transport policy might be achieved either by applying more drastic and sophisticated methods of control or by giving thevarious means of transport greater freedom to compete for the available traffic on commercial principles. The committee came down in favour of greater freedom. This was more in line with the position in other sectors of the economy.Experience had shown how difficult it was for the Government to determineby regulation the best division of traffic between competing forms of transport the new legislation provides for the progressive relaxation of the licensing system for road transport and the final abolition in 1968 of the needs test. Atthe same time the railways will be relieved of their public service obligations and where, for reasons of national policy, they are required to maintain un-economic services, they will be reimbursed by the Government.Conclusions on Overseas Regulation of Road Transport of Goods4.29 In our investigations we have had to take account of the virtualunanimity of other industrial countries in applying restrictive controls to road transport. It is probably significant that nearly all these controls were introduced in the 1930&apos;s under the influence of the slump and were probably also influenced by each other. We note, however, that more recently the movement has beenaway from the more highly restrictive forms of control. The only case we know of where a Government is proposing to tighten up its control of road transport is in Portugal where stronger controls over own-account traffic are proposed.4.30 We were impressed in our survey of transport policies and practicesabroad by the evidence that the absence of restrictions on capacity, routes andpricing did not in fact seem to lead to the fearful conditions foreseen by many who put views to us. The experience in America and Australia of the unregulatedsectors of road transport here seemed to us to be of some significance, as did the views so painstakingly formed by the Swedish enquiry.4.31 The other major impression left on us by our survey of what is currentlydone abroad is that there are many different circumstances affecting transport policy in different countries. This may help to explain the diversity of systems of control in force.
Method of Approach5.1 We come now to the main part of our task the evaluation of the presentsystem of licensing. It would have been attractive to set out our views here on a progressive basis the role of licensing as seen by the Salter Conference; thetranslation of their ideas into statutory form; the performance of the system in achieving the purposes originally set for it; the adaptation of the system tochanging needs and circumstances; the ways in which it now might be adapted;and the other means there might be for attaining policy objectives.5.2 We found however that exposition on these lines cut across another and wethink more important line of analysis that is, the examination of licensingagainst the various aims of a system of regulation of road transport. Licensing isno end in itself, and its working cannot usefully be considered without firstdeciding its purposes. Once purposes are defined, licensing can be examined in the fight of them.5.3 We think the main possible objectives of government policy in regulatingroad transport of goods are:(i) the promotion of the safety of the public;(ii) the promotion of efficiency in road transport operations;(iii) the reduction of any harmful effects of road transport on amenity andenvironment;(iv) the promotion of increased use of available rail facilities for movementof goods;(v) the reduction or control of congestion on the roads.5.4 The safety of the public: Once above the lightest class of goods vehicle, theladen weight of lorries rises sharply. In this country the 174,500* in the 3-4 tonunladen weight class can by law run, and sometimes do so, at loaded weights over10 tons; while the heaviest lorries in the ordinary range i.e. up to say 9 tonsunladen will weigh as much as 28 tons laden. The speeds at which these vehiclesoperate continue to rise steadily. This increase in speed and the heavier weights ofgoods vehicles are inevitable and indeed proper steps along the path of technicalprogress. In a competitive world, we cannot afford to deny ourselves the con-siderable benefits that come from them. But the combination of weight and speedproduces vehicles which are capable of doing a great deal of harm to life, limband property. Government has a high responsibility therefore for seeing that heavy lorries are designed and maintained, driven and operated in such a way thatthey are as safe on the road as they can reasonably be made, having in mind theneed for efficiency as well.5.5 The efficiency of road transport: Road transport costs are a significant partof the cost of producing and distributing almost all goods. In effect, we devotenearly a tenth of our national effort to moving goods by road, rail and coastal
shipping*. This is a heavy call on our national resources. Anything that can be doneby government to increase the efficiency of the transport system, of which road transport is by far the preponderant part in the movement of goods, will havewide beneficial effects, not only in our export trade but also domestically.5.6 Impact on amenity and environment: There can be few in this country who do not make some personal use daily of a main road. It is on such roads that heavylorries largely run. There are now roughly half a million such lorries, each usuallyon the road every working day. So the heavy lorry can hardly fail to make itspresence widely felt; and the effect of this presence can be a nuisance on a large scale. Its total effect on our environment will depend to no small extent on howfar the lorry is noisy, smelly or an eyesore. Government control can bear on allthese aspects.5.7 Use of the railways: The country&apos;s past capital expenditure in railways hasbeen heavy, both originally by private investors and more recently in massivemodernisation with funds provided nationally. This investment has produced asystem of transport with a capacity to carry a larger share than at present of thecountry&apos;s goods. There would be some social advantage in terms of safety, amenityand road congestion, if this spare capacity were used more fully. There would, onthe other hand, usually be an uneconomic penalty to pay for the use of a means oftransport which the individual user had decided was not the best to meet his needs.5.8 Road Congestion: Rapid growth of the road vehicle population since 1945has put a heavy strain on the road system. Large increases in the road programmehave met the situation on some routes and at many of the worst points; but thetide of vehicles goes on rising apace, and forecasts are that it still has a long way togof. The rate and extent of its progress seem to be likely to be more than anyfeasible road programme can wholly meet in the foreseeable future. The prospectof widespread congestion, particularly in towns, presents a formidable problemnow and in the years ahead. It is a problem which it must be primarily forgovernment to tackle.Co-ordination5.9 It may at first seem strange that we do not include in our list of objectivesthe co-ordination of transport. The Salter Conference had this much in mind, andthe matter has continued to figure prominently in discussion of transport policyever since. It could be argued therefore that it should be regarded as perhaps theThe value of the total output of goods produced by the economy as a whole (includingimports) is shown in the National Income and Expenditure Blue Book. For 1962 the figure for agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction industries, and the distributive tradestotalled about  24,000m. (at market price). It is estimated that total expenditure on thetransport of goods by road, rail and coastal shipping in 1962 was about  2,100m. This figure includes all the inland transport expenses of farmers, manufacturers, building, mining etc.industries, and of wholesale and retail distributors. The expenditure on road transport aloneis estimated to be   1,700m. The source of this figure is Ministry of Transport Statistical PaperNo. 3 Highway Statistics 1963, H MSO (A detailed explanation of the basis for the estimate is given in the final paragraph of the introduction to that publication). The expenditure on railfreight transport in 1962 was  290m. (This figure is the total rail receipts from freight transportshown in the BTC annual Report and Accounts). An estimate of the expenditure on transportbetween the ports of Great Britain by coastal shipping is not at present available, but sincecoastal shipping performs about two thirds the amount of transport performed by the railwaysand is mainly engaged in the carriage of low priced bulk commodities, it is likely that expendi-turc on this form of transport is in the region of  100- 150m. Movements of goods by other forms of inland transport waterways, pipelines and airways, are relatively unimportant andthe expenditure on these forms of transport probably amounts only to  2 or  3m.fThc Transport Needs of Great Britain in the Next Twenty Years (Hall Report).
main aim of government in regulating road transport of goods, and that it was upto us to consider the question.5.10 However, co-ordination did not seem to us to be an aim separate anddistinct from those we have set out. Rather, the term &quot; co-ordination &quot; refers to apolicy embracing in varying degrees according to individual emphasis the severalpolicy aims we have considered. Although there is no general public consensus,in practice co-ordination is often taken to mean largely a policy of influencing thedistribution of traffic towards the greater use of rail. This particular aim of policyis one of the five set out in this Chapter, and examined in detail in Chapter 9.5.11 We therefore have nothing to say explicitly about co-ordination as such.We do not think we were called upon to do so. The balancing of the various possible objectives in transport policy is a matter for government decision. Ourenquiries inevitably covered but part of the complex of circumstances and measures bearing on transport. The appropriateness of our decision not toconsider co-ordination separately and explicitly is indeed confirmed by yourappointment of Lord Hinton to make a special study of co-ordination.Public Attitudes to the Policy Objectives5.12 We believe that there will be general agreement with the proposition thatthis country cannot afford to have any but a highly efficient transport system, andthat the efficiency of its transport system can have a profound effect on suchimportant matters as the performance of its industries in world markets and thesuccess of domestic policies of regional development. There will probably be littlequarrel with the proposition that the pursuit of efficiency in transport mustnevertheless have regard to the maintenance of high standards of safety to thepublic and those engaged in transport, and to the effect of transport development on amenity and environment. To the extent that the reduction of road congestionenhances the efficiency of road transport and curbs its harmful effects on environ-ment, this objective would also find general favour.5.13 On the other hand, the remaining objective the greater use of rail-is highly controversial. The social advantages of fewer lorries are clear to all. Theeconomic penalties of not using road transport may apply as universally, but oftenin ways not immediately obvious to the public. An extremely difficult balance hasto be struck. In view of what wc say in paragraph 5.10 above, we have not found itincumbent on us, or necessary for purposes of this report, to say where this balanceshould lie, or even to express views on it. All we seek to do, in Chapter 9 below, isto consider licensing and other measures as ways of influencing the balance.5.14 There may be other objectives which a government may well regard asbeing relevant to its transport policy. We feel sure, however, that our discussionof the licensing system in terms of the objectives we have set out above will bring out its most important effects and implications. It will also no doubt show a degree of inter-relation between these aims, in that the pursuit of any one maycontribute to or inhibit the achievement of another.5.15 In the following five chapters we propose to take in turn each of the objectives, and to examine the licensing system against it; to see in each casewhether it has contributed to achievement of the aim; whether some modificationof the system would enable it better to do so; and whether means other thanquantity control by licensing might be more effective instead.
Licensing and SafetyIntroduction6.1 Throughout the history of the present system of licensing, there has been an undercurrent of belief that there was a close connection between licensing and the safety of lorries. Since we think that a major and compelling aim ofgovernment in regulating the transport of goods by road should be the promoting-tion of a high degree of public safety, including the safety of those engaged inthe industry, it seems right to us to start our examination of the present licensing system by seeing how it has worked in the field of safety.THE SAFETY OF LORRIESThe Accident Record6.2 The road accident record of the heavy lorry is in some respects betterthan that of most other road users, bearing in mind the mileages run by each class of vehicle. A lorry of 1  tons or over will on average run 340,000 milesbefore being involved in an accident involving personal injury, while a car runsonly 265,000 miles.* But there is little reason for satisfaction on this account.The margin in favour of lorries is not large. Their size, weight and strengthmean that the accidents they do have are of greater rather than lesser severity.Thus a lorry is involved in a fatal accident every 7 million miles on average ascompared to 12 million miles for a car.6.3 Two factors suggest that it would be entirely reasonable to demand oflorries a safety record not just somewhat better than that of cars, but a greatdeal better. First, a high proportion of goods vehicles are driven full time byprofessionals, while cars are inevitably driven quite largely by people with much less experience. Second, the greater the potential danger of the tool, the greatershould be the safeguards and the care in its use.6.4 In the light of these considerations, the present safety record of the lorryis not what it should be. There are many good operators and drivers who do all they humanly can. But there are also many indifferent or bad ones.The Present Situation as Regards Lorry Maintenance, Safe Loading and Hoursof Drivers6.5 The difficulties of showing a direct correlation between road accidentsand any particular shortcoming of driver behaviour or vehicle equipment are well known. No material is available to us to show that the accidents in whichlorries have been involved can be attributed mainly to any particular cause*Ministry of Transport and Scottish Development Department, Road Accidents 1963.Table on Page xx (H M S O).
But there is no call to prove the clanger to the public of a heavy and laden lorry,running away on a lull for lack of brakes, or careering headfirst into oncomingtraffic as the over-tired driver nods off at the wheel. The obvious menace ofsuch situations is ample justification for any action to avert them wherever itseems likely that they may arise.6.6 As to the widespread possibility of such situations there is ample evidence.A series of special checks was conducted by your Ministry from July to October1964 outside major cities. At these checks 15,000 vehicles were examined,nearly 1,500 immediate prohibition notices were issued and nearly 7,000delayed notices. An immediate prohibition notice is issued if the defects in the vehicle are such as involve immediate risk to public safety. It will be seentherefore that 10 % of the lorries inspected were unfit to be on the road, and 45 %were less seriously defective.6.7 The figures reveal a shocking state of affairs, particularly since advancewarning was given of the towns where these checks would be conducted, sothat operators had ever)&apos; opportunity to put their vehicles in order. It must ofcourse be borne in mind that some effort was made deliberately to pull in thosevehicles which appeared to be in bad condition. But the same kind of figures have persistently been found in other roadside checks, and some of the licensing authorities have mentioned in their annual reports that checks in their areasconducted on a random basis showed no significant improvement in the figures.Every member of the Committee witnessed such a check, and saw for himselfhow important were the defects which were found.6.8 The bad maintenance situation is made worse by what is happening inother fields of lorry safety overloading and drivers&apos; excessive hours.6.9 Under present law, maximum permitted weights are governed only bythe number of axles of the vehicles. For example, a two-axle vehicle may legallyweigh up to 16 tons laden. No offence is committed below that weight, provided the load is well stowed and secured; yet such a weight may be greatly beyondthe design capacity and probably beyond the safety limits of the vehicle. Thelegal position can hardly fail to tempt operators to overload vehicles. Even thewell-intentioned have only a manufacturers recommendation as guidance as towhat their vehicles may safely carry; and as they know that this guidance isprobably over-cautious, they feel no compunction in disregarding it. We cannotdoubt that in practice many lorries carry more than is safe.6.10 This view is confirmed by the number of prosecutions taken for breach of maximum permissible weights.6.11 The danger of driving while tired is clear. The added danger when the vehicle is a heavy lorry is clearer still. The maximum permitted hours of drivingof a heavy lorry are therefore laid down by statute, explicitly for reasons ofpublic safety. To show that these hours are being observed, lorry drivers haveto keep records; and officers of your Department enforce both requirements bya process of checks and examinations, and where appropriate by prosecutions.6.12 We were told, by witnesses well placed to know, that the statutorylimits on drivers hours were widely disregarded, and that the system of enforce-ment through the examination of records was quite inadequate. Even as it is,the enforcement work of a staff of roughly 140 results in some 12,500 successful
prosecutions a year (4,000 for excessive hours, and 8,500 for failure to keep the required records. In the latter class of offence there is often good ground forsuspecting an offence of excessive hours also).6.13 There is an element of double counting in these figures because prose-cutions  may be brought against more than one person for a single offence.But they do indicate a serious situation. The evidence we received convincedus that breaches of the statutory limits on hours of driving are far too common.6.14 We are forced to conclude that safety regulations are disregarded far too frequently. The Salter Conference found in 1930 that the time had cometo tighten things up. So again do we.THE CONTRIBUTION OF LICENSING TO SAFETY6.15 The main government measures to secure the safety of road goods vehicles are direct. Statutes and regulations lay down safety rules and require-ments, and these are enforced by the police and by specially appointed officials.*The role of licensing in promoting safety is indirect. Opinions were expressed to us that this role had been two-fold: to create an incentive to good behaviourby providing a special &quot; trade&quot; penalty, through the power of licensing authorities to revoke, suspend or curtail a carriers licence; and to afford atleast enough protection from extremes of competition to allow those within theindustry to maintain their vehicles properly and to allow their drivers adequaterest.Use of Present System of Licensing as a Disciplinary Measure6.16 As regards the disciplinary function, we heard on all sides that fear of loss of use of a vehicle, through action in respect of its carriers licence, was thesanction most likely to have a powerful effect on a carriers behaviour. Thefines imposed by ordinary courts for most &quot; carriers&apos; &quot; offences were usuallywell worth paying for the financial gain from the offence (and from other likeoffences which went undetected). Violation of the limits on drivers&apos; hours oftengave additional use of expensive vehicles. The immediate and delayed prohibitionnotices served on unroadworthy vehicles were no great trouble to the owner.Only the loss of a licence would really hurt.6.17 The value of so powerful and feared a sanction as suspension orrevocation of a licence cannot be measured simply in terms of how far it is actually used. Its mere existence as a threat will always make it a considerablebut immeasurable deterrent. Even so its effect will be bound to depend to someextent on the real chance of its being applied. This chance is and has been inpractice so remote that we doubt whether fear of licence action has seriouslyinfluenced the behaviour of road transport operators in their attitude to safetymatters. For offences against safety, these are the figures of revocations andsuspensions:These include the Vehicle Examiners, the Driving and Traffic Examiners and the TrafficExaminers of the Ministry of Transport, and the Inspectors of Weights and Measures of LocalAuthorities.

We conclude thatlicensing is not at present having any appreciable disciplinary effect.The Argument that Licensing is a Protection against Disregard of Safety through&quot; Excessive &quot; Competition6.19 The same facts about the present widespread failure to observe safetyrequirements tell heavily with us in assessing how far licensing, by restricting&quot; excessive &quot; competition, has enabled operators to maintain proper safetystandards. These standards have not been kept up, so clearly licensing has not
by any means fully achieved this aim. It is more difficult to say whether, butfor licensing, matters would have been much worse or whether, through stricterlicensing, it could have been made much better. After most careful examinationof the modern history of road transport of goods, and consideration of the theory of the relation between restrictive licensing and safety, we conclude thatthere is little or nothing in the argument that licensing benefits safety by restrict-ing &quot; excessive &quot; competition. We think that licensing could have had little or no effect.6.20 In broad terms, the case made for control of quantity, to ensure safety,is that with unrestricted entry to the industry, competition would become sofierce that in a desperate struggle for survival, rates would be cut below thelevel of long term costs. Operators would then be forced to cut costs, and the safety features like maintenance and hours of drivers would be the first to suffer. Those who advance this argument in support of their case usually point to the improved conditions in the industry after the passing of the Road and rail Traffic Act in 1933.6.21 By the end of the 1920&apos;s, the road haulage of goods was both highlycompetitive and unregulated. Not only was there no regulation of competition,but also no restriction on drivers&apos; hours, no significant control on fitness of vehicles or their loading and no testing of drivers. Speed limits were honouredin the breach. With a similar lack of discipline over cars and buses, the toll of road accidents was high and growing alarmingly.6.22 It has also been said that the bankruptcy rate among hauliers at thetime was abnormally high, and a connection has been seen directly between this and the mounting number of accidents. In other words, both pointed to&quot; excessive &quot; competition.6.23 The legislation of the early 1930&apos;s (mainly the Road Traffic Acts of 1930and 1934, and the Road and Rail Traffic Act of 1933) dealt with both the direct and the indirect approaches to the problem. Safety requirements were laiddown in specific terms, and competition was curtailed by a system whoseobject was to limit the total supply of transport to something like the amountneeded to meet the demand.6.24 By 1939, the licensing system was fully under way. The situation in road transport of goods had manifestly improved. And so it was argued that it wasthe control of competition that had done the trick. But in fact had it, either inpart or in whole? The direct safety controls which had been imposedcould not have failed to have had some effect, and perhaps a great one. general economic circumstances had changed from the slump conditions of 1929-31 to more buoyant conditions of 1937-39. Detailed research into bankruptcies ofthe late 1920&apos;s has tended to show that the failures in road haulage were probably not abnormal. Road haulage was a newly developing industry, attractive to ex-Servicemen on demobilisation after the first World War. The industry was developing in a period of violent fluctuation in industrial activity, culminatingat the end of the decade in a vast and deep world depression. In these circum-stances a fair number of bankruptcies in the road haulage industry was probablyonly to be expected. Other occupations like that of small shop-keeping were suffering similarly.
6.25 Looking back, we see a &quot; growing up &quot; of the road haulage industryafter the Act of 1933, and the disappearance of quite a number of its adolescentblemishes. Quantity control by licensing had been introduced and served to restrict competition. But four other important factors were also at work.Parliament had imposed many direct controls on safety. Business confidence and activity had improved steadily. The firms in road haulage were themselveslearning from experience and were developing in commercial knowledge anddiscretion and in operating efficiency. And the motor industry had made greatstrides in producing safer sounder vehicles.6.26 That factors other than the introduction of the quantitative controlaspects of licensing were at work is suggested by what happened to the roadaccident records of lorries and cars between 1931 and 1936. The followingtable shows the figures:Rate per thousand vehicles	Goods Vehicles	0/ * /o	Cars	/o	All Motor Vehicles	Ol * 101931	67-7		55-5		66-1	1932	67-6	0	540	-3	64-2	-31933	70-4	4-4	52-7	-2	62-9	-21934	69-8	-11	50-2	-5	60-2	-41935	60-9	-13	42-0	-16	51-5	-141936	58-5	-4	39-3	-6	48-6	-6*%-Percentage change from previous year.6.27 It will be noted that while the lorry accident record was improving, sowas that of the car. This invites the conclusion that the forces at work wereapplying to both kinds of vehicle. The various direct measures such as theintroduction of speed limits and pedestrian crossings, and the improvement inthe technical quality of motor vehicles, were among such forces. If quantitycontrol of lorries, or indeed the whole carriers&apos; licensing system, had had any significant effect, it would have been reasonable to expect that the lorry recordwould have improved not just more or less parallel with that of the car but toa noticeably greater extent. It did not improve thus.6.28 Our study of past events, therefore, yields no direct evidence that the initial limitation of competition imposed by the Road and Rail Traffic Act of1933 had any appreciable effect on safety.6.29 As this is however only a verdict of &quot; not proven &quot;, we went on to try to analyse and probe the theory of the argument, and also to look around forother evidence.6.30 As to the theory that limitation of competition is beneficial to safety,we conclude that it is ill-founded.6.31 Although the licensing system tends to reduce the pressure of competitionit has not eliminated it within the industry. Operators have an incentive andare under some pressure to cut their costs. However, there are many ways theycan do this. Some put great effort into achieving high efficiency in operation;
others economise on premises; others pay great heed to their vehicles; othersincrease their drivers&apos; hours and cut down vehicle maintenance; others takelower profits. All these courses are open to an operator, and which he choosesdepends on the man. Moreover even where conditions allow operators to makelarge profits there is no guarantee that some operators, in search of still higherprofits, may not cut their expenditure on maintenance or exceed the limits ondrivers&apos; hours. We are convinced that it is the sense of responsibility of theoperator, and not the licensing system, which mainly determines the priority hegives to good maintenance and observance of drivers&apos; hours.6.32 To sum up on the safety aspects of the present licensing system, weconclude that it has had no appreciable effect, directly or indirectly, on prevailingsafety standards.POSSIBLE MODIFICATION OF LICENSING TOSECURE GREATER SAFETY6.33 If our conclusions above are right, it follows that no modification ofthe technique of quantity control, by discretionary proof of need, would have any effect on road safety. We can see no way of modifying the system in a way which would ensure that the benefits road hauliers obtained by protecti on iromcompetition would be spent on safety measures.6.34 The role of licensing in the field of safety is disciplinary, as a sanction to secure that lorries are sent on to the roads in a proper state, driven byresponsible men who have not been too long at the wheel.6.35 The opinions expressed to us by many witnesses leave no doubt thatthe disciplinary force of removal or suspension of a licence to ply as a carriercan be very high. We can think of no more effective deterrent to breach of thelaw by lorry operators. All other measures are of much less consequence. Finesare often well worth paying, for the financial gain which the breach of law hasmade possible. Gaol sentences would certainly have a salutary effect; but theCourts would always be reluctant to take this extreme action for offences ofthis character. Prohibition of use of vehicles which are unfit carries no directfinancial penalty, and often only means that repair work, which was inevitableanyway, is at last done. Even a lorry subject to an immediate prohibition noticemay go legally on its way once unloaded, subject only to possible prosecutionunder different statutory powers.* Moreover it may go on its way loaded, in defiance of an immediate prohibition, once the examiners have gone, subject only to the risk (which may in present circumstances be negligible) of beingstopped again on the road.6.36 At the present time there can be no doubt that the public and the manyresponsible and law-abiding lorry operators would benefit greatly from thevigorous use of licence action to secure good behaviour. Many who appeared before us or who gave written evidence agreed with this view.6.37 While there is therefore no benefit to safety in keeping a quantitativelicensing system, we regard it as essential to keep some form of permit (evenin simplest form available initially on demand and held for as long as it is notrevoked or suspended) so that the right to ply as a carrier, whether of his owner others&apos; goods, can be revoked, suspended or curtailed. The essential condition*We understand that your Department is already aware of this situation, and has noted thepoint for consideration in any future amending legislation.
of such a permit would be that the holder should abide by the requirements ofthe law as regards safety; and for any oreach of these requirements, he wouldbe fully liable not only to the ordinary processes in the courts for the offencehe had committed, but also to lose all or some of his right to continue tocarry goods.6.38 The influence of this sanction will depend on the likelihood of its use inpractice. At least until there is a marked improvement in those aspects of lorrysafety which we have criticised, the power to revoke, suspend or curtail a permit should be used sufficiently frequently and widely for every operator torealise that his livelihood is in very real jeopardy if he does not conform tothe safety regulations. In this imperfect world fear of the consequences is aspur to endeavour which should be used. These consequences should not onlychastise the wicked but also discourage any thought of falling back by those withdwindling firmness of purpose.Enforcement of Suspension or Revocation6.39 If powers of suspension and revocation of permits were used more widely, there would be a further problem of enforcement of the penalty. Itwould therefore be necessary to see that those who had had their permits taken away did not continue to operate without a permit, nor obtain a new one underanother guise.6.40 To prevent evasion of the penalty for plying without a permit, a much larger and more readily visible form of permit plate, perhaps akin to thepresent excise registration plate, would be useful. There would be one suchplate per vehicle licensed, and the plate would be removed from the vehicle if a prohibition notice were issued or if the carriers permit in respect of the vehiclewere revoked, suspended or curtailed. Any vehicle then running without a permit would be particularly conspicuous (just as one without a number plateis conspicuous at present).6.41 It would be more difficult to cope with those who sought to evade the impact of suspension or revocation by applying in a different trading guise fora new permit in place of one suspended or revoked. (This position can alreadyarise with C licensed operators under the present system. It does not seem tohave done so in practice simply because there has been so little revocation,suspension or curtailment of licences). The difficulty might be met by a combina-tion of measures. The application for a permit could include a declaration thatthe applicant was not currently under any revocation, suspension or curtailmentorder. In addition, there could be a further declaration that he was not directlyconnected in business with anyone who had lost his permit. As a further safe-guard the applicant could at the discretion of the Licensing Authority berequired to declare the names of the shareholders, of the directors and of the holders of the main management posts in the firm, the firnfs address and the address where the vehicles were normally kept. False declaration could be severely punished. Correct declarations should be sufficient to reveal any significant participation in the firm&apos;s affairs by anyone barred temporarily orfor longer term from holding a permit. For any who got through the net, therewould be the ever present risk of detection from visits to premises by those responsible for the law relating to the hours of work of drivers or the mainten-
ance of vehicles in good condition. The system might not be wholly proofagainst determined evasion by any one prepared to commit a criminal offence.But we think it could without too much elaboration put formidable difficultiesin the way of anyone trying to evade the regulations.Duplication of Punishment6.42 We have considered at some length whether the disciplinary powers ofthe Licensing Authorities, exercised after an offence has already been punishedby the Courts, constitute a second punishment, which might be held to be inequitable. No one complained to us on these lines, though the situation hasstood ever since licensing was introduced. There seems no case for any change.The punishment by the Courts is for disobedience of the law of the land. any action by the Licensing Authorities is designed to see that the commercial useof vehicles with great potential for danger to the public is allowed only to thosewho continue to show themselves to be fit and proper persons thus to be trusted.The two functions are quite separate. We would not be attracted by either ofthe alternatives giving Magistrates&apos; Courts the power to take away a carrierspermit or giving Licensing Authorities the power to fine for breaches of the safety regulations and turning them into hauliers&apos; courts.Duality of the Licensing Authority&apos;s Role6.43 On one aspect alone of the Licensing Authority&apos;s disciplinary role doesa change seem desirable. At present the Vehicle Examiners and Traffic Examinersare under his control. These officials detect the offences, bring the prosecutions,and give evidence in the Magistrates&apos; Courts; and if disciplinary licensing action is taken they in effect play the same parts before the Licensing Authority acting as a judge. This amounts to making the Licensing Authority judge and jury,prosecutor and policeman, all in the same case. This situation does not seem infact to have worked unfairly, but in principle we regard it as unsound, as do the licensing Authorities themselves. It would be advisable to preserve the manifestimpartiality of the Licensing Authorities when exercising their disciplinaryfunction, by relieving them of their responsibility to control the enforcementstaffs.Responsibility for Safe Operation6.44 In the course of our study of enforcement of the safe condition of lorries,we were frequently struck by the problem of responsibility. Drivers often knewtheir lorries were in poor shape; but their job was to drive, not to maintain;and when they reported defects, they might well be told to get on with the jobthey were employed to do. Indeed it was clear that in some cases the frequentreporting of defects by drivers was unwelcome to employers, and that thesedrivers soon found their jobs at risk if they persisted in drawing attention to theneed for repairs. Maintenance staffs were not always given the necessary oppor-tunities to carry out their vital work, and the demands of the traffic departmentoften had higher priority. Often those ultimately responsible for the conduct ofthe business did not know of the true state of their vehicles, and would havebeen horrified to find out the truth. (We came across cases where this was so).6.45 If an order of revocation, suspension or curtailment of a licence of asmall firm is made, clearly those at the top of that firm will soon get to know.
But where the firm is large, perhaps national in scale, licence action might applyto only a small and local part of what they were doing. The directors or topmanagement might then be wholly unaware of local events.6.46 It is essential that a proper system of supervision be set up in everyoperators business to make sure that no unsafe vehicle is put upon the road.To meet this situation, we considered whether the permit should be personalto some senior official of the firm, or even to the top man himself. Then any proceedings could easily be brought most forcibly to the attention of someonewith adequate power to take appropriate action. But the cause of disciplinary action would usually be day to day matters for which top management was entitled to delegate responsibility, and for which it might not be fair to punishthe top men personally.6.47 The point would be met if the application form for a permit had toshow the name of the owner of the firm or a director of the company as applicantand he had to acknowledge personally in writing any notice sent of permitaction taken or threatened by the Licensing Authority. The same proceduremight with advantage be used when a prohibition notice was served following a check of a vehicle^ roadworthiness. Action on these lines would not be unfairin principle nor unduly burdensome to those with wide and heavy responsibilities.But it could hardly fail to ensure that top management knew what was going on in the lower reaches of their organisations; and this would be bound to havea salutary effect.MEASURES OTHER THAN LICENSING FOR EFFECTING SAFETY6.48 A permit system to provide a sanction in safety matters is of highimportance. But this does not mean that it is the only way to achieve safety, oreven the most important way. The safety features which we have considered(good maintenance of vehicles, loading within safe limits and observance of statutory limits on hours of drivers) can also be brought about by direct enforce-ment. This would include advice, caution or, in the last resort, prosecutions inthe Magistrates&apos; Courts.Maintenance of Lorries6.49 We know that the maintenance of lorries is a matter to which yourDepartment and the industry are giving much attention. From what we haveourselves seen and heard, we fully endorse the need for this action. We welcomeyour intention to introduce a system of annual inspection for heavy lorriesthough we are sure that these must be regarded as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the random roadside checks which have been the main approach to this problem in the past. We would see great advantage in the extension ofthese random checks, some being surprise checks, others announced in advance.Such checks, even if they do not catch all defective vehicles passing by, should at least ensure that a man driving a lorry he knows to be defective will, if he isnot caught in the net, realise that he has had a lucky escape and will so informthe owner when the vehicle reaches its base.6.50 There would also be advantage in increasing the trouble to which alorry owner is put if his vehicle is found at a roadside check to be defective.Indeed he should be positively penalised to some extent for being thus caught.
It should certainly not be sufficient as it is at present, that unloading the vehicleshould then allow him if he wishes to go back on the road with the vehicleunder its own power. If the vehicle is a danger when loaded, it is not usuallymuch less so when empty. We would also envisage that any lorry subject to a prohibition notice should have confiscated its permit plate (which we suggestedin paragraph 6.40). The plate would only be returned when the vehicle hadbeen put right and inspected. Moreover, it would be useful if a fee with a penalelement in it were charged for return of the plate, and if perhaps a &quot; ticket&quot;system of fining (with suitable appeal procedure) were considered.Overloading of Lorries6.51 We are informed that your Department is working on the developmentof a scheme of limits to the loaded weight of a lorry much more precise thanthat contained in present regulations. We understand that under this scheme(known colloquially as &quot; the plating scheme&quot;) all lorries would have to carry areadily visible plate showing the maximum permitted loaded weight of the vehicle. In fixing this weight account would be taken of the main safety factorsof the vehicle braking capacity, strength of suspension and chassis, tyres andprobably also the power to weight ratio. The full introduction of such a scheme should help materially to stop the dangerous practice of overloading. To be fully effective the plating scheme would of course need to be backed up byan adequate enforcement effort, and this would involve the provision of weighingequipment on a wider scale than at present. It would also be appropriate thatpenalties for overloading should be quick and immediately deterrent. Forinstance, the permit plate we propose should be removed at once from anyvehicle found overloaded; and recovery of the plate when the overload hasbeen removed should be subject to the same procedure as we set out in thepreceding paragraph relating to defective vehicles.Drivers&apos; Hours6.52 The enforcement of the drivers&apos; hours regulations should clearly be strengthened. We have noted that you have already taken steps in this direction;and these measures accord well with our ideas on this aspect of safety. It wouldalso be right that an operator found guilty of any lack of due diligence in securing observance by his drivers of the statutory hours should find himself at great risk of having his carriers permit suspended in whole or in part in additionto any punishment which the Courts might inflict. Over-driving is a most dangerous practice, and any owner who procures or condones it should be madeto realise that by so doing he is jeopardising his carriers permit.Licensing of Lorry Drivers6.53 A heavy lorry can be a particularly menacing vehicle if not well driven.More is called for than the skills and attitude of the ordinary motorist. Weunderstand that it is intended to reintroduce a special driving licence for heavylorries, and we welcome this step. The existence of such a licence, apart from itsother considerable merits, would make it possible to apply to drivers guilty of safety offences a discipline similar to that which revocation, suspension orcurtailment of a carriers permit would provide in respect of his employer. In
this way the fringe of drivers whose behaviour does not match their responsibility-ities could be cut off, to the advantage of the good reputation of the heavy lorrydriver as well as to the benefit of the public at large.Qualification Requirements for Hauliers6.54 A measure which was put to us which might have possible advantageso far as safety was concerned was that would-be hauliers should have to give some proof of their knowledge and understanding of the job and what itentailed, before being granted a permit. Haulage gives a deceptive first impression of simplicity as an occupation. Some of the dangerous practices which fromtime to time arise in it probably owe something to lack of awareness of thelaw and of good techniques of safe operation. It was suggested to us that some kind of entry qualification with a syllabus covering for instance the elements of road transport law and of vehicle maintenance would be beneficial.6.55 Under such a system, new entrants would know from the outset the standards of behaviour with which they would have to comply and what thisentailed. Since some period of study would be essential, the casual and irres-ponsible entrant would be deterred.6.56 Something akin to this idea is widely practised abroad. It is in its most highly developed form in the Netherlands (where qualifications are requiredfor entry into most occpations). Most other European countries have some kind of scrutiny of individuals before they are allowed to become hauliers. Thecase for education before entry is stronger where ignorance in plying a trademay endanger the public.6.57 On the other hand, there can be no doubt that men have entered and do enter haulage in this country at present, and carry out their responsibilitieswell, although they might find difficulty in coping with some form of examina-tion on a prescribed syllabus. They make good hauliers and the country wouldbe the loser for debarring such men.6.58 While we do not recommend the prescription of an entry qualificationat present, a voluntary training scheme for those already in the haulage business would have merit. So too would the setting up of appropriate courses on a voluntary basis for those who wish to enter the industry. The former kind oftraining will probably flow from the bringing into effect, in respect of the road transport industry, of the Industrial Training Act. The same machinery might also encourage or stimulate the provision of training facilities for aspiringhauliers.6.59 It was also put to us that besides being professionally qualified, a newentrant should be required to put down a sum of money on deposit as evidenceof his substance. The connection with safety of this proposal seems at bestremote. In practice we see nothing to commend it. If the money were depositedbeyond the reach of the new entrant, he would in effect have had to freeze asubstantial sum of capital which might much better have been used to sec himthrough his early and difficult period in the industry. If the deposit were allthat stood between him and entry to the industry, he would be put under heavy pressure to borrow it, perhaps at a heavy rate of interest, so that it was amillstone round his neck.
COST OF ENFORCING SAFETY RULES6.60 The combination of all the approaches we envisage would bring abouta much higher degree of safety. But all would require expenditure on manpower and equipment on a scale far greater than present levels. This should not beallowed to be an obstacle. It would be appropriate that the industry should bear the ultimate cost, through fees or penalties, just as the costs of the presentlicensing system and the enforcement of drivers&apos; hours, and the costs of roadsidechecks, are borne through the fees paid for carriers licences. The saving of thecost of the present system of quantitative control by licensing would of itselfpay for a considerable increase in direct enforcement effort.THE ROLE OF THE COURTS6.61 Wc do not question the desirability of maintaining the independence of the judiciary and we would be unwilling to see any instructions given to the magistrates except by the superior Courts. We feel however that more couldbe done to bring home to the Magistrates the greater danger to all other users of the road of a defective or overloaded vehicle, or one driven by a tired driver.SUMMARY AND conclusions.62 The present system of licensing has not been responsible for bringing about an appropriate degree of observance of safety of lorries. We can see no practical way of altering the system of quantity control to achieve greatersafety. However a permit to carry goods, unrelated to quantity control, has a vital place as a disciplinary measure, which should be widely used. The annualinspection of heavy vehicles and increased roadside checks would be valuable.Vehicles found defective at these inspections and checks or overloaded couldbe stripped of their permit plate. Operators persistently offending and foundcontravening regulations on drivers hours should be deprived of their carrierspermit. This would generally be a more reliable deterrent than a fine of any amount which seems likely to be passed by Parliament or imposed by theCourts. Steps might also be taken to ensure that the Courts are aware of the seriousness of offences against safety. If sufficiently used these measures shouldlargely eliminate the fringe of reckless drivers and irresponsible operators.
Licensing and Efficiency7.1 The second policy objective against which we assess licensing is the promotion of the efficiency of road transport of goods. We define &quot; efficiency &quot;by saying that it would be at its maximum when the road transport of goodswas being carried out effectively, to meet the diverse and varying needs of itscustomers, with the minimum demand on national resources, while maintainingstringent standards of safety and appropriate working conditions for those employed.Measurement of Efficiency7.2 It is easier to say what we mean by efficiency than to measure efficiencyitself. It may be possible to compare some aspects of the efficiency of two firms in the same line of business, but this would not help us here. Nor is thcie muchscope for comparison between road transport in different countries, since basiccircumstances vary so widely. The best we can do is to consider a number of factors from which it may be possible to deduce whether the efficiency of road transport of goods in this country would be greater in the absence of quantitycontrol by licensing.7.3 To the casual observer, road transport of goods presents an encouragingimpression of efficiency. As we have said already (Chapter 3) there was no sig-significant element of customer dissatisfaction in evidence to us (though this mightowe something to the freedom of the user to run his own vehicles if that werethe only way he could get the service he wanted, and to the absence of any otheryardstick by which to make comparisons). There is certainly competition in theindustry. Generally if one haulier fails to give good service, there is a competitorready and willing to step into his place. It must be recognised however that suchcompetition is almost entirely confined to those already established within the licensing system competition from new entrants plays hardly any part. Theindustry has seemed alert to new needs, and not slow to adopt new techniques(e.g. the use of specialised vehicles for carriage of bulk materials though here the lead has often been given by the own account operator). There has been no serious suggestion of a crying need for new blood to invigorate the industry.7.4 It would be wrong however to judge the industry and the effects of licensed-sing solely on this basis. Measurement of efficiency is hardly practical. There isalso little evidence of the effect on efficiency of different arrangements in othercountries. Our examination of the relationship between licensing and efficiencytherefore depends greatly on our views about the implications of the principal features of the present system of quantity control by licensing. We can discernthe direction in which licensing tends to work where efficiency is concerned,even if we cannot measure the effect.Limits imposed by Licensing7.5 Every form of licence in one way or another restricts the licence holder.For the A licensee his declared &quot; normal user &quot; sets a framework for his oper-ations from which he can only depart to a marginal extent. If he wishes to change
his work profoundly, he must put his licence at risk by reapplying, and for major changes objection to a grant is more than likely from those already in orlaying claim to his new trade. He can hardly be blamed therefore for not seekingchange. The A Contract licensee is firmly tied to one customer only and so mustforego any opportunities for more intensive use of his vehicle which would arise from carrying goods for others. The B licensee is confined to the conditions ofhis licence, and this may give him greater or less scope but never complete freedom. For him, the return load is denied unless it comes within his conditions.The C licensee can carry only for himself.*7.6 This certainly seems to be a formidable series of restrictions. Could it bethat in fact the reality of restriction was less than it appeared? In other words,perhaps operators in various licence categories were content with the limitedfreedom they already had, since they would have been hard put to it in practice to make use of greater freedom. This was the argument of the C licensedoperators&apos; representatives when they said that in general they did not seek tobe able to carry for hire or reward. They said that most C licensed operators rantheir own vehicles to meet their own special need; and that they would not be interested in interrupting the smooth flow of performance in meeting these needsjust to seek out loads for profit. But even this argument was not completelyadhered to. For instance, it was represented to us by a number of organisationsthat the freedom conferred upon a holding company in respect of subsidiariesat least 90% owned should be extended to subsidiaries which were majorityowned. Such proposals would hardly have been made had it not been that thepresent arrangement inhibits operations.7.7 It is probably true that for many C operators greater use of vehicle capacitycan only be achieved by reducing the standard of service more than is acceptable.But it would also be surprising if there were found in practice to be no usefuleconomies, over the country as a whole, from C licensed operators looking aroundto find others whose road transport requirements could be fitted in well withtheir own. The present limitation, which has held for 30 years, has inhibited Coperators from this pattern of thought, and therefore from actively looking foropportunities.7.8 Greater freedom would not amount to turning all traders or manufac-turcrs into hauliers. The own account operator has a very firm priority and a fairly rigid starting position his first duty is to meet his own firm&apos;s needs.What he might gain from a return load would cost him dear if he thereby upsethis own movement programme. But so far as there are movements on the behalfof others which he could fit in with his own, and thereby avoid some empty or part loaded running, we are sure that present licensing must be an impedimentto efficiency. And in so far as his own needs fluctuate, and he finds it desirableto keep enough lorries to cope with his peak demands, at other times his fleet islikely to be under used.7.9 On all sides too we found dissatisfaction with the &quot; normal user &quot; arrange-ments for A licences. The hauliers&apos; associations and the hauliers themselves whogave evidence to us were unhappy about the restrictions which &quot; normal user &quot;*Unless he is a holding company with at least a 90% holding of the issued share capital of a subsidiary or subsidiaries, in which case a degree of freedom to use each company&apos;s vehiclesunder the holding company&apos;s c licence can be obtained by application to the licensing authority.
attached to what they clearly felt ought to have been the (original) concept of a licence freely to ply anywhere, any time, with anything. So much feeling could hardly have been generated against a purely &quot; paper &quot; restriction. It must havebeen against the real restriction imposed by &quot; normal user &quot; that hauliers werecomplaining.General Effects on Efficiency of Licensing Restrictions7.10 The various licensing restrictions are bound to have a considerablebearing on efficiency. First, competition will inevitably be lessened. Second, themost efficient use of vehicles will from time to time be inhibited. Third, speed ofadaptability to new situations and needs will be reduced.7.11 Competition is a considerable spur to efficiency. And competitioncertainly exists in road haulage, sometimes to a fierce extent, sometimes less so.But licensing inevitably prevents new men and firms from entering the industry as and when opportunity seems to them to be present. And it must also inhibitthe expansion or redirection of the operations of existing firms. (From what we heard in evidence, the influence on new entry is greater than that on expansionor redirection). In tending therefore to prevent these changes in particular partsof the haulage market, the licensing system must make it easier for the less efficient to hold their place, and more difficult for those more efficient to displacethem. The restriction of competition also creates a situation more conducive tothe operation of restrictive arrangements and understandings of a kind likely tobe adverse to efficiency.7.12 The imposition of more or less stringent restrictions on the use to whicha lorry can be put must also frequently reduce the efficiency of its operation. in considering the question of load factors (Chapter 3), we have shown that theproportion of full-load running of a lorry is not necessarily an appropriate mcas-ure of efficiency. But obviously the aim of minimum use of transport resourcesis more nearly achieved the more any one vehicle is used. Efficiency as we havedefined it can only be less if licensing means, as it often docs, that two vehicleshave to be used where one would do. This view is confirmed by the steady streamof applications for full A licences by A Contract operators who produce as evidence the pressure of their customers for the lower rates which more workfor their vehicles would make possible; and in the intermittent attempts by Clicensed operators to break into the hire or reward field for basically the same reason.7.13 A third effect of licensing restrictions on efficiency is that the ability ofhauliers to adapt quickly to the changing needs of their customers must bereduced. The haulage services required by trade and industry are ever-changing,often at short notice. A ship carrying imports which normally came to Londonmay be diverted to Liverpool, which may be beyond the conditions of a Blicensed haulier who has for long served a particular importer. Or the trader maychange his supplier to one from another part of the country. His regular hauliercan only continue to serve him if he can survive the process of getting his licenceconditions changed. If he cannot, the trader must find a new haulier with whom he must build up that mutual understanding which is essential to efficiency.7.14 All the effects of licensing on efficiency which we have discussed abovemust find their reflection in costs and hence in prices. It is not possible for us to
say by how much costs and prices are raised by the system. The effects of thesystem cannot in general be measured, or their relative importance established,by reference to observed events and situations. It is in the nature of things thatthese effects have to be inferred from the nature of the restrictions; and the severity of the restrictions is largely a matter of judgement. We think that the adverse effects of licensing on efficiency and the prices of haulage services are sufficiently important to be a serious criticism of the system.The Control of Capacity and the Price of Licences7.15 It was the opinion of some of those who gave evidence to us that, partic-particularly since the change of emphasis in the proof of need was made in 1953, the licensing system had not in practice significantly affected the availability ofhaulage capacity. But our impression is that within this broad situation there arecircumstances in which the system has been restrictive. A possible index of theextent to which licensing has this effect would be the scarcity value of a haulagelicence. Although licences cannot at law be transferred by sale*, we were told that licences in fact have a market value, and that in recent years the price of Alicences in some transactions has been as high as  300 a licensed ton. Oneinterpretation would be that these prices represent the capitalised value of theadditional profits secured by licence-holders by virtue of their ownership of the licences in a situation of restricted total supply. New entrants or establishedfirms wishing to increase their capacity apparently have been willing to paysuch prices. If this interpretation were correct, the prices paid for licences wouldbe a direct measure of the severity of the control of capacity by licensing.7.16 In practice the purchase of the licence is not a separate transaction. It istied up with the purchase of a going concern (the licence of a dead business isworthless, as the Licensing Authority will not agree to its transfer to a newowner) and the value-of-licence element in the total price paid would not normally be stated separately or be easily calculable by a third party.7.17 A realistic measurement of the current scarcity value of licences indifferent parts of the industry is elusive, and we have no systematic data. But wearc satisfied that in many transactions a price is paid in effect for the specialvalue of the licence held by the sellers. It has been put to us that in many or mostof these transactions where there appears to have been a payment for thelicence as such, the buyer paid the price because of his failure, as a newcomer,to understand the working of the licensing system, with the resultant tendency for him to have an exaggerated view of the difficulties of obtaining a licencewithout payment (except for the fee) by application to the Licensing Authority.Even if it were the case that all or most payments for licences were misguidedand unnecessary, it would suggest that the licensing system is regarded by new-comers as if it were sufficiently restrictive to warrant material payments tocircumvent its rigours and to secure a place within its shelter. Misguided pay-ments for licences have no doubt been made in some cases, but we do doubt whether they have been common. We are impressed by the fact that relatively*But a new licence is granted without further question to the purchaser of an existingbusiness provided that the Licensing Authority is satisfied that the business is a going concern.And where the purchase of the business is by way of the shares in a company, the nominalholding of the licence is unchanged, so no question of transfer arises.
few A licences have in recent years been issued to newcomers. Moreover, ignor-ance of the system cannot explain the frequent transactions in which oneestablished haulage firm buys the business of another and pays a price which includes something for its licences. We conclude that in some parts of theindustry control has been restrictive. To the extent that quantitative control bylicensing curtails the volume of road haulage services, we would expect the pricesof these services for this reason alone to be higher, the difference reflecting theadvantage conferred on those fortunate enough to have been granted licences to serve a market in which supply is restricted.The Bias Imparted by Licensing to Own Account Operation7.18 The inevitable delays and considerable complexity of licensing are inour view a partial explanation of the decisions of many traders to use their ownvehicles rather than those of hauliers. They must often have felt that any minordisadvantage of running their own transport was to be offset against the troublesand inflexibilities of having their goods carried by a haulier whose licence wouldhave to be extended to deal with an increase in their traffic, or adjusted to cope with a change in its character. If they used their own vehicles, details of their commercial operations remained in their own confidence. If they wanted to use a haulier their operations and their plans might well have to be disclosed in opencourt, to the advantage of their competitors; and there might well be delaybefore the additional vehicles were available.7.19 We think that the whole procedure of control of licences for haulagehas tended to bias traders in favour of using their own vehicles under C licence;and that this is part though by no means all of the explanation of the growth ofthe number of C vehicles in recent years. To the extent that this bias has been present, it has added to the number of vehicles operating under the mostrestrictive category of licence. In this way the restrictive system of licensing ofhauliers has reduced overall transport efficiency: by increasing the share of trafficcarried in lorries most restricted as to use, it has increased the volume of vehiclemovements on the roads.The Case for Quantity Control by Licensing as an Aid to Efficiency7.20 We have set out above the adverse effects of restrictive licensing onefficiency, with the consequential tendency for transport costs to be higher thanthey would be otherwise, to the detriment of users and the economy as a whole.It has been put to us, on the other hand, that users of road transport derivebenefit or advantage from licensing because, without it, conditions in the road haulage industry would be such as to have harmful effects.7.21 It has been suggested that without controls on entry and capacity,competition would be so fierce that rates would often be at uneconomic levels,that there would be a rapid turnover of small firms, and that chronic excesscapacity would emerge. The industry, it is said, would be intolerably unstablein its composition; quality of service would go down with uneconomic rate-cutting; and efficient firms would withdraw from an unprofitable industry. Theindustry, furthermore, would not be able to render the &quot; public service &quot;expected of it.
7.22 We do not accept this analysis. It is not supported by our reading of theearlier history of the industry in this country, when allowance is made for the underlying economic conditions at the time, and for the rapid growth of theindustry in its early years. The lesson of foreign experience, though limited bythe rarity of instances anywhere in the world of uncontrolled road haulage, alsogoes against the analysis. Moreover, the pessimistic view of the working ofuncontrolled competition does not in our view take adequate account of majorelements of stability in several of the main markets for transport services. Wewere impressed by evidence that many users put a high value on continuity ofservice and business connections and on dependability of service. Again, thesmall-scale new entrant is unable to enter markets where large-scale operations are essential or offer real economies. Uneconomic rate-cutting, even if it were to occur in fringe markets, would be unlikely to undermine efficient operations inthe major sectors of the industry where customers&apos; preferences for quality and stability are important. Where quality and continuity of service are important to users, regulation of entry or of capacity is not necessary because the behaviour of the users themselves will bring about the required stability; and wherequality and continuity are not demanded by users, there is no need for controlsto impose stability in their interest, and no case to impose them for the then solebenefit of those who have chosen haulage as their livelihood.Haulage as a &quot; Public Service &quot;7.23 We have had no evidence that the &quot; public service &quot; provided by road transport under licensing is different from that of any other service providedcommercially to the public: haulage firms are not required by their licences tosupply at a loss some services to particular users or to assume extra-commercialobligations. It seems unlikely that, without quantity control by licensing, theroad haulage industry would discontinue or reduce any of the services it pro-vides at present.Control of Pates as an Aid to Efficiency7.24 It has been suggested to us that, while quantity control by licensing is unnecessary to ensure stability of the road haulage industry in the interest ofusers, there is nevertheless a serious risk that some rate-cutting may be un-economic and undesirable, and that this should be avoided by the imposition ofa system of minimum rates. As we have explained above, however, we do notbelieve that rate-cutting would have adverse effects on users and the economysuch that public intervention was required. A practicable system of minimum rates for transport services would be very cumbersome and costly to operate and enforce. It would also be likely, if effectively enforced, to impede the flexi-bility of pricing which is necessary for efficient adjustment by hauliers to theever-changing and particular business circumstances to which each is exposed.Direct Costs of Licensing7.25 On the effect of licensing on costs and prices, there is the final point thatthe application and objection procedures for haulage licences must of themselvesimpose additional costs. The cost of the Government^ side of the system (i.e.of the Licensing Authorities and their stalls) is recouped through fees for carriers&apos;
licences, bringing in some  lm. a year (of which about  400,000 is attributable to the costs of enforcing maintenance of vehicles and observance of drivers&apos;hours.) The cost to the industry is not only these fees, however, but also the costs of legal representation, of witnesses at enquiries, and of management timeand effort devoted to the licensing side of the business. We cannot quantify thiscost, but we are sure that it can be appreciable, if not invariably at least inparticular cases.Summary and Conclusions7.26 While the road transport of goods gives no outward appearance ofinefficiency, the limitations on vehicle use imposed by the present licensing system inevitably cause waste and hence higher costs and prices. The system alsoreduces flexibility of operation and restricts competition. Its control of thehaulage part of the industry promotes the growth of own account operations.Its procedures are themselves an added cost. We do not accept the idea that bycontrolling competition, the present system of licensing promotes efficiency.The system impedes efficiency in important ways, and thereby imposes a sig-significant economic burden.
Licensing and AmenityThe Physical Effect of Road Transport on Environment8.1 The reduction of the adverse effects of road traffic on amenity is the thirdof the policy objectives against which we judge control of road transport of goodsby licensing.8.2 There can be no gainsaying that lorries are usually much noisier than most other road vehicles; their big engines necessarily discharge large volumes ofexhaust fumes into the atmosphere; and they are also obtrusive because of their size. They can become a public nuisance, offending ear, nose and eye. The lorryis not the perfect servant going almost unseen and unheard about its business. Itoften makes a rough, unpleasing, and perhaps unhealthy impact on people as individuals and on environment at large. Its points of contact with us all are manyand almost inescapable.Noise8.3 The report of the Wilson Committee on Noise* has much to say on the noise caused by road traffic in general, and heavy commercial vehicles in par-ticular. A study carried out in Central London showed that road traffic was the predominant cause of noise at 84% of the survey points. 36% of people questionedwere disturbed by traffic noise when at home and 20% when outdoors. TheBuchanan Report gave an cxamplef of a modern office block where the level ofnoise due to traffic was well above the level at which conversation can con-venicntly be carried on. There can be no doubt that noise is a serious nuisance,particularly in towns, and that heavy lorries are among the main contributors. as more knowledge is gained, a connection between noise and health may also befound to exist.Exhaust Gases8.4 The Buchanan Report also stresses:!&quot;, the nuisance caused by engine fumes incities. These fumes are certainly unpleasant to inhale and may well be a danger to health. And the size of lorry engines means that each heavy lorry is producing atleast 3 times as much exhaust gas as the average 1A litre car.8.5 When for any reason the lorry exhaust contains an excess of unburnt fuel,the exhaust gases become a belching cloud of black smoke. This smoke is particu-Iarly unpleasant to breathe and is very dirty. In the large volumes in which itsometimes occurs it can be a hazard to road safety, partly because its unpleasant-ness impels following drivers to press on and overtake the offending lorry, whenit might be wiser for them to hang back. There is a substantial minority of diesel-engined lorries which persistently emit quantities of black smoke. In a country-*Noisc; Grind 2056, 1963 Chapter III.t&quot; Traffic in Towns &quot; pp. 212 and 213.j&quot; Traffic in Towns &quot; page 21.
wide check in September 1964 your Department Found that 14i% of the lorriesobserved were producing excessive smoke.The Role of Licensing in Securing Amenity8.6 The original design of licensing made no attempt to deal with problems ofamenity. Only if licensing had led to somewhat fewer lorries on the roads couldit be held to have had any beneficial effect. But we are satisfied that it did not have this effect.8.7 If licensing were to make a greater contribution to solution of problems ofamenity, it could only do so indirectly. The main way would be to use licensingto reduce the total number of lorries, by transferring their traffic to rail or other forms of transport less hurtful to amenity. In a secondary way, licensing could alsohelp by serving as an additional sanction against offenders who broke direct lawsas to noise or smoke etc.8.8 To use licensing to benefit amenity, by a general reduction in the numberof goods vehicles, would involve the difficulties which we shall discuss in Chapter9 below when we consider licensing and the railways. As we have seen in con-sidering licensing and safety (Chapter 6) the disciplinary use of licensing does not need to depend on a quantity control. Any form of licence issued on demand and held &quot; during good behaviour &quot; would suffice.Direct Ways of Protecting Amenity8.9 Apart from the indirect approach by means of licensing, there are several other direct courses of action available to ensure that the use of goods vehiclesis not intolerable to the public generally. The noise and smoke problems are not easy to handle, not least because of the difficulties of definition and measurement.But we know that the active search for solutions is continuing. The steps beingtaken to improve road-worthiness of vehicles will also help, both by reducing thenumber of cases where noise is caused by the rattle of parts of the lorry, and by encouraging improvement in the general condition of the vehicle. Ideas like theuprising exhaust pipe and the wider use of mudflaps also seem to us to offerprospects of making the lorry more acceptable to its fellow road-users. More usecould also be made of bans on lorries in particular streets or on roads where their presence may offend general ideas of amenity (as is already clone, for example, inthe Royal Parks in London).8.10. The direct approach seems to us the only reliable way to reduce theharmful effects of lorries on amenity. Nothing useful can be done throughlicensing.Summary and conclusions.11 Lorries often offend the ear and nose, and sometimes the eye too. their total numbers and the way they permeate our national life make them a potentialpublic nuisance on a large scale. The strengthening of existing measures designedto cope directly with excess noise and smoke is the best way of tackling theproblem. Quantity control by licensing cannot help significantly, though a permit to ply (on the lines discussed in Chapter 6) would provide a disciplinary sanctionagainst operators of persistently offensive lorries.
Licensing and the RailwaysTHE EFFECTS OF LICENSING ON THE RAILWAYS9.1 The Salter Conference put forward several reasons for recommending theintroduction of a system of licensing of road transport of goods. But their declared underlying object was the establishment of a fair basis of competitionsuch as would tend to secure a better division of goods traffic between rail and road. And behind this in turn lay the view of the Royal Commission on Transportthat &quot; road competition must continue to affect the railways adversely &quot;.* Thepresent licensing system therefore owes its origins to the growth of road transportof goods at the expense of the railways, and a general feeling that &quot; the greatestpublic advantage &quot; would be achieved by the regulation (i.e. to some extent therestriction) of this development.9.2 Such an aim might still be among the objectives of government transport policy. It has been said that the greater use of an existing large-scale capital asset,and of a means of transport with fewer adverse social repercussions, would be advantageous, particularly in the light of the present heavy pressure on our roads.These considerations would of course have to be weighed in the balance againstthe economic benefits which road transport gives and which we can ill afford to forego in a competitive trading world. Through all that the Salter Conferencesaid in its Report about a system of licensing ran the important thread of meetingthe needs of industry and trade: &quot; we are equally impressed with the evil of any system which would prevent trade and industry from securing the form oftransport which is best adapted to its ever-changing needs at the lowest practicablecost that can be obtained on a salutary basis &quot;.9.3 In reaching any decision to seek to influence traffic from road to rail, againit would be necessary to follow the line of the Salter Conference and the wholequestion of track costs would also have to be taken into account.9.4 Nothing in this chapter should be interpreted as approval or disapproval ofthe policy objective of seeking to influence traffic from road to rail. We regard this issue as outside our terms of reference. We seek to do no more than to examinethe quantity control of road haulage by licensing in relation to the policy objective.We do this by considering in turn how far the licensing system has afforded any direct advantage to the railways in the past; whether it offers an instrument to giveeffect to such a policy in future, if that were desired; and whether there might be other and perhaps less disadvantageous ways to the same end.9.5 As originally conceived and put into effect through the Road and rail traffic Act 1933, the licensing system gave the railways an opportunity to pleadthe existence of their facilities as a reason why more road haulage licences shouldnot be granted. This was an opportunity which they may at first have usedeffectively. Certainly they devoted a considerable effort to taking advantage oftheir opportunity. They vigorously opposed applications, large or small, forThe Royal Commission^ Final Report, paragraph 130.
carriers&apos; licences for hire or reward. (In the process, they relieved many existinghauliers from any sense of need to make objections with so powerful an objectoralready in the field, many a small man did not go to the trouble and expense ofbriefing Counsel to object on his behalf).9.6 During the war, other factors came into play, and there was no doubt inthose years that the railways were the dominant carriers of goods in this country.But in the post-war period, when the wartime scarcities of rubber and oil no longercaused the Government to apply a heavy curb on road haulage, we think thatlicensing has had a negligible effect on the distribution of goods traffic between road and rail.9.7 The reasons for this are fairly clear. For nearly a decade after the war therailways were perforce using equipment which was both obsolete and, after the intensive use made of it during the war, in far from good shape. Their managementapproach was conditioned by the statutory and historical framework whichencumbered them. From the consignors point of view, there was a great differencebetween what the railways could offer and what road transport could do. road transport with its rapid improvement in vehicles could provide a door to doorservice which was nearly always faster than the railways, with less handling, fewerbreakages, less pilferage, more personal attention and at a lower cost. For the short haul, the lorry had now obviously become the right means of transport. Andfor the consignor, the balance of advantage even for long hauls often lay clearly in using road transport.9.8 Thus for industry and trade the advantages of road transport were enjoyedincreasingly in terms of speed, price, flexibility and service: these advantagesaccrued to the benefit of the economy at large, and to the public generally asconsumers and as participants in the economic life of the country. But there wereopposing considerations from the social point of view, affecting the generalpubiic in other ways. The railways were an existing capital asset which was beingunder-used, and their losses were falling on the public purse. The railways&apos; opera-tions took less toll of life and limb in accidents than did those on the roads. Fewerpeople were affected by their noise and smoke. And goods carried by rail savedany addition to road congestion. (This saving would operate mainly on the trunk routes. Rail haulage could do little to help with the growing problems oflorry transport in towns, since here the ultimate collection or delivery of goodshad usually to be carried out by lorry, even if the trunk leg had been by rail).9.9 There was thus a possible conflict between the advantage to consignorsindividually and the advantage to the public at large. In these circumstances it washard for the Licensing Authorities to give the railways much protection. Thearguments of the individual consignor were loud and clear, and could only be denied at the cost of inflicting obvious and demonstrable harm to his commercial interests. No one spoke for the public at large; and even if anyone had, the licensing Authorities would have had to decide between the direct and obvioushurt to the consignor on the one hand, or the indirect and rather generalised harm to the public on the other. Moreover, any hurt to the public (in the form ofadditional congestion, accidents and railway deficits) would have been the resultnot of the grant of any one licence, but of the sum of them all.9.10 There was the further practical point that so long as a C licence was to be had on demand, the railways were not likely to get much benefit from increased
restriction on the road haulier. If the consignor thought road transport was required for his own business, and if he could not obtain it from hire or rewardhauliers, he would use his own vehicles unless this solution was too expensive. Inmany situations and for many users this course would have been practicable andwould have been taken.9.11 The Transport Act of 1953 prescribed that the Licensing Authorities&apos; when considering applications for A and B licences, should give priority of considera-tion to the user over the provider of transport. This made it even more difficult for the railways to sustain objections to the grant of further haulage licences.Customers generally were prepared to appear in the licensing courts to supportthe haulier whose services they wanted. They were the users, and their needs hadto be given first place.9.12 For the last decade at any rate, we are sure that licensing has had no significant effect in securing for the railways any traffic whose consignor wishedit to go by road.POSSIBLE AMENDMENT OF LICENSING TO INFLUENCEMORE TRAFFIC TO RAIL9.13 It is not for us to say whether goods traffic should as a matter of generaltransport policy be required or induced to go by rail rather than road. But if aGovernment did wish to act to this end could they adapt the present licensing system to achieve that aim more effectively than the licensing system has done for the last decade?The Scope for Transfer from Road to Rail9.14 The first point to consider is what practicable scope there is for a policyof requiring or inducing goods traffic to go by rail rather than road. In theirreport &quot; The Reshaping of British Railways &quot; the British Railways Board state:&quot; Such short distance traffic (i.c. freight other than coal on journeys of less than50 miles) is unlikely to be attracted to rail unless it can be moved in bulk,directly between rail connected terminals. A very high proportion of this short distance traffic is made up of [specified flows] and other flows to places where norail terminal could be expected to exist &quot;. On this basis, the scope for divertingroad transport of goods to the railways would usually be confined to longjourneys of over 50 miles. However, about 80 % of heavy lorry journeys are under50 miles, so that any possible transfer could occur only over less than 20% of thetotal number of journeys made.9.15 One of the difficulties of influencing the distribution of traffic between road and rail is that in the circumstances of this country, rail is not the best oroften even a practical means of transport for a high proportion of movements ofgoods. In his lecture to the Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce (submittedto us as part of the British Railways Board&apos;s evidence) the Chairman of the Boardconcluded after a most careful study of the whole rail freight position and potentialities-tial, that there were perhaps roughly 71,000,000 tons of goods moving annually by road which could appropriately go by rail and then only if the nature of rail service was streamlined, its costs reduced, and its services brought more intoaccord with modern needs. This volume of traffic is less than 6 % of the total
-    2volume moving by road. In other words, the Railways Board&apos;s own estimatessuggest that over 94% of the tonnage of goods on the road should continue to gothat way even after the railway freight sen ices had been refashioned.9.16 The relatively small amount of long distance movement of goods is ofcourse mainly the outcome of geography. From Land&apos;s End to John 0&apos;Groats is nearly a thousand miles. But our main centres of industry and population lie between two roughly parallel lines, one from Glasgow to Edinburgh, the otherfrom London to Bristol. These lines are only 400 miles apart. And the highconcentrations of the Midlands, Lancashire and the North-East are con-venientiy spread in the middle of this belt, and about 100 miles apart. Thus mostof the country is within 100 miles of one or more of our great industrial and commercial areas. In these circumstances it is hardly surprising to find that withthe exception of the more remote parts of the country there are few long haulsand so many short ones.The Need to Control Own Account Work9.17 Any restriction of road transport would have to apply to both hire orreward and own account operation. Given the undoubted preference of manyconsignors for road transport rather than rail, any action confined to one of these fields would make the other the primary beneficiary, with rail a poor second. Ifthe own account operations of the trader or manufacturer were severely cur-tailed, his response would usually be to employ a road haulier. If the C licenseewere determined to have exclusive control he could do as quite a number ofindustrial concerns already do. He could employ a haulier on terms which gavehim virtually exclusive use, and certainly full control, of what the vehicles did.He could even have them in the livery of his own firm. Thus he would get all thesubstance of C licence operation while using hauliers&apos; vehicles. The restriction onhis own freedom would not have caused him to use the railways.9.18 If on the other hand control were confined to the hire or reward licet asat present, but applied more stringently, there would be an immediate extraincentive on consignors of traffic to run their own vehicles. This would not be practical for all of them because the additional costs of this solution might beunwarranted their traffic might be too irregular, or so varied as to need severalkinds of vehicle, or they might not have the capital. To this extent the railways would be the main beneficiaries. But the history of the development of the Clicensed fleet in recent years shows that for many traders&apos; purposes, road trans-port suits them so much better than rail that they would surely be prepared to goto some effort and expenditure to retain it for themselves. It must also berecognised that there will be cases where the use of rail transport is not possible,for various technical reasons, or is not feasible commercially because of theadditional costs. In such cases a ban on use of road transport would simplymean that that trade would have to stop and there would be no benefit to rail.9.19 if the diversion of traffic to rail is therefore to be significant, either interms of benefit to rail or of reduction of road traffic, the means of bringing itabout must bear on both hire or reward and own account road transport. even then, what would be lost to road might not all be gained by rail there might be some net loss of traffic and trade.
More Stringent Proof of Need9.20 The most obvious way of amending the present system so as to affect thedistribution of traffic between road and rail would be to subject applicants forcarriers&apos; licences to a more stringent proof of need. The present system certainlyleaves room for such a change. The C licence is to all intents and purposes to be had on demand. Haulage licences go to anyone who can produce a potentialcustomer who can convince the Licensing Authority that it is not reasonable to expect him to go elsewhere for his particular service. The difference between rail and road service usually means that effective objection is confined to other roadhauliers.9.21 On the present basis, therefore, need is relatively easily proved. But the criteria of decision could be made much harder to meet. Until 1960 the practice in Belgium, for instance, was to grant licences only where the railways did not want the traffic i.e. in practice only where it was virtually physically impossiblefor the railways to cope (paragraph 4.8). This represents the extreme limit toenforced use of the railways; between it and our own present arrangements thereis a wide range of possible degrees of severity.9.22 The idea of a control based on a more stringent proof of need than atpresent has the surface appeal of seeming rational, and it fits in well with wide-spread views that some of the present use of road transport is &quot; unnecessary &quot; or&quot; wasteful &quot;. But we are convinced that applied with the rigour necessary to have any significant effect, and yet with the reasonableness or equity that we are surepublic opinion would demand, it would be an enormous and difficult task toapply a more stringent test of need. Guidance would have to be given to the licensing Authorities; arguments case by case over an extremely wide and complex field would have to be sifted and heard again as circumstances changed;and it would hardly be possible to achieve complete fairness as between users oftransport. We do not say that these problems could not be handled; but theirscale leads us to recommend strongly against amendment of the licensing system as a means of influencing distribution of traffic between road and rail.Guidance to Licensing Authorities9.23 The system as amended would have to leave wide discretion to the licensing Authorities. But it would not be appropriate simply to leave thewhole problem to them. They would need guidance not only as to the policy theyshould seek to implement but also as to criteria of need. The drafting of these in practical and usable form would present formidable difficulties. It is easy tosee words like &quot; reasonable &quot; or &quot; reasonably practicable &quot; quickly creeping in.In practice they would be of very little help, virtually begging the whole question.Of course, some indication of the factors which the Licensing Authorities shouldtake into account in reaching their decisions would no doubt be possible. Butagain we see the greatest difficulty in framing this in terms general enough to beof wide application, yet specific enough to secure uniformity and consistency.Difficulties in Assessing Need9.24 Our work has brought vividly to our attention not only the scale of road transport of goods, but also its complexity. Hardly any two movements of goods are identical. The differences between them can be most relevant to the decision
whether, within the scope of general policy, rail transport would be a properalternative. This decision would have to be taken case by case. The choice bya consignor of his form of transport involves the weighing of a host of factors.Speed, price, reliability, flexibility, tying up of capital, customs of the trade,competition all can have a bearing. One consignor might believe that he needed to oifer his customers a 24 hour service. Another might say it was necessary forthe driver to be an expert in his commodity. Yet another would argue that useof rail meant provision of expensive packing. The probing of all these kinds of argument would either be superficial and hence valueless, or it would have to bepenetrating, and hence protracted and even then not wholly susceptible of clearcut decision. It seems clear that given the present degree of preference by con-signors for road rather than rail, most cases would be argued vigorously, and decisions which went against the consignors wishes would be contested to thehilt.Justice as Between Consignors9.25 There would also be the difficulty that it would be hardly possible toensure that the system worked in a way which was manifestly fair as betweenwould-be consignors by road. One consignor might have to be given a licencebecause his geographical position (which might be quite fortuitous) made railcarriage impracticable. But this licensed use of road transport would confer on him other advantages ability to meet orders at short notice, economy inpacking, or even simply lower freight costs which might be denied to com-competitors who were made to use rail. Inevitably some would be given positions ofbenefit as the result of circumstances for which they could claim no credit. Sucha system would hardly earn general acceptance, let alone acclaim, and this attitude would add greatly to the vigour with which each case was fought, andto its pursuit through all the processes available.Denial of Licence to Certain Broad Traffics9.26 Because we were much impressed with the sheer scale of the task in trying to work a system of proof of need for transport by road rather than rail,we looked at the possibility of broader approaches, by a general ban on the useof lorries for certain traffics, specified perhaps by commodity or by distance.Such a procedure, if practicable, might greatly reduce the volume of work, if asystem of proof of need were to be run alongside it. Or it might make it possibleto do without a proof of need system at all.9.27 The kinds of proposition which we considered were, for example, thatthere should be a ban on carriage by road of bulk coal; or perhaps of any bulkmaterial in more than say 5 ton lots; or that all road transport for distances morethan say 100 miles should be proscribed.9.28 As with the idea of proof of need, there is again at first sight an attractivesimplicity about such an approach. But there are hard practical difficulties. Thesestart from the fact that for some bulk movements and for some journeys howeverlong, rail is not physically or realistically suitable for the work, so no ban couldbe absolute. If the bulk movement is short, there may be no railway line nearenough to offer any reduction in road use (and we assume that no one would want to suggest compulsory carriage by rail simply in order to give the railways some-
thing to carry). If the journey is long and a rail link is otherwise possible, the loadmay be &quot; out of gauge &quot; for the railways. For a further high proportion oftraffics, the unsuitability of rail would be relative, with the extra cost of use of rail, in charges, in time, in packaging, in stockholding and so on, all being amatter of degree, but sometimes high indeed. Here the situation would becomeone of judgement of individual cases, and all the arguments which tell against asystem with a more stringent proof of need become equally relevant to a systemof banning of some categories of traffic.9.29 However we looked at the idea of holding back road transport bylicensing, we found no way out of the administrative problems (except by making,the restriction so slight that it would have no influence on the situation anyway).We were strengthened in our belief that our fears were well founded by theexperience of the Ministry of War Transport. Restriction of the use of road transport during the last war necessarily presented problems of deciding how much additional cost or reduction in service it was &quot;fair,&quot; &quot;reasonable&quot; or&quot; appropriate in terms of policy &quot; to impose on some though not on others.These difficulties could and did arise even when there was general public goodwill and understanding of difficulties. We do not rate highly the chance that thedifficulties would be any the less in times of peace, particularly now that the useof road transport has grown so greatly, to the point where it is a major andintegral part of our economic system.9.30 We have set out at some length the difficulties of more stringent proof of need, because on the surface it may appear to be an easy yardstick whereas infact the difficulties are very real. We do not go so far as to say that a system onthese lines could not be made to work. But we do say that such a system would only work in an inequitable and unsatisfactory way. It would inevitably producedecisions which did harm to our competitive efficiency in overseas trade, andwhich tended to put up costs or reduce standards of service at home. For the sake of clarity we repeat that this view does not mean that we are saying road trans-port should be given its head, and that no traffic should be influenced to go by rail. All we are saying is that if this is the desired policy, the licensing of road transport by proof of need is a very imperfect and costly way of doing it.An Administrative or Judicial System of Control9.31 Even if it were thought that the difficulties and costs to the economy of enforcing a more stringent proof of need, though perhaps great, had to beaccepted because of the importance of preferred policy objectives, we are sure that the application of proof of need would demand a quite different techniquefrom that used in the present licensing system. While this system carries out an administrative function, much of its practice is judicial in form and concept. Forany material change, due notice has to be given and published. Evidence is heardand examined, and this process is a commanding factor in the ultimate decisionof the Licensing Authority. The analysis of evidence is largely judicial in form,with the appearance of witnesses and their cross-examination by Counsel.Precedents are cited and relied on, and successive cases build up an evermoreclosely reasoned and refined volume of law. There are rights of appeal to theTransport Tribunal, which has the status and some of the procedure of the HighCourt. From the Tribunal there is the possibility of further recourse to the Courtof Appeal and even to the House of Lords.
9.32 In evidence we heard much criticism of this procedure and its legal com-complexity. To the many small firms of which the haulage industry is substantiallycomposed it must present a formidable set of rules, practice and convention. Weare sure that its legalism has developed despite the intentions of the originaldesigners of the system, and that they would deplore it, no less than we do, as outof accord with the needs of the industry. The system, if it were to be amended soas to give effect to a tighter proof of need, would have to be put on a quite different footing. The Licensing Authority would have to have full discretion,constrained only by any policy guidance given by statute or in accordance withany directions which tine Minister might give if thus empowered. The licensing authority would have to be entitled and indeed encouraged to take a broad viewof factors which he could take into account, including particularly those wider aspects of public interest which have conspicuously failed to find any reflectionin the working of the licensing system in the past. Public opinion would doubtlessinsist that the dissatisfied should still have access to some machinery for appeals.ALTERNATIVES TO LICENSING AS A WAY OF influencing the ROAD/RAIL BALANCE9.33 In suggesting that licensing is not a good way to influence the distributionof goods traffic between road and rail, we have had in mind other possible means by which the same general aim of policy could be brought about if that were theGovernments wish. In describing these wc should not be taken as advocating the aim for which they might be used. We seek only to consider them briefly as toolsalternative to licensing. We have considered a quota system; taxation; control of road transport rates; and the improvement of rail facilities or of the terms onwhich they are available to users.Control of Quantity by Quota9.34 If it were decided that there had to be a limit to the quantity of road transport of goods, it would be possible to fix the number of lorries for whichlicences would be issued. This number could be determined from time to time byministerial decision, or by means of a formula linked to some economic index,for example of national production. Such an arrangement would have thecharacteristic that an upper limit would be set to the volume of road transport,at the level selected by the Government.9.35 An immediate problem would be to decide the basis on which the licences should be shared out among the many who would want them. A systemof proof of need would have all the disadvantages to which we have already referred above, and these would be much worse when there was a finite limit tothe number of licences to be issued. The fortunate recipients of licences would bethe beneficiaries of additional profits secured by the restrictionist policy.9.36 An alternative would be for the Government to put the licences on themarket, for sale by public tender. Licences could also be transferable, so that theycould be bought and sold. The advantages of this scheme would be that, com-bined with a certainty of limitation of goods vehicles to the chosen number,there would be freedom of choice by users. Price would be the mechanism forsharing out the limited services of the prescribed capacity just as it is for most
other things. Those who felt their need was greatest would have to pay themarket price commanded by the limited capacity. This scheme would raiserevenue for the Exchequer.9.37 Control on these lines would be flexible in the hands of the Government,and also flexible in allowing industry and trade freedom of adjustment to thesituation brought about by the control. Its demerit is that it would inevitablyreflect in higher prices for transport. But this is an inevitable penalty attaching to any general system of limitation of quantity of supply relative to demand, byquota as by any other means. How serious this effect would be would depend onthe severity of the limitation on quantity.Limitation of Quantity by Taxation9.38 Road transport capacity could be limited and controlled by the impositionof additional taxation on lorries, their fuel and their other requirements. by raising the costs of road transport, the demand for its services would tend to bereduced.9.39 The quantitative effects of taxation would depend on its level and form-We did not enquire into these aspects. If a policy of diverting goods traffic fromthe roads were to be implemented, a study of the various forms of taxation andthe likely response of transport users to different levels of taxation would beimperative. In principle, however, any given degree of diversion could beachieved by the appropriate taxation.9.40 As compared with the control of capacity by a quota system of licensing,control by taxation would have the disadvantage that the precise quantitativeeffect of a given level and form of taxation would be somewhat uncertain.9.41 Ideally, if the sole purpose of the taxation was to alter the distribution oftraffic, the taxes imposed should be so designed as to divert the desired volumeand types of traffics, without falling on those users whose traffics were not to be diverted; for otherwise the diversion would be achieved not only at the expense(unavoidably) of the traffic to be diverted, but also at the expense (unnecessarily)of the remaining traffic. (This effect is common to all systems of control which apply generally and not selectively). It is unlikely that taxes could be so devisedas to be ideally sensitive and selective in their incidence. However, the adoptionof a selective approach in taxation presupposes that it is known which classes oftraffics could more readily be diverted than others or which traffics the authori-ties wished to have diverted. But if this information were available, direct control by means of the proscription of such traffics by road would be as promising asolution as taxation.Control of Rates9.42 In many countries the government influences the distribution of goodstraffic as between road and rail (often because of its direct financial interest in therailways) by way of control of road freight charges. These charges can either beexactly laid down, or the control can take the form of a prescribed &quot; fork &quot; orbracket within which the rate actually charged must lie. The relative attraction of road and rail can then be set or changed at the governments will; and the powercan be used widely or narrowly, and according to commodities, distances, or anyother factors which a rate schedule is capable of taking into account.
9.43 Despite the fairly wide use abroad of this instrument of control, we havegrave doubts as to its practicability, at least in the circumstances in GreatBritain. To influence traffic towards rail, it would be necessary to lay down a road freight rate which was above the economic level i.e. above the rate atwhich the service could be provided efficiently by hauliers. Hauliers would find the prescribed rates to be attractive, and hence they and new firms attracted bythe rates would compete for business by one or other form of disguised pricecutting. They would tend to do this unless the total capacity of road transportwere limited. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate such pricecutting.9.44 There would have to be a system of inspection of both the consignorsand road carriers books and other documents to see that the due rate had been properly charged and paid for each transaction. Such inspection would no doubt be on a &quot; sample &quot; basis only, but even so the inspection effort would be verylarge to have any real effect. (Heavy goods vehicles make roughly 135,000,000*journeys a year in this country).9.45 The question would also arise of ensuring that no concealed rebate wasgiven to the consignor. Access to company records might be sufficient to showthis up if it took the crude form of direct refund. But there would be many lessreadily detectable forms of evasion. Special carrier service might be providedwithout additional charge. Other services or goods not subject to freight ratecontrol could be supplied free or at reduced rates. The loopholes seem to us to belegion.9.46 An even more serious, indeed insuperable, difficulty would be that theown account operator could not be brought within a scheme to control road transport by the prescription of minimum charges. Since he does not pay an outside firm for his own transport services, no minimum rates could be imposedor enforced. Freedom to traders and manufacturers to carry their own goodswould undermine any system of rate control designed to limit the volume of road transport services: the higher the rates were set, the more advantage wouldbe taken of the option to carry one&apos;s own goods. The volume of road traffic might indeed be increased if operations more effectively performed by hauliers were increasingly carried out by operators on own account.9.47 In other countries, control of road freight rates is allied with closelicensing control over both haulage and own account work. Given suchcontrols, we see no need for rate control as well. Without such controls, ratecontrol could not in practice be made to influence the distribution of traffic between road and rail.Increasing the Attraction of Rail Services9.48 The basic problem of influencing traffic to rail is that of distinguishingthose traffics which could go that way with least disadvantage and thenseeking to influence the balance between the use of road and rail for thosetraffics and no others. Given the flexibility in the use of lorries, and the com-complexity and variety of the uses to which the lorry is put, the approach to theproblem by way of seeking directly to bias the balance against the use of roadsis fraught with difficulties, as we have seen.
9.49 This situation invites attention to the alternative approach not of makingroad less attractive to the user, but of making rail more so. Through nationalownership of the railways, the Government has considerable scope for infiuen-influencing the situation. The possibilities in this direction seem to us to be wide,particularly bearing in mind the difficulties the railways have had in the post-war period. Vigorous steps are now being taken to improve the attraction of rail transport of goods. It seems clear already, from actual experience, that if british railways concentrate their efforts on traffics for which rail has advantages tooffer over road, considerable flows of traffic can be attracted to rail. It is clearthat British Railways realise that there is yet a good deal more progress open tothem in this direction.9.50 It is conceivable, however, that the level of traffic which the railways cansucceed in attracting, when they have made all the improvements open to them,might yet not be as high as government policy required. In that situation thedifficulties of tackling the road end of the balance are formidable and the costs of so doing to industry and trade severe. Attention might instead be turnedusefully to the &quot; artificial &quot; enhancement of the attractions of railway service.The meeting by the Exchequer of current railway deficits is already having this effect in practice, so no new point of principle would arise. Of course, directsubsidy would tend to remove a financial discipline valuable in any organisation.If, however, government policy required that the distribution of traffic between road and rail should be different from that which follows from the free play ofeconomic forces, financial help to the railways, perhaps by way of acceptingnational responsibilities for some clearly definable element in their costs, wouldappear to have fewer disadvantages than the other courses we have discussedabove, and would be well worth further study.Summary and conclusions .51 We find that, at least since the war, the licensing system has not had any significant effect in influencing traffic from road to raii. We do not see how thesystem could be altered, to give effect to such a policy if that were the wish ofgovernment, without an administrative machine of inordinate size, of doubtfulefficiency, and without placing a heavy burden on industry and trade. Othercourses arc open to government. Of these, taxation is an obvious tool, but onewhich is difficult to use precisely in practice and which also would raise the costs of transport users. The improvement of the general efficiency of the railways, forwhich there seems to be considerable scope, would have a direct effect on thedistribution of traffic between road and rail and would reduce rather thanincrease costs. If this did not carry matters as far as government felt was necessary&apos;a further measure would be to reduce rail freight charges by accepting certainrail costs as an Exchequer liability. Both the use of taxation and the improve-mcnt of the attraction of the railways seem to us greatly to be preferred, asinstruments of policy, to any attempt to use a licensing system to divert goodstraffic from the roads.
Licensing and CongestionIntroduction10.1 The lorry is a frequent target for criticism on the score of holding upother traffic, both by its slowness when moving and by its obstructive effectwhen loading or unloading on the highway. These characteristics can seriouslyreduce the efficiency of all road users, or if not their efficiency, their due enjoy-ment of the highway. In this chapter we examine the extent of the lorry&apos;s share in congestion; whether quantity control by licensing could be used to relievecongestion; and whether there are other better ways than licensing for tacklingthe problem.The Lorry as a Cause of Congestion10.2 The lorry can cause congestion and delay in three distinct circumstances,to each of which different considerations apply; when moving on trunk routes;when moving in towns; and when stopped on the road in towns whether to loador unload or merely to await further work.10.3 On inter-urban roads, lorries can cause delay to cars, and to other lorriesable to move faster, because of their low power relative to their weight and because of their size. On a long hill a heavily laden lorry may be incapable ofmore than a fraction of the speed of most of the other traffic. When the road isnarrow and winding, and the general level of traffic is above a certain minimum,the size of a lorry may make it impossible without risk to overtake for a longtime, although its speed may be only half that which cars or some other lorriescould safely travel. This effect grows worse if there are several faster vehicleseach having to wait its turn to overtake. If two or more lorries are bunchedtogether the obstructive effect can often apply for miles.10.4 Clearly, no serious problems arise when the road readily allows over-taking (as e.g. on a motorway or dual carriageway, or on a smaller road with good sight lines and with a low volume of traffic). But despite the improvementsalready made in recent years to our trunk road network, there are still manymain routes which are overloaded at least for some of the day; and on suchroads and at such times, the lorry is clearly one of the causes of delay. This is reflected in the assessment of a lorry as equivalent to 3 passenger cars* whentraffic flows on trunk routes are being measured.The Lorry on Trunk Routes10.5 During the normal working day, lorries are an important part of thevolume of trunk route traffic. In a sample count of vehicles in a recent Ministryof Transport traffic census for trunk roads lorries accounted for about 20% ofthe total traffic in the 24 hours. But most of this lorry traffic was between 8 a.m.*It is customary to measure mixed flows of traffic in &quot; passenger car units &quot; (p.c.u.s). a scale of equivalents, based on practical experience, rates a heavy lorry as from 1.75 to 3 p.c.u.s.according to circumstances.
and 5 p.m., while quite a large part of the total of cars passing the census pointsdid so between 5 p.m. and midnight. During the &quot; working day &quot;, lorries over30 cwt. were something nearer 30% of the total. And if the lorry was countedat its normal trunk road equivalent of 3 p.c.u.s, it accounted for about half thetotal volume of traffic during the working day.10.6 The morning peak of traffic, even on trunk routes, includes the high level of lorry activity at that time. But by the evening peak many lorries are offthe road for the night, and the lorry component in the evening peak of trunkroute traffic is significantly smaller.10.7 The long distance lorry on its night trunk run hardly interferes with thefree flow of the relatively small volume of night traffic. This is an important point, as quite a high proportion of long distance lorry traffic is by night. BritishRoad Services have said that 78 % of their trunk mileage is done during suchhours; and the Ministry&apos;s census figures suggest that though this high proportiondoes not apply to all long distance traffic, it is a common feature of this kind ofwork.10.8 A particular form of trunk route congestion which attracts much public attention is that which arises on main roads to resorts at holiday times or duringweekends in summer. This congestion arises almost entirely from the volume ofprivate car traffic, and the lorry is little involved.Lorries Under Way in Cities and Towns10.9 The lorry is less of a hindrance to faster traffic in cities and towns thanon trunk routes because the speed limit in towns reduces the disparity betweenvehicles. But the lorry is still a cause of delay, particularly where it has pooracceleration or where its length has to be taken round a sharp corner. Thesmaller obstructive effect of lorries in towns is reflected in their being assessedat only 2 p.c.u.s for traffic flow purposes compared with the p.c.u. value of 3 oninter-urban routes.10.10 The proportion of heavy lorries in urban traffic does not seem to differ from that on trunk routes. The detailed information of the London TrafficSurvey suggests that lorries account for about 10% of the vehicles by number inthe morning peak, for 25% during the middle of the day, and less than 10% inthe evening peak. Again the lorry contributes quite markedly to the morningpeak but much less to the evening peak.10.11 As on trunk routes, the moving lorry in towns is not an obstructionuntil the volume of traffic reaches a certain level in relation to the capacity ofthe roads. This level is not usually reached except during the period 8 a.m. to6 p.m.Lorries Stopped in Towns10.12 Any vehicle stopped at the kerbside may be an obstruction to the freeflow of traffic including that of vehicles of its own kind. The bigger the vehiclethe bigger the obstruction. Most heavy lorries are nearly twice as long and halfas wide again as the ordinary car. They take up a large proportion of availablespace in a narrow street.
10.13 Lorries have to load and unload. Many premises, particularly in citycentres, are not laid out so as to allow this except at the kerbside. Even wherethere is off-street space, entry to it may be difficult and slow for a big andawkward vehicle.10.14 Loading and unloading at many places call for the presence of varyingnumbers of workers besides the driver. Most loading or unloading thereforetakes place in normal working hours i.e. when the general level of traffic is at its highest.10.15 The responsibility of the lorry for congestion cannot be considered in isolation. We recognise that the private car at the kerbside is also responsiblefor much urban congestion. We know of no measurements of tire relativecontributions of cars and lorries to urban congestion through kerbside parking,whether for long or short periods. There are more cars than lorries, and theytend to stay parked longer at a time, often all day. But a van delivering to achain of London suburban shops may in total spend half its time stopped invarious High Streets, and often cannot avoid double parking there.The Effect of Licensing on Congestion10.16 It is obvious that the lorry is indeed an important clement in certainkinds of congestion. The Salter Conference saw this and in their rccomend-ations for a licensing system proposed that road congestion should be one ofthe elements in deciding whether carriers&apos; licences should be granted. TheirReport recommended specifically (Paragraph 111 D) that &quot; the licensing authority shall grant the licence requested by a haulier except where the grant would be in whole or in part against the public interest on consideration of thefollowing factors: .. (ii) any actual or prospective congestion or overloading ofthe roads &quot;.10.17 It is not clear how the Conference expected this recommendation towork in practice. They may well have envisaged that Licensing Authoritiesshould incline to refuse applications for more lorries, because of the congestionto which they might add, and that in suitable cases therefore the objections ofthe railways should be given particular weight. Their Report throws no light onthe Conference^ ideas as to detail. No greater light is thrown on the question bythe terms of the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933, which broadly brought intoeffect the Conference^ recommendations as to a licensing system for road trans-port of goods. The Act made no explicit reference to congestion. It seems possible,though by no means certain, that it was in mind that the point should be met bythe instruction to the Licensing Authorities to have regard &quot; to the interests ofthe public generally &quot; (a phrase now enshrined in Section 174(4) of the road traffic Act 1960). Again it was not clear how such a policy would have been putinto effect. It may be that the practical difficulties of designing a licensing system which would satisfactorily cope with the problem of congestion (then far lessmarked than today) dissuaded the legislators of the time from seeking to pres-cribe detailed machinery. Behind this there may have been the thought thatlicensing would in any case keep transport of goods by road down to an irre-ducible minimum. There may also have been the thought that lorries were notthe only vehicles contributing to road congestion, and that it would be invidiousto single them out for special attention.
10.18 Whatever the intention of those who originally introduced the licensing system, the grant or refusal of licences has not depended on any detailed con-sideration of road congestion. In opposing licence applications, the railways havefrom time to time drawn genera! attention to road congestion as a reason whytheir services should be preferred. But congestion tends to be local and to depend on a coincidence of time and place, and the present form of carriers&apos;licensing system could not readily be made to operate so selectively. It would be practically impossible to produce evidence that a given licensing decision, usuallyinvolving a fairly small number of lorries, would cause or add substantially tocongestion at a given time and place. Congestion, at least by lorries, would onlyarise from the sum total of licences granted, not from any one of them. More-over, no provision was made in the Act for anyone who could put forward thecase for the general public interest to be heard at a licensing enquiry.10.19 At best the net reduction of congestion by licensing at any given placeor time can only have been insignificant. Indeed over the country as a whole, itis more likely that licensing has led to an increase in the number of goods vehicleson the roads, for the restrictions which licences impose tend to prevent somelorries from being more fully used. To this extent licensing is likely to have contributed to increased congestion.Amendment of Licensing to Reduce Congestion(a) By General Injluence on Lorries10.20 If the present licensing system does not reduce congestion, can it be amended so as to achieve this aim? As we have indicated in the previous para-graph the removal of licensing restrictions on the use of individual lorries would tend to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and hence the problem of congestion. But we do not think the gain here, in terms of reduction of traffic, islikely to be large. An alternative to removal of licensing restrictions would beamendment of the system so as to require a more stringent standard of proofbefore &quot; need &quot; was established and a licence granted. We have already discussed in the previous chapter the disadvantages which we see in such a course. More-over the practical limitations and difficulties of bringing about the transfer ofgoods from road to rail are so great that road congestion, to which lorries arenot by any means the only contributors, would at best be only slightly affected.10.21 There would be most scope on the long distance inter-urban traffics,though even here only a part of lorry traffic would prove in practice to be suitablefor carriage by rail. And bearing in mind the high proportion of lorry journeyswhich are short, much of this traffic on trunk routes cannot be on long distancework, but must consist of vehicles using the trunk road for part of more or lesslocal journeys for which rail is no practical substitute. It must also be borne inmind that a reduction in long-distance road movement of goods may evenincrease urban congestion, because of the almost inevitable collection and delivery by road in towns.10.22 In the towns and cities, where congestion is worst, a very high propor-tion of goods traffic is on journeys so short that use of rail is impracticable.Whatever discipline or pressures were applied, the net reduction in congestionwould be insignificant.
(b) By Specific Application to Congestion10.23 Either on trunk routes or in towns, congestion occurs only at certainplaces and at certain times. A system of licensing to deal specifically with con-gestion would therefore have to refer directly to places and times of knowncongestion. Licences to operate would have to impose explicit restrictions as totimes and places to which they applied. This is possible in principle but inpractice too complex to be contemplated. Enforcement would present enormousproblems. Moreover, to avoid unnecessary restrictions on lorry operators andusers, it would be desirable to adjust the conditions in licences in the light of changing circumstances bearing on congestion. It would be virtually impossibleto achieve such flexibility without undermining meaningful control.10.24 Licensing is therefore a crude and ineffective means of dealing withcongestion. Other ways which we have considered of tackling this problem seemto be more promising. Moreover, reliance on control of congestion throughlicensing of lorries is discriminatory in that it is not lorries alone which causecongestion. We see no reason why lorries, used predominantly in the country&apos;sindustry, trade and agriculture, should be the specially chosen subjects of measures for the control of congestion (except in so far as they alone causeparticular types of congestion calling for specific remedial action).Other Ways of Reducing Congestion10.25 Better roads are the most obvious way of easing congestion, though in many towns the necessary degree of improvement to eliminate congestion maybe prohibitively expensive. Improved traffic management measures e.g. one-way streets, banned right-hand turns, loading and unloading bans, and specialroutes for lorries have proved their worth in making better use of the roads wchave already. Experience in the last few years in London has shown what can beachieved by them. Despite an increase in traffic of 10% off peak (15% in peakperiods) speeds have gone up by about 20%*, almost wholly as a result of traffic management measures. We are sure there is still much scope for such measures.10.26 Adequate provision in future of access to and space for vehicles withinbuildings requiring servicing by lorries can make a useful contribution to casingcongestion. We are aware that such provision is often made. But much more could be done, and this line of approach merits further urgent consideration.10.27 A prescribed minimum power/weight ratio for lorries (such as might arise from the &quot; plating &quot; scheme which we understand is being considered by your Department) would help both in easing inter-urban congestion and inspeeding traffic flow within towns.10.28 We have also considered whether it would be possible and desirable tointroduce measures designed to spread road goods traffic more evenly over the24-hour day. We appreciate the difficulties. There would have to be many major changes of methods and habits, and some of these would be unwelcome to thosedirectly concerned. But the use of our highways for only a relatively small partof the 24 hours, and their abuse at some times of high traffic density, suggests atleast one way of dealing with the incoming tide of motor traffic in cities.*Roads in England and Wales. Report by the Minister of Transport for the year ended31st March, 1964, page 48. H.M.S.O.
10.29 Finally, the emerging possibility of road-space pricing as an instrumenof control of congestion seems to offer better promise than the use of a licensing system.Summary and Conclusions10.30 Lorries contribute in varying degrees to traffic congestion on bothtrunk routes and in towns. Their contribution is significant during the workingday in towns and on inadequate trunk routes, but is not otherwise serious. Thepresent restrictions imposed on lorries by licensing reduce their operatingefficiency and hence tend to increase their numbers and their contribution tocongestion. The practical scope for transfer of road goods traffic to rail is too small to offer useful help in reducing road congestion. Licensing designed to ease congestion, by proscribing certain times and places for the use of thelicensed vehicle, would be impossibly complex.10.31 Direct methods offer best hope for improvement better roads; traffic management including loading and unloading bans and special lorry routes;provision of good lorry access to buildings; higher power/weight ratio; moreuse of off-peak hours; and the pricing of use of road space.
The C Licence11.1 Separate reference to the C vehicle, and proposals for distinctivetreatment of it, figured quite widely in views put to us. This was not perhapssurprising, in the light of the amount of public discussion of this aspect oftransport in recent years. It might be helpful therefore if we set out separatelyour views on the question of the C operator, even though in so doing we mustrepeat some of the points we have made earlier. Wherever the facts of thesituation allow, anything we have said already about licensing in relation tothe various possible aims of policy applies equally to own account operation as to the hire or reward sector. But some critics have seen the C licensed lorryas particularly responsible for aspects of the present situation which theydo not like, and they have therefore proposed measures applying only to suchvehicles. It is with these matters that we deal in this chapter.Criticisms of C Operation11.2 Criticism was concerned mainly with the heavy C licensed vehicles (ofwhich there are 199,000). The 565.000 small vans engaged on retail delivery and similar services and the 515,000 vans and lorries of between 1 and 3 tons unladen,also often on larger scale retail delivery and small wholesale distribution,despite their numbers, attracted no criticism in the context of licensing or ofgeneral transport policy. Indeed, given the kind of work on which they are engaged, it is hard to see how anything could be done to reduce their numberswithout foregoing the services they provide. The contribution of these smallervehicles to matters like road accidents, noise and smoke, and impact on amenityand congestion, are all closely comparable and indeed hardly to be distinguished from the impact of the private cars from which they are often derivatives, andwith the functions of which to some extent they overlap. We do not therefore propose to say any more about them, and in the rest of this chapter any referenceto C licensed vehicles should be understood to apply only to the heavy ones i.e. weighing over 3 tons unladen.11.3 Of the fleet of heavy lorries on C licence, the most usual point madewas that their operations must be &quot; wasteful &quot; because by the nature of a Clicence, limiting the operator to his own goods, his vehicles must run emptyon one half of each journey. The critics also drew attention to the substantial increase in the number of C licensed vehicles, including particularly the&quot;heavies&quot;, in recent years. Much of this growth was attributed to &quot;empirebuilding &quot; by the transport departments of the firms concerned. It was alleged that the boards of these firms often did not know whether their traffic was beingcarried economically in their own vehicles, and that it was not in the interestof the transport department to diminish its own importance by sending itsfirnrs goods by haulier or by rail, even where this was more economical forthe firm as a whole. It was also said that the use of C licensed vehicles had grown because of the opportunities such vehicles offered for advertising the firm&apos;s name or products.
11.4 All these factors were added up to make the C operator a substantialvillain of the piece. His heavy vehicles were made responsible for much of thedecline of rail traffic, for road congestion, for the growth in numbers of theobnoxiously noisy and smoking heavy vehicle and so on.Review of Criticisms11.5 If these criticisms were valid, they would constitute a strong indictment.However, when carefully analysed, their scope and force seem to be severelylimited.11.6 The cost consciousness and careful consideration of transport efficiencyas demonstrated to us by a number of large firms suggests that while &quot; empirebuilding &quot; may exist, it is not an important factor in the general context of Clicence operation. Similarly, the advertising value of the vehicle is not material in business decisions about own account fleets. If there had been such value,the &quot; plain van &quot; would be exceptional; but it is often to be seen, and doesnot owe its anonymity always to the demands of its particular trade. The onlycriticism which did seem to us to be important enough to warrant close studywas that of &quot; waste &quot;, and we have considered this in some detail.11.7 As to empty running, a recent Ministry of Transport survey* suggests:All A licence vehicles over 3 tons about 24% empty runningB 41VJ)     &quot; 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ^l   /O 5 5 &quot;C 32 0/55     ^ 55 5 5 5 5 5 ! /() 55 55,, A Contract ,, ,, 38 %11.8 Thus it can be seen that although the heavy A licensed lorry has lessempty running than the heavy C vehicle, the difference is not large. Certainly,for all its greater freedom of operation, the A licence vehicle does not usuallymanage to run loaded both ways, while the C lorry, for all its restrictions, doesnot run empty half the time.1 1.9 But even if the empty running of A lorries was much less than that ofthose under C licence, this would not necessarily be a telling fact against Clicensed operations. Own account operation is concerned in high degree with thefood and distributive trades and with building and civil engineering. In thesetrades traffic back to base or even to a destination on the way rarely arises atthe outward end of the journey. For example when a motorway is being built,much material goes in, but little comes out. On a circular delivery run to a chain of food stores, not only is there little if anything to go back, but the lorry mustrun progressively more empty as it sets down part of its load at each store in turn.11.10 It is another feature of C licensed operation that it includes a high proportion of specialised vehicles. Tankers, bulk carriers and refrigeratedvehicles are relatively more numerous in the C licence category than in the Aand B categories. These specialised vehicles by their nature would generally been gaged in operations which do not yield return loads.11.11 The degree of &quot; waste &quot; in current C licensed operation is therefore a good deal less than is popularly supposed. Nevertheless, it is inevitable, from
the fact that C operators are restricted to carrying their own goods, that theremust be some degree of empty or light running which could be reduced butfor the restriction imposed by the present licensing system. Removal of this restriction could contribute to higher efficiency. The scope for improvementhere is probably not large, but such improvement is certainly worthwhile.Ways of Reducing the &quot; Waste &quot; of C Capacity11.12 There are two ways of tackling the problem to curtail the numberof C vehicles, or to remove the restriction which reduces their efficiency.Curtailment of the Number of C Vehicles11.13 The use of C vehicles could be curtailed by three techniques: by requiring the C operator to prove his need to run his own vehicles; by imposing a radius limit on his operations; and by levying a special high tax on him.11.14 We are averse to any of these limitations in principle. They would reduce the effectiveness of the easy availability of own account operation as a stimulus to good service by professional carriers, whether by road or rail.They would also take away some of the freedom of the trader or manufacturerto provide for himself whatever service suits him best, a freedom to whichwe know trade and industry attached the highest importance, in our viewquite rightly.11.15 But even if we found no objection in principle to limitations on thenumber of C vehicles, we see disproportionate difficulties and problems inputting such proposals into practice.11.16 The difficulties of operating a system of &quot; proof of need &quot; in respectof own account C licences arc the same as those which wc discussed at length in Chapter 9 on licensing and the railways. Modern road transport operations are complex and varied, and &quot;need&quot; is in this context a subjective term. Wecannot see a system on these lines working satisfactorily.11.17 The application of a radius limit to C licensed operations would alsoencounter considerable difficulties. There would almost certainly be caseswhere exemption would have to be allowed, and difficult problems of decisions would arise in a system based on proof of need. Enforcement would also bedifficult. And a radius limit even as low as 25 miles would only bear on one thirdof the tonnage of goods carried by heavy C licensed lorrics* (two thirds of thetotal tonnage carried by these vehicles are on journeys of less than 25 milesalready).11.18 A high tax on C operation would discourage some traders and manu-facturers. But we are clear from the many circumstances in which C licensedvehicles are operated that often the user would more readily pay a tax, even ifit were high, than lose the use of what to him is a vital part of his production or distribution chain. It would be difficult to design a tax so as to bear onlyon those who were relatively better placed to use an alternative. The end result
would be a general increase in the cost of transport for no material gain interms of transport policy.11.19 Even if the difficulties of curtailing the use of C vehicles could be overcome, the consequent gains would nevertheless be small for other reasons.If the former C operator still had the option of using a haulier it would be im-possible to prevent him from arranging with the haulier to have the exclusiveuse of the haulier&apos;s lorry or lorries. In other words, he would operate the vehicles exactly as before.11.20 It is difficult to arrive at any realistic estimate of the savings in heavyroad traffic, if any, that might be achieved by diverting C licence work tohauliers. It is interesting however to consider the effects if heavy C licencevehicles did as little empty running as present-day A licence vehicles. In 1962heavy lorries under C licence ran about 3,000 million miles.* of which about one third was empty mileage. If this could have been reduced to one quarter(the A licence figure), there would have been a saving of about 330 millionvehicles miles.f As the vehicles concerned were heavy vehicles, this would havebeen equivalent (under the normal traffic measurement convention) to 1thousand million passenger car unit/miles. This hypothetical reduction, large as it sounds, would have been less than 1 % of the estimated total traffic onour roads in 1962. It must be seen against an increase in total traffic at presentrunning at about 5% per annum.11.21 It is also possible to save vehicle miles by securing that part-loadedvehicles are more fuHv loaded. What information we have tends to indicate that licence vehicles run with only small part-loads more often than do hauliers&quot;vehicles. Estimation of possible savings in this field is even more difficult thanin that of empty running. As mentioned in Chapter 3, how much a vehicle can carry is in practice limited either by the weight or bulk of its load or by othercharacteristics such as how far the load can be stacked. There is therefore noeasy way of defining and measuring the degree to which any vehicle is loaded.And it is characteristic of many C licence journeys that they entail the pro-gressivc delivery of loads to (or their progressive collection from) several points on a circular route. On such journeys the vehicle can hardly be full all the time.While we cannot therefore measure the scope for saving vehicle miles by loadingC vehicles more fully, it seems unlikely that the scale of practical advantage canbe large.11.22 The railways would be scant beneficiaries of any pressure on C operatorsso long as road haulage services were available as an alternative. In other words,the first choice of the C operator would be a haulier to provide his services,rather than the railways. But if this option were denied him. and he were forcedto use rail, it must be borne in mind that there are severe practical limits to how far the railways can or would wish to offer a satisfactory substitute service.Their recognised forte is in the field of long distance bulk movement. A very high proportion of heavy C licensed work is short distance, often not in bulk;and for this kind of work the railways are fundamentally unsuited or not evena practical means of transport.*Ministry of Transport Statistical Paper No. 2 Survey of Road Goods Transport, 1962,Final Results, Part I, Table 18. Page 40, HMSO,see Appendix B (i). Table (x).
9 9Removal of Present Restrict ions on C Operators11.23 We think that the right way to tackle any reduction of efficiency imposed on C operators by the present licensing system is to free them from restriction as to what they may carry. In practice, it would be virtually impossible to denythem this freedom if entry into the hire or reward sector of the industry weremade unrestricted. For otherwise the C operator could avoid any speciallimitations placed on him, by the simple process of securing the setting up of ahaulage company for the sole purpose of carrying out his road transport work.There would ultimately be no way of stopping this kind of arrangement. Itappears to us that the right course is not only to abandon restriction of entry into the hire or reward field but also at the same time to remove the restrictionat present imposed on the C operator that he may only carry his own goods.Summary and Conclusions11.24 Criticism of C licensed operation of heavy vehicles has been muchexaggerated. An element of &quot; waste &quot; is inherent in the restrictions which areimposed upon this kind of operation by the licensing system. We do not thinkthat this should be dealt with by further restriction of C licensed operation,which is liable in the end only to substitute one inefficiency for another, but rather by removing the existing restrictions. Indeed, such removal is in practiceinherent in any freeing of the haulage sector of the industry from restrictionson entry.
Track costs the General Relevance of Track Costs to Licensing12.1 We had much evidence on the question of comparative track costsby road and rail, and there seemed to be hope in some quarters that we wouldarbitrate on this highly controversial and long standing problem. We were forsome time uncertain how far it came within our remit, and we gave carefulconsideration to this. We finally decided that while the question was of somerelevance to us, in so far as it bore on the taxation or subsidisation of road haulage, it was not essential to the discharge of our duty to try to pursue it tofinality. Nor was it necessary for us to go into the question of the relative costs of carrying traffic by road or rail (nor for that matter by sea or air).12.2 The terms on which road transport services are offered are influenced by how much road users, or particular classes of them, have to pay for the useof the roads. If they do not have to pay adequately for the use of roads, throughtaxation or otherwise, their services could and possibly would be supplied at less than the full cost of providing them. Any subsidy, whether hidden or overt,would lead to an increase in the use of road transport; and such an increase would not be justified economically so long as other forms of transport had to price their competing services on the basis of their costs including their trackcosts. Thus the incidence of road costs affects the economic use of resources in all forms of transport. It is conceivable that a licensing system might beused to reduce the number of lorries so as to counteract the effect of any subsidy to lorries which may be present as a result of the public provision of roads.12.3 The railways arc in principle required to pay directly for all the costs of providing and maintaining the lines on which their trains run, and of signal-ling, lighting and policing their lines; and to adjust their charges accordingly.(We are aware, however, that for some years the railways have in fact been operating at a loss, which means that the payments made to the railways by rail users have been insufficient to cover total costs of operation, includingtrack costs. In this sense, some rail users have been &quot; subsidised &quot;).12.4 Road haulage operators do not pay directly for the use of the roads onwhich their vehicles run. With trivial exceptions they are allowed &quot; free &quot; useof the roads for running and parking; and public authorities meet the costof policing, traffic control and lighting. But this is of course only part of the account. In the tax on fuel and the annual excise duty on vehicles used on publicroads, road users pay substantial taxes the equivalent of which are not paidby the railways. The taxes on road users no longer take the implied form of payment for the use of roads, but are part of general Exchequer receipts. Thepayment of these taxes cannot however be ignored in considering the cost ofthe facilities provided by public authorities.12.5 It is no part of our task to look into the costs of running a railway.The British Railways Board in their evidence provided us with detailed figures,
but we are in no position to comment upon these. Nor do we think it is forus to do so. It is also no part of our terms of reference to say whether themoney spent on the road system should be recouped through taxation or tosay how road costs should be shared between different classes of vehicles.The Salter Conference recommended the adoption of detailed schemes of road vehicle taxation. But the Conference^ terms of reference, unlike ourown, included &quot; the incidence of highway costs in relation to the contributions of the different classes of mechanically propelled vehicles &quot;. We decided wewere only required to consider whether a licensing system could serve to re-adjust the balance between road and rail if it were to be shown both thai thiswas being upset because lorries were paying in taxes less than their share ofthe cost of providing and maintaining the roads, and also that this under-payment could not otherwise be corrected.Evidence from the British Railways Board12.6 In evidence the British Railways Board said that they were not seekingpiotection through licensing of road goods transport. But the best distributionof traffic between road and rait could only be made if road users were payingtheir fair share of the costs of the road system. In their &quot; Report on the Re-shaping of British Railways &quot; the Board had argued that the railways wereinherently unsuitable for many of the tasks which they had performed in thepast. The system was being reorganised in order to enable them to competemore effectively for those traffics for which they had inherent advantages. Inpractice competition between road and rail was primarily restricted to trunkroutes.12.7 The Board did not argue that road users as a whole were paying lessthan the cost of providing the road system. They had confined their attentionto the kind of road and rail operations in the goods field which they considered to be in serious competition with each other. Their &quot; Study of the RelativeTrue Cost of Rail and Road Freight Transport over Trunk Routes &quot; firstestimated the costs of building a new motorway or trunk road as comparedwith that of building a new railway. Then they added to these costs therespective costs of operating heavy goods vehicles or the costs of operatingeither traditional forms of railway freight transport or the proposed linertrains. The Board concluded that on the assumption of existing rates of usageof either road or rail track, the cost of the entire system, per capacity ton mile,was twice as high for road as for rail. They also concluded that vehicles of10 or 16 tons capacity running on new motorways or dual carriageway trunk roads were paying in fuel tax and excise duties between one-third and one-half of the share of road costs which the Board&apos;s study attributed to them.If this were true road operators engaged in trunk haulage were in effect beingheavily subsidised to the detriment of the railways.Evidence from the Ministry of Transport12.8 We also received evidence from your Department about the distributionof road costs between different classes of vehicles. This study covered the road system as a whole and sought to show the limits between which an equitableallocation of road costs could be made to different classes of vehicle. It assessed
the capital cost of the road system both on the basis of actual expenditure ina given year (1962) and alternatively as the annual interest payments on thecapital sunk in the road system. Other costs (maintenance, cleansing and snowclearing, lighting, policing, administration and the cost of accidents not coveredby insurance) were divided by the Department between different vehicle classesaccording to a number of different methods (by vehicle miles, passenger carunit miles, laden ton miles, etc.) as appropriate to each kind of expenditure,giving upper and lower limits in the calculations where necessary.12.9 We compared the results of these calculations with estimates of the taxes paid by various classes of vehicles. The comparison shewed that each classof vehicle was paying more in taxes than its share of road costs, but that the extra payment by heavier lorries was much less than that of lighter vehicles.The Ministry agreed that there were other methods of making the calculationswhich might yield different answers.Evidence from Road Interests12.10 We also received evidence on track costs from the British RoadFederation, the Road Haulage Association, the Transport Holding company and the Traders Road Transport Association. Memoranda put to us by these bodies were directed mainly at criticising the methods used by the british railways Board in arriving at their conclusions that heavy vehicles were notpaying enough for the use of the roads:(i) it was said to be unfair to base rates of vehicle taxation on only alimited part of the road network. Even in the case of trunk routes itwas unrealistic to assume that all trunk roads were new roads built to modern standards. Since vehicle taxation could not be varied accordingto the use made of different kinds of roads the only reasonable basis on which to assess taxation was the cost of the road system as a whole;(ii) much of the high costs attributed to heavy vehicles by the Board resulted from the assumption that the greater part of the cost of buildingmodern roads was due to a need to cater for heavy vehicles. The board had estimated that the cost of a motorway built for private cars only would be some  200,000 per mile as against the cost of a full standardmotorway of  700,000 per mile. Studies by your Departments engineers and by a firm of consulting engineers indicated that in fact not morethan 20% of the cost of motorways could be saved by building for light vehicles only;(iii) the Board had misapplied the results of tests carried out by the AmericanAssociation of State Highway Officials into wear and tear on roads,to charge too high a proportion of maintenance cost to heavy vehicles;(iv) the Board had failed to allow for increasing traffic which would spread the cost of the new roads over a larger number of vehicles and so reducethe cost per vehicle.12.11 In general the memoranda from road interests were content to rely on the cost allocation suggested by your Department in its evidence to us,although they thought that in some respects it was unfairly weighted against
heavy lorries. Only the Transport Holding Company had produced independentestimates. They compared several methods of calculating road costs and didseparate calculations on trunk, classified and unclassified roads. In every case they found that lorries paid more than enough in tax to cover their road costs.12.12 The Road Haulage Association and the Transport Holding Companywent on to argue that there was no &quot; correct&quot; allocation of road costs, that anyallocation must be to some extent arbitrary and would depend upon the objectives which the Government were trying to pursue. They insisted, however, that thetrack costs argument could not be used to justify levying extra taxation onheavy goods vehicles.Evidence from the Road Research Laboratory12.13 All the track cost studies mentioned above were founded on the notionof determining the total cost of the provision, maintenance and control of theroad system (or part of it) and of allocating this total among the various categories of users. The Road Research Laboratory used a different approach. The calcula-tions in their study did not purport to estimate the charges which would haveto be levied on road users to recover the cost of the road system. Instead, theadditional costs caused by a small increase in the volume of traffic were csti-mated. Two alternative types of estimate were made. In the first it was assumed that there was no additional road capacity, so that the postulated increase intraffic imposed additional costs on all road users by slowing down traffic flows,and also caused an increase in road maintenance costs due to the more rapidwear of road surfaces. In the second type of estimate, it was assumed that the speed of traffic flows was maintained unchanged by adding to the road capacity(by new building) to accommodate the increase in traffic. Here the additionalcosts took the form of the outlays on the additions to the road system, expressed on an annual basis. Estimates of these costs for rural roads were made on eachof these two bases, and for urban roads on the first method only. The costs were estimated separately for an increase in heavy vehicle traffic and in lightvehicle traffic, the dividing line being a vehicle of \ \ tons.12.14 The general conclusions were that on rural roads the present taxeson heavy vehicles exceeded the (marginal) costs of using the roads as defined and estimated in the study. In urban areas, on the other hand, the taxes paid were considerably lower than the estimated costs, the deficiency reflecting the high degree of road congestion already present in many urban areas, and the morepronounced slowing-down of traffic caused by a small addition to traffic.Review of Track Cost Studies12.15 We felt that there were weaknesses in the case presented by the british railways Board. The estimates made by highway engineers convinced us,in the absence of informed comment to the contrary, that the Board had over-estimated the savings on the construction of roads for light vehicles only.Moreover, their argument depended quite heavily on their assumption that anew road or railway would be used at the present level of goods traffic betweenthe places connected by the route. This is arbitrary and bears no necessaryrelation to capacity or to what may happen in future. We also had some doubtson the appropriateness of the use of p.c.u. values in some of the Board&apos;estimates.
the capital cost of the road system both on the basis of actual expenditure ina given year (1962) and alternatively as the annual interest payments on thecapital sunk in the road system.

Since vehicle taxation could not be varied accordingto the use made of different kinds of roads the only reasonable basis on which to assess taxation was the cost of the road system as a whole;(ii) much of the high costs attributed to heavy vehicles by the Board resulted from the assumption that the greater part of the cost of buildingmodern roads was due to a need to cater for heavy vehicles. The board had estimated that the cost of a motorway built for private cars only would be some  200,000 per mile as against the cost of a full standardmotorway of  700,000 per mile. Studies by your Department^ engineers and by a firm of consulting engineers indicated that in fact not morethan 20 % of the cost of motorways could be saved by building for light vehicles only;(iii) the Board had misapplied the results of tests carried out by the AmericanAssociation of State Highway Officials into wear and tear on roads,to charge too high a proportion of maintenance cost to heavy vehicles;(iv) the Board had failed to allow for increasing traffic which would spread the cost of the new roads over a larger number of vehicles and so reducethe cost per vehicle.12.11 In general the memoranda from road interests were content to rely on the cost allocation suggested by your Department in its evidence to us,although they thought that in some respects it was unfairly weighted against
heavy lorries. Only the Transport Holding Company had produced independentestimates. They compared several methods of calculating road costs and didseparate calculations on trunk, classified and unclassified roads. In every case they found that lorries paid more than enough in tax to cover their road costs.12.12 The Road Haulage Association and the Transport Holding Company-went on to argue that there was no &quot; correct &quot; allocation of road costs, that anyallocation must be to some extent arbitrary and would depend upon the objectives which the Government were trying to pursue. They insisted, however, that thetrack costs argument could not be used to justify levying extra taxation onheavy goods vehicles.Evidence from the Road Research Laboratory12.13 All the track cost studies mentioned above were founded on the notionof determining the total cost of the provision, maintenance and control of theroad system (or part of it) and of allocating this total among the various categories of users. The Road Research Laboratory used a different approach. The calcula-tions in their study did not purport to estimate the charges which would haveto be levied on road users to recover the cost of the road system. Instead, theadditional costs caused by a small increase in the volume of traffic were csti-mated. Two alternative types of estimate were made. In the first it was assumed that there was no additional road capacity, so that the postulated increase intraffic imposed additional costs on all road users by slowing down traffic flows,and also caused an increase in road maintenance costs due to the more rapidwear of road surfaces. In the second type of estimate, it was assumed that the speed of traffic flows was maintained unchanged by adding to the road capacity(by new building) to accommodate the increase in traffic. Here the additionalcosts took the form of the outlays on the additions to the road system, expressed on an annual basis. Estimates of these costs for rural roads were made on eachof these two bases, and for urban roads on the first method only. The costs were estimated separately for an increase in heavy vehicle traffic and in lightvehicle traffic, the dividing line being a vehicle of \ \ tons.12.14 The general conclusions were that on rural roads the present tuxeson heavy vehicles exceeded the (marginal) costs of using the roads as defined and estimated in the study. In urban areas, on the other hand, the taxes paid were considerably lower than the estimated costs, the deficiency reflecting the high degree of road congestion already present in many urban areas, and the morepronounced slowing-down of traffic caused by a small addition to traffic.Review of Track Cost Studies12.15 We felt that there were weaknesses in the case presented by the british railways Board. The estimates made by highway engineers convinced us,in the absence of informed comment to the contrary, that the Board had over-estimated the savings on the construction of roads for light vehicles only.Moreover, their argument depended quite heavily on their assumption that anew road or railway would be used at the present level of goods traffic betweenthe places connected by the route. This is arbitrary and bears no necessaryrelation to capacity or to what may happen in future. We also had some doubtson the appropriateness of the use of p.c.u. values in some of the Board&apos;estimates.
12.16 All but the Road Research Laboratory&apos;s approach to the allocation of track costs start from analysing what would happen if a public corporationwas responsible for running the road system and for paying its way. They seek to establish the items which ought to appear in the accounts of such a corpora-tion and to work out what charges ought to be levied on different users of thesystem. But a public corporation in this position would have no difficulty in thinking of numerous different tariff structures to raise the required revenue.There are some road costs which can be directly attributed to particular types of vehicle. These are costs which would be avoided if there were no vehicles ofthat type on the roads. It is reasonable to assume that these costs would berecouped directly from those users. But many other costs are common to all types of user. These costs would have to be incurred whether or not a particularclass of road user used the roads. There does not seem to be any obvious reason why one method of raising revenue to cover these costs should be preferred toanother except a subjective judgement as to what seems equitable or expedientin the circumstances.12.17 It is not for us to say whether charges for the use of roads should bebased on the notion of costs used in the Road Research Laboratory&apos;s study;nor is it for us to assess the reliability of the estimates presented in the study.(We noted that the findings were presented to us with frequent references tothe wide margins of error in the estimates and the inadequacy of the basicdata).12.18 More generally, the approach adopted by the Laboratory is in ourview more appropriate to the question of the control or reduction of congestionon the roads than to the question which faces us competition between road and rail as it may be affected by payment by users for the tracks they use.Social Costs and Benefits12.19 A further difficulty in seeking to pursue the track costs argument isthat it almost inevitably has to leave out a number of factors. Mention was madein evidence to us of social costs which should come into the reckoning; andsome witnesses pointed to the need for recognising the social benefits of road transport. We do not know, however, on what basis allowance should be madefor the various items of social costs and social benefits. Methods for calculatingthem are in their infancy, and necessarily include major elements of estimation,about which there is wide scope for the exercise of judgement and for differences of opinion. It seems to us that any adjustment to be made for the social costs and benefits of the two modes of transport is ultimately a matter for government decision. The importance of this decision needs no emphasis from us in viewof its effects on the public generally and on users of transport services, and henceon the economy as a whole.How Far Lorries Pay their Track Costs12.20 The British Railways Board sought to show that heavy lorries engagedin trunk haulage were paying substantially less than their true road costs.Other interests suggested that road users in general, including heavy lorries,were paying far more than they should. The Road Research Laboratory, byanalysing the rural and urban situations separately, provide partial support
for both schools of thought. But the Laboratory^ estimates do not supportthe view that long-distance road haulage is &quot; subsidised &quot; by way of road costs in its competition with rail. For long distance movements, the area in whichroad and rail are mainly in competition, most of the road hauls are on &quot; rural &quot;roads where taxation was calculated by the Laboratory to be in excess of costs.On the other hand, on urban roads where heavy lorries were calculated by theLaboratory to pay less in tax than their imposed costs, road transport cannot in practice be replaced by rail. The implicit subsidisation (according to the study) of road haulage on urban roads cannot therefore be significant forcompetition between road and rail.12.21 The only certain conclusion we can draw from all the evidence wehave received is that no method of assessing road costs secures general accept-ance, and we are not in a position to arbitrate finally upon the merits of differentapproaches to this problem.Moreover, nothing in the evidence put to us givesus reason to think that there is any hope, at this stage of thought or knowledge,of arriving at such a solution. This is no new problem. We recall the views ofthe Royal Commission on Transport when it said in its Report:&quot; We now approach the most difficult subject of the relationship betweenhighway expenditure and the taxation of mechanically propelled vehicles.A considerable volume of evidence has been directed to this matter,and we confess that, in spite of the great amount of thought we have givento it, we have been unable to reach a conclusion which we could confidentlyput forward as demonstratively and mathematically sound. Certain facts and statistics are available which may be used in a variety of ways accordingto the ingenuity of the person using them and the conclusion which hehopes to prove &quot;.*Licensing and Track Costs12.22 Having said that we doubt whether a final answer is yet possible andhaving pointed to the intractable problems of attributing common costs to particular classes of user, we obviously cannot say that the present amount and balance of taxation are right. But we are not convinced by the evidence beforeus that the present rates of taxation of heavy lorries are low relative to the trackcosts which can be properly attributed to them and hence that a restrictionby licensing of the number of lorries would be justified on these grounds tosecure the most economic use of transport resources. Moreover, we believethat if there were a subsidy element and rates were low relative to such costs,Exchequer action could redress the balance if this were thought wise. TheGovernment could adjust the rates and bases of taxation of road users in orderto ensure that each category paid its required contribution towards the costof the system. This would be a much more realistic and logical approach than any attempt to try to achieve the same ultimate effect by licensing.12.23 Finally, nothing we have said should be taken to mean that the Govern-ment should not raise revenue from any mode of transport in excess of public expenditure directed to it. Nor are we suggesting that increased taxation of road transport should not be imposed in order to secure a transfer of traffic form road to rail, if that be the deliberate aim of government policy. But in so* Royal Commission^ Final Report, paragraph 224.
saying, we should make it clear that we are not advocating such a policy;and we would in any case think it vital that a detailed study of the probable effects of such action, not only on the interests of road users but more generally on the economy as a whole should have been made before any such coursewere embarked upon.Summary and Conclusions12.24 The question of track costs has a narrow but important relevance toour work. None of the approaches put to us seemed to be a final answer to this long standing and vexing problem. We were satisfied that the present situationdid not of itself make it essential to continue a system of quantity control oflorries through licensing.
Control of A Licensed Hauliers13.3 It was suggested that the present freedom of A licensed hauliers to carryreturn loads without specific regard to their &quot; normal user &quot; (see paragraph2.50) undermined the power of the Licensing Authorities to control capacity and should be removed.13.4 It was suggested also that the doctrine of&quot; normal user&apos;1 was uncertainin operation and difficult of enforcement. There was no universal agreement, itwas said, among Licensing Authorities about the extent to which a hauliershould be free to depart from the intentions expressed in his application for hislicence, before being regarded as in breach of his &quot; normal user &quot;. statements of intention were drafted by applicants themselves or by their advisers and mightbe amended orally during the course of inquiries. Often therefore they were open to divergent interpretations. Licensing Authorities could not prosecute the holder of an A licence who infringed his &quot; normal user &quot; as they could the holder of a B licence who broke a condition of his licence.13.5 It was strongly argued on the other hand that a bona fide public haulieronce licensed should be free to carry goods with the minimum of restriction andthat the idea of &quot; normal user &quot; had been unjustifiably grafted on to a systemoriginally designed to leave A licensed hauliers free in this way.Proposals made to the Committee for the reform of the Licensing System within itsPresent Broad Framework13.1 Many of the memoranda put to us either argued the case for some kindof quantity control by licensing or were based on the assumption that such asystem of control would be continued. These memoranda were devoted primarily to criticism of detailed aspects of the present system and to advocacy of pro-posals for its amendment within its existing framework.13.2 We have concluded, however, that the present system of licensing hasno merit in relation to any of the aims of transport policy and has certainpositive disadvantages. We see no practical way of amending the system to repair these serious defects. There is therefore no need for us to consider any ofthe proposals premised on the continuance of the system. However, if we didnot note some of these proposals, we should fail to show how the present systemappeared to many who are affected by it, and their views would go unrecorded.We therefore set out briefly the main points (we cannot list them all, for someconcerned quite minor and esoteric matters); and in paragraphs 13.37 and 13.38we add a few general observations.
B Licences13.6 It was widely represented to us that the B licence had developed in a waynot originally intended. It was said that the licence was designed to meet theneeds of those traders whose own account operations could be made more efficient by a limited amount of carrying for hire or reward. &quot; Unfair &quot; competi-tion with the public haulage industry was to be prevented by attaching restric-tive conditions to the licence. But because existing carriers, particularly therailways, objected less strenuously to applications for B licences (where their interests could be protected by the imposition of suitable conditions) they werewidely resorted to by professional hauliers. In particular, newcomers to theindustry found it easier to obtain B licences with restrictive conditions than Alicences. Many professional hauliers now therefore operate under these licences.This state of affairs was criticised both because it was said to have led to unduerestriction of professional hauliers under B licences and because it had allowedundue proliferation of small haulage firms.13.7 As against the argument that B licensed hauliers were already undulyrestricted, it was suggested that a right of objection and appeal should be givenagainst an application to vary the classes of goods permitted by the conditionsof a B licence. (No such right at present exists although the Act allows objectionagainst changes in geographical limits laid down in the conditions).Contract A Licences13.8 Various proposals were made for the abolition of Contract A licences.It was put forward as an objection to their existence that they provided a relatively easy method of entry to professional haulage. The Court of Appealdecided in the Arnold Transport case* that evidence of traffic from one customeralone could be sufficient to justify the grant of a full A licence. A haulier em-ployed under a Contract A licence could sometimes bring evidence that hiscustomers required him to cheapen his services by accepting back loads fromother customers and that if he did not do so he would lose his contract. Thisunder the conventions of the system made it difficult for the Licensing Authorityto refuse to grant an A licence.13.9 It was argued also that Contract A licences were unnecessary becausetraders could get the service they required by negotiating a suitable contract with an existing A licensed haulier. Alternatively the Contract A licence shouldbe treated as a form of B licence limited to carriage for one customer alone. Ifthen the holder established that it was desirable for him to carry return loads for others he could be granted a variation of conditions without being admitted tothe greater freedom of a full A licence.Lack of Information for Licensing Authorities13.10 Several witnesses argued that under the system as it stood licensing authorities lacked adequate information on which to base their decisions. Whenthe Licensing Authority had to decide an application for increased capacity, heusually had evidence of a customers need for the haulier&apos;s services and evidence&quot;Arnold Transport (Rochester) Ltd. v British Transport Commission and Others [1961]3 Al 1 E.R. 495
brought by the objectors that there was already sufficient capacity to meet the alleged demand. It was said that many customers are extremely reluctant to give evidence which might involve disclosing commercial information of value totheir competitor, or to submit to the ordeal of cross-examination. On the otherhand, others might be willing to support almost any application so that theycould benefit from sharper competition. Existing hauliers might not wish to takethe trouble to object or might have agreements with other hauliers that theywould not object to each other&apos;s applications. In the past the practice of the rail-ways to object almost automatically to all applications for new A licences hadensured that evidence of some at least of the existing facilities had generally been available to Licensing Authorities. But this might not always be the case in thefuture. Licensing Authorities were not bound to grant an application simply because there were no objections to it, and they could draw on their own know-ledge of the facts of the situation. But it was very difficult for them to act withoutevidence of the extent of haulage facilities in their district and in the districts otherthan their own to which the vehicles would travel. It is relevant to mention here that it was suggested that Licensing Authorities should be given the powers,which at present they lack, to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths.*13.11 A number of witnesses suggested that there was another weakness inthe machinery. An application for a new licence has to be made to the licensing authority of the Traffic Area in which the applicant has his operating centre.Evidence of supply and demand would be very largely confined to that area buttraffic might be drawn from other areas too.Suggestions for National and Local Licences13.12 It was suggested that to meet these and other difficulties there shouldbe two main classes of licence for public hauliers:(a) a national licence giving no limit on the range of operation, and(b) a local licence by which the haulier would be limited to (say) a fiftymile radius of operation.Each of these two classes would be subdivided into licences which enabledhauliers to operate freely without restriction, and licences to which various types of conditions could be attached by the Licensing Authorities. Applicationsfor national licences would be considered by a National Licensing authority and applications for local licences by Local Licensing Authorities. The licensing authorities should attach less importance than at present to the evidence ofcustomers and objectors. They should attach primary importance to economicstatistics such as indices of industrial production, and in the case of existinghauliers applying for increased capacity to the extent to which their fleets arealready fully utilised.Legalistic Administration of the System13.13 We received a considerable amount of evidence to the effect that thesystem had become unnecessarily hampering to trade and industry, and tohauliers, because of a too legalistic approach to its administration. It was said*See both the Report of the Committee on the Licensing of Road Passenger Services,HMS O., 1953 paragraph 89 and the Report of the Committee on Administrative tribunals and Enquiries, Cmnd 218, HMS O., 1957 paragraph 92 for views relevant to this suggestion.
that the Transport Tribunal in particular relied too heavily upon precedent andtechnical points of law in reaching its decisions. It was suggested that the thicketsof case law which had grown up as a result of Tribunal decisions over the years were impenetrable by the average layman and that sometimes even the lawyersexpert in licensing matters got lost in them. Applicants and objectors were bound to take legal advice in preparing their cases and generally they found itnecessary to be legally represented in hearings before the Licensing Authority.This led to multiplication of further points of law.13.14 A few witnesses suggested that an over-elaborate structure of precedentshad been built up because the criteria laid down in the Act for the guidance of licensing Authorities were too broadly drawn. For this and for general reasons it was said that the criteria should be elaborated.Appeal Machinery13.15 A number of suggestions were made for changes in the appeal machinery.Some of these were connected with the view mentioned above that the system had become too legalistic.13.16 Abolition of any right of appeal from Licensing Authorities&apos; decisionswas proposed. Other witnesses suggested that appeals should be only on points of principle and that the Tribunal should not substitute its discretion for thatof Licensing Authorities. Yet other witnesses suggested that on the contrary theTribunal should conduct a complete rehearing on appeal so as to exercise itsdiscretion with the fullest possible knowledge of the facts.13.17 It was also suggested that the constitution of the Tribunal might be altered in various ways. It was proposed that it should include an economist andthat it should always have members with direct experience of haulage and of thelower licensing courts.Hire of Vehicles under C Licences13.18 The provisions of the Act under which holders of C licences can hireunmanned vehicles for their own use were widely criticised, by hauliers and those concerned with the administration of the system, as leading to abuse.13.19 Against them, it was argued that the facility was valuable and that the allegations of abuse were much exaggerated. The facilities allowed the trader ormanufacturer to supplement his C licence fleet by hiring unmanned vehicles tomeet seasonal fluctuations or to expand his operations without incurring capitalexpenditure on increasing his fleet.13.20 The practice is of long standing, but we were given to understand thatits adoption grew considerably during the period of nationalisation. Its abuseconsisted in hiring out vehicles for short periods to numerous hirers whileevading the requirements that the hirer must supply his own drivers, by settingup an agency to supply the drivers for him. This form of operation was tanta-mount to operating an open haulage business. It was also possible for the hirerto present as evidence of need in an application for an A licence the work whichhe had been doing under a C hiring margin, thus obtaining some advantage overan applicant who started from scratch.
13.21 Various suggestions were made for dealing with the matter. One wasthat the vehicles to be hired should be specified on the licence of the hirer.Another was that the facility should be abolished and the need met by a form of short-term Contract A licence. A third was to set up a register of vehicle hirers,wfco would have to record the hiring out of their vehicles and who would besubject to appropriate rules about minimum periods of hire.Farmers&apos; Concession13.22 We also received a number of complaints about the concession wherebyfarmers&apos; vehicles while operating under C licence may carry for neighbouringfarmers for hire or reward. It was strongly suggested that a concession originallyaimed at helping bona fide farmers was being abused by persons who wereconducting haulage businesses under the guise of being farmers. (This is possiblebecause the Road Traffic Act I960 grants the concession to a &quot; person engagedin agriculture &quot;, and &quot; agriculture &quot; has in law a very wide meaning^. The Actpermits carriage of goods for hire or reward on behalf of another &quot; personengaged in agriculture &quot; . . . &quot; in that locality&quot; and this second phrase also canbe interpreted very diversely).13.23 Spokesmen for the farmers did not seek to show that there was noabuse of the concession. But they did stress the great value of the concession togenuine farmers in remote areas, and argued that it should be continued withwhatever safeguards against abuse might be agreed.Takeover of Limited Companies13.24 Under the Road Traffic Act as it stands licences belonging to a haulagebusiness run by an individual or a partnership cannot be transferred to apurchaser of the business. The purchaser must apply for a new licence in hisown right. Special provisions in the Act enable him to obtain the licence with little difficulty if the business is a going concern and if he is not disqualified from holding a licence by reason of previous offences as a carrier. If the business is moribund, however, as is sometimes the case, and the purchaser is in effectattempting to buy access to haulage with a view to cutting a niche for himself atthe expense of other hauliers&apos; traffic, the Licensing Authority may refuse hisapplication.13.25 It was pointed out to us that this control did not operate in the case of limited companies. Licences belonging to haulage businesses run by limitedcompanies vest in the company and not in any individual. Control of a mori-bund business, if it was a company, could therefore pass without the mattercoming to the notice of a Licensing Authority.Holding Companies&apos;&apos; C Licences13.26 The act permits vehicles used by a holding company to carry goodsunder that company&apos;s C licence on behalf of subsidiary companies of which itis the beneficial owner of not less than 90% of the issued share capital. It was represented to us that no harm would be done and a useful gain in the efficiency*Under the Agriculture Act 1947 (S.109(3)): &quot;Agriculture includes horticulture, fruitgrowing, seed growing, dairy farming and livestock breeding and keeping, the use of land asgrazing land, meadow land, osier land, market gardens and nursery grounds, and the use ofwoodlands where that use is ancillary to the farming of land for other agricultural purposes&quot;.
of some C licence fleets would accrue if this concession were extended to sub-sidiary companies more than 50% owned and if vehicles licensed by onesubsidiary could carry for another.Holding Companies and Contract A Licences13.27 It was further suggested that the concession in respect of interworkingunder holding companies&apos; C licences could usefully be extended to interworkingunder a Contract A licence granted under a contract between a haulier and a holding company.Duration of Licences13.28 A and C licences at present have a maximum life of 5 years but Blicences a life of only 2 years. Various suggestions were made for changes in the duration of licences, including a suggestion that all licences should have a life of 5 years.Display of Licence Conditions13.29 It was suggested that vehicles subject to restrictive conditions shoulddisplay the conditions in question as an aid to enforcement.Definition of Capacity of Vehicles13.30 A number of witnesses pointed out that the unladen weight of a goodsvehicle was an unreliable indicator of its carrying capacity. It was suggested thatwhen introduction of a &quot; plating scheme &quot; (see paragraph 6.51 above) made the carrying capacity of each vehicle readily ascertainable, this should be used as ameasure whenever appropriate.Licensing by Capacity of Fleet13.31 It was also suggested that, at least for some carriers, licensing should bein terms of the total capacity of their fleet rather than of individual vehicles.Licensing of Trailers13.32 It was suggested that trailers, and in particular the semi-trailers ofarticulated vehicles, should be individually identified in licences instead of as atpresent authorised by a description of type and weight. This change wouldtighten the control exercised by Licensing Authorities.Definition of &quot; Goods Vehicle &quot;13.33 Section 191 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 defines a goods vehicle as &quot; a motor vehicle constructed or adapted for use for the carriage of goods, or atrailer so constructed or adapted &quot;. It was suggested that this definition wasinsufficiently precise.Deposits from Applicants and Objectors13.34 It was suggested that applicants and objectors should be required tolodge deposits which would be forfeit if without due notice they failed to appearat a public inquiry called to consider their case. It was said that the practice oflodging precautionary or merely delaying objections without attempting to sustain them was fairly prevalent and caused waste of valuable time to licensing authorities and others concerned in the proceedings.
-    2Use of Drivers Not Employed by Licensee13.35 The Act lays the responsibility for the correct licensing of a goodsvehicle upon the employer of the driver. A licence permits only the employer to&quot; use &quot; the vehicle and no vehicle can be specified in more than one licence. Asa result a carrier is unable legally to make arrangements for interchange, forexample, of drivers on vehicles worked jointly with an associate at the oppositeend of or within a trunk route. It was suggested that this restriction should be lifted.Exemption of Vehicles Operating Within Limited Radii13.36 We also received proposals for exemption from various requirementsof licensing of vehicles operating within limited radii. Considered schemes onthese lines were put forward. The general object was to remove from unnecessarycontrol classes of vehicle unlikely to affect the major streams of road transport.Conclusions13.37 We make three points on this list of proposals for reform of the presentsystem. First, some of the suggestions are incompatible each with the other.Some seek to increase control, some to loosen it, sometimes both. Some would increase the complexity and legalism of a system which others said had gone too far already in this direction. Second, the meeting of some of the criticisms wouldinvolve problems of definition or of drawing boundaries. Even if new definitionscould be found, we think these demarcation lines might well in practice proveno more satisfactory than the old. Third, some of the proposals made goodsense to us and would have been put forward by us if we had decided torecommend reform within the present system of quantity control.13.38 But seen in their entirety, the many criticisms of the system had two more telling effects on us. First, they showed that the present arrangements were a long way from satisfying even those who thought that the broad principles onwhich they were founded were right. Second, they were additional evidence ofthe complexity of the apparatus which had grown up, and which clearly would tend to increase as one refinement after another was applied to meet particular points. The net result of all the criticisms was to strengthen our belief that thesystem was ill-suited to present day needs.(Signed) Geddes [Chairman)W. L. BarrowsWalker CarterDavid MilneVincent TewsonB. S.

It isnot possible from the results of the present survey to analyse intermediate journeys by lengthof haul because, by definition, this type of journey is one on which the load is continuallychanging. The present figures therefore relate to journeys analysed by their length; the vehiclemay be loaded for the whole journey or for only part of it, and different consignments (or size of consignment) will be carried on different parts of the journey.Estimated number of loaded end-to-end journeys undertaken during 1962,analysed by length of haulThousands
