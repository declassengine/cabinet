THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1965C. (65) 8529th June, 1965Copy No.     5 9CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1965-66Memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Future Legislation Committee have considered the Billssuggested by Ministers for inclusion in the Legislative Programme for1965-66 and have heard the views of the Ministers concerned. In the list annexed the Bills have been provisionally classified under thefollowing heads:A.l.   Essential Bills that is, Bills which must be obtained by aparticular date.A.2.   Contingent Bills that is, Bills which may become essential.B. Main Programme Bills.C. Bills in Reserve that is, Bills which might be brought forward if time permits, but which cannot have anypriority in drafting.S.   Bills suitable for the proposed Second Reading Committee.P.   Bills suitable for Private Members.D. Other Bills.2. We suggest that the core of the main programme should bethe Bills, foreshadowed in the Manifesto, to implement the government&apos;s social policies. Room must also be found for theoverflow from the present Session, for Bills which may be needed for economic reasons, and for other Bills which may become necessary inthe course of the Session, but cannot now be foreseen. The list of Bills,though long, is not in my opinion too long, bearing in mind that theremay be some casualties.3. List S is new. We have tried to identify Bills which can beintroduced with the intention of referring them to the Second reading committee but not necessarily of finding time for them if objection istaken successfully to their being given a Second Reading by this procedure. :5842a
4. In the normal course the major Bills in the programme shouldbe introduced by the end of January, and a good supply of Bills for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords early in the session is essential. The programme will be further considered whenthe terms of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament arebeing settled in the Autumn. Subject to that, we ought to take decisionsnow on what we want to see in the programme so that the ministers concerned can go ahead urgently with the preparation of their Bills.I accordingly seek the approval of the Cabinet for the provisional programme set out in the Annex.H. B.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,28th June, 1965.
