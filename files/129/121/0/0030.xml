IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C (65) 80 COPY NO.;lst June, 1965CABINET59COMPUTER PURCHASES BY THE government memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn his Memorandum C. (65) 79, the Minister of Technologyproposes that in future the purchase of computers for GovernmentDepartments should be governed by criteria affording a substantialmargin of preference to British manufacturers and that a statement ofthis policy in general terras should be made as soon as possible.    Iwould like to draw attention to the implications of going as far as theMinister of Technology proposes (i. e. a 25 per cent price margin) inrelation to:-(i)   our international commercial relations and certaincurrent negotiations;(ii)   our policy towards foreign investment in the UnitedKin gd om; s.nd(iii)   our location of industry policy.Commercial relations2.      Our general policy has been governed by the conviction that asmajor exporters of manufactures, it is in our interest to persuade othergovernments to adopt the policy of allowing foreign suppliers to compete for orders being placed by public authorities.    Since at thepresent time our total purchases from abroad, including defencepurchases, only amount to some  50 million a year, the balance ofadvantage must still lie heavily with persuading other governments toliberalise their policies rather than in our adopting an overtlyrestrictive purchasing policy.    We are currently pursuing this .aim inthe Kennedy Round negotiations on non-tariff barriers, particularly with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the United States tomodify their &quot;Buy American&quot; rules.    We are also taking part in discussions in O. E. C. D., and have stated in reply to the Secretariatquestionnaire that we do not discriminate against foreign suppliers inthe field of public purchasing.    The United Sta.tes have challenged the accuracy of our statement on the basis of our earlier announcementsabout computers.    To modify our statement of policy at this stage mustseriously weaken our bargaining position in the Kennedy Round andbilaterally with the Americans.    It would inevitably throw doubt on our willingness to refrain from such discrimination in respect of otherindustries; indeed it would be difficult once having breached the present policy to give any assurance that computers would be the soleexception.    A public announcement of a policy of discrimination oncomputers would therefore in my view seriously reduce our chances ofsecuring advantages for British exporters in this part of the kennedy round negotiations without ensuring any appreciable advantage for our balance of paysnents.-1-CONFIDENTIAL

3        The EFTA Convention requires us to eliminate practices ofpublic undertakings which protect domestic production in the same way as duties, import restrictions or subsidies.    It also requires usnot to introduce any new practices of this kind.    As there are atpresent no EFTA suppliers of the larger computers, we could argue that a preference for British suppliers would cause no real damage to EFTA interests.    But other EFTA countries (e. g. Sweden and switzerland) might, nevertheless, object on the grounds that such a trade might develop in the near future j they might object to the breach of the rules because they feared that the principle of preference for British suppliers would inevitably be extended into other fieldswhere they already have a trade interest (e. g. machine tools).Public purchasing practices are already under examination in EFTA,and are amongst the matters that will come under even closer scrutinyas a result of the programme of work to which we agreed at the ViennaMinisterial meeting.     ^IThile, therefore, we might seek to defend theproposed action on computers on the grounds that there is no currentEFTA trade interest, we should ha.ve to be prepared to give an assurance that we have no intention of operating preferences againstEFTA suppliers in cases where they have a real trade interest.Inward Investment4.      The proposal by the Minister of Technology is intended to dis-criminate not merely against imports of computers,but also againstcomputers manufactured in the United Kingdom by foreign-controlledfirms such as I. 3. M. or Honeywell.    This has implications for our policy of attracting foreign investment here and for British interestsoverseas.5.      Many British manufacturers have set up plants abroad in orderto compete more successfully for orders inside foreign markets.    our overseas investment of this kind is many tim.es greater than foreigninvestment here.    We should therefore stand to lose - and should have much more at risk than we could possibly gain - if other Governmentsadopted a like policy and discriminated against British and other foreignsubsidiaries when placing government contracts.6.       There is the more immediate danger of seriously reducing the flow of inward investment into this country.    We have been actively engaged in recent years in trying to attract foreign investment andha.v3 set up an office in New York for this purpose.    Foreign firmscontemplating investment here are assured that they will be treated inexactly the same way as domestic companies.    Discrimination of thekind proposed against firms owned by EFTA nationals could be contraxwto our EFTA obligations.    If we decided deliberately to discriminate against foreign-controlled companies in the field of government orders,this would certainly have a damaging effect on future investment.Foreign firms might well fear that further measures of discriminationwould follow once the principle had been accepted.   The firms imme-diately affected would be American and the United States currentlyaccounts for some 65 per cent of new foreign investment here.     At atime when we are taking measures to restrict the outflow of capital,it v/ould seem unwise to take action that might significantly reduce the-2-

inflow at a time when foreign confidence is already not very strong.Firms established here might transfer their activities on future developments to the Continent; and if for example L, B. Ivi. transferredtheir computer production from Scotland to Switzerland, we should bein breach of our EFTA obligations if we discriminated against them.7.      There is in addition the practical difficulty which must bedealt with in any announcement of our new policy of precisely how we intend to distinguish between wholly British and foreign-controlledfirms.    The &quot;Buy American&quot; rules are essentially related to the valueof imported components included in bids for government contractsnot to the ownership of the company.    If the imported content is over50 per cent, the bid is treated as foreign.    At present, firms likeI. C. T. also import substantial quantities of components.    I have beenasked, together with the Minister of Technology, to consider howimports of computers can be reduced.    One way would be to seek to persuade all computer manufacturers in this country to make a higher proportion of the components here, but it will obviously be moredifficult to persuade firms such as I, 3. M. to do this if we are to discriminate against them in respect of government orders.Location of industry8.      Incoming foreign firms have made a very useful contributionto providing additional employment in development districts.     Comingnew to this country, they are &quot;footloose&quot; and therefore moresusceptible to being steered to the development districts thanestablished United Kingdom firms.    Some well-known names areBurroughs, Caterpillar, Timex and Chemstrand.    In the computer industry, both I. B. MJs main plant and the new Honeywell factory arelocated in Scottish development districts.  , They have been given special inducements to set up manufacturing there in accordance withour general distribution of industry policy.    Moreover, under the contracts Preference scheme which dates back to the 1930&apos;s, firms in development districts are, other things being equal, given preferential treatment in relation to government contracts.    If we now decide to discriminate against these American-controlled firms in Scotland, weshall be reversing this preference.    I think we must certainly expecta strong reaction from the American firms concerned and from Scotland(and development districts elsewhere) if we introduce such discrimina.-tion, and quite apart from the reduced prospect of attracting new firms,we shall have reduced the likelihood of those firms already thereexpanding.conclusions .     My view is that we will do serious damage to our economy andto the balance of payments if we embark at this time on a policy of discrimination in the field of Government purchasing beyond theprotection already provided by the existing customs tariff, and beyondthe principle of preferring British-produced goods when other things are reasonably equal.    On the export side we have a very substantialbusiness in selling to overseas public authorities, and we haveconstantly to resist their protectionist policies.    At the present time,discussions are going on in EFTA to ensure that all members honour

their very special obligations in respect of this tra.de.    In the GATTalso we are discussing measures designed to remove obstacles tothis trade.    I would not wish to see the prospect impaired by changingour policy now.10.     I am even more concerned about the damage we could do by adopting a discriminatory policy as regards firms in the United Kingdomaccording to whether they are wholly British-owned or not, and inparticular a. policy which would in effect discriminate against theAmerican firms whom we have encouraged to establish themselveshere.    We should find it very difficult to convince others thatcomputers were a quite exceptional case and that discriminationapplied to them did not signify a major change in our policy.    Thesefirms are making a notable contribution to our economy, both in import saving and in exports;   they are important sources of employ-ment in some of our development districts notably Scotland andNorthern Ireland where they have introduced modern industries, andin some cases transformed the whole outlook.    It would be a majorblow to our policy of trying to attract such firms and particularly tothe development districts, if we now  embark on a policy of discrimina-ting against them.    Indeed we might put at risk the existing employment which they provide.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. V/. 1.31st May, 1965
