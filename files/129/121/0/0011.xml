(65) 61 Copy No.    5 98th April, 1965CABINETBBC finance memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe BBCs financial problem the Corporation have been committed by decisions of theprevious Government, following the report of the PilkingtonCommittee, to undertake major expansion of their services, namely:(a) BBC-2;(b) self-contained television services for Scotland and Wales;(c) more hours for sound broadcasting;id) more adult education programmes; andie) a start on colour television.Except for colour television these decisions, which were generally welcomed when they were announced, have been implemented.2. The previous Government said, in its first White Paper onthe Pilkington Report (Cmnd. 1770, paragraph 59):&quot; The proposals . . . will mean increased BBC expenditure.The Government accepts its responsibility to see that the BBCcan secure sufficient income to finance adequate services.&quot;This undertaking was not fulfilled.3. The present fees are  4 for a combined television and soundlicence (the charge to the public of  4 has remained unchanged since1957) and  1 for a sound only licence (unchanged since 1946). the bbc are now using their borrowing powers to balance their accounts and they say that a  6 combined licence fee is essential if they are tomeet their financial commitments ( 1 15s. of the increase would beto meet the cost of the new developments authorised by our predecessors). They are also asking for the sound only licence fee tobe increased to  1 5s. The changes in the licence fees since the war are shown in Annex 1. The BBCs estimates (summarised in Annex 2)show that if the BBCs present commitments were to be maintainedCONFIDENTIAL5600 a

At its meeting on 1st April the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting considered my paper on Broadcasting Development inwhich I argued that unless my colleagues were prepared to considerradical changes there was no alternative but to increase the combinedsound and television licence fee to  6 and the sound only licence feeto 25s. as the BBC have proposed, and to pay over to the BBC thewhole of the net proceeds. The Committee also had before them a paper by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury drawing attention tothe rate at which the BBCs financial position is deteriorating and urging the need for an early decision.5. The Committee concluded that an increase in the combinedfee beyond  5 would be generally regarded as incompatible with ourincomes and prices policy. We decided to recommend to Cabinet,as an interim measure, that the combined sound and televisionlicence fee should be increased to  5 and the sound only licence to  1 5s. This will enable the BBC to contain their deficit, for some two years.6. We recommend that, meanwhile, there should be a reviewof the BBCs finances and development plans; and that, as a first step, the BBC should be asked to make available to us the report which, at the BBCs own request, Messrs. Urwick, Orr and Partners,a. leading firm of management consultants, made about three years,ago on the BBCs efficiency controls. The review, which should, becompleted by July, would enable us to judge what, if any, further measures we should need to take to deal with the BBCs financial problem.7. An interim decision to increase the licence fee only to  5carries with it, of course, the need to restrict the BBCs commitments.So, pending the outcome of the review, I would not authorise a startin colour television; nor would I allow any increase in the numberof hours of television broadcasting either for the BBC or for independent television. Incidentally, this would reserve unusedbroadcasting time on all the existing general services for anyexperiments in educational broadcasting, which the Secretary ofState for Education and Science may wish to mount. I do not however propose at present any restriction on the BBCs plans for continuing to expand the geographical coverage of BBC-2.8. Hitherto the BBC revenue has been annually reinforced bythe growing number of viewers. However these have now reached aplateau, and in future increased BBC revenue will depend uponincreases in the size of the licence fee itself. Even after a  6 licence which would last till the late &apos;60s an increase of 10s. per year
has been estimated as necessary. It is this problem, as much as the short-term problem, that has convinced the Ministerial Committeethat a more fundamental examination is required, and that other measures for meeting rising expenditure may have to be considered.Savings facilities9. I recognise that any increase in the licence fee would bear very hard on poorer people. I therefore proposed and theCommittee endorsed this proposal to introduce a special card,obtainable at any Post Office, on which people could stick the required number of National Savings Stamps until they had savedenough to exchange the card for a licence (one 2s. 6d. stamp a week for 40 weeks would be sufficient for a  5 fee). The cards would beintroduced on the same day as the new licence fees and I would announce their introduction at the same time as the new fees were announced.Questions for decision10. Above all we cannot allow the public service broadcastingsystem to be destroyed for lack of finance. An early announcementis essential and I should like to make a statement in the House ofCommons (Annex 3) on 14th April. I accordingly invite mycolleagues:(i) to endorse the conclusion of the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting that, as an interim measure, the combinedsound and television licence fee should be increased to 5 and the sound only licence fee to  1 5s.;(ii) to agree that further consideration should be given to theproblem of the BBCs income and expenditure following a financial review to be completed by July;(iii) to endorse my proposal to introduce a special card on whichNational Savings Stamps can be saved towards licences;and(iv) to consider my proposed statement (Annex 3).A.

Annex draft STATEMENT AFTER QUESTIONS ON14th APRIL, 1965With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about BBC finance. The BBC were committed by decisions of theprevious Government, following the report of the PilkingtonCommittee, to undertake major expansion of their services. Theyhave represented to me that a  6 combined sound and televisionlicence fee is essential if they are to meet their financial commitments.They are also asking for the sound only licence fee to be increasedto  1 5s. The Government has decided that the problem of BBCfinance requires further study and I shall be asking the BBC toco-operate in our review. Until our review is complete I shall notauthorise any increase in hours of broadcasting (whether for the bbc or for independent television), nor can there be a start in colour television. But it is not enough to rely upon negative measures alone.We cannot allow public service broadcasting to be destroyed for lackof finance and, as an interim measure, I shall therefore be layingbefore the House shortly after the Easter Recess proposals toincrease the licence fees, from 1st August, 1965, to  5 and  1 5s.In order to make it easier for people to save towards licences, Ishall therefore be introducing, also on 1st August, 1965, specialcards, obtainable at any Post Office, on which people can stickNational Savings stamps to the number required to exchange their,card for a licence.
