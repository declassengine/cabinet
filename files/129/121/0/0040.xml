CONFIDENTIAL nnoc boHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 90 COPY NO..    596th July, 1965CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIt is necessary to reach early decisions on recommendationsarising from Lord Mountbatten&apos;s recent Mission to certainCommonwealth countries, if a full and detailed statement ofGovernment policy is to be made as promised by the Prime minister in the House of Commons on 15th June, and a White Paper issuedbefore the Summer Recess.Lord. Mountbatten1 s report.     Lord Mountbatten was commissioned to explain to the other commonwealth Governments whom he visited the problems caused us by the present scale of immigration into this country, and to consider what new measures might be adopted, particularly in the countries of origin, to regulate the flow.    He was also invited to make any recommendations as to policy or procedures in the whole field of immigration.    His recommendations were summarised inparagraph 76 of his Report (C. I. (65) 19), of which  an extract isattached at Annex A.Commonwealth lxn.ro.igration Committee1 s i Views3.     These recommendations have been considered by theCommonwealth Immigration Committee, who are prepared to accept them except as explained below.Workers (recommendations (i) to (yiii))4.     The Committee considered that the overall figure of 10,000vouchers a year in future recommended by Lord Mountbatten was too high, and that a more realistic figure would be 7,500,    this figure, however, needed to be considered against the figures of aliensadmitted for employment here, of whom 9,000 were allowed to take uppermanei t residence here in 1964 (an exceptionally high year).5.     While generally in favour of the abolition of Category C (mainlyunskilled) vouchers, the Committee felt that, while perhaps maintain-ing the distinction between Category A vouchers (those with jobs to goto) and Categox-y B vouchers (those with special qualifications or skillsneede &apos; here), vouchers might be issued   within these broad categoriesaccording to a restricted list of eligible occupations agreed inter-departmentally and arranged in order of priority.    On the basis of a limit of 7,500 vouchers the Minister of Labour has suggested thefollowing list:-

(1)   doctors, dentists and nurses;(2)   qualified teachersj(3)    graduates in science or technology with two yearspost-graduate experience;(4)   non graduates with certain professional qualifications and two years experience after qualifying;(5)   persons with offer of employment in hospitals;(6)   persons with offers of employment in public transport.He considers that it would be impracticable not to reveal publiclythese classifications and the criteria required.6.     As regards Malta (recommendation (vii)), some members ofthe Committee were doubtful about the proposal for special arrange-ments to ensure that Malta receives until 1967 not less than her present level of 1,500 vouchers.    This matter must clearly be considered inrelation to Her Majesty&apos;s Governments relevant commitments to malta, which are set out in the note at Annex B.7.     Some members of the Committee think that attention shouldbe drawn to two further implications of these proposals:-(i)   By restricting categories of Commonwealth employment-voucher holders to those v/ith special qualifications of value to this country, would we not, in our own interests, be discriminating against Commonwealth,countries, both in &quot;creaming off&quot; the skilledprofessional workers whose services they needthemselves, and at the same time in treating themless favourably than foreign countries on whosenationals no such limitations   are imposed?(ii)   3y imposing such rigid and limited categories ofemployment for immigrants from commonwealth countries, should we not be inflicting undue hardship&apos; on small dependent territories (for whom Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have a special responsibility) whoseeconomies are to a greater or lesser extent dependenton being allowed to send workers here in other categories than those listed?3.     Figures are attached at Annex. C of statistics regarding the immigration and employment of Commonwealth citizens and aliens,and statistics of vouchers hitherto issued to Common wealth citizensfor different categories of employment.Dependants9.      The Committee felt that some further limitation on the entry of dependants was desirable, having rega.rd particuia-rly to a possiblehalf million dependants now entitled to admission if they care toexercise the right.    They considered - but rejected - various possibilities of imposing a limitation, including that of a moratoriumon the entry of all dependants and a scheme for requiring proof of-2-

satisfactory housing arrangements being available for all nev/lyarriving dependants of established immigrants.    They consider,however, that, while preserving their legal right of entry, theremust be stricter control of dependants.    The Committee agree withthe Mission*s recommendation (x) that the concessionary extensionsset out in Cmd. 1716 (to allow children from the ages of 16 to 18 tojoin parents and to allow children under 16 to rejoin relatives otherthan parents) should be withdrawn.    As regards the need to verifyclaims for the admittance of dependants (recommendation xi), after considering various alternatives, the Committee think that the bestarrangement would be to make it a requirement for immigrant workers to register, before some specified elate, the names and particulars ofall their direct dependants.    These should be checked in the country of origin, and certificates issued which would need to be producedto immigration officers on arrival to secure admittance.    legislation would be needed to enable immigration officers to refuse admittanceto dependants arriving without certificates of registration.    The HomeSecretary  should have discretionary powers to waive the strict application of these requirements in compe.soionate cases.Students10.     In order to check the bona fides of a student the Missionrecommended (xii) that encouragement should be given to arrangements whereby Commonwealth Governments and High Commissions in Londonvouch for the bona fides of students,     When they completed or gave up their studies they should be allowed to take up work only if they wouldhave qualified for avoucher.    To ensure that they left aftercompleting their studies a new general power to repatriateCommonwealth citizens without a criminal conviction or a   courtrecommendation should be used,11.     This would not, however, solve the problem of finding students who left their studies for general employment.    The most practical solution would be to compel the registration with the nolice of thosestudents whose bona fides was in doubt.     Registration with the police would, however, be inappropriate for C omm on wealth citizens andwould be sharply criticised by the Comm on wealth.    Other methods of keeping in touch with them, e. g. through Colleges would be muchpreferable.12,     The Committee think that there should also be some tighteningup of the present criteria for admission as a Student&apos; and of the definition of Educational establishment1.Visitors13.     The Committee agree with the Mission&apos;s recommendation(xiii) to limit stays of visitors to six months (extensions being freelygranted if good cause is shown)Conditions of Entry14.     The Mission recommended (xiv) that there should be a general power to impose conditions of entry.    The liability would be extended by statute to all Commonwealth citizens subject to control, includingvoucher-holders and entitled dependants, and the power would be a

general power to impose any condition.    The Committee agree butfeel that the power to require registration with the police as acondition of entry in any class of case   should not be exercisableunless it is expressly conferred by a statutory instrument subjectto the affirmative resolution procedure.    The general power might,it was suggested by the Home Secretary, also be used to obtainphotographsRepatriation15.     The Committee agree with the Missions recommendation (xv)that there should be power to repatriate Commonwealth citizenswithout the necessity of a criminal conviction or a courtrecommendation.    They think, however, that a right to make representations to an independent authority would be essential.Whether there should be a qualifying period of residence here for theexercise of this right, and if so how long, will require decision by theCabinet.    Aliens acquire a right to make representations againstdeportation after two years of residence:  it is urged that, in principleCommonwealth immigrants&apos; rights in this respect should be greaterthan those of aliens.Health Checks16.       While agreeing wholeheartedly that it is desirable toestablish effective health checks for immigrants entering the UnitedKingdom, the Minister of Health does not agree that it is practical toensure that these are effectively carried out in all the countries of origin.    The national health authorities, he thinks, cannot be relied upon to produce reliable certificates, and it would be too difficult and expensive to instal United Kingdom teams of doctors, etc. withthe necessary diagnostic equipment in all the countries from which we receive immigrants.     He considers therefore that health checks muscontinue to be carried out in the United Kingdom and extended and improved where possible.    Some of the Committee, however, laygreater stress on the arguments in favour of checks in the country of origin, even if not 100 per cent reliable, on the grounds that thereis a strong feeling, however unjustified, in this country againstpotential carriers of diseases being allowed to reach these chores.They emphasise also the hardships involved in returning sick personsonce they have arrived here.    This has however been the practiceover many years with aliens.Decisions required170 Decisions by the Cabinet are now sought on the followingpoints(1)   Should the overall limit of vouchers be 7,500 annually(subject to a possible sxaecial additional allotment to malta)?(2)    On this basis should the distinction between Category Aand Category B vouchers be maintained and is thelimitation of employment-vouchers to the categoriesproposed by the Minister of Labour (see paragraph above) acceptable ?(3)     If agreed, must the proposed categories be made public,as in the past ?-4-

(4)   Should similar restrictions be placed on foreign workers?(5)   Should a special allotment of vouchers be given to Maltaso that she may receive up to 1,500 vouchers at least until 1967?(6)   Should legislation be enacted to enable immigration officers to refuse admittance to dependants of immigrants not in possession of a certificate of registration as a dependant of an immigrant (i. e. asa wife or child, under 16 of a voucher -holder) ?(7)   Should a general power be taken for immigration officers to impose conditions of entry on any immigrantwhose bona fides is in doubt, including dependantsand visitors?    Should this power include the right torequire photographs of immigrants ?(8)   Should this power ever be used to require Commonwealthstudents, whose bona fides is in doubt, to register withthe police?    If so, should the power to requireregistration be held in reserve until expresslyapproved by Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure ?(9)   If, as proposed, there should be power to repatriateCommonwealth citizens without the necessity of a criminal conviction or a court recommendation, subjectto the right of representation, should there be a qualifying period of residence for the exercise of this right, and, if so, how long should it be ?(10) Should immigrants be required to pass a medical testin the country of origin?    If not, should measures belimited to what can be done to improve existing arrangements in this country ?(11) Should powers be taken for the medical examinationof dependants, and also to make it a condition of entry for all immigrants found to require medical treatment that they should take steps to obtain it?Timing18.     Decisions are also needed on the timing of:-(i)    The statement in Parliament on Government policy.(ii) The issue of the proposed White Paper.(iii) The proposed, changes in the voucher scheme, andother changes which need not await legislation.(iv) The timing and date of operation of the legislation required.; H.

Dependants should not be excluded on the grounds of ill health, nor should students unless theyare unfit to follow their chosen course of study (paragraphs 63-68)Knowledge of English(xvii) Immigrants who come to work should have to satisfy the british high Commission in the country of origin that they have sufficientEnglish to become assimilated to the British community (paragraph 69).

ANNBX BMALTAThe fact that Malta has special problems is recognised inthe Preamble to the Agreement on Financial Assistance to Malta*which states:-&quot;.......... The Government of the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, having regard tothe special problems of the economy of Malta, desireto assist the Government of Malta in the diversificationand development of the economy of Malta&quot;.2.     Among other forms of assistance the Agreement specifiesthat the United Kingdom Government will provide financialassistance during the five years ending on 31 March, 1969,towards &quot;the costs of emigration at levels to he agreed fromtime to time between the two Governments&quot;.      The BritishGovernment have accepted the need for a high rate of Malteseemigration and have also encouraged the Malta Government toset up a special unit in Britain to recruit Maltese emigrantsand settle them in jobs here.      In 196I4/65 British capitalassistance to Malta under the Agreement included a grant of ^79,500 towards their emigration expenses.3.     Malta&apos;s position is in fact unique.     For over a centurythe entire economy of the colony was based on the serviceestablishments and the Naval Dockyard.      The decision to rundown these establishments was dictated solely by our own interests.      With substantial capital assistance from us, the malta Government are now attempting to rebuild their wholeeconomy on a new basis, but the next two years, till 1967, bywhich time their development programme will, it is hoped, be making some impact on the economy, are crucial./U.

if.      In response to approaches from the British Government,the &apos; old&apos; Commonwealth, particularly Australia, have accepted,more Maltese immigrants.

ANNEX CSTATISTICS OF IMI&amp;RATIONImmigration from the Commonwealth1 . A substantial increase in the number of coloured commonwealth citizens settling in this country first came to notice in 1953.     From1955 onwards a rough check was kept at the ports of the number of commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean, Asia, East and West Africa andthe Mediterranean who were arriving and leaving.     Estimates of the netintake of coloured immigrants based on this count are as follows -Year	Total Number1955	42,7001956	46,8501957	42,4001958	29,850YearTotal Number1959196o19611962(first months21 ,60057,700136,40094,9002.

4.   Immigration from Foreign CountriesIt is not possible to give- exactly comparable figures foraliens because most categories of aliens are allowed to enter the UnitedKingdom only temporarily in the first instance:    a foreign worker andhis wife and children, for example, are not accepted for permanent residence until he has completed four years in approved employment.The number of foreign workers who do so is only about one-fifth of thenumber entering on labour permits.     The table below gives figures forthe years 1963 and 1964;    because the entry into employment and continuedresidence of aliens admitted for temporary purposes is strictly controllethe net balance of inward movement through the ports and its excess overthe number originally admitted for settlement does not have to be relied on as a measure of the actual extent of immigration and these figures have therefore been omitted.1963 1964(1)   Number granted leave to land 2,162,392        2,429,958(2)   Number embarking 2,151 ,104        2,411 ,092(3)   Number granted leave to land as -(a) workers 39,663 42,584(b) workers&apos; dependants 3,337 4,098(c) others (including students)coming for twelve months or more        46,128 44,149(d) visitors 1 ,664,368        1 ,891 ,200(4)   Number accepted for permanent residence -(a) workers 5,897 9,195(b) others (mainly dependants) 9,452 10,016(c) total (a) + (b) 15,349 19,211Permits issued for foreign workers abroad1964Industry and Commerce	9,660Hotels and Restaurants	11,387Entertainers	5,480Nurses	2,402Student employees	7,225Resident Domestic workers    (other	than in hotel and catering)TotalDirect comparispns between the aliens scheme and the voucher schemepresent some difficulties.
