(65) 74 Copy No.      ****14th May, 1965CABINETSLUM CLEARANCE: COMPENSATION for owner-OCCUPIERSMemorandum by the Minister of Overseas DevelopmentDuring the election we made specific pledges to the effect that adequate compensation would be proVided for owner-occupiers&apos;displaced by clearance schemes and that in particular we would extendlocal authorities&apos; power to pay supplementary compensation in certain cases beyond the end of this year when it is due to lapse. The PrimeMinister spelt out these pledges at. his Press conference in Liverpoolduring the campaign and a number of us are personally very deeply committed .by. them.2. The Minister of Housing and Local Government has tried todeal with this matter through a Private Member&apos;s Bill but has not beenable to find a Member willing to introduce it. At present there is no government legislation in contemplation and questions are being asked during the municipal campaign as to what has happened to ourpledge.3. The urgency of this matter arises from the fact that the powerto pay supplementary compensation lapses on 13th December thisyear. If the legislation is not amended before then it clearly cannotbe amended at all. This is not a case, therefore, where we can postpone the fulfilment of a pledge. We must act soon or admit that the pledgehas been violated.4. The cases to be covered are those of owner-occupiers whowere compelled by the post-war housing shortage to buy unfit housesat inflated prices. Because slum clearance was in abeyance up to 1955they bought in the expectation that the houses would have an indefinitelife and the price they paid reflected this. When slum clearance was resumed in 1955, steps were taken to meet their difficulties under theHousing Act 1957. Schedule II of the Act provides that owner-occupiers who bought their houses between 1939 and 1955 will beentitled to compensation up to full market value provided the houses are acquired for clearance before 13th December, 1965. In certain5701
areas where there are a large number of such houses acquisition is farfrom complete and, unless the period is extended, the owners will onlyget site value.5. I would suggest to my colleagues that amending legislationneed take very little Parliamentary time. All we need is a one-clauseBill substituting the year 1970 for 1965 in Schedule II of the.1957Act. This would give local authorities another five years in which toacquire the qualifying properties.6. The Minister of Housing has informed me that he is doing the best he can without legislation by encouraging local authoritiesto buy the houses before the present Act expires. This action, welcomeas it is, comes up against two main difficulties. The first is that localauthorities could not possibly value and acquire all the housesinvolved in the time available. In my own constituency, for example,it is taking up to 12 months to complete the purchase in advance of properties being acquired outside the current two-year programmeof slum clearance. With 10,000 houses to be cleared, the programmeextends to 1982 and the local authority estimates that the minimum period needed to acquire all the properties would be five years. even this would involve drastically condensing the 17-year programme andwould cause considerable difficulties. It would be quite impossiblefor the Council to acquire all the qualifying properties before the endof this year.7. The second difficulty would arise from the cost of acquiringthousands of houses within the next few months which in the case ofmy own local authority would amount to a very large sum.8. For all these reasons I would urge that time be found for a one-clause Bill extending the period for five years.B. A. C.Ministry of Overseas Development, S.W.1,12th May, 1965.
