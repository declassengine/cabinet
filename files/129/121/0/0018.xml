HIS DOCUMENT IS THIS PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 63 COPY NO. 594th May, 1965CABINETTHE LAW RELATING TO HOMOSEXUAL OFFENCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home DepartmentLord Arran will move the following Motion in the House of lords on Wednesday, 12th May:&quot;To call attention to the recommendations of the WolfendenCommittee on homosexual offences; and to move fox-Paper s&quot;.He will advocate the implementation of the Wolfenden recommendations that homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should cease to be a criminal offence, and he expects to be supported by atleast a dozen speeches from both sides of the House, from the Benchof Bishops and from the Cross Benches.I consider that the basic Government attitude should be thatthis is a matter for personal judgment; that debates of this kind serve the xiseful purpose of focusing public attention on the essential considera-tions; that the strongest opinions are at present widely held on bothsides; and that the Government would not think it right either to adviseagainst implementation of the Wolfenden recommendations or to come out in support of it.I am reluctant however to adopt a wholly neutral attitude,without offering some guidance to the growing body of opinion in favourof a change in the law on how in the Governments view a change mightbe brought about.    For the foreseeable future Government legislationmust I think be ruled out, and the question arises how far we should goin encouraging a Private Member&apos;s Bill.I think that the least that could be said would be that theappropriate course for those in Parliament who support a change in thelaw would be to introduce a Bill at a suitable opportunity so that parliamentary opinion may express itself on specific provisionsimplementing the Wolfenden recomnaendations; and that while theGovernment could not undertake to provide time for the Bill, theywoxxld not wish to obstruct it and would be content with the decisionParliament reached on a free vote.-1-

But, after consulting the Home Affairs Committee, I think itmight be desirable for the Government spokesman to go further andindicate that if there appeared to be a general wish that a private member&apos;s Bill should be discussed, and that this could not be doneunless the Government made time available, then the Government would consider providing such time, although there was no possibility of theirdoing so in the present Session.    This would imply recognition by theGovernment that the issue was one of sufficient public importance for parliament to be enabled to reach a conclusion upon it, but the HomeAffairs Committee would welcome such an undertaking.Lord Arran does not think that after receiving the strong supporthe expects in the debate he should withdraw the Motion, and he envisagesthat it would then go to a Division.    I propose, at the suggestion of theHome Affairs Committee, that the Government spokesman should notadvise the House either to accept or to reject the Motion, and thatGovernment supporters, including Ministers, should be left free to voteaccording to their personal judgment.    I understand that there would beno need to supply a.ny papers in response to the Motion, if it were carried, unless Lord Arran asked in his speech for specific information.I invite the Cabinet to agree that Lord Stonham, on behalf of theGovernment, should adopt a neutral attitude to the Motion but should indicate the Governments willingness to make Government time available for the consideration of a Private Member&apos;s Bill should it appear that there was a general wish that such a measure should bediscussed; and that a Division should be handled on the lines indicatedin paragraph 6 above.-  . s.Home Office, S.&apos;W. 1. ,4th May, 1965-2-
