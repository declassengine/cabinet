April 1965C (65) 62 Copy No.     5912th April, 1965CABINETTRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT, 1921Memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet, at their meeting on 11th March (C.C. (65) 15thConclusions, Minute 7), invited me, in consultation with the lord president, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Minister without portfolio, the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to give further consideration to the means by which the operation of the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, might be improved andto the extent to which an independent inquiry for this purpose mightbe expected to be of value.2. We: have examined the criticisms that have been made ofthe procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry. (Evidence) Act andthe suggestions ,which have been made for improving it. Criticismis concerned principally with- ,&apos;    (a) the difficulty which a person who may be involved in an&apos; &quot;    investigation has in defending himself in the absence of- anything in the nature of a formal&apos;charge and. Without-the-procedures and rules of evidence which have been developed in the criminal courts for the protection of- accused persons;(b) the public nature of the proceedings which results incurrency being given to allegations against &quot;innocent. . persons some time before they have an opportunity to. &apos; u   /- reply;i  &apos;&apos; &apos; &apos; *&apos; &apos;  - &apos; -J 1L&apos;    l&apos; &apos; &apos;(e) the expense to which innocent persons maybe put in beinglegally represented at the inquiry; V&apos;    (d) the participation of the Attorney-General (or, in the case.of inquiries in Scotland, generally speaking, the Lord.    u Advocate) in the proceedings as amicus curiae, which-y:l llvu:k tends to suggest to the public that the Government, somer &apos; .of whose members or actions may be under investigation,- &apos;. are acting in the role of prosecutor, and that theproceedings cannot therefore be impartially conducted.3r We considered that if it were accepted that it is.necessaryto retain a means of investigating matters of urgent public importance by an inquisitorial procedure, then some improvements5607
might be made in the procedure, for example to make it less difficult for interested persons to prepare and conduct their cases, and togive the tribunal power to award costs.4. With regard to the participation of a Law Officer (or, inScotland; the Lord Advocate) in the proceedings, some of us thoughtthat it must be a matter for him, entrusted as he is with responsibilityfor safeguarding and representing the public interest, to decide inany given case whether he appears or not.5. Such improvements would be of a minor nature and couldbe considered by the Government itself without the assistance ofan independent inquiry. It was clear to us, however, that criticismarises principally from the inquisitorial nature of the procedureitself, and that the grounds for criticism would not. be effectivelyremoved by minor improvements and modifications. Some of usthought that it was necessary for Parliament to retain means of instituting an inquisitorial form of public inquiry, however sparinglyit was used, and that such an inquiry was the most effective meansof clearing the names of innocent individuals whose reputations hadbeen aspersed. It was pointed out that the safeguards provided bythe rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings may preventthe whole truth being disclosed and possibly leave the public withthe impression that discreditable facts had been concealed. We were agreed, however, that a procedure which, whenever it was used,aroused so much public anxiety on the score of hardship and actualinjustice to innocent persons ought not be to retained withoutexamination by a high-powered body in the light of its operationover the 45 years during which it has been in use. We thought thatsuch a body might well consider whether in most, if not all, of thecases in which an inquiry under the 1921 Act would hitherto havebeen thought appropriate some other procedure might not serve thepurpose equally well. We were impressed by the fact that LordDenning&apos;s Inquiry, although held in private, did in fact silencerumours and allay public anxiety without at the same time giving further currency to unfounded suspicions about the conduct of innocent individuals.6. We think that, for the purpose of the inquiry we have inmind, a small Royal Commission would be the most suitable body.We accordingly recommend that a Royal Commission should beestablished with limited membership and wide terms of referenceon the lines recommended by the Home Secretary in C. (65) 31, but with a clear indication that the possibility of devising alternative forms of investigation should be considered, e.g. &quot;To review the working of the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, and to consider whether it should be1 retained or replaced by some other procedure, and, if retained,whether any changes are necessary or desirable; and to make recommendations.&quot;-.- G.House of Lords, S.W.1,9 th April, 1965.
