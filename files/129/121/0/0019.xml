CONFIDENTIAL -       125HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.

(65) 14th Conclusions,Minute 6) a proposal that the Government should accede to a request from the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council that the facility ofthe deduction of trade union subscriptions from pay should be grantedto any recognised Civil Service staff association which sought it, but no conclusion was reached.    The Prime Minister subsequently asked me to consider the questions at issue more fully in consultation withthe Ministers concerned.    I have had discussions with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister ox Labour, the Postmaster General, the Paymaster General,the Minister of State, Department of Economic Affairs, the Chief Whipand the Financial Secretary, Treasury.The original proposals the proposal before the Cabinet on 4th March was that, in respectof unions with a political levy, there should be two rates of deduction,one for those who paid the political levy and the other for those who didnot.     We consider this arrangement objectionable on the ground that itwould enable the Government to deduce the movements of political opinion among its employees from the fluctuations in the number ofdeductions at the higher rate, but we thought that to deduct subscriptionsat a single rate which would include the political levy and leave it tocontracted-out members to claim the levy back from the vmion would beno less objectionable both on legal and political grounds.    We shouldhave been willing to accept deduction of the industrial subscription withoutthe political levy, but, as we expected, the Union of Post Office workers and the Post Office Engineering Union, the only two unions concerned whohave a political levy, proved when consulted to be unwilling to accept this arrangement.^ii? 5^j!y.S^E2;iiS.9 salsThe Post Office unions have, however, put forward alternative proposals, namely that the employer should collect the subscriptionat a rate including the political levy, and that the unions should paycontracted-out members in advance at the beginning of the subscriptionyear the amount which would be deducted from their pay during the year in respect of the levy, about 3s. or 4s. a year according to the union.This would ensure that the Government did not know which employeespaid the levy, that the union complied with the legal obligation to-1-

CONFIDENTIAL *       125THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.

The Prime Minister subsequently asked me to consider the questions at issue more fully in consultation withthe Ministers concerned.    I have had discussions with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister of Labour, the Postmaster General, the Paymaster General,the Minister of State, Department of Economic Affairs, the Chief Whipand the Financial Secretary, Treasury.The original proposals the proposal before the Cabinet on 4th March was that, in respectof unions with a political levy, there should be two rates of deduction,one for those who paid the political levy and the other for those who didnot.     We consider this arrangement objectionable on the ground that itwould enable the Government to deduce the movements of political opinion among its employees from the fluctuations in the number ofdeductions at the higher rate, but we thought that to deduct subscriptionsat a single rate which would include the political levy and leave it tocontracted-out members to claim the levy back from the union would beno less objectionable both on legal and political grounds.    We shouldhave been willing to accept deduction of the industrial subscription withoutthe political levy, but, as we expected, the Union of Post Office workers and the Post Office Engineering Union, the only two unions concerned whohave a political levy, proved when consulted to be unwilling to accept this arrangement.Qy$^3^*veJ xJSB9 salsThe Post Office unions have, however, put forward alternative proposals, namely that the employer should collect the subscriptionat a rate including the political levy, and that the unions should paycontracted-out members in advance at the beginning of the subscriptionyear the amount which would be deducted from their pay during the year in respect of the levy, about 3s. or 4s. a year according to the union.This would ensure that the Government did not know which employeespaid the levy, that the union complied with the legal obligation to-1-

relieve the contracted-out member of payment of the levy, and that theunion did not benefit from the use of the levy during a period betweenits collection and its repayment to contracted-out members.    Thearrangement might still be open to criticism that the Government werefacilitating a deduction which benefited only their own party, and wecould not rule out the possibility that a Private Member&apos;s Bill might beintroduced to prohibit the deduction of trade union subscriptions fromthe pay of Government servants.     On the whole, however, it seemsbetter to accept these risks than to refuse to the Civil Service unions is a facility which is increasingly being given by private employers andthe nationalised industries.    We recognise that if we give the facilityto the Civil Service we shall shortly be asked to make it available toemployees in the National Health Service.    Since, however, it wouldbe part of the arrangement that the union in question would meet theadministrative costs, v/e do not think that the further spread of thepractice of deduction need deter us.It will be essential, however, to stipulate that each employeemust make an individual request for deductions to be made, and thatthis request must be demonstrably voluntary.     We contemplate thatthe union should provide their members with individual forms on which to make the request, and that these forms would be sent by the union to the employing Department.    Clearly the circulation of a list towhich members willing to participate in the arrangement were asked to add their names would not be an adequate safeguard against unionpressure.    A contracted-out member who agreed to the deduction ofthe union subscription from his pay would claim and receive arebate direct from the union, so that the Government would have no part in this process.    The detailed administrative arrangements wouldhave to be negotiated through the Whitley Council procedure and wedo not propose that any announcement should be made until an agreement has been concluded. /ConclusionIt is recommended that the Government should agree, if sorequested, to adopt a system of deducting trade union   subscriptionsfrom pay for any Civil Service union that desire3 it on the basis of asingle rate of deduction, including the political levy, the union under-taking to pay to contracted-out members at the beginning of thefinancial year the amount of levy to be deducted during that year.This arrangement should be conditional on the negotiation through theappropriate machinery of detailed arrangements which v/ould ensurethat the agreement of the individual member to the deduction of hissubscription from pay is voluntary, on the lines indicated inparagraph 4 above.H.
