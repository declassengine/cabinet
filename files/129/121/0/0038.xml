THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1965C. (65) 88 Copy No.    5930th June, 1965CABINETPUBLIC SCHOOLSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education andScienceOn 17th December last my predecessor announced that he proposed &quot; to set up an educational trust with a view to the integration of the public schools within the State system ofeducation&quot;. On 19th May I submitted to the Social services committee a detailed plan for doing this. I proposed to set up aPublic Schools Commission and to give it (in an accompanyingWhite Paper) firm guiding principles on which to work.2. The Social Services Committee approved my proposals inprincipal. But they felt (as I do) that the moment was not propitiousfor stirring up another major row, and that action should wait untilthe autumn.3. I therefore do not now seek Cabinet approval for the merits of my plan, which I shall of course put to Cabinet at the appropriate moment. But I seek a decision on whether we should make anyinterim announcement in the period before we go ahead with themain scheme.4. I think that we should. To say and do nothing might provoke difficulties (a) in the Parliamentary Party (though I personally doubt this), (b) more seriously, at Annual Conference,where there might be a hostile debate which would force me to say something before Cabinet had taken a decision, and (c) amongstour friends in the educational world. It would also make us lookrather foolish at a time when the Public Schools themselves areasking for reform. And it might create an impression of Governmentindecision or give rise to rumours of a split in the Government.5. I therefore suggest that in answer to a written P.Q. I shouldmake some such statement as this.&quot; My preparations for setting up a Public SchoolsCommission to advise on the best way of integrating the publis schools into the State system of education have reached an advanced stage. I now propose to invite the views of interested parties. I shall hope to establish the Commission in the next session of Parliament.&quot;5847
6. I could then conduct a leisurely series of meetings, at whichI would listen rather than talk (as several Shadow Ministers did with representative Headmasters before the General Election).7.  I therefore seek approval for a statement on these lines.C.A.R.C.Department of Education and Science, W.1,29th June, 1965.
