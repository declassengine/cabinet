confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March1965C. (65) 55 Copy No.    5931st March, 1965CABINETIMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES FOR THECOMMONWEALTH SECRETARIATMemorandum by the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsAt the meeting of Commonwealth officials in January to considerthe formation of a Commonwealth Secretariat the United kingdom representative made an offer, with Ministerial approval, of a scale ofimmunities and privileges to be enjoyed by the Secretariat and its staff broadly corresponding to that accorded to international organisations in this country. Under this proposal the &quot;HighOfficers &quot; of the Secretariat would enjoy full diplomatic immunities and privileges. But other senior staff recruited from elsewhere in theCommonwealth would have only first arrival Customs privileges andimmunity in respect of official actions.2. The other Commonwealth representatives were unanimous in pressing strongly for an extension of full diplomatic immunities and privileges to all senior staff recruited from elsewhere in theCommonwealth. They argued that without this extension Secretariatstaff, who would mainly be recruited from the diplomatic services in commonwealth countries, would be at a disadvantage compared withtheir colleagues in Commonwealth High Commissions here; andthat it might not be possible to attract the best candidates for service in the Secretariat. The United Kingdom representative said that theBritish Government would have difficulty in justifying to Parliamentsuch an extension, but, in view of Commonwealth pressure,undertook that the question would be re-examined.3. The Official Committee on Immunities and: Privileges andthe Home Affairs Committee have accordingly looked at the matter again. Their main concern was with the effect which such a concession might have on our policy towards international organisations in this field, since a case could not be established forthe Secretariat staff to enjoy more favourable immunities and privileges as a matter of functional need. They also felt that such a wide concession of this kind would be open to parliamentary criticism. The majority of members of the Home Affairs Committeewere of the opinion that the concession should not be made. But theCommittee felt that it was not appropriate for them to take a finaldecision since they were not well placed to balance the harm whichmight be done to our general policy over immunities and privileges,CONFIDENTIAL5554
2CONFIDENTIALif we did make the concession, against the damage to commonwealth relations if we did not.4. I fully recognise the force of the arguments which have been advanced against conceding full diplomatic status. We are, however,faced with the fact that there are strong feelings among the restof the Commonwealth that the concession should be made;&quot;Mr. Pearson has already pressed the point in a recent message tothe Prime Minister. They will, for instance, maintain that the secretariat is a special case, so that any preferential treatment for it should be free from awkward repercussions elsewhere; that we ought to be prepared to treat a Commonwealth organisation more favourably than an international organisation; and that any failure to meet the rest of the Commonwealth on this point would beevidence of a lack of enthusiasm for the concept of the Secretariatas a unique and valuable Commonwealth organisation.5. In these circumstances I should like to propose that weshould seek some arrangement which would indicate that we had made a sincere effort to satisfy the rest of the Commonwealth inspite of our very real difficulties. The question of personal immunitypresents particular difficulty; it is the aspect on which hithertoParliament has felt most strongly, particularly in relation to trafficoffences. But I hope that we shall be able to make a limitedconcession over diplomatic privilege. The concession which I have in mind is that the senior staff from overseas should be allowedto obtain from the Secretariat reasonable quantities of duty-freeliquor and tobacco for representational purposes and that staff should be granted refund of petrol duty from the commonwealth relations Office Vote, as is done for High Commission staff.Arrangements of this kind in relation to liquor and tobacco (though not petrol, on which the duty is insignificant) exist at the united nations Headquarters in New York.6. Such a concession would fall a long way short of what therest of the Commonwealth are asking for, in that it excludes personalimmunity and does not grant full continuing Customs privileges.We should, however, be in a much stronger position to argue with commonwealth Governments that, despite our very real difficulties,we had made a considerable and genuine effort to meet their wishes.I would hope, too, that we could expect an understanding responsein Parliament, where the great majority of Members would, I think,recognise the need to do something special for this new and very important Commonwealth development.7. Legislative sanction would, I understand, be necessary. Themost convenient course might be an appropriate clause in the short bill which will in any case be required to cover the setting up of the secretariat.8. I very much hope that my colleagues will agree that I should approach Commonwealth Governments on the basis of thearrangement proposed in paragraph 5.A. G. B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,30th March, 1965.CONFIDENTIAL
