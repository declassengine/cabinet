C.(65) 7311th May, 1965CABINETLINKS BETWEEN EFTA AND THE EECMemorandum by the Prime minister the progress towards consolidation of the European free trade Association (EFTA) as a free trade area and of the european economic Community (e.c.) as a customs union is already sharpeningdivisions within Europe,    The danger is increased by the inwardlooking tendencies of the e.c. and their habit of concentrating on thesettlement of their own problems without regard to the effects on theeconomic and political unity of Europe,    A widening of this division would be detrimental to.our interests and indeed to those of theWestern world as a whole.    Moreover, the present position is unstable;the attraction of the Common Market is weakening our own spheres ofinterest.    Thus Austria, Nigeria and East Africa are already in negotiation with the e.c. for association with it, and others will be tempted to follow if they succeed.2.       The United Kingdom must not allow itself to become isolatedin Europe.    We must maintain the aim and hope of establishing closerpolitical and economic unity in Europe in some form in which theUnited Kingdom can play a full and integral part.    To do this we mustbuild on the associations we already have:   such a unity will have to befound on a basis acceptable to the countries both of the Six and of efta.    It has to take account of the progress towards consolidationboth of the e.c. and of EFTA, and the likelihood that this progress willbe carried further:  we cannot, apart from major political upheavals inEurope, expect the Six to abandon the Community arrangements and theTreaty of Rome,    Thus the ultimate solution seems only feasible interms which it is still difficult to envisage - a solution based on theinclusion of the United Kingdom and other EFTA countries (some of thelatter as Associates) in a Community based on the Treaty of Rome butdeveloping and adopting policies acceptable to us.    There can be noquestion of our trying to deal with this problem by seeking immediateentry to the Community, if only because of the general s veto on us,In the meantime we must seek to prevent loss of confidence or cohesionin EFTA, which was shaken by the introduction of the import sur-charge (though that difficulty seems now to have largely passed) andwould be weakened if Austria decided to join the e.c. on terms which meant leaving EFTA,    If once Austria moved, we could not be sure that Denmark might not follow, and we could in the end find ourselvesfaced with the prospect of trying to negotiate entry into a largerCommunity from a position of considerable weakness.3.       Thus the problem is one of keeping up hope and direction at atime when it is not possible to take major initiatives to merge the two groups.    Nonetheless there are various ways in which we could seekCOPY NO,&apos;..   142THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

to bring them closer together and to build bridges between them.    TheChequers meeting with leaders of European Socialist Parties indicated that there is such great interest in this question that the present time ispropitious for a discussion at the Vienna Meeting of the EFTA on 24thMay of any ideas which may at least mitigate the dangers of the divisionof Europe, and perhaps help to promote its eventual unity.4.       What we can expect to achieve will inevitably be limited, but weshould not underrate the psychological importance of such a discussion,especially as it is now clear that a number of EFTA Prime ministers are prepared to attend the Vienna Meeting because of the value that they attach to it.    The discussion will serve to demonstrate not only ourconcern with the problem of division in Europe but also our desire to solve it in conjunction with our EFTA friends,5.      At the same time we must guard against creating excessiveexpectations or fears about what we can reasonably expect to achieve.There is now general recognition that we cannot join the e.c. withoutfundamental changes in our trading relations with other commonwealth countries and in our agricultural system.     v7e must avoid creating theimpression that this is what we are proposing to do in the near future,6.       In the light of these considerations I feel that our objectives atthe Vienna Meeting should be to restore the cohesion of EFTA, so faras we can do so without detriment to our longer-term prospects for entry into the e.c.;  to explore With our EFTA colleagii.es positive ways of reducing the trade barriers between the two groups and ways of preventing the inward-looking character of e.c. policy making fromcreating new barriers;  and to seek agreement with them forinitiatives in these fields.7.       I suggest that the immediate need, to maintain the morale of efta and to build a bridge between EFTA and the e.c., would be wellserved by two proposals for institutional developments which I should like to put to the EFTA meeting in Vienna:-(a) the establishment of a standing joint Consultative Council of the member countries of the e.c. and SFTA;(b) an exchange of ambassadors between the e.c. and EFTA.8.       The standing joint Consultative Council should consist ofMinisters with a subordinate committee of senior officials.    It mightwell supersede the discussion of economic affairs (but not political)which we have tried to maintain through the 7/, E. U, with theGovernments of the Six since the Brussels breakdown, though this would obviously be mere attractive to other members of EFTA than to us.The council s terms of reference should provide primarily for thediscussion of questions of general economic and commercial policy ofparticular interest to e.c. and EFTA countries, with a view to avoidingdivergences between the broad lines of development of the two groups and the removal of obstacles to mutual trade.    In this way the council could avoid duplication of discussions of economic questions in other and wider contexts, e. g. in O. E. C.B.    The Council might also be

given a watching brief to look for opportunities to move towards av/ider European market.    Such a Council would probably be welcome toour EFTA partners and possibly to some of the Six, but the french would probably veto it.    We need not on that account be deterred fromputting the proposal forward.9.      An exchange of ambassadors between the e.c. and EFTA wouldmake possible a continuing dialogue between the tv/o organisations,reinforcing the work of the Council and maintaining a momentum on thediscussion of substantive proposals.10.     At Vienna we should go on from there to canvass - not as ourown proposals but as ideas put forv/ard in various quarters and meritingfurther consideration in EFTA and. (if SFTA agreed) in the newinstitutional machinery - various substantive ideas for improving the links between the e.c. and EFTA.    After considering the memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C,(65) 52) I suggest thatthe following possibilities are worth considerihg:-(i)  a wider free trade area created by the e.c. joining EFTA, or(perhaps less provocatively) a new European free trading area in which e.c. and EFTA would each be one member;(ii) the maximum use of the Kennedy Round to reduce tariff barrierson industrial products;(iii)  a further reduction of tariff barriers on goods traded predominantly-nantly between the two groups (the benefits of which would beextended, to other countries on an ni, f. n. basis) to be negotiated in the light of the outcome of the Kennedy Round;(iv) the formation of free trade area type arrangements for appro-priate goods on the model cf the United States/Canadian dealfor motor vehicles and parts or the Swallow scheme for a free trade area in cars.11.      None cf these possibilities, even if fully achieved, would con-stitute a permanent and satisfactory solution to all the problems to whichI refer in the first two paragraphs of this paper.    The proposal thatEFTA should be widened by bringing e.c. in as an additional memberhas been widely canvassed.    It can be argued that, apart from the risk that this might land us with permanent &quot;second class citizenship&quot; inEurope, it might not be in our immediate interest, since it couldexpose us to pressure from, the e.c. in a forum where we should be without the support of the non-European Governments who share our interest in a more outward looking form of European co-operation.On the other hand this, or the variant suggested in paragraph 10(i),could in the short-term preserve our interest in trading with the e.c. and might lay the foundation for the single common market which wasthe ultimate objective.12.     As regards (ii) this is already the firm objective of ourselves and our EFTA partners and is also the professed objective of the e.c..It is plainly right to continue to put the main emphasis on this if only because the trade benefits from an even moderately successful kennedy round are likely ;to be substantially greater than those which we could expect from any purely European tariff arrangement.    At Vienna I

should of course wish to draw special attention to the importance of the kennedy Round in reducing intra-Eurcpean barriers.    Because of therisk that we should be thought by the Americans and others to be losinginterest in the success of the Kennedy Round it would not at this stage be advisable to say much publicly about (iii);  this is something to be pursued once the Kennedy Round is over.    Similarly, with (iv), sincearrangements of this kind would not be compatible with the GATT andwould be likely to encounter strong objections from the U.S.A.    It canbe argued that, if it were thought that we were seriously contemplatingsuch arrangements now the effect on the Kennedy Round might be disastrous;  it would not therefore be wise at this stage to do more thanhint privately to our EFTA partners that after the Kennedy E.ound itmight be worth exploring these ideas further.    On the other hand, ifthe climate was right, we might well suggest at Vienna putting in handsome preliminary consideration between SEC and EFTA while the kennedy Round is still going on, in preparation for action - if that is agreed - after the Kennedy Round is completed.    Against that possi-bility I should like an examination made of the scope for arrangements of this kind;  motor cars, chemicals and machine tools seem the most likely possibilities, but there may be others.    The bala.nce of advantagefor the industries concerned would of course need very careful and detailed consideration and there could be no question of launching specific propo-sals at Vienna.13.     Other possibilities for EFTA/e.c. links which we might discussat Vienna are:-(a)    The extension on a wider European basis of the &quot;functionalcollaboration&quot; arrangements on specific projects in the fields of advanced technology which we are now starting to developwith the French, Germans and Italians.    Sweden and switzerland in particular may in any case be eyeing our recentmoves in this field with interest.    Again, it would be necessaryto have careful prior examination of the fields in which suchcollaboration would be profitable and practicable.    It would be essential to avoid &quot;white elephants&quot; and to bring into anyparticular project only countries who had something useful tocontribute,european.n co-operation, or even moves by one or more countries,to remove the differences in Europe of basic regulations or codesof practice.    Some items in this field are important for closereconomic and technical relationships;  e. g, patents, industrialstandards, and food regulations, but the United kingdom efforts in ;.Y. E. U. for co-operation have had no success.    Itmight, however, be worth while pursixing them at the ministerial level in a joint ESC/EFTA context, and I think we should provide for this possibility at the Vienna Meeting.(c).   On metric systems and decimal coinage the United Kingdom isthe only one out of step.    It is for consideration whether wecould make a contribution in these fields by indicating both tothe EFTA meeting and publicly that we are actively reviewing the possibility of moving to the metric system and to a decimalcoinage, and shall soon be bringing these matters to the pointof decision.    We might even be able to announce positiveGovernmental decisions to move.    There is no doubt that thiswould arouse much interest in Europe.(b)

14.     At the Vienna Meeting I might, therefore, ask my colleagues to agree to an EFTA initiative.    This might take the form of a suggestion by EFTA Heads of Government in the communique after the ViennaMeeting that there should be a meeting of senior Ministers of member governments of SEC and EFTA to discuss the possibilities of establishing a Joint Consultative Council of SFTA and e.c. with the functions sugges-ted in paragraph 8 above, and of a.n exchange of ambassadors betweenthe SEC and EFTA.    The communique could go on to set out as agenda for the new Council proposals for reducing trade barriers in Europe,on the lines discussed in paragraphs 10 to 12, and the other possibilitiesof closer European collaboration outlined in paragraph 13.    I think weshould also arrange for a meeting of appropriate Delegations fromEFTA countries (the Permanent Representatives v/ould need reinforce-ment for this purpose) to work out further stages of this initiative, inso far as this needs to be done in the light of the decisions and announce-ments to be made at the Vienna. M&apos;.meeting,    The agenda for the SFTAmeeting already includes the questions cf European integration and thestrenthening of SFTA.    The Secretary-General has been preparing a directive from Ministers to the Council at official level to prepare areport covering a broad reappraisal cf how EFTA can be developed and strengthened.    I am sure that an exchange of views on the basis of my proposals would provide what is needed to produce the right sense ofoccasion for this meeting and that we should therefore take steps toensure that the directive prepared by the Secretary-General is adapted to put more emphasis on the theme of reducing barriers within Europe,and the strengthening of EFTA presented rather as part of this broaderapproach.15.     If these ideas are acceptable to my colleagues I would proposeto put them informally and confidentially in advance to my SFTAcolleagues for their comments.    We should also need to give some priornotice, at the appropriate stage, to other Commonwealth governments and to the United States Government.    Meantime, in view of the urgency, officials should be instructed to prepare a brief for the vienna Meeting on the basis of them.H. W,10, Downing Street, S.W.I.11th May, 1965-5-
