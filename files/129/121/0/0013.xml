-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTYlS GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 6323rd April, 1965CABINETIRON AND STEEL, NATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of power at their meeting on Oth April, 1965 (C. C. (65) 24th Conclusions,Minute 4), the Cabinet invited me to redraft the White Paper on steel nationalisation in the light of their discussion and agreed to give furtherconsideration to the timing of the publication of the White Paper at a subsequent meeting.2.      A revised draft of the White Paper is attached.    In general it follows the lines laid down by the Cabinet but there are two points towhich I invite the attention of my colleagues:-(a) Defects of present system the lead into Part III (paragraph 10) uses some of thematerial in paragraph 10 and the first sentence ofparagraph 11 of the draft circulated with C.(65) 59, whichthe Cabinet asked should be omitted.    I think that thecomplete omission of this material would weaken thedraft and make it less positive.    In particular it wouldmean omitting the point that there is no practicablemethod of remedying the defects of the present system bystrengthening public supervision with the industry in private ownership.(b) exports the Cabinet asked me either to elaborate in detail the ways in which nationalisation would help to increaseexports of iron and steel or to give less prominence tothis subject.    Paragraph 13(c) is an amended and strengthened version of the passage on exports.    Toinclude only a passing reference to exports would, Ithink, be too scant a treatment of this important subject and hardly consistent with the fact that the Bill willimpose on the National Steel Corporation a specific duty to promote exports.3.      I ask my colleagues to approve the revised draft of the white paper.COPY NO.Ministry of Power, 3. W, 1.23rd April, 1965

Steel NationalisationDraft White paper&apos;      Introduci^ion the Government announced through the Queen&apos;s Speech on 3rd November j, I96U that they would initiate early action to re-establish the necessary public ownership and control of the ironand steel industry,  in accordance with Election pledges.    TheFirst Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs said in the Debate on the Address on hth November:-&quot;We have considered the contribution which the steelindustry will have to make towards economic growth,and we are satisfied that this can &quot;best be achieved byre-establishing public ownership and control .. . ..  .Our intention is to take into public ownership themain part of the iron and steel industry.&quot; (official report, Col.  227).The First Secretary of State went on to make it clear that withinthe framework of this broad policy,  the Government would welcomeconstructive discussions with interested organisations.2.      This White Paper describes the Governments legislative proposals to give effect to the policy already announced.    Duringthe preparation of their proposals,  the Government have had discussions with interested parties,  including the Iron and steel board,  the Trade Unions,  the British Employers&apos; Confederation,the Federation of British Industries,  the National Association ofBritish Manufacturers, the British Iron and Steel Federation,eight other representative organisations( l) of the industry and anumber of individual companies.II.    background the Iron and Steel industry.      The iron and steel industry includes three main groups of operations apart from the working of iron ore.    These are themaking of iron,  the making of crude steel and the shaping of crudesteel into semi-finished and finished steel products.    these operations are carried on in some 300 works.    Twenty-two of theseare integrated works which carry out all three operations and formthe core of the industry.    Another 38 works make crude steel andshape it;    9 works are concerned only with iron-making;    92 works are &quot;re-rolling&quot; plants which shape semi-finished steel;    and about 150 works are specialist units which often straddle theborderline between the steel and engineering industries.    these works are owned by about 260 limited liability companies, nearly all of which are members of the constituent bodies of the british iron and Steel Federation.    The Federation performs the normalfunctions of a trade association.    It also provides importantcentral services for the industry,  including,  through the british iron and Steel Corporation Ltd. and its subsidiaries, the import of iron ore and certain other raw materials./The(l)    British Federation of Iron and Steel Stockholders; BritishShipbreakers&apos; Association;    British Steel Founders&apos; Association;Joint Iron Council;    National Council of Associated Iron OreProducers;    National Federation of Iron and Steel Merchants;National Federation of Scrap Iron, Steel and Metal Merchants;Steel Distributors&apos; Association.SECRET\

- 2 -The Role of the Industry in the Economyk.      The iron and. steel industry occupies a focal and dominatingposition in the British economy.    First,  it is one of our largestindustries.    Its sales in 196k (over  1,000 million) were greaterthan those of the coal industry.    At the end of 136k it employedover 315,000 people - more than the electricity supply industry.Its capital expenditure on major schemes (including the stripmill expansion programme) over the five years i960 to 196k averaged 130 million a year or 11 per cent of all investment in manufacturing industry.    Second,  the iron and steel industryprovides basic materials for British industry.    Key industriesthat are eminent growth points in our economy, depend significantlyon steel:    among these are the engineering industries, which account for about two-fifths of total output of manufacturing industries.    Third, the iron and steel industry is of crucial importance to the export drive.    In 196k, manufactured goodscontaining steel accounted for almost half our total exports:    anda further five per cent of the total consisted of exports of ironand steel as such.Public Supervision of the Industry 5.      It has been accepted for more than thirty years that the characteristics of the iron and steel industry and its importanceto the national economy require a special measure of publicsupervision.    Prom 1932 until 1939 this public supervision wasexercised by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, whichencouraged the establishment of the British Iron and steel federation in 193k and which from 1936, by a voluntary arrangement with the Federation, supervised the prices fixed by theFederation&apos;s constituent bodies.    On the outbreak of war in 1939,direct control of the industry was assumed by the Ministry ofSupply which itself fixed maximum prices under statutory powers.The Ministry of Supply continued to fix maximum prices after thewar;    but from September,  19k6 until March, 19*4-9, more general supervision over the industry,  including supervision ofproduction, distribution, raw materials supplies and modernisationschemes, was exercised under the Minister of Supply by a. non-statutory Iron and Steel Board, which also advised on prices.6.      The latter were, however,  interim arrangements, superseded the action of the Government of 19*4-5/1951.    That government decided that the iron and steel industry had such characteristicsand involved such a concentration of economic power that it ought not to be left in private hands.    They considered too that theexistence of a large number of separately-owned undertakings,  the boards of which were responsible to their own shareholders, made it &quot;difficult for the industry to achieve the necessary freedomof movement in reorganisation and to change the physicalcharacteristics of many of its undertakings&quot;.(2)    Moreover,  the raising of the very large sums of capital which would be needed for the industry&apos;s expansion programme would be faciliated ifthey could be raised under Treasury guarantee.    The Iron andSteel Act, 19*4-9,  therefore provided for the vesting in the Iron(2)    The Lord President of the Council,  the Rt. Hon. herbert morrison, M.P.

SECRET- 3 -and Steel Corporation of Great Britain of the shares andsecurities of all &quot;but the smallest iron and steel companies.Vesting took place on 15th February,,  3.951.7.      Despite a lack of co-operation from the British Iron andSteel Federation a start was made in the preparation of plans forthe reorganisation of the industry when the General Election ofOctober,  1951 resulted in the return of a new Government pledged to denationalise the industry.    On 13th November, 1951,  theMinister of Supply(3) gave the Corporation a general directionthat they should not make any alteration in the financial structureor management of any publicly-owned companies without the consentof the Minister.    This was followed by the Iron and Steel Act,  1953which provided for the transfer of the iron and steel undertakings and other property of the Corporation to the Iron and Steel holdings and Realisation Agency, which was given the duty of returning themto private ownership.    By 1961 the return of the iron and steelindustry to private ownership had been largely completed exceptfor Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd., which is still owned by the agency.8.      The Iron and Steel Act,  1953 also established the present arrangements for the supervision of the industry by an Iron andSteel Board appointed by the Minister of Power.    The Board arerequired &quot;to exercise a general supervision over the iron andsteel industry ...... with a view to promoting the efficient,economic and adequate supply under competitive conditions of ironand steel products&quot;.    In particular,  they have to keep underreview production capacity, prices and the arrangements forprocuring and distributing raw materials and fuel, for research,for the promotion of the safety, health and welfare of employees and for  Joint consultation on matters of mutual interest to employers and employees other than terms and conditions ofemployment.    Their most important power Is to determine maximum prices for iron and steel products.    The Board have used this power to set what they regard as reasonable delivered prices,which until recently the steel makers agreed that they would generally charge to their customers.    The Board also have power,subject to appeal to the Minister,  to control substantial projects for the provision of additional facilities for the production of iron and steel in Great Britain.    They have reserve powers (a)  toarrange for the import or distribution of raw materials or theimport of steel products and (b)  to make grants and loans for research relating to the iron and steel industry and for thetraining and education of persons employed in that industry.9.      The Minister&apos;s powers under the Iron and Steel Act,  1953are limited.    He can require the Board to determine a maximum price or to vary a determination;    he has a reserve power toprovide or arrange the provision of production facilities whichare required for the efficient, economic and adequate supjply of iron and steel products and which the industry is unable or unwilling to provide;    he can acquire production facilities whichit is proposed to close or lie can arrange with other persons tokeep them in use;    and he can direct the Board to exercise their power to arrange the import of steel products.    The only one ofthese powers which the Minister has in practice used is thepower to arrange for the provision of production facilities,  andthis only to make loans to Colvilles Ltd. and Richard Thomas and baldwins Ltd. for the  provision of additional strip mill capacity./III.(3)    The Rt. Hon. Duncan Sandys,  MoP.SECRET\

- k -III- Defects of the Present System10.    The Government do not believe that the system of private ownership in the main part of the steel industry,  combined withthe present form of public supervision,    or indeed any workablevariation of such supervision, can be reconciled with the national interest and with the proper functioning of private enterpriseitself.    There are three reasons for this.    First, the steelindustry has a dynamic and positive role to play in sustaining asatisfactory rate of general economic development and the balanceddistribution of such development between regions.    The powers ofthe Iron and Steel Board are, however,  essentially negative.They can, within limits, prevent action which is contrary to thepublic interest:    they cannot insist on positive developments which are in the interest of the nation but which, for commercialreasons,  individual companies may be unwilling to undertake.Conflict between the requirements of private enterprise, with its responsibilities to its shareholders,   and the requirements of thepublic interest, has arisen in the past and is,  in the nature ofthings,  likely to recur in the future so long as the industry Isin private hands.    Thus,  there were differences of view about the timing and location of the provision in recent years of the newstrip mill capacity in South Wales and Scotland;    and a. settlementof these problems was achieved only with Government interventionand the injection of public funds on a large scale.    Whileadequate capacity has now been created to cover requirements forsome years ahead, new decisions will have to be taken in thatperiod.    It is,  in the Governments view, wrong to allow a situation to persist in which effective plans to meet these vitalneeds should continue to be dependent on the initiative of private interests;    and in which state control over the industry results in the granting of substantial and perhaps exclusive, privilegesto particular private concerns,11.    Secondly,  difficulties have arisen over the financing of expansion programmes.    Over the past tenyto fifteen years public money totalling over  kOO million in aggregate has been provided to the steel companies.    With the growth in the size and complexity of units,  the cost of major projects in the steelindustry is high and increasing.    A single new large integratedworks may cost over  150 million - substantially more than thecost of a nuclear power station.    There are difficulties in raising private funds for projects of this sort, which take manyyears to complete and which, when completed, have to go through along commissioning period before they can earn a return on capitalsufficient to attract private enterprise.    These difficulties are increased when,  as happened in the case of the strip millexpansion programme, the national interest requires provision ofadditional capacity to be made on a. larger scale and ratherearlier than could be justified on a strict commercial view.The Government think that if the industry continues in private ownership, the need for further public assistance is likely torecur over the years or,  alternatively,  that -prices will tendto be fixed at an unnecessarily high level,  in order to providethe necessary finance.12.    Thirdly, despite the provision in the Iron and Steel Act,  1953,requiring the Iron and Steel Board to promote the efficient,economic and adequate supply under competitive conditions of ironand steel products, the system was operated in such a way thatthere has been very little competition on price between british steel companies selling in this country.    This tendency towardsarrangements of a monopoly type is not confined to this country;the capital-intensive nature of the industry and the effectsupon it of cyclical fluctuations in demand, are well known./The

- 5 -The industry in the United Kingdom entered into arrangements toensure that members generally observed as actual selling prices the maximum prices fixed by the Iron and Steel Board under theIron and Steel Act,  1953,  and sought to defend this as justifiablebefore the Restrictive Practices Court.    One of these arrangementswas the subject of an enquiry by the Court which,  in its judgment on 22nd June, 196k,  found that it &quot;must be declared contrary tothe public interest&quot;.    Since then,  that agreement and others ofthe same type in the industry have been abandoned, but it doesnot follow that effective and widespread price competition will emerge.    Because of the size of its units and the nature of itsmarket,  the steel industry here,  as in other countries,  is likelyto tend towards common pricing through price leadership.    In theGovernment&apos;s view,  these monopoly characteristics in this basicindustry point to the need for public ownership under -which price policy would be determined and prices fixed with regard only tothe public interest.&apos;    The Government &apos;s ProposalsObjectives of the New Arrangements13.    The Governments proposals are designed not merely to remedy the manifest weaknesses inherent in the arrangements introduced in 1953 but also to secure further advantages as follows:-(a) Investment and CapacityThe present negative control by the Iron and steel board over projects initiated by the individual companies will be replaced by central planning of investment   programmes  under which new projects will be initiated in accordance with a national programmedesigned to ensure that adequate new capacity isprovided and that major new units of plant are located in accordance with the national interest.    Under sucha programme,  it will be possible to strike the.righteconomic balance between continuing to use obsolescentplant and incurring capital expenditure to replace it,and to ensure that&apos;effect is given to the conclusionsof such analysis.(b) Production and MarkejbingCentral planning of production and marketing overthe main part of the industry will make it possible to concentrate production in the most advantageous fashionin the national interest and to eliminate uneconomicpractices such as unnecessary crosshauls.    The develop-ment of new management techniques,  including thecentral use of computers, makes it possible to planproduction and marketing centrally in some detail;full advantage can only be taken of these techniquesby using them to secure the best pattern of productionand marketing for the main part of the industry as awhole and not merely for the individual companies.This will improve the industry&apos;s service to consumersgenerally.(c) ExportsExpansion of exports of iron and steel as suchbecomes &quot;increasingly difficult as more countriesdevelop their own steel industries.

In the Governments view, national-Isation of the main part of the iron and steel industry is thejonly appropriate means of securing quickly the benefits of commonownership.    Nationalisation will also provide new opportunities for increasing co-operation between management and the tradeunions so as to improve the use of manpower and increase productivity, and to resolve in a fair manner the human problems to which structural and technological changes will inevitablygive rise.The Scope and Method of Nationalisation16.    The Government are satisfied that the essential objectivesiff nationalisation can be secured without bringing into public ownership all the 260 limited liability companies in theisindustry.    The industry is dominated by a small number of veryILarge groups,  each of which produced more than h-75,000 tons of crude steel in the twelve months July,  1963 to June,  196b-.    Oneof these groups, Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd., is alreadypublicly owned.    The Government think that the right course ismo take over these groups in their entirety as going concernsExcept certain very large mixed groups whose main interests areBlearly outside iron and steel.

The Government are satisfied that the essential objectives of nationalisation can be secured without bringing into public ownership all the 260 limited liability companies in theindustry.    The industry is dominated by a small number of verylarge groups, each of which produced more than h.75,000 tons of crude steel in the twelve months July,  1963 to June,  196h.    Oneof these groups, Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd., is alreadypublicly owned.

- 7 -17-    Nationalisation will be effected by the vesting in aNational Steel Corporation of all the shares and securities(k)of the following fourteen companies, which alone comply with the criteria in the preceding paragraph:-Colvilles Ltd.Consett Iron Co. Ltd.Dorman, Long &amp; Co. Ltd.English Steel Corporation Ltd.G.K.N.  Steel Co. Ltd.John Summers &amp; Sons Ltd.The Lancashire Steel Corporation Ltd.The Park Gate Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd.Round Oak Steel Works Ltd.South Durham Steel &amp; Iron Co. Ltd.The Steel Company of Wales Ltd,Stewarts and Lloyds Ltd.The United Steel Companies Ltd..18.    These fourteen companies own or control the 22 integratedworks(5) and h.2 other iron and steel works.    They employ on theiriron and steel activities, about 220,000 men and women - about70 per cent of the total manpower of the iron and steel industry.They account for over 90 per cent of the production of iron ore,pig iron, crude carbon steel, heavy steel products,  sheet and tinplate.    They occupy a strong position in the production of mostof the other main steel products.    They control about 60 per cent of known reserves of iron ore in the United Kingdom(6).19.    Pour of the fourteen companies are subsidiaries of holdingcompanies of large mixed groups.    They are the English steel corporation Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Vickers Ltd.;    G.K.N.Steel Co. Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Guest, Keen &amp; NettlefoldsLtd.;    and the Park Gate Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.  and Round OakSteel Works Ltd., which are subsidiaries of Tube Investments Ltd.The Government have given much thought to whether the national interest would best be served by retaining vertical integrationbetween these companies and their parent groups or &quot;by securinghorizontal integration between them and the main part of the steelindustry.    They have decided that the balance of advantage lies/with(k)    Excluding (a) securities forming part of the loan capital of a company which can be redeemed at par at less than oneyear&apos;s notice and (b) securities created by a company ascollateral security for a loan to that company.    The latter will be cancelled as from the vesting day.(5)    The figures in this paragraph include the subsidiaries ofthe lk manor companies and companies in which the lk majorcompanies collectively have a majority interest.    One of the22 integrated works is owned by the Skinningrove Iron Co.Ltd. which is itself owned by Iron and Steel InvestmentsLtd. - a consortium 90 per cent of the shares of which are held by nine of the companies which will be nationalised.(6)    One per cent of known reserves is controlled by independentiron ore producers.    The remainder is outside the controlof the iron ore and iron and steel industries.

skch.r:8with the nationalisation of&quot; the companies in these groups,specified in paragraph 17.    These four steel companies had an output of 3**4- million tons of crude steel in the twelve monthsJuly, 1963 to June,  196k and have a potential output ofh.U million tons in 1965.    Their exclusion from nationalisationwould seriously prejudice the possibility of national planning of production and marketing and would make it more difficult to rationalise the structure of the industry.    The Government will,however, expect the National Steel Corporation to conduct their affairs with due regard to the existing close links between the steel-producing units and other units of Vickers, Guest, Keen andNettlefolds and Tube Investments;    and these concerns,  like other consumers of steel,   can expect to benefit from the improvements in efficiency which should result from common owner-ship of the main part of the industry.20.    Two of the fourteen companies - Dorman, Long &amp; Co. Ltd. andthe Lancashire Steel Corporation Ltd. - are holding companies forgroups which have important interests outside the iron and steelfield, particularly in structural engineering, bridge building andwire manufacture.    The position of these groups is, however,different from that of the Vickers, Guest, Keen and Nettlefoldsand Tube Investments groups because their main interests are clearly in iron and steel activities;    and they should,  therefore,be nationalised as a whole.Vesting Day 21.   Vesting day will be the day after thirty-six weeks have passed from Royal Assent to the nationalisation measure,  or an earlier day fixed by order of the Minister of Power.CompensationSafeguarding proyisions23.    The nationalisation measure will contain provisions to guard against the dissipation of the property and assets of the companies to be nationalised and their subsidiary companies in the perioduntil vesting day.    Annex C contains a summary of these provisions which will apply in some cases to transactions entered into after/date of publication of White Paper/ and in others to transactions-entered into after Uth November,  196k - the date of the announce-ment by the First Secretary of State that the Government intendedto take.into public ownership the main part of the iron and steel-industry.2k.    The day to day operations of the industry and the implementation of its programmes of capital expenditure have beencontinuing normally.    This is clearly required in the national interest and in the interest of the industry itself.    Althoughthe safeguarding provisions are necessary, they should not hamperthe normal operations of the companies.    Actions taken in good faith and in the normal course of business are unlikely to be challenged under these provisions;    and the Minister of Power is22./re ady

ready to discuss with the directors concerned any transactions ofan unusual character.Organisation of the Nationalised Industry25&apos;    The National Steel Corporation will consist of a chairman and from ten to sixteen other members appointed by the Ministerof Power.    The Corporation wi 11 initially be in the position ofa holding company in relation to the nationalised companies.However,  as sole shareholder, they will in practice be able toexercise all necessary central control over the organisation aswell as the policy of the nationalised companies.    They will heable to secure the regrouping of assets among the existing companies or the replacement of the existing companies by a completely new company structure or the setting up of a unitaryorganisation under which the underlying assets would be directlyowned by the Corporation which would wind up the companies and set up their own administrative substructure.26.    One of the main tasks of the Corporation will he to combinenecessary and desirable centralisation of the main policy decisionswith the maintenance of vitality and a sense of responsibility inthe subordinate units.    This problem is common to all largeorganisations whether in the public or private sector of the economy.    In this connection,  special attention will have to begiven to the substructure of organisation below the Corporation.The Government think it would be wrong to lay down a rigidsubstructure in legislative provisions which would be inflexiblefor the future and which would have to be framed before theCorporation have had an opportunity to offer their advice on theappropriate organisation.    The nationalisation measure will,therefore, not contain a detailed scheme of organisation for the nationalised industry;    but it will require the Corporation toundertake an immediate review&quot; of the organisation for carrying onthe activities under their ultimate control and to submit a reportto the Minister within twelve months of vesting day (or a longer period allowed by the Minister).    The Corporation will also berequired to submit further reports whenever they think itnecessary or the Minister asks them to do so.    The Minister willhave the power to give the Corporation specific directions onorganisation;    and. he will,  of course, be answerable to parliament for the use he makes of this power.Powers of thej^iationalised Industry27.- While a company structure is retained,  the powers of the nationalised companies will in general be those in their memorandaof association.    The National Steel Corporation will be empowered(a) to hold the securities which, vest in them;    (b) to carry onany activities which the nationalised companies are or have been authorised to carry on by their memoranda of association and(c) to form or acquire by agreement other companies whetherengaged in iron and steel or other activities.    The corporation will also have power,  subject to the Minister&apos;s approval, topurchase compulsorily land required for their own purposes or those of the nationalised companies.28.    The nationalised steel industry will he able to diversifyits activities when this appears commercially advantageous.Diversification is a common practice among private companies,including the steel companies,  and has advantages.    It enablesan industrial organisation to adjust its activities to keep pace with changing technologies and market conditions.    The government think that the efficiency of the national economy as a whole willbe improved by giving the nationalised industries an opportunityto diversify.- 9 -

- 10 -29-    The nationalised iron and steel industry will acquire a firmoasis of diversified experience on which to &quot;build through theacquisition of the wider interests of the Dorman Long andLancashire Steel groups and certain other companies, particularlyStewarts and Lloyds.   A major extension of its activities outsidethe iron and steel field will, however, not he solely a matter for the commercial judgment of the Corporation,,    It may raiseissues of national policy.    Both the Corporation and the nationalised companies will,  therefore, be required to obtain theconsent of the Minister of Power before acquiring interests incompanies outside the iron and steel field;    and the corporation will be required to obtain similar consent before themselvesundertaking activities outside that field.Duties of the National Steel Corporation30.    The specific duties of the Corporation will be to:-(a) Promote the efficient and economic supply of iron andsteel products in such quantities and at such price as may seem to them best calculated to meet the reasonable demands of consumers and to further thepublic interest.(b) Avoid,  and ensure that the nationalised companies avoid,undue preference or unfair discrimination betweencustomers but without prejudice to such variations inthe terms and conditions on which their iron and steel products are supplied as may arise from ordinary commercial considerations or from the public interest.(c) Promote the  safety, health and welfare of their employees and the employees of the nationalisedcompanies, and consult with appropriate organisationsabout the establishment of machinery for negotiation and joint consultation.(d) Promote the export of iron and steel products and anyother products they or the nationalised companiesproduce.(e) Promote research and development in iron and steelactivities and in any other activities which they ora nationalised company carry on.Finance31.    The Corporation will be statutorily responsible for the finances of the nationalised industry as a whole,  including theservice of debt to the Exchequer.    They will be required toensure that the industry?s revenues are not less than sufficientto meet outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account,  takingone year with another,  and to establish and maintain a general reserve.    The Minister of Power will be empowered to give theCorporation specific directions about the disposal of surplusrevenue and the establishment and management of the general reserve.    It is the Government&apos;s intention to apply to the nationalised steel industry the principles and procedures setout in the White Paper on the Financial and Economic obligations of the Nationalised Industries(7) under which financial objectives are agreed with the boards concerned./32.(7)    Cmnd. 1337SECRET\

- 11 -32.    The nationalised iron and steel industry will he required to borrow on a long-term basis from the Minister alone.    It will beempowered to borrow on a temporary basis from the Minister or,with the consent of the Minister, from other persons,  and theTreasury will be able to guarantee such borrowings by the   -Corporation.    Total outstanding borrowings,  in addition to theindustry&apos;s commencing capital debt,(8) will be limited to 300 million.    This limit should be sufficient to meet theindustry&apos;s need for borrowing to finance capital expenditurealready planned and to re-finance certain loans to the companies concerned from outside bodies,  and should also allow a margin forany further plans over a period of about five years.    However,  itwill be provided that the industry cannot borrow more than 200 million without a resolution of the House of Commons.33.    The Minister will be empowered to give the Corporationspecific directions about servicing the nationalised industry&apos;scommencing capital debt and any further sums advanced.    TheMinister will be required to send a yearly account of payments and receipts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will berequired to lay it before Parliament together with his own reporton it.3h.    The Corporation will be required to keep proper accounts and each year to submit their audited accounts and those of the nationalised companies to the Minister, who will be required to lay them before Parliament.The Role of the Mlnisj^er35.    In addition to the powers to give the Corporation specificdirections referred to in paragraphs 26, 31 and 33 above,  theMinister of Power &quot;will be able to give the Corporation directions of a general character on matters which appear to him to affectthe national interest and specific directions to discontinue orrestrict activities or dispose of production facilities,  otherthan iron and steel activities or production facilities in GreatBritain.    The Corporation will be required to obtain the Minister&apos;approval for the general lines of their programmes of capital development and research and development,  to provide any information the Minister requires and to submit an annual reportto the Minister who must lay it before Parliament.Protection of Consumers36.    The increased efficiency resulting from nationalisation ofthe main part of the industry should benefit consumers of ironand steel through prices lower than might otherwise be necessary and improvements in the quality of products and services.    the nationalisation measure will impose no restriction on imports of iron and steel.    Consumers will be free to buy from the private sector any products it can provide.    The nationalisation measure/will(8)    The commencing capital debt will be made up of an amount forthe compensation to private holders of securities in companies to be nationalised,  the value as shown in their 1963/6I4.accounts of the securities held by the Iron and Steel holding and Realisation Agency in Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd.,the amount of the Agency&apos;s outstanding loans to this company at vesting date,  and the amount of the Minister of Power&apos;sloans under Section 5 of the Iron and Steel Act, 1953 toRichard Thomas and Baldwins, Ltd. and to ColvilleE Ltd.,  all of which loans and securities will he transferred under theBill to the Corporation on vesting&apos; day.

- 12 -will provide for the establishment of a Consumers&apos; Council and consumers will be further protected by the specific duties tobe imposed on the Corporation described in paragraph 30 above.Although the nationalisation measure will not give the Ministerany specific powers on prices, he can be expected to be concerned with questions of price policy in the nationalisediron and steel industry in the same way that the responsible ministers in successive Governments have been concerned with questions of price policy in the other nationalised industries.The Private Sector of the Iron and Steel Industry;37-    Although the main part of the industry will be nationalised,the private sector will still consist of about 210 companies(9)having an annual output valued at about  200 million and employingnearly 100,000 people.    The Government regard it as important that the private sector should have a healthy and efficient life of its own and so make a full contribution to the national economy.The private sector will have a particularly important role inthose specialist finishing operations which lie on the borderlinebetween the steel and engineering industries but it will berepresented in most sections of the industry.      The government propose to abolish the controls now operated by the Iron andSteel Board.    In the interests of proper planning of the investment programmes of the industry as a whole,  the Minister will retain a reserve power to control substantial development projects by theprivate companies in the basic fields of iron and steel-makingalone.    The Minister will also be responsible for collecting and publishing statistics relating to the industry as a whole.38.    There will be a need for arrangements for appropriateconsultation and co-operation between the nationalised and private sectors.    The precise form of these arrangements will be a matter for consultation between the two sectors of the industry,  thetrade unions and the Government:    but the Government envisagethat there might be established on a non-statutory basis:-(a) An advisory committee including representatives of thetwo sectors of the industry,  the trade unions and government Departments,  to provide for the participation of the whole industry in national economic planning.(b) A joint forum between the nationalised and private sectors to discuss matters of a more commercialcharacter which are inappropriate to the advisorycommittee.(c) An advisory council on research, and developmentappointed by the Minister of Power and covering boththe nationalised and private sectors.39.    The nationalisation measure will specifically permit joint action by the nationalised and private sectors in negotiationsabout terms and conditions of service and in the fields of safety, health and welfare.    The arrangements for the supervision of training in the whole industry by the Iron and Steel industryTraining Board,  appointed by the Minister of Labour under theIndustrial Training Act,  196k, will not be disturbed./The(9)    There will also be about 90 steelfounding and 1,200 iron-founding establishments outside the nationalised part ofthe iron and steel industry.

- 13 -1 Pi 9The Iron and Steel Board and the Iron and Steel Holding and.Realisation Agency...............&quot;1+0.    When the new arrangements described in preceding paragraphshave been brought into operation,  there will be no functions forthe Iron and Steel Board and the Iron and Steel Holding andRealisation Agency to perform.    The nationalisation measure willprovide for the dissolution of the Board and the transfer of their property, rights,  liabilities and obli.gatJ.ons to the Corporation.(Provision will be made to ensure that records relating to thecompanies which remain in private ownership are not transferredto the Corporation).    The Agency will be dissolved by means of a treasury order made under the Iron and Steel Act, 1953.The British Iron and Steel Federation1+1.    The Government intend that the nationalised companies should withdraw as soon as possible and on equitable terms from theconstituent bodies of the British Iron and Steel Federation andthat the central trading services operated by the Federation shouldbe transferred to the Corporation.    The companies to be nationalisedare the predominant users of the central trading services but theCorporation would make them available on equal terms to the private companies if the latter wished.1+2.    The Government think that the main consideration in makingthe new arrangements should be to ensure in the national interest that the central trading services continue without interruptionfor the benefit of both the nationalised and private sectors.    The .arrangements,  including contractual arrangements, on which these services are based are extremely complicated and the Government&apos;present knowledge of them is necessarily somewhat incomplete.    TheGovernment,  therefore, propose that these matters should,  in thefirst instance, be left to negotiation between the Corporation andthe Federation.    They hope that the Federation will co-operate inthe national Interest in reaching a settlement which, whilesafeguarding the legitimate interests of the private sector, willcorrespond with the realities of a situation in which the centralservices will be used almost entirely by the nationalised sector of the iron and steel industry.1+3.    When the nationalised companies have left the constituentbodies of the Federation and the central services have beentransferred to the Corporation,  it will be for the iron and steel companies remaining in private ownership to decide whether toretain the Federation as their trade association or to make new arrangements.V.      conclusion +1+.   An efficient and dynamic steel industry,  fully co-ordinatedinto the Governments general economic plan,  is of paramount importance to the country.    The proposals in this White Paper are designed to enable the industry to realise its full potential inthe national interest.Ministry of Power.;22nd April, 1965.

Summary of Proposed. Compensation ProvisionsANNEX   CSummary of Proposed Safeguarding ProvisionsThe National Steel Corporation will be empowered to direct the disclaimer of any agreement or lease entered into&apos; by a. companycoming into public ownership, where the Corporation consider thatthe agreement   or lease was unnecessary for the purpose of thecompany&apos;s ousiness or was entered into by the company withunreasonable lack of prudence, regard, being had to the circum-stances at the time.     This power will be available in relationto any agreement or.lease made or varied on or after the kthNovember, 196k and before vesting date,2.      The Bill will contain provisions about the payment of interest or dividends oy the Ik companies listed in paragraph 17  of theWhite Paper-in respect of periods between / date of publication of white Paper/ and the vesting date.     Defined limits will beapplied to the rate of any dividend or interest paid by any ofthese companies injursuance of a resolution of the directorspassed after the /date of puolication of White Papery7 in respectof the last complete financial year before that date or any subsequent period before the vesting date.      If such a resolutionhas authorised the payment of any dividend or interest,  in respectof that financial year or period, at a rate exceeding the maximum rate permitted oy the Bill,  the directors of the company will bemade personally liaole to the National Steel Corporation to repay the amount of interest or dividend paid out by the company inexcess of the permitted rate.The maximum rates of interest or dividend permitted by theBill for the above purposes will be formulated as follows (regard being had in either case to any previous payment of interest orinterim dividend for the same year or period)(l)    Interest on Loan CapitalThe permitted rate is that Y/hich is the minimum necessary to prevent the company from defaulting inrespect of its ooligations.(2)    Dividends on Share CapitalDividend must be paid only out of the company&apos;s ne trevenue (as certified oy the company&apos;s auditors) for theyear or period to which the dividend relates or, inaccordance with normal practice, from the company&apos;sANNEX   B

SECRET-2-dividend equalisation account or other reserve maintained for the like purpose;  out that net revenue may,  in thecase of shares or stock carrying cumulative preferencerights, be applied towards making good the holders&apos;accumulated right to participate in the profits of previous years.      Subject to the foregoing, the maximumpermitted rates of dividend are as follows:-(i)    Ordinary Shares and StockThe rate,  calculated as an annual rate, paid(other?/ise than as a capital dividend)  in respectof the last financial year in respect of which adividend was paid before the /date of publicationof White Paper/ on the same class of securities.*(ii)    Shares or Stock with Priority for DividendThe minimum rate required to enable thecompany to pay,  in accordance with the constitutionof the company and the rights attaching to thevarious classes of securities, the permitted rate on the ordinary shares or stock (see (i) above).In the case of securities issued after the /jiate of public-ation of White Paper/ either at a price below market value or free,the Minister of Power will have power to direct that the maximumpermitted rate of interest or dividend on these securities is tobe less than that stated under heads (l) and (2) above, or that no payment of interest or dividend is to be permitted.Any payment, however described,  oy a company to its members in their capacity as members,  if made out of the net revenue ofthe company, will be treated as a payment of dividend for thepurposes of the foregoing provisions.References above to payments of interest or dividend are tobe construed as references to the gross amount in question,  thatis to say,  the amount of the interest or dividend before deduction of tax.      Any payment expressed to be made free of tax will betreated as a net amount paid after deduction of tax and will requireto be grossed up accordingly,  the limiting provisions of the Billapplying to the gross amount,3.      The Bill will contain provisions enabling the Minister of power in certain circumstances to bring into public ownership a company which does not become publicly-owned by the operation ofthe Bill itself.      The circumstances in which this power will be exercisable are that:-(l)    the company in question for the time being owns oroperates any iron or steel works which on or at anytime after the hth November, 196k were owned or operated by one of the lk companies listed in para&quot;.- 17 of the white paper or by one of their subsidiaries or(2)    the membership of the company was on the kth November,196k such that,  if it had not subsequently changed,  thecompany would have come into public ownership under theBill.*    In the case of any securities on which a final dividend has never been paid,  the rate will be such as the Minister of power may approve.

SECRET-3-In either case, the Minister will be given power to serve a notice on the company concerned, the effect of which will be tobring the company into public ownership either in addition to, orin substitution for, one or more of the fourteen companies.If a company is Drought into public ownership under this procedure,  the compensation and safeguarding provisions of the bill will apply, and be deemed always to have applied, to it in the same way as they apply to the lb companies:  in particular,  the date onwhich the securities of the company vest in pursuance of theMinister&apos;s notice will be treated as &quot;the vesting date&quot; in relationto that company for all purposes of these provisions.The corollary of the above-mentioned power is that of excluding one or more of the lb companies from coming into puoiicownership,  if since the hth November,  196h it has ceased to own oroperate any iron or steel works,  or to have any subsidiary whichdoes so.      This power also will oe conferred on the Minister andwill be exercisable by the service of a notice on the companyconcerned,,&quot;Iron or steel works&quot; in this paragraph means any works u&amp;ed forany of the iron and steel activities specified in Schedule 3 to theIron and Steel Act,  1953, and includes plant and machinery and iron ore mines and quarries.h.      If at any time after the kth November, I96U and before thedate on which it comes into public ownership, a company has enteredinto any transaction involving the assignment of a right of owner-ship or user in respect of any works, plant, machinery or otherfixed assets, a right to any invention or design, or a right toiron ore in the ground, the Corporation will be enaoled under theBill to serve a &quot;notice of acquisition&quot; on the current owner of theright concerned and compel its re-transfer to the Corporation or one of the publicly-owned companies.      Similar provisions will apply to rights transferred by subsidiaries of companies whichcome into public ownership.      Compensation in the form of Governmentstock w ill be paid in appropriate cases to the person from whomthe asset is recovered.5.      The Bill will contain provisions protecting the National steel corporation against losses due to transactions taking effect afterthe /date of puolication of White Paper/ and resulting in thedissipationof a company&apos;s assets before it comes into public owner-ship.      The transactions covered oy these provisions are; reductionof share capital by payments to memoers; prematureredemption of securities; payment to holders of securities out ofthe company&apos;s capital and assignment of the company&apos;s assets to,or for a consideration payable to, holders of the company&apos;ssecurities.     Personal liability for any loss suffered by thecompany may fall on directors who have been party to any of theabove transactions and,  in certain circumstances, on the other parties to the transactions.6.     Provision will also be made enabling the National Steel Corpor-ation to recover any losses sustained as a result of certain othertransactions entered into by companies which come into public ownership under the Bill after the /date of publication of white paper/ and resulting in dissipation of their assets.      Suchtransactions include payments, or assignments of assets, withoutconsideration or for an inadequate consideration; and unduly onerousor imprudent contracts whose disadvantageous character substantiallyoutweighs any benefit accruing therefrom to the company.     Again,

-k-personal 1 is. oil it y to repay to the Corporation the amount of any loss occurring to the company from such transactions will attach to any persons who were parties thereto, including the directors of the companyo7.      Transactions such as are mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 6 above will be excluded from the effect of the safeguarding provisionsif they have been approved by the Minister of Power (either before or after the Bill passes into law).     The Minister&apos;s approval will normally be effective for this purpose even though given subse-quently to the transaction in question.      This, however, will notapply in the case of payments of interest or dividend above themaximum permitted limits (see paragraph 2 above): for such payments,the Minister&apos;s approval must be sought in advance.8.      The Bill will also contain provisions about certain agreements for the loan of money to the lh companies listed in paragraph 17of the White Paper.     Any agreement in force at the date when theBill receives Royal Assent under which money has been lent to oneof the lh companies will be determined at the vesting date if it isa condition of the agreement that the lender has the right torequire the issue of, or subscribe for, securities of the company or&quot; the right to make appointments to the company&apos;s board.     Aperson enjoying rights under such an agreement will be entitled to compensation in respect of any loss he has sustained as a result ofthe   abrogation of his rights.      Compensation will, however, be payable only in respect of such rights if created before the hthNovember, 196h or on or after that date with the written approvalof the Minister of Power.9.      The Bill will contain provisions for arbitration, on the linesadopted by the Iron and Steel Act, 19k9,  in cases of dispute as tothe applicability of the safeguarding provisions to particular circumstances and,  in particular,  as to the personal liability of directors and other persons on account of their participation intransactions to which the safeguarding provisions are found to apply.10.      The question which companies &quot;come into public ownership&quot; forthe purposes of the safeguarding provisions will be determined by reference to a definition, to be comprised in the Bill,  of theexpression &quot;puoliciy-owned company&quot;.      This expression will not be confined to the lh companies whose securities vest in the NationalSteel Corporation oy virtue of the Bill, but will include certainsubsidiaries and associated companies.     After nationalisation, a company will be &quot;publicly owned&quot; if it is one of a group of bodiescorporate to which both of the following conditions apply:-(a) every body corporate in the group is either the NationalSteel Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation, and(b) every member of every company in the group is (by director nominee shareholding) either the Corporation or anothercompany in the group.Any company which becomes &quot;publicly owned&quot; within the meaning ofthe above definition will be treated as &quot;coming into public ownership&quot;.22nd April, 1965
