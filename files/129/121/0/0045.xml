THE LARD COhSdlSSIONDRAFT THITB paper i   The background.     For centuries the claim of landowners to develop their land unhinderedand to enjoy the exclusive right to benefit from socially created valueswhen their land is sold for development has been questioned, especially whenit is sold to the community r;hich itself has created the value realised.However, the view that, in a modern society, control over development mustbe exercised by the community is not now seriously disputed and it is increasingly being accepted that the value attached to land by the right todevelop it is a value which has substantially been created by the community,who should accordingly be entitled to benefit when that right is exercised.A growing population, increasingly making their homes in great cities, hasnot only made effective public control over land indispensable;   it has also made wholly indefensible a system which allows landowners or land speculatorsto appropriate the substantial increases in the value of urban land resultingeither from government action, whether central or local, or from the growth of social wealth and population.2.     There is no novelty in proposals to s secure for the community at least ashare in the values it has itself created.     An Act of 1427 sought to recoverincreases in the value of property attributable to public expenditure onworks for sea defence, and in the reign of Charles II there was statutoryappropriation of a part of landowners&apos; unearned enhancement or &quot;melioration&quot;assessed upon the benefits cf street widening in London.     In the latenineteenth century schemes to generalise this principle of betterment, as it came to be known, resulted in various legislative expedients.     These weregathered up and systeraatised in 1542 in the recommendation in the Report ofthe Expert Committee on Compensation and Betterment under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Uthwatt.3*    The main recommendations of the Uthwatt Committee were implemented by*the Labour Government in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, whichvested in the State all development rights in land.     Anyone wishing toThere are separate Town and Country Flanning Acts for Scotland.     ?&apos;herenecessary references to these are inserted in the text.1.

9 n q?3 U eJdevelop land had to r ecover the right to d evelop by payment of a development charge to the Central Land Board.    A capital sum of  300 million was avail-able for payments to those who e stablished claims that the value of their land had depreciated as a result of the Act.4.     The Central Land 3oard were also given powers to buy land compulsorilyfor the purpose of disposing of it for development.     The Uthwatt Committeehad considered that public acquisition, if need be by compulsion, was theonly satisfactory answer to the problem of comprehensive development and- ofsecuring betterment.     In practice doubts arose about the validity of the.precise powers given to the Central Land Board and they were not used widelyuntil they had been tested in the courts.     By the time this had been done,however, the Conservative G-overnment had, by the Town and Country Planning   .Act&apos;1953* abolished development charges. ,-5.    The 1953 Act, a stop-gap measure, was followed by the Town and country planning Jet 1954 which removed the restrictions on private sales of land so*that those sales took place at market price.      A two-price system wasthereby created;   one level of prices being paid when land having develop-ment value was sold privately with a much lower level of prices paid for compulsory purchase.     This two-price system 7jas so clearly inequitable thatthat the Government were forced to eliminate it and this they chose to do bythe Town and Country Planning Act 1959 which restored market value as thebasis, for compensation on compulsory purchase.6.     Since the removal in 1959 of the last restraints on the market in landfor development, land with planning permission for development or even withthe hope of such planning permission, whether stimulated by a development planor not, has been fetching ever-increasing prices.     High prices, have beenobtained by those who owned land whichreceived permission for development.These prices have inflated the amounts which must be paid by public authori-ties.when buying land for their essential purposes and have thus imposed aCompensation for refusal of permission to develop land, however, was limitedto the amount of any unexpended balance of development value established as existing in 194-7 for the purpose of a claim on the  300 million and this limitation still continues.     a similar limitation was imposed upon the element of development value in compensation payable on compulsory purchaseof.land.2.

3.heavy burden upon their resources.     They also limit the opportunities for owner occupation.     Moreover, since in certain circumstances, a refusal of planning permission can lead to a local authority being forced to acquire and at a price settled as though a planning permission had beengranted, the fear of the consequent cost may in some cases have led to wrong planningdecisions being taken.II ^ The ,0,b.jecjiyes^7.     In the Government&apos;s view it is wrong that planning decisions, which are public decisior.3 about land use,  should so often result in large unearnedincrements being realised by owners of land which r eceives planning permission for development.     Moreover it is also wrong that the higher prices thereby established should in turn have to be paid by public authori-ties buying land for their essential purposes.     Desirable development may be frustrated by owners withholding their land in the hope of higher prices, and high costs discourage public authorities from buying land in advance in orderto ensure its orderly development.     Therefore the two main objectives of theGovernment&apos;s policy are:(l)   to s secure that the right land is available at the right time forthe implementation of national, regional and local plans;(2)    to secure that a substantial part of the development valuecreated by the community returns to the community and that thecost of land for essential purposes is reduced.Ill   The Solution8.     The Government intend,  very shortly, to introduce a Bill designed to achieve these objectives by establishing a Land Commission which, and in line with the recommendations of the Uthwatt Committee, will have widespreadpowers to acquire land compulsorily.     The Commission will do so on a bssiswhich will give the owner the value of the land for its current use and anamount sufficient to cover any contingent losses by the owner plus a furtheramount - a part of the value arising from the prospects of development - toencourage the willing sale of land for development.     The Bill will coverScotland as well as England and Wales and will include any adaptationsnecessary because of differences in the Scottish system of land tenure and

conveyancing.     These adaptations are not expected to be long or complex.Some of the more important are mentioned later in this Paper,9.     The G-overnment recognise that it would be administratively impracticable for the Land Commission to buy all land needed for development at the start of their operations.     But,  if some land for development is being bought bythe Commission at current use value plus a part of the development valuewhile other land changes hands on an unrestricted basis, there will be a two-price system such as existed under the 1954 Act.     To avoid this difficultythe Bill will provide for a levy at a uniform rate on development value whenit is realised by transactions in land and also, to the extent that develop-ment value has not been realised in a previous transaction, when it isthe Commission and paid into the Exchequer.10.     The levy will be comprehensive;    it will apply to development valuerealised in sales of land to local and other public authorities undercompulsory purchase powers or by agreement as well as in private transactions.The Land Commission themselves, when buying land, will collect the levy bydeducting it from the price they pay, so that the net payment made to theowier will in effect be the current use value of the land plus a part of its development value.     The levy will thus equalise the basis of prices paid bythe Commission on the one hand and by local and other public authorities and private purchasers on the other.     Subject to this, the market value basis ofcompensation for compulsory purchase at present in existence will continueunchanged for the Commission as well as for other public authorities.11.     The Land Commission will comprise a chairman and not more than eightother members, appointed jointly by the Minister of Land and NaturalEesources and the Secretary of State for Scotland (&quot;the Ministers&quot;).     one member will be appointed after consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Wales.     The Commission will operate throughout Great Britain throughoffices in Scotland, Wales and the regions.Development value included in compensation paid for revocation of planning permission or for other actions depreciating the value of the land willalso be subject to levy.realised by the actual development of land.The levy will be collected byIV   The Commission

12.     Although the Commission will nave a considerable degree of independencethey will be subject to policy directions by the Ministers and they will,  ofcourse, operate entirely within the framework of the Act and the regulationsn&amp;de under the Act.     Moreover, although the Commission will exercise their functions on behalf of the Crown, they will be made subject to planning control under Parts III and IV of the Town and Country Planning Act 1962,  or,in Scotland, the corresponding provisions of the Town and Country Planning(Scotland Acts 1947 to 1963.13.     The Commission will be able to buy by agreement any land which theyhave reason to think may be needed for development.      However, despite thefact that a landowner will receive broadly as much when land is sold to theCommission as when it is sold privately and that the levy will leave enoughdevelopment value with the landowner to provide an incentive to him to offerhis land for development,  nevertheless, it is possible that some owners willbe unwilling to sell their land to the Commission even though it ought to be developed and some may also, for fear of the levy, withhold their land from private transactions.     If the Commission&apos;s object to ensure that the rightland is made available at the right time is to be achieved, therefore, theCommission must possess effective powers of compulsory purchase.14.     The Bill will therefore confer on the Commission comprehensive powersof compulsory purchase which will enable them to acquire any land on whichthere has been a planning decision that it is suitable for development.      but these powers will be made available to the Commission in their entirety onlyon a date to be fixed by Ministers and they will not do this until their proposals have been approved by theHouse of Commons.     In the initial stage of their operations the Commission&apos;s compulsory powers will be limited to theacquisition of:(a)    land which, in the opinion of the Commission,  ought to be acquired by the Commission in order to secure its early development or redevelopment;(b)land which, in the opinion of the Commission, ought to be acquired by the Commission in order to secure its development or redevelopmentas a whole;CONFIQENTBAL

(c) land required &quot;by a public authority, possessing compulsory purchasepowers, for the purpose of its functions;(d) land which is to be disposed of to housing associations or throughlocal authorities or directly on concessionary terms for privatehous ing.15.     It will be necessary, before the Commission &quot;ill be able to usepowers of compulsory purchase, for there to be a planning decision that theland is suitable for material development.       The &quot;planning decision&quot; will be defined by regulations made by the Ministers and will include, of course, anyplanning permission and also allocations or definitions of land in develop-ment plans,  the designation of land as the site for a new town and alloca-tions or definitions of land approved by resolution of the local planning authority.16.     Although the Commission will have power to buy compulsorily land needed for the functions of a public authority,  it is not intended to interfere withthe existing powers of public authorities and the Commission will use their powers in such cases only with the agreement of the authority concerned orotherwise with the consent of Ministers.17.     Until they have fully built up their organisation, the scale on whichthe Commission can undertake the acquisition of land will be limited but toensure that the orderly development of land is facilitated they can beexpected increasingly to buy substantial areas of land in advance of require-ments.     Moreover,  if landowners withhold their land and there is any risk that sufficient land to maintain the essential building programme would not reach builders, the Commission will use their compulsory purchase powers asswiftly and as widely as is necessary to bring forward the land required.* &quot;Material development&quot; will be defined by regulations by exclusions from the definition of development in section 12(2) of the Town and Country planning act 1962,  (section 10(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act1947).     Broadly material development will be development other than:(1)    development covered by the Third Schedule to the 1 962 Act,  (third schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947)(the notional right to carry out this development is included within the conception of existing use value);(2)    permitted development under the General Development Order, and(3)    development excluded from development charge under the Town   and country Planning (Exemptions from Development Charge) Regulations1950,  (the Town and Country Planning (Exemptions from development charge) (Scotland) Regulations 1950).6.

VT   Procedures for Compulsory Purchase18.     In order to simplify and to accelerate the administrative processes itis intended to amend the normal compulsory purchase procedure in two mainrespects.   First, if there are no objections to a compulsory purchase order made by the Commission the order will become effective after 28 days withoutthe need for confirmation by a minister.    If objections are duly made withinthe 28 days the compulsory purchase order will require confirmation in thenormal manner.19.     Secondly? once a compulsory purchase order is effective the commission will acquire the land by means of a vesting declaration under a procedurevery close to the expedited completion provisions in sections 74 to 76 of theTown and Country Planning Act 1962 and at present available to localauthorities in certain circumstances.    In Scotland the vesting declarationwill be registered in the Register of Sasines.    Such a vesting declarationwill give to the Commission an overriding title to land, of which they candispose, without waiting for a normal conveyance following an investigation of the vondor1 s-,-title and the settlement of price.    The determination of thecompensation for acquiring an interest in land can proceed independently ofthe vesting and the Commission will be able in most cases to pay out more quickly by accepting without full investigation the title that the owner ofthe interest claims that he holds and by relying upon their ability to suefor recovery of overpayment and to prosecute in the unlikely event of a falseclaim.   This procedure should reduce very substantially the work involved inconveyance of land.   There would be similar advantages to all public authorities if they could use this vesting procedure and, although it is outside the scope of the intended Bill, an early opportunity will be taken toprovide for this in separate legislation.20.     The Bill will also enable the Minister by Order to invoke temporarilyand if necessary for certain parts of the country only a more rapid compulsory purchase procedure in which therewill be some modification of the requirementsrelating to the service of notices and the holding of inquiries intoobjections. v- .7 -

VII   Powers to Hold and to Manage and to Dispose of Land21.     The Commission will be acquiring land in advance of need - bothundeveloped land and developed land in need of redevelopment.    They will begiven all the powers necessary to manage and to improve land while it is intheir possession including powers to carry out any necessary works.   TheCommission will, however, be subject to directions from the Ministers on theextent to which these powers are to be used and, as already mentioned, willconform to planning and also to building regulations.22.     It is the Government&apos;s intention that, subject to control by theMinisters, the Commissions policy on the disposal of the land they acquireshall be as flexible as possible.    Normally when land is made available tolocal authorities or other public bodies the freehold will be sold.    In other cases disposals will be either by sales or by leases whichever is appropriate.If the Commission grant leases for houses they will normally be very long -say 999 years - and thus and in other ways the terms will take full accountof the Government&apos;s policy for leasehold enfranchisement.23.     The Commission will have power to dispose of land subject to restrictionson future development.    In particular they will have power to dispose of landfor housing subject to restrictions which will reserve to the Commission all future development value.    The Commission will be able to repurchase such property either to enforce the restrictions or when redevelopment is necessary on payment of the value subject to the restrictions.    Such disposals will be&quot;crown hold&quot;.24-     The Commission will be able, in appropriate cases, to dispose of landfor owner-occupied houses at less than its market price.    They will normallydo so to bodies which can effectively supervise the assignment of such houses,such as housing associations, co-operative groups and local authorities whoare prepared to build houses for sale.   With the consent of the Ministers,however,&apos; the Commission themselves will have power to provide houses for disposal direct.    Insuch cases the disposal will be on a crown hold basis andin addition to restrictions on development there will be provisions for controlof assignment and recovery of the concessions.    Owner-occupiers may alsobenefit from the operations of the Commission, however, by the use of some ofthe proceeds of the Commission1s activities to finance cheaper mortgages.- 8 -

VIII   The Lovy25.     The levy will differ from development charge under the Tom and country planning Act 1%7 in two important respects.   First, the levy will not take all the development value.    Secondly, the levy will normally ho paid by theseller, leaving to be paid when the land is developed only levy on anyresidue of development value not reflected in previous transactions.   InScotland in certain circumstances where, for example, a feu duty has been increased or a sum of money has changed hands because of the granting of awaiver - part of the betterment levy may he payable by the feudal superior,26,     The levy is to take a prescribed proportion of development value whenit is realised by a transaction or payment relating to tho land or bydevelopment and is to be taken from the person who has actually realised it.Thus, to give a simple example, if an acre of agricultural land worth  300as such is sold for  3,000 with a planning permission for housing, levy would apply to the difference between the market value and the agricultural valuei,e.  2,700,   If the land is developed immediately thereafter the market value at point of development would still bo  3,000 and no more would be payable.   However, if the land was not developed for, say, three years, by which time market values had risen and tho value of tho land was then  3,500, levyat point of development would be payable on the additional  500 then realised.It may happen that the land changes hands more than once before development.For example, the agricultural land might have been sold first without a planning permission, but with some hope that one would bo granted, for  1,000.Assuming that there had boon no increase in the agricultural value of tho landthe development valuo realised in the first sale would thon have been  700,which would have been subject to levy.    The purchaser having paid  1,000, ifho, then sold for  3,000 and tho whole of the increase was development value,would have to pay levy on this increase of  2,000 which would bo thedevelopment value he realised.27.     For the purpose of the illustration above tho initial value to besubtracted has been described as agricultural value.   More precisely thoinitial value may be made up of a number of components?    the valuo of tholand for its current use whatever that is, the amount of any unrealised- 9 -

development value in 1947 established by a claim on the  300 millioncompensation sum provided for by the Planning&apos; Act of that year and an allowance for cost of improvements which have increased development valueLevy will arise only in respect of the prospect of &quot;material development&quot;which is defined in the footnote to paragraph IS above.    Current uso value is thon the value of the land on the assumption that any development which isnot material development would bo permitted.    This, in theory, is wider than&quot;existing uso value&quot; as conceived in the 1947 Planning Acts but will notdiffor appreciably in practice.28.     Levying twice on tho same development value is avoided by taking asbase value - the sum to bo subtracted from market value to find the amounton which levy is chargeable - either the current use value version of basevalue described in the paragraph above or tbo price paid in the lasttransaction in tho land whichever is greater.29.     Owners will bo able to claim as a last transaction for this purpose the prico paid if they bought the land between 1st July 1948 (the appointed day for the purposes of the 1947 Planning Acts and therefore for establishingclaims for loss of development valuo existing at that date) and tho date onwhich this Paper is presented to Parliament.    Transactions 00curring between that date and tho appointed day, when the powers of the Commission como intooperation and transactions become subject to levy, will not bo recognised forthis purpose.30.      Development value will be excluded from chargeable gains for the purposesof capital gains tax or corporation tax.   This willmcan that from the timewhen tho levy comes into operation it will be tho main instrument for dealingwith development value. The rate of levy can thus bo determined independentlyin tho light of tho requirements of land for development and tho need to recover betterment for the community.    It will bo proscribed by order at an initial rate of 40 per cent which in the Government&apos;s view is a modest rateleaving ample incentive to owners to offer their land for development.    Butit is the Government&apos;s intention to increase the rate progressively to45 per cent and then to 50 per cent at reasonably short intervals.    Thequestion of increasing the rate further will be examined as tho amount of- 10 -

acquisitions by the Commission, and thus their ability to provide land for development, is extended.31.     As a transitional arrangement no levy will arise at point of develop-mont of land hold at the date of presentation of this Paper to Parliament onwhich the owner can satisfy the Commission that he wishes to build a singlehouse for occupation by his family.   The exemption will relate to onedwelling per owner no matter how much land he may own.32.     As a further transitional measure, to avoid any risk of disruption ofthe house-building programme, no levy at point of development will be payable in respect of dwellings to bo erected by builders or estate developers on land which they owned or were under a binding contract to buy at the dateof   presentation of this Paper to Parliament, provided that the development is carried out in accordance with a planning permission existing at the dateof publication and, where land is under contract, only if the oonveyance is completed within 12 months aftor the appointed day for the commencement of operation of the Commission.33-     No levy will bo payable on the development or disposal of land heldby local authorities for their social services but it will apply to landheld by such authorities for commercial purposes which will not, however,include comprehensive development or town development.    Similarly, levywill not be payable on the development or disposal of operational land of statutory undertakers /or functional land of charities//34&quot;     The levy will apply to non-Crown interests in land which is Crown landby virtue of a Crown interest but not to the interest of the Crown.    TheDuchies of Cornwall and Lancaster will, however, bo   empowered to enter into agreements with the Commission to make payments in lieu of levy.IX   Assistance to Local Authorities35-     The Government intend that local authorities should benefit financiallyfrom the operations of the Commission.    It would, however, bo impracticableand inequitable to relate this assistance directly to the levy arising on theconveyances of the land purchased by each local authority, since the benefitcould vary between local authorities in an arbitrary fashion and consequently it will be necessary to provide a more equitable method to ensure that localauthorities benefit financially from the activities of the Commission.- 11 -

36,     A review of general and specific aspects of local government financeis at present proceeding, as a result of which grants will ho revised and,as necessary, improved.    In tho course of this review there will ho an examination of themoans by which the additional assistance made possible by the operations of tho Commission should bo given to local authorities.The question is how this should bo done.   Many local authority services aregrant-aided either through tho general grant or by specific grants such asthe highway grant and the housing subsidies.    These grants are paid towardsthe whole cost of the particular service including tho cost of the land and do not distinguish land costs as such,  except in tho case of the specificsubsidy for expensive housing sites.   While a specific grant towards thecost of land acquisition has the attraction of relating tho benefit of thoCommission&apos;s operations directly to tho cost of land it has many disadvantages.Thus the amount of grant would not relate to tho needs or to the particular circumstances of the local authority or of the service concerned and mostfinancial assistance might well bo given to those areas which on regional planning considerations should have least.37-     Without prejudice to the discussions which arc to take place it is theintention of the Government to ensure that in tho current review of localgovernment finance the gain to the Exchequer from the operations of the land commission will in one way or another bo reflected in the general arrangements under which local authorities receive financial assistance from the Government.X   Summary38.     The Government thus intends to achieve its objectives by a flexiblesystem which, combining a levy with the other operations of tho Commission,will both provide an effective and fair solution to the problem of compensation and betterment and ensure a sufficient and orderly supply of land for development.- 12 -
