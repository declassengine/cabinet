this document is the property ofher britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1965Copy No.      59CABINETSALARIES OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs on 15th December, 1964 (C.C. (65) 15th Conclusions, Minute 6),the Cabinet agreed that legislation should be introduced in June orJuly 1965 in order to increase the salaries of the higher judiciary with effect from September. There was to be no public announcement tothis effect in the immediate future, in view of its possible impact onthe incomes policy, but it was agreed that the judges and the previousLord Chancellor (Lord Dilhorne) should be informed of theGovernment^ proposal in confidence. The quantum of the increase was left for further discussion.2. The Economic Development Sub-Committee on Prices and incomes considered the amount of the increase at their meeting on12th May (E.D. (P.I.) (65) 11th Meeting). The discussion showed a fundamental difference of opinion between, the Lord Chancellor,supported by the Home Secretary and the Minister of State, Board ofTrade, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, supported by theDepartment of Economic Affairs and by the Secretary of State forScotland.3. It is convenient to consider this matter in relation to the salaries of High Court judges in England and Wales, though theproposals cover a range of judicial salaries which would move in parallel with High Court judges (see Annex). At present High court judges are paid  8,000. Their salary was raised to this level from 5,000 (where it had stood since 1832) in 1954, with the declaredintention that the new rates should stand &quot; for a generation &quot;. It isgenerally agreed that there was thus some measure of looking forward in the rates fixed in 1954, and it has been suggested by officials of the Departments concerned that the new rates were&quot;about right&quot; in 1958.C. (65) 7618th May, 1965a
Lord Chancellors proposal4. In his memorandum to the Sub-Committee (E.D. (P.I.)(65) 49) the Lord Chancellor stated that he had assumed that hiscolleagues would agree in all the circumstances that an increase inthe salaries of High Court judges of the order of 30 to 40 per centcould be manifestly justified. An increase of 40 per cent would givea High Court judge a salary of  11,200, and an increase of 30 percent a salary of  10,400: other salaries in the field would be increasedpro rata. He stressed the immense importance of maintaining theunchallengeable independence of the judiciary (which was one of thechief considerations in fixing judicial remuneration in 1832 and again in 1954), and of avoiding anything which might look like down-grading the judges&apos; status, which would alienate judicial opinion.The Lord Chancellor said that without an increase of the order he proposed he would be in increasing danger of failing to attract thebest men to the Bench. He pointed out that comparisons withmovements of other incomes at comparable levels since 1954 or 1958would justify much higher salaries than he was proposing. His 30 percent would represent a compound annual rate of increase of2\ per cent since 1954, or 3f per cent since 1958.The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal5. In his memorandum (E.D. (P.I.) (65) 50) the Chief Secretarymade clear his view that the time had come to consider judges&apos;salaries not in relation to what had been thought appropriate in thepast but in relation to the place of judges in the modern world, andin particular in relation to the salaries of senior Ministers and permanent Secretaries. He proposed that the salaries of High court judges should be increased by 12^ per cent to  9,000. He pointed outthat the considerations which led to the salaries of judges (and of senior Ministers) being fixed in 1832 at what was then the very high level of  5,000 no longer prevailed to-day. He considered that  9,000was as much as should be given to judges at a time when senior ministers are paid  8,500 and Permanent Secretaries  8,200 (theLord Chancellor reminded the Sub-Committee that the lawrence committee recommended  12,000 for senior Ministers and that itwas decided to implement only half this recommendation, for reasons which he suggested did not apply to the judges. The Chief secretary said that, given the nature of the functions and responsibilities of judges, status is a matter of much more than remuneration, and hequestioned whether the level of salaries which he proposed would fail to attract men to the bench. He reminded the Sub-Committeeof the generous pensions arrangements which applied to judges(50 per cent of salary after 15 years&apos; service). His \2\ per cent would represent a compound annual rate of increase of just over 1 per centsince 1954, or \\ per cent since 1958, though that is in a sense beside the point, since his proposal amounts to a revaluation of the judges.6. One important point of detail is the relationship of the salary of the Attorney-General and that of the Lord Chief Justice. From1954 to 1965 both were paid  10,000. The Lord Chancellor pointedout that the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal would result in the Attorney-
GeneraFs salary being increased to  13,000 (plus his parliamentary salary of  1,250), while the Lord Chief Justice would be denigratedwith a salary of  11,500. The Chief Secretary recalled that until 1954the Lord Chief Justice was paid  2,000 less than the Attorney-General,and that his proposals would revert to that relationship, though thedifference would only be  1,500.Views of other Ministers7. The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the chief secretary to the Treasury. He did not think that the salaries proposed for the Scottish judges would make it more difficult to attract mento the bench in Scotland.8. The Minister of State, Board of Trade, thought that, unlessjudges received increases of the order proposed by the LordChancellor, it might become more difficult to fill quasi-judicialappointments. He gave as an example the chairmanship of the monopolies Commission: he thought it unlikely that the Board ofTrade would be able to persuade the man they wanted to accept thepost, unless he could be offered the same salary as a High court judge and that salary was at the sort of level proposed by the LordChancellor. He pointed out that the Chairman of the National prices and Incomes Board was being paid  15,000. My own view is that one cannot compare the terms which one has to pay to attract a manout of business to an appointment of that nature with the termsappropriate for judges, with their security of tenure, attractive pensionsand recognised place in the scheme of things.recommendations. The Sub-Committee were unable to agree upon a recommendation to the Cabinet on this question. In further discussion, however, the Lord Chancellor, the Chief Secretary to theTreasury and I have agreed upon the following proposal. Werecommend the Cabinet to agree that the salaries of High court judges should be increased to  10,000 (and other salaries in the fieldpro raid) from 5th April, 1966. This would represent an increase of25 per cent, or a compound annual rate of just under 3 per cent since1958. We recommend that the dates of an announcement of these increases and of the introduction (this session) of the necessary legislation should be decided by agreement between the LordChancellor, the Lord President of the Council and myself.Conclusion10. The posts concerned, the existing salaries and the various proposals put forward are set out in the annex to this memorandum.It is agreed that the salary of the President of the Probate, Divorceand Admiralty Division should in future be the same as that for the master of the Rolls (instead of being the same as that for a HighCourt judge), because he has a larger burden of administrative duties in addition to his judicial work than High Court judges have. It isalso agreed that the legislation which will authorise whatever increase
is decided upon by the Cabinet should take power to fix the salaries of the higher judiciary by Statutory Order in future. The Cabinet is asked to approve new rates of salary of  10,000 for High court judges (and other rates as in the last column, in the table annexed) tocome into effect from 5th April, 1966, dates of announcement andintroduction of legislation to be agreed between the Lord Chancellor,the Lord President of the Council and myself.G.
