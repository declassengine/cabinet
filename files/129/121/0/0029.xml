this document is the property ofher britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1965C. (65) 79 Copy No.    5 931st May, 1965CABINETGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT POLICY FORCOMPUTERSMemorandum by the Minister of TechnologyAt their meeting on 6th May (CC. (65) 28th Conclusions,Minute 6), the Cabinet asked me to arrange for further considerationto be given, in the light of their discussion on computers forGovernment Departments, to the terms in which the Government^policy in relation to the computer industry might be publicly announced on an appropriate occasion.2. For several reasons I consider that an early opportunity should be taken to make a public announcement defining in broadterms the Governments decision to accord a measure of preference to British suppliers in the procurement of computers for Governmentuse. It is not consistent with the Government^ declared objective of promoting a flourishing British computer industry that government assistance should be given to British makers in other ways but not inthe orders which the Government places for its own needs. The soonerthis inconsistency is removed the better. Secondly, there aredisadvantages, both for Government users and for their suppliers, in allowing too much uncertainty to persist about the practice of theGovernment in its procurement of computers. The United StatesGovernment have asked for clarification on this policy in the context of discussions about procurement policy in the public sector whichare proceeding in O.E.C.D.; and this reflects the uncertainties whichAmerican-controlled computer manufacturers have evinced inapproaches to my Department and in other ways. Thirdly, the purposeof according a measure of preference to British suppliers in thepurchase of Government computers is to help them hold their ownduring the interval which must elapse before the other forms ofGovernment assistance to the industry can have effect. As a measure for the short term it should be introduced quickly. It is also important that the new criteria for Government purchases of computers should apply to all new Government projects. To take an example, this wouldsimplify the handling of the tenders for the new computer at the RoyalAircraft Establishment, Farnborough.5775
3. Government Departments will need guidance on the criteriathey should adopt in evaluating tenders for computer installations.The criteria I suggested in my earlier paper (C. (65) 66) were that aBritish machine should be ordered unless:(a) no British machine can satisfy the requirement; or(b) the project for which the computer is required would thereby be delayed by two years or more; or(c) there is a disparity of 25 per cent or more between the tenderprices for United Kingdom and foreign machines.On further consideration in the light of discussion at Cabinet Ithink that the period of two years in (b) above might be excessive asa general rule. I propose therefore that it should be reduced to12 months.4. The Cabinet decided that in announcing the criteria,whichthe Government proposes to adopt in procuring computers for theirown use it would be preferable to avoid any reference to a specificperiod as the measure of excessive delay or a stated percentage whichwould render a price disparity unacceptable. I propose, therefore,that an early announcement of the Governments policy should bemade on the lines of the statement in the Annex. This is designedto explain the decision to accord British computers a degree ofpreference in the context of the Governmenfs objective of promoting a flourishing British computer industry and to indicate that thispreference will be given unless this would involve unreasonable delayor excessive cost.5.   I invite my colleagues to agree that:(a) the margin of preference to be given to British suppliers inGovernment purchases of computers should be inaccordance with the criteria as modified in paragraph above;(b) I should announce the Governmenfs policy in this respectas soon as possible in a statement on the lines of the annex.F. C.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1,28th May, 1965.
AnnexPROCUREMENT OF COMPUTERS FOR GOVERNMENT USEDraft statement in the statement I made to the House on 1st March, 1965,I announced a series of measures which the Government were taking to assist technological advance in this country and to support our export effort by encouraging a rapid increase in the use of computersand promoting the efficiency of the British computer industry.2. In support of these objectives, the Government have reviewed the policy to be adopted in the purchase of computers fortheir own use. The Governments own needs for computers amountto about a tenth of the total demand in this country. It wouldcertainly not be appropriate for the Government to seek to confineall their orders to British suppliers. Nor is it the purpose of theGovernment to establish an undue or indefinite measure of protection for the British computer industry. On the other hand, the placing of Government orders for the products of British manufacturers canpromote their growth and vigour; and can do so with more immediate effect than other measures of support that have been announced in the field of research and development. This isparticularly true of new products for which the number of earlyorders received substantially influences the unit price that must becharged to cover development costs.3. Accordingly, the Government have decided that inevaluating the tenders received for the supply of computers toGovernment users a suitable British machine should if possible be selected unless to do so would entail unreasonable delay or excessiveextra cost.
