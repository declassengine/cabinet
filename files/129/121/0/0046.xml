THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 96 COPY NO.    599th July, 1965CABINETLAND commission memorandum by the Minister of Laud and Natural ResourcesI am circulating separately (C. (65) 95) a revised draft of theWhite Paper containing amendments made after discussion with some ofmy colleagues under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.     Thereare two issues of policy still outstanding:  the rate of betterment levy,and v/hether the permanent endowment land of charities should besubject to the levy.The Levy2.       At the meeting with my colleagues it was suggested that thereshould be a progressive rate of levy and officials were asked to consider such a proposal.    I attach at Annex A a note by officials from which itwill be seen that, while there is no difficulty, and on balance some advantage, in providing for a levy that will increase, some depe^rtmentswere doubtful of the wisdom of announcing in the &quot;White Paper the size of the increases envisaged.     Officials all-agreed that there would be serious disadvantages in prescribing the dates of increases.    My own view is that it would be desirable to state firmly the size of increasesthat we have in mind, while giving only a general indication of the timing.     Paragraph 30 of the White Paper contains the form of wordsthat I should like to use.The Permanent Endowment Land of Charities3.       Annex B sets out the position relating to charities and thearguments for and against excluding permanent endowment land fromliability to levy.    This paper was considered by the meeting of mycolleagues under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister when it wassuggested that it might be possible to distinguish between sales ofsuch land for socially valuable purposes and sales which were not forsuch purposes.    Officials were instructed to examine this suggestion and to report to me.    They have now done so.    They point out thatcharities are only accepted as such if their purposes fall within thedefinitions of charitable purposes as recognised by the decisions of thecourts or as enacted; that furthermore the Charity Commissioners(or Church Commissioners, or Department of Education and Science)exercise full control over transactions in permanent endowment land(except in the cases of some university, college and other charities).Moreover the Charity Commissioners ensure in the case of charitiesunder their jurisdiction that the proceeds are used as capital for thepurposes of the charity.    The Charity Commissioners and the-1-

Department of Education and Science have, since the Charities Act I960,full powers to revise these purposes if, e. g. , they &quot;cease to provide asuitable and effective method of using the property in the spirit of thegift&quot;.    The purposes for which the Church Commissioners can use their income cannot be varied without statutory authority.    There is noquestion, therefore, but that the proceeds of transactions in permanentendowment land would be used for proper charitable purposes.    TheCharity Commissioners add that, although their powers are ultimatelygoverned by the decision and practice of the courts and not by the directions of Ministers in enforcing charitable trusts, they have, sinceI960, been developing a system of consultation with welfare departments in order to give trustees advice on the most effective way of usingcharity property in the circumstances of today.4.       It would be impossible to distinguish among charitable purposes,solely for the purposes of levy, between those which were sociallyvaluable and those which were not, without raising the whole   questionof whether purposes which the Government regarded as not sociallyvaluable should be recognised as charitable at all.    The CharityCommissioners would regard it as premature to embark on a re-examination of the definition of charities so soon after the passing ofthe I960 Act and in any event this should not be decided as a side-effectof legislation about land.    It would raise the strongest objections, for ministers to be able, in effect, to favour some charities as againstothers.5.      I see force in these argimients and I have reluctantly come to theconclusion that it would be wrong to try to distinguish between charitiesin the way suggested and that we would be likely to run into politicalpressures and difficulties in practically every case.    The question posedin paragraph 9 of Annex B, therefore, remains for decision.F. T. W.Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, S. W. 1. ,8th July, 1965-2-ei 1 0

CONFIDENTIAL .       q-J?o 1 IAIjNEX ANOTE BY QggiCIALSAt a meeting of Ministers which the Prime Minister held on 29th June,it was suggested that, on the basis that development value would be subjected only to the levy, and not to a combination of levy and capital gains tax (on which point the position of the Chancellor of the exchequer was reserved), there would be advantage if the levy were made progressive.It was proposed that the levy should be at an initial rate of 40 per cent,and raised over a period successively to 45 per cent and 50 per cent.   Thisproposal was remitted for examination by officials.2. There would be no difficulty as a matter of machinery in raising therate of betterment levy at intervals since the Bill will provide that therate shall be fixed by regulations.3,     Beginning the levy at a rate of 40 per cent while announcing an intention to raise the rate in 5 per cent stages would provide an incentive to landowners not to withhold their land.   But there are countervailingarguments,   Landowners might well assume that the rate would not beincreased at less than annual intervals and it has to be borne in mind thatan additional 5 per cent of levy would not do much more than match theannual increase in land values.   Moreover, while the Opposition might be unlikely to criticise a levy of 40 per cent, the incentive effect of theannouncement vould be reduced if they suggested to landowners that if therewere a change of government the rate would not be increased.   Some Depart-ments would prefer, therefore, to give no indication, at least in the ;&apos;.&quot;hitePaper, of the size of the increases in the rate of levy although there couldbe advantage in leaving tho impression that while the rate would not go downit might well go up in due course.4.     Officials were all agreed, however, that it would be undesirable to specify in advance the times at which the increases would take place,   ouchan announcement might precipitate rushes of land on to the market and rushesof starts of development before the levy was raised, followed by stagnationafter the rise , followed by a further rush of starts before the levy was due to be raised again.   Again, since the reactions of the market in land to the imposition of the rate of levy cannot be forecast with any precision,it seems essential to retain some flexibility in the system so that the date for increasing the rate of levy can be determined in the light of what is actually happening to the flow of land for development.0)

5o     It vrould be desirable to avoid the implication that the rate oflevy should never rise above 50 per cent.   The Land Commission is intendedto be permanent and even when it has extended its field of operations toacquire virtually all land required for development the levy will remainbecause the Commission will bo purchasing at market value net of levy.But by then the Commission may well be in a position to take a share ofthe development -ffalue larger than 50 per cent.(2)

THE APPLICATION 0? qHQETTERfflm jC^JMLfilJP MLD B^CHAEECIESThe l^jpblemThe question at issue here is the extent to which land held by charitiesshould he exempted from betterment levy.     Charity land falls into three categories:(i)   functional land used by the charity for its functions, such as theprovision of almshouses, churches or other buildings forcharitable uses;(ii)   permanent endowment land, iBeu, land given for the purpose of thecharity to provi.de it with a perpetual income;    (such land cannotbe disposed of without the consent of the Court, the CharityCommissioners, the Secretary of State for Education or some otherresponsible authority0     It may, however, be used for functionalpurposes from time to time);(iii)   land held by a charity which can be disposed of -without restriction,20     The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 vested the development value ofland in the state and provided for a capital sum of  300 million to meetclaims for compensation.     The development of land became subject to a development charge.     The Act distinguished between functional land, whichwas exempt because it could, not be valued and consequently neither compensa-tion nor the development charge could be assessed, and investment land(categories (ii) and (iii) above) which was treated in the same way as non-charity land.     It is agreed that for the purposes of the betterment levyfunctional land should, be exempt (for similar reasons) and that land in category (iii) - non-endowment land held as an investment - should not be exempt;   but it has not been possible to reach agreement on a proposal thatpermanent endowment land should be subject to levy.The amount of land, ijavolyed3.     The value of land held, by charities is not precisely known.     It isthought that functional land (excluding sites of churches) may amount toabout  330 million, and the remaining land held by charities to about 370 million, of which about three-quarters (say  275 million) may be permanent endowment land, and of this perhaps half is potentially subject tolevy as development land,     Perhaps half of permanent endowment land is owned by the Church Commissioners and by educational charities, including some public schools and Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and the rest by a wide(3)

variety of charitable bodies which includes some large national charitiessuch as ICing Edward VII Hospital Fund and Dr. Baraardot8, but consistsmainly of large numbers of local charities of modest means which provide, forinstance, gifts in cash, ministers stipends, almshouses, homes for the blindor working men&apos;s institutes0Argomerrj^j.^ favour of^^ejcempting permanent endowment land for JLevjf4a     (a)   Permanent endowment land is land given to produce an income in perpetuity for a particular charitable purpose.     It has for centuries beenpublic policy to respect the intentions of the donor,, and not to interferewith charitable property,(b) As a result of the recommendations of the Committee on Charitiesappointed in 1950 under the chairmanship of Lord Nathan, charities have become recognised as partners with the state in the welfare service.     their resources are already devoted to the welfare of the cormnunity, and there isno point in taking part of them in the form of development value in order toapply it to community purposes.     To do so would be regarded as going backon the recognition of the partnership of the charities in the welfare state.(c) Most charities (educational charities are an exception) depend onincreases in the value of their permanent endowment land to maintain the purchasing power of their income in the face of rising costs and to providecapital for modernising and improving their properties.     The control exercised by the Charity Commission and the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceover the sale of their land ensures that the trustees get the best obtainableprice for their land and preserve the capital value of the endovmient.     In sofar as the object of the levy is to ensure that increased land values are wholly applied to public purposes and do not go to private speculators, theexisting machinery already secures this.     The income of the charitiesmaintaining institutions is in many cases fully committed, and their onlysource of capital for renewing either functional or investment buildings isthe land itself.     If part of the development value were taken from them somecharities would be unable to carry on or to do so acceptably, and the sectionsof the community which they serve would suffer, for example, the old people living in almshouses which it was not possible to bring up to modern standardsn(d) Charities are traditionally exempt from taxation, and the levy wouldbe in effect, if not in intention, a tax,     In this respect and- in the absenceof compensation it differs from the scheme under the 1947 Act.     Moreover, theposition of charities has altered since 1947 when their role in the welfarestate was still in doubt,(4)

5.     Similar arguments apply to the land held by the Church Commissioners,whose transactions in land have the sole objective under statute ofproviding income for the &quot;benefit of the Church of England, and in particular for clergy stipends and pensions.     The Free Churches and the Roman catholic church would no doubt make a similar case for the exemption of any permanentendowment land held by them,A^ument^ against the exemption^ of ^rmanent^^doOTenl^land6.     On the other hand, it is argued that -(i)   a distinction should be drawn between betterment levy and taxation.The purpose of the levy is not to raise revenue, but to deal, with the scandalof inflated land values by ensuring that increases in value resulting fromthe activity of the community do not accrue wholly to the owner0     this principle applies, and should be seen to spply, equally to charitable andother landowners j   and it is important to maintain that the betterment levyis not a tax, because if this were conceded the charities would be able to claim exemption for ordinary investment land as well as permanent endowmentland;(ii)   since the levy is not a tax it would be hard for the Government toexplain why the arrangements differed from those adopted in 194-7;(iii)   it is not intended that the levy should take all the development value, but only a moderate part of it.     The remainder should providereasonable funds both for maintaining the charities&apos; incomes and for capital projects;(iv)   whatever may be the case in respect of some charities it cannot besaid of by any means all charities that they are &quot;partners with the state&quot;;nor are all subject to control of their land transactions:    the universitiesof Oxford, Cambridge and Durham and. their respective colleges and halls arenot.7.     It has been suggested that to attempt to distinguish between functionalland and other land, as the Minister of Land and Natural Resources proposes,might give rise to anomalies, e.g., where functional land had been put toanother use, or where tho functional use was confined to part only of theland, as where the charity has its offices over shops;   or where the use isnot clearly functional, as where a charity lets houses to its own staff.If the Cabinet decide, however, that a distinction should be drawn betweenfunctional land and permanent endowment land, it should not be impossible toproduce workable definitions to cover these categories.    No distinction drawn in this field willr.be wholly free from anomalies.(5)

CONFIDENTIAL -        39 9Political factors8.     It is recognised that an attempt to charge levy on permanent end.ovm.ientland would subject the Government to strong political pressures.     many members of Parliament on both sides of the House will be under pressure from small charities in their own constituencies, and the national charities willbe able to arouse a good deal of public sympathy if they can represent thatsocially valuable work is likely to be impeded as a result of their having topay the levy.     If we do not exempt permanent endowment land we shall be involved in controversy on a relatively minor issue which could delay theBill and perhaps sharpen conflict on more important aspects of our proposals.On the other hand, political pressure will not be all one way.     Some of ourown supporters would be likely to object in principle to the exemption ofpermanent endowment land belonging, for example, to public schools.     But itwould be a new and controversial departure to distinguish between one type ofcharity and another on the ground either of the charity&apos;s purposes or of theamount of land it holds:   and we should almost certainly have to exempt all or none.Cjmclusion9.     My colleagues are asked, therefore, to decide whether or not permanentendowment land held by charities should be subject to betterment levy.(6)CONFIDENTIAL\
