this document is the property ofher britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1965C. (65) 6527th April, 1965CABINETCOMPUTERS FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTSMemorandum by the First Secretary of StateWhen the Minister of Technology^ proposals for spreading theuse of computers and computer techniques in British industry and promoting a flourishing computer industry were considered lastFebruary by the Prime Ministers Group on Technology (Misc. 24/2ndMeeting), it was thought that British computers were generallycompetitive with foreign computers. At that time the Minister of technology saw no evidence that price was a sufficiently cogentconsideration to make it necessary for him to recommend a measureof discrimination in the provision of computing facilities forGovernment use.2. The Minister of Technology has recently suggested, however,that there is evidence that the British manufacturers cannot offer thelarger machines as cheaply as their American competitors; and hehas recommended that two particular Government orders for largecomputers should be given to British contenders. In the first of thesecases a computer required by the Scottish Department tenderswere received last October and the most attractive bid has been madeby an American subsidiary, International Business Machines (UnitedKingdom) Limited (I.B.M. (U.K.)). In the second case a computerrequired by the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough theMinister of Aviation has proposed that tenders should be invitedfrom British firms only (excluding American subsidiaries here). Theseproposals were discussed in the Economic Development Committee(E.D. (65) 11th Meeting) and in the absence of agreement I undertook to arrange for the issues to be clarified by officials and the matterreferred to Cabinet. A report by officials is annexed to thismemorandum.3. In my view the arguments against awarding the Scottishcontract to International Computers and Tabulators Limited (I.C.T.),when they have been thoroughly outbid on price and performanceare overwhelming. This contract should go to I.B.M.CONFIDENTIAL5642 a*copy No.59
4. The Farnborough case is fortunately more encouraging. TheBritish machine has the edge in performance and suitability for the job. This would justify, if necessary, some margin of price differentialin evaluation of the bids from tenders. Moreover, I.C.T. must surelyrecognise the importance of this order and of making a competitivebid, provided they know they face competition. I cannot see a soundfuture for a British-owned computer industry which faces nocompetition (even from British-based foreign subsidiaries) in biddingfor Government orders. Such a policy is most likely to leave us, atthe end of the day, with an industry which can supply machines tothe British Government but to no one else. The measures we havealready taken to assist the British industry, including generousfinancial support for research and development, were approved inthe belief that the industry was currently competitive and these measures would ensure that it remained so.5. I therefore recommend that the Farnborough order shouldbe put out to open tender in the ordinary way (and, if necessary,I.C.T. should be told that their tender must be competitive). Until wehave been out to tender we cannot be sure that there will not be a fully competitive British bid, whether from I.C.T., English Electricor Elliott Automation. If, when the tenders have been evaluated,I.B.M. are found to have materially outbid the British competitionmaking every allowance for any technical superiority on the latter&apos;part, then I think our whole policy towards the British-ownedcomputer industry should be re-examined in the light of its failure to compete in these two cases.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,26th April, 1965.
COMPUTERS FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTSReport by officials the Economic Development Committee discussed on the13th April (E.D. (65) 11th Meeting Minutes, Item 4) proposals by theMinister of Technology that the two computers required by ScottishDepartments and by the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnboroughshould be bought from British manufacturers and not from foreigncompanies. In the absence of agreement the First Secretary undertook to arrange further clarification of the issues by officials of theDepartments primarily concerned.2. The question has since been considered at a meeting attended by officials of the Department of Economic Affairs, Treasury, Boardof Trade, the Scottish Office, Department of Education and science and the Ministries of Technology and Aviation. This report sets outthe issues as they arise in each of the two cases.The Scottish computer3. A large computer is to be installed in the Scottish Departmentof Agriculture and Fisheries and will serve the needs of the fourScottish Departments and certain other bodies; the work would affectlocal authorities and other users such as hospital boards. It was putout to tender to Leo, International Computers and TabulatorsLimited (I.C.T.), and International Business Machines (UnitedKingdom) Limited (I.B.M. (U.K.)). Tenders were received last october and evaluated last November. I.C.T. was the main Britishcontender, but I.B.M. (U.K.) put in the most attractive bid and theScottish Office&apos;s report on evaluation received Treasury support atthe end of December. The matter was held over while the Ministryof Technology worked out its support policy for the British computer industry.4.   Comparison of the I.C.T. and I.B.M. bids(a) Capital cost: The I.C.T. installation would cost  1,101,000:the I.B.M. installation  978,000, about 12 per centcheaper. The machines cost about the same at a littleover  400,000 each and the difference in total cost is attributable mainly to the lower programming costs forthe I.B.M. machine. This is the area in which I.B.M. aretechnically ahead and there is no question of dumpingby I.B.M., i.e., charging less for the imported machinerythan they would charge a customer in the United States.CONFIDENTIAL5642 A 2S
The I.B.M. price advantage may be even greaterthan 12 per cent because the Scottish Office have addedabout  70,000 to the I.B.M. figure for staff costs inprogramming despite an I.B.M. guarantee of freeassistance to meet the timetable if their stated rate ofproduction and efficiency of programmes is not achieved.Although the guarantee is related to inexperiencedprogrammers of the type to be recruited, the scottish office have increased the estimate to avoid any accusationof over-optimism in the use of the I.B.M. programminglanguage. The Ministry of Technology Support Unitthink that the allowance could be less., but do not seriouslydispute the addition of  70,000. It would seem, however,that if there is any room for doubt about the figureof staff costs, it should be exercised in favour of I.B.M.whose agreed figures are substantially below those ofI.C.T. and who have given a guarantee. If the  70,000were not added to the I.B.M. figure, the company&apos;s bidwould be 17  per cent lower than I.C.T.(b) Recurrent cost: The I.B.M. running costs are lower byabout  21,000 a year on a total annual cost of  400,000.(c) Capacity: Both machines could do the jobs at present inview well within their total capacity. However, the I.B.M.machine offers 1,100 hours spare capacity as againstI.C.T.&apos;s 820 hours and it is certainly likely that, when the computer is installed, more and more work will come forward for it. On this score also the advantage is withI.B.M.(d) Operation: The delivery date for the two computers wouldbe about the same, but the I.C.T. system would requiremuch more programming and the take up of work on itmight be slower by between four and nine months. Tomeet the scheduled starting date of 1st April, 1966, withthe I.C.T. installation, the Scottish Office would need toobtain the services of 25 more programmers and it isgenerally agreed that this many could not be recruited.If the scheduled starting date were not met, the savings in operations, estimated at  30,000 a month, would be deferred. Nine months&apos; delay could thus add  270,000 tothe cost of the project.(e) Foreign exchange cost: Both machines contain substantialproportions of imported components. Exact details arenot available, but on the information to hand the foreign exchange cost of the I.B.M. machine would be aroundf    50,000 higher.5. Considerations in favour of buying I.C.T. The Ministry of technology do not deny that, on technical and financial grounds, theI.B.M. machine offers advantages to the Scottish Departments.Furthermore, when the Minister of Technology&apos;s proposals for
supporting the computer industry were considered last February bythe Prime Minister^ Group on Technology (Misc. 24/2nd Meeting),it was thought that the British industry was currently sufficientlycompetitive to make it unnecessary to consider price discrimination in its favour. The Ministry of Technology argue against buying theI.B.M. machine in this case on the grounds that:(a) The machine will be installed in what in effect will be aGovernment computing centre in Scotland. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is pledged to support the British computer industry and it would give a bad impression, affectingthe confidence of the industry&apos;s customers at home andabroad, to replace the existing small I.C.T. machines bya large computer of American design;(/)) Her Majesty&apos;s Government is giving research anddevelopment assistance in order to establish a flourishingBritish computer industry. Government orders which account for about 30 per cent of the British industry&apos;smarket are one of the best ways of aiding the industryto obtain the job experience it needs to overcome its current competitive weakness in programming;(c) There is now evidence that the British industry cannot offer the larger computers as cheaply as its Americancompetitors. Its main disadvantage in reducing its costsis its limited market. Its American competitors have an enormous market and are assisted by the United StatesGovernment^ &quot; Buy American&quot; policy. government orders will give the British industry economies of scale;(d) If British equipment is not used at the start of this project,it will not be used at all for about seven years when thetransfer of the centre to a new location may provide theopportunity to start afresh. Any additional ancillaryequipment needed within the seven years would probablybe I.B.M. and at the end of the period there would be a cost bias in favour of LB M.6. Considerations in favour of buying I.B.M. The scottish office strongly favour, on user and political grounds, taking theI.B.M. machine:(a) It offers significant advantages in cost and performance. Inparticular, only it has available now the type ofprogramming language required and only it has the largecapacity backing store suited to the operation of a computer centre with many small jobs, as in this case;(b) To buy I.C.T. would necessitate deferring the scheduledstarting date and this would involve not only expense butalso political embarrassment. The starting date has been well publicised in Scotland and the Scottish Office have entered into heavy commitments with hospital and education authorities throughout Scotland on the basis ofthat date. Many have started preparatory work which inmany instances would have to be repeated. I.B.M. have\
given a written guarantee of free help to meet the timetable and could be expected to make considerable political capital out of any buy-British decision with itsresultant breaking of the timetable especially as I.B.M.have a factory in Scotland;(c) The I.B.M. machine is not all American. Some of thecomponents (about 20 per cent of the value of the machine) are made in Scotland and most of the designwork has been carried out in Britain. If it became known that a policy was being adopted of deliberatelydiscriminating against American computer subsidiaries in britain, this could arouse fears of a wider discriminationwith adverse effects on the level of new Americaninvestment in Britain. This would be particularly unfortunate in its application to Scotland and notmerely in relation to the I.B.M. and Honeywell Computerfactories there.Other Departments see further reasons for not withholding this order from I.B.M.(d) Accepting that it would not sit well with the Governmentsrecently announced policy of trying to establish a thrivingBritish computer industry if both the Scottish andFarnborough orders were to go to an American subsidiary,it does not follow that allocation of the Scottish order toI.B.M. would affect this policy. The tenders were invitedand evaluated before the policy decision was made and announced;(e) For this reason Her Majesty&apos;s Governments good faith is involved. It is a matter of good public practice that firms should not be put to the expense and trouble of tenderingonly to be barred the field. We should protest violentlyif other Governments were to do this to our firms. Ifwe are to change the rules for tendering, this should bedone (unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary)only after existing bids have been dealt with;(/) Moreover, it is not in accordance with our general commercial policy to discriminate against foreignsuppliers in this way and we stand to lose more than we could gain by encouraging other Governments toadopt protectionist policies in the field of publicprocurement;(g) A decision to reject the I.B.M. bid would be very awkwardlytimed in relation to the agreement reached by theMinister of Defence with Mr. MacNamara that, if her majesty&apos;s Government go ahead with the F111Aarrangement, the United States&apos; Defence department will waive its 50 per cent price discrimination in favourof domestic defence equipment and use its best efforts toplace contracts in this country for the United states forces on a competitive basis;
(h) If this order is given to I.C.T. when they have been beatenon price, capacity and profitability of operation, there isa danger that I.C.T. will feel so confident of being nursedby Government that they will have no incentive to put their house in order. Yet unless the I.C.T. managementare stimulated to improve their competitive performance,the Government^ policy of helping the industry to helpitself will be a fiasco.The Farnborough computer7. This is in a different position from the Scottish computer inthat tenders have not yet been invited. The computer in this case,with its building, would cost over  600,000. A suitable machine canbe provided by I.C.T. but the Ministry of Aviation believe that, ifopen tenders are invited, I.B.M. would put in the lowest quotation,perhaps by as much as 10 per cent. Although the I.C.T. 1907 computerwould be technically the best for the job, its technical superioritywould not justify overlooking a price differential of that order. TheMinistry of Aviation, supported by the Ministry of Technology, wishto restrict tenders to British computer manufacturers. They argue that the sale of a foreign computer to the Royal aircraft establishment, Farnborough, one of the largest Government researchstations in the country, will be a prize of exceptional commercialvalue and one which can be expected to receive widespread publicity.The considerations set out in paragraph 5 (a), (b) and (c) above are equally relevant here.8.   Against this must be set the following considerations:id) It is against Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ general commercial policy to encourage protection for industry bydiscriminatory devices of this kind. We have, for example,a clear obligation to the European Free Trade Associationnot to extend preference in Government purchasing toBritish manufacturers beyond that accorded by the tariff(although we have greater latitude when in balance ofpayments difficulty, as now);(b) In this case the discrimination would extend to automaticallybarring foreign subsidiaries in this country from tenderingfor Government purchases. We should take it very amissif other Governments were to take such action in relationto British subsidiaries abroad;(c) Our policy in tendering for computers for Government usehas been to consider any company which providesadequate technical and servicing facilities in this countryand by this criterion a number of foreign companiesqualify, including I.B.M., Honeywell and Burroughs. to change this would create a precedent for Governmentprocurement policy generally;id) The argument for competition in paragraph 6 ih) aboveapplies in this: case also. If the purchase of a Britishmachine is so important to the British computer industry,
particularly from the point of view of job experience,I.C.T. could reasonably be urged to make the necessaryadjustment to the price of their tender (guided by thestandard prices quoted throughout the world for I.B.M.machines) to ensure that they match the American tenderon price.Possible solutions within existing policy9. If it were decided that the Scottish computer contract should go to I.B.M. it would be highly desirable to secure, if reasonablypossible, that the Farnborough order should by some means or othergo to the British computer industry.10. Until the order has been put to tender we cannot be sure that the I.C.T. (or possibly an Elliott or English Electric) bid willnot in fact be competitive, especially having regard to the possibletechnical superiority of the I.C.T. machine for this purpose. I.C.T.might be encouraged to make a special effort in their tender price tosecure this important order. This would avoid the difficult issues ofprinciple.11. Another solution would be for the Ministry of Aviation tonegotiate directly a contract for an I.C.T. 1907 on the ground thatthis machine alone meets their specifications. The Ministry of Aviationthought that it might just be feasible to make a defensible case forruling out the I.B.M. machine in this way since it will be slightly less flexible and slightly slower than the I.C.T. 1907, but the case would not hold up under pressure from Elliott-Automation who arealso in the field for the contract. The Ministry of Aviation have beenasked to consider further the possibility of drawing their specificationsso as either, and preferably, to limit the practicable field of tenderto I.C.T. and Elliott-Automation or to justify direct negotiation ofa contract with I.C.T. on the basis of a reasonably defensibledistinction between the I.C.T. machine and the rest. It seems unlikely,however, that preference by specification can be secured withoutdiscriminating in favour of one part, but against another, of the Britishcomputer industry.Department of Economic Affairs, London, S.W.I.23rd April, 1965.
