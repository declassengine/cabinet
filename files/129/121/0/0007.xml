I DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEoTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 57 COPY NO.     5 931st March, 1965CABINETTHE TSR. 2 OR THE E-111AMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceIntroductionWhen we last discussed the aircraft programme in January weadjourned a decision on the TSR. 2 (C. C.(65) 6th Conclusions, Minute 6).Much progress has been made in the last two months:-(a) the study group set up by the First Secretary of State has indicated that no continuing major redundancy is likely ifthe TSR. 2 is cancelled, particularly if the British aircraft corporation can be persuaded to close their Weybridge ratherthan their Preston works;(b) examination by the Department of Economic Affairs and theTreasury suggests that the resources released by cancellingthe TSR.2 could be re-deployed to earn or save substantialamounts of dollars to set against the costof purchasing theF-111A;(c) more information has been obtained on the military accept-ability and costs of the two aircraft;(d) it is unlikely that we could obtain further information whichwould significantly affect the decision between the two aircraft for many months to come.2.      We now have the information on which to reach a decision.    TheTSR. 2 is costing us  1 million a week -  20 million since we assumedoffice.    I believe we should now cancel it and take an option on the F. 111A-the United States Air Force version of the TFX.Development position and military acceptability of TSR. 2 and F-111A3,       The engine and airframe development programmes of the two aircrafts have reached roughly the same stage - with the TSR. 2 after fiveyears of development compared with just over two years for the F-111A.In recent months the flying programme of the TSR. 2 has progressed very well after surmounting last year&apos;s engine problems, whereas there are currently serious engine problems in the F-111A.    The Americans have,however, turned large resources on to these problems and expect to solve them.-1-

CGiC BET384.      Equipment development has been tackled differently for the two aircrafts.    The TSR. 2 was conceived and developed from the outset as an advanced weapons system of high performance, whereas the initial mark of the F-Hl-k will be given a current equipment fit of relatively lowperformance, the intention being to upgrade this in a Mark 2 which willgive the aircraft a performance for strike/reconnaissance broadlycomparable with that of the TSR. 2.5.       The military merits of the two aircraft are finely balanced.Either aircraft would satisfy our military need, but there is a slightmilitary preference for the F-111A Mark 2.Costs6.      More cost information has beccrne available about both aircraft.In each case it is related to a purchase of 110 aircraft, the maximum needwe foresee, but not necessarily the number we shall want to buy.    For theTSR. 2 the cost details result from negotiations between the Minister of aviation and the manufacturers.    This has resulted in a target price -with a maximum penalty of  9 million to the airframe company, if it isexceeded.    For the F-111A the information is from the United states secretary for Defense, who has personally negotiated with the manufacturers,    This has resulted in a firm price offer for the F-111Awith Mark 1 avionics and an estimate for Mark 2 avionics.7.       These costs indicate that the F-111A should be at least 200 million cheaper than the TSR, 2, and perhaps as much as 280 million cheaper if our expectation of lower running costs for theF-111A proves justified.    This is on the basis of money still to be spentand allows for cancellation charges on the TSR. 2 ( 70 million) and interest payments ( 70 million) on credit facilities which the UnitedStates Government will make available for the F-111A.    In percentage terms the F-lllA&apos;s advantage is 23-34 per cent, as against a maximumdifferential of 20 per cent which Ministers considered acceptable if wewere to order the TSR. 2.8.       These calculations still include an additional British safetymargin of  250, 000 for each F-111A, which I think can be regarded as more than adequate to cover the remaining main variable in the price ofthe F-111A; i. e, the additional cost of the Mark 2 avionics fit, for whichthe United States estimate is  200, 000.9.       The F-*lIIA&apos;s cost advantage will increase if we decide, as v/ewell may, to buy less than 110 aircraft.10.      The phasing of the bill for the F-111A would be less burdensomethan that for the T3B..2, since the money would be spent later.    A verybroad index of this phasing advantage is given by the following table showing expenditure in 5-year sequences;--2-SEGRET

F-111A Mark 21965/70        1970/75 1975/78 Total  million        million   million   million561 472 50 1,083240 385 180 805(includes residualcapital and interest payments)These comparisons include not only  70 million for cancellation charges,but also  70 million for interest on credit facilities.    Repayments ofcapital and interest will be made on expenditure incurred on price levelsobtaining 7-10 years earlier.    This offers substantial economic advantages.    If we were prepared to deny ourselves these advantages and pay for the F-111A on delivery, as for the Toll. 2, the costdifferential between the two aircraft would be increased by eliminating the  70 million interest charge.11.      The need for early savings is important.    We face a formidableproblem in reducing prospective defence expenditure, particularly in thenext five years.    Cancelling the TSR.2 and replacing it with the F-111Awill save well ever  300 million in this critical period.    This saving isa vital part of any plan to achieve the reduction in defence expenditurethat we are seeking.    In my view the financial arguments for an early decision in favour of the F-1T1A are compelling.12.      The cancellation of the TSR.2 will release resources, particularlyskilled rnan-power, to the value of  750- 800 million.    About  330 million of these resources would be reiased in the next 5 years, when dollarcosts would be about  12 million.   The total dollar liability over the next13 years is some  500 million for a full buy of 110 aircraft.    This makesfull provision for purchasing spares,   oorne  70 million of the dollarcost derives from a credit arrangement,   which would be concludedprimarily on balance of payments rather than defence budget grounds, andwhich postpones the bulk of the liability until after 1970.The need13.      The purpose of a strike/reconnaissance aircraft iss-(a) in the strike role, to be able to destroy on the ground theenemy&apos;s capacity to attack our own forces, and to preventhim for reinforcing his own troops.    The knowledge thatwe have this capability acts as a powerful deterrent againstthe threat of escalation in conventional operations;(b) in the reconnaissance role, to be able to give early warning of the deployment and movement of enemy forces so thatrapid precautionary moves, on a small scale, can be ma&amp;ewhich may often prevent the need for larger scale action ata later stage.    If there should be a threat of limited v/ar,this capability is an essential element in the political controlof the situation.-3-HEGRET

14.      Unless we abandon almost all our current commitments outside europe, we shall need an aircraft of the TSR. 2/F-111A class for thestrike/reconnaissance role in the 1970s, and no alternative aircraft will suffice.    It is common prudence to plan to include some of this class of aircraft in our forces, even if economic factors should compel us inconsequence to reduce the number of other types of aircraft.   Moreover,although the F-111A is about twice as expensive as the improved Buccaneeror the Phantom, at 500 miles radius of action 11 F-111 As or 13 TSR. 2 S would be equivalent to 25 developed Buccaneers or 50 Phantoms.Numbers15.      We have already reduced the planned numbers of aircraft from158 by eliminating the provision for stationing them, in Germany.    110aircraft is now the maximum if we are to maintain our existing commit-ments outside Europe.    We might be able to reduce the number furtherby eliminating commitments or on certain other hypotheses including theuse of other British aircraft for parts of the TSR.2/F-T11A role.    Wemust not decide how many aircraft we should buy until we have completedour review of defence commitments and tasks.    The best and most economical way of preserving the freedom of action that we need is toopt for the F- 111 A which offers the following advantages over the TSR. 2;-(a) the final decision on numbers can be left open far longer;(b) there is a relatively small research and development charge for each F-111A which will not vary greatly with the numberpurchased;(c) the production price will remain relatively stable, irrespective of the number that we purchase;(d) if any aircraft are lost or damaged in operations, it shouldbe easier and quicker to replace them.Nature of the F-111A Option16.      If we are to cancel the TSR. 2, we must be able to announcesimultaneously that we have secured a satisfactory option on the F-111A.This is essential because without it we could not justify to Parliament,the country, or the Services a decision to cancel the TSR. 2 and also give an assurance that the RAF will be able to carry out its tasks.    ButMinisters will not want to commit themselves more deeply than isessential to ensure that it is available to us at a satisfactory price.The detailed discussions that I have been having with the United StatesGovernment show that we could make an arrangement which would limitour commitment to ordering by 1st January, 1966 10 F-111A Mark aircraft, with an option for up to 100 Mark 2 aircraft which need not beexercised either in part or in whole before April, 1967.    Such anarrangement would give us time to decide on the numbers needed in thelight of the defence review.    An option which gives us this flexibility intime and numbers seems likely to be on the basis of an estimated price.Provision will be made in any arrangement for fitting the Roils RoyceSpey engine (if examination shows this to be sensible), a British developedreconnaissance pod, and, where practicable, other British equipment.-4-

Reciprocal Purchase by U. S. A. from Britain17.      The Minister of Defence (RAF) has recently been to Washington todiscuss this question with the United States Secretary for Defense,Mr. McNamara.    As a result the United States Government is willing toagree on a public statement waiving the 50 per cent United Statespreference rule which at present applies against any British military equipment bought for the United States forces.    This announcement wouldbe tied to the signing of an arrangement, on the lines indicated in thepreceding paragraph covering the F-111A.    The United States Governmentwould also be willing to look at United States defence requirements and touse their best efforts to procure some defence equipment from thiscountry, provided that it meets requirements as to performance, time and cost.    These steps offer some hope of greater success than hithertoin selling British equipment to the Americans, though they will obviouslyrequire time to take effect.Re c omme ndati on s18.      I recommend that:-(a) we should decide now to cancel the TSR. 2;(b) we should conclude our negotiations v/ith the United StatesGovernment for an arrangement giving us an option to buy the F-111A at a satisfactory price on the lines suggestedin paragraph 16 above;(c) the nature of the option to buy the F-111A should be presented to Parliament on the lines of the draft at annex.D. W.H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.31st March, 1965

annex draft TERMS OF ANNOUNCEMENT ON F-111A OPTION/To be preceded by a passage dealing with cancellation of TSR. 2jIt would be impossible for our forces to forgo the aircraft atpresent planned to replace the Canberra towards the end of this decade,unless it were certain that their operational tasks could be carried outby other means.    It will not be possible to define these tasks preciselyuntil the defence review is completed later this year;  but it seems likely that the military commitments which this country can be expectedto face in the 1970s will require the R* A. F. to possess some long-rangestrike/reconnaissance aircraft.    Her Majesty*a Government has madqarrangements, therefore, with the United States Government by whichit has secured an option on the F-111A aircraft at a price which would bring a saving of  250m. compared with the TSR. 2 - on money yet tobe spent and inclusive of cancellation and interest charges - if weeventually ordered the maximum number of aircraft required to fulfilour existing operational commitments.    It may well be possible,however, to reduce this number substantially as a result of the defence review.The nature of the option is such as to require only a very smallinitial order of the F-111A to be placed at the beginning of next year,and to give us a further 12-18 months before a follow-up order has tobe placed.    This arrangement will enable us to complete our defence review before any final step is taken.    If it emerges that the need fora certain number of F-111A aircraft is then established, we shall havehad time to consider every means of keeping this number to a minimumby making the best possible use of all available British aircraft.    Weshall also have been able to explore Ihe possibility of including Britishcomponents in the F-1.11A in order to reduce dollar costs.Me ie, I am able to inform the House that the United StatesGovernment has also agreed to waive the 50 per cent preference rulewhich operates at present against purchases of British military equipment by the United States, as soon as the first small initial order for the F-lilA is placed.   In addition, the United States Governmenthas indicated its willingness to examine its own defence requirements and use its best efforts to procure some defence equipment from theUnited Kingdom, provided that requirements as to performance, time-6-

and cost are met,    This undertaking offers some hope of greatersuccess than hitherto in selling British equipment to the United StatesWe shall take all possible steps to secure United States orders forBritish equipment prior to taking up our option on the F-111A.
