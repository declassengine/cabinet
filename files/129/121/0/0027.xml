(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 7718th May, 1965RACE RELATIONS BILL - CONCILIATION MACHINERYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentClause 1 of the Race Relations Bill a.s it stands makes it a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction by a fine, to practise discrimination on grounds of coloxir, race or ethnic or national origins in any of the places of public resort described in thesection.&quot;    This provision has been attacked by the Opposition, andwidely in the press, on the grounds that it introduces criminal sanctionsinto a field more appropriate to conciliation.    There is also aconsiderable body of opinion among Government supporters and the organisations representing immigrant communities that some form of conciliation machinery should be introduced as a preliminary to any proceedings in the courts.In the debate on Second Reading on 3rd May I undertook that weshould listen closely to the arguments advanced in favour of aconciliation process and that, if we considered it practicable and in thepublic interest to do so, we should amend the Bill at Committee stage to give such effect as we felt able to the wishes of the House.    the subsequent debate served to confirm the general feeling in favour of conciliation machinery, with a preference that any proceedings thatmight follow failure of conciliation should be of a civil rather than a criminal nature.The draft amendments annexed to this memorandum provide forthe establishment of conciliation machinery and for enforcement by civil proceedings when conciliation has failed.The proposed new clause A provides for the constitution of aRace Relations Board, which will be required to appoint localconciliation committees.      It will be the duty of the committees toreceive and enquire into individual complaints of discrimination in public places within the ambit of Clause 1 of the Bill, and to attemptto secure a settlement of the differences between parties and, where appropriate, to obtain assurances against any repetition of discrimina-tory acts.    The committees will work informally and will not be armed with powers to summon witnesses.    In any case in which conciliationfails the committee will be required to make a report to the Board;and if in such a case the Board is satisfied that a course of discriminatory conduct has taken place and that such conduct is likelyto continue it will be able to take proceedings for enforcement.-1-COPY NOCABINET

Clause A has been drafted so as to leave the Board with considerable latitude in deciding the number, distribution and composition of conciliation committees.    If, as I propose, the Board is itself to beresponsible for enforcement it ought not in any case to be directly responsible for conciliation.    This means that there must beconciliation committees covering the whole country.    Whileconciliation by people familiar with the local situation will bedesirable wherever possible, it may be found best in some parts ofthe country to have a single committee serving a comparatively large area in which few cases are likely to arise.     The separation of the processes of conciliation and enforcement will also be effected by theprovision in clause 3 that any statement made during the course of conciliation shall not be admitted in court proceedings   except with theconsent of the party by whom it was made.It is apparent from the debate on the Second Reading, and fromamendments which have already been tabled, that there will be strong pressure during the Committee stage for the Bill to be extended to dealwith discrimination in such wider fields as employment and housing.It will be urged that these are the fields where the worst abuses occurand where attempts at conciliation by local committees of the kind we propose to set up would be particularly effective.    I assume however that it will still be the wish of my colleagues that this pressure shouldbe resisted.It is only after the most careful consideration and consultationwith my colleagues principally concerned that I have decided in favourof enforcement by civil rather than criminal proceedings.    An arrange-ment whereby criminal proceedings would be taken in the magistratescourts, with offences punishable by fines as in the present clause 1, has some attraction.    But conciliation and criminal proceedings are difficult to reconcile in principle and there are serious proceduraldifficulties in attempting to combine them. One of the advantages of proceeding   by civil action will be to free the police from allresponsibilities in the matter.I understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland supportsthese proposals and would like the scope of the proposed Race relations board to extend to Scotland.    It would accord better v/ith the Scottishsystem of law enforcement for proceedings in Scotland to be taken bythe Lord Advocate instead of by the Board, and the draft new clause Cprovides for this.I seek the approval of my colleagues to the tabling cf theCommittee stage of the Race Relations Bill of  amendments giving effect to these proposals.Home Office, S. W. 1.18th May, 1965 -2-CONFIDEWT1ALCourt proceedings are dealt with.in the proposed new clause B.     Proceedings will be taken in the county court or High Court,which will be empowered to grant an injunction restraining the defendant, on pain of committal for contempt of court, from any furtheracts of discrimination either against specified individuals or againstspecified classes of persons.    I would expect very few cases in practice to reach the courts.
