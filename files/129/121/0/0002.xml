THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C. (65) 52 Copy No.    5 326th March, 1965CABINETLINKS BETWEEN EFTA AND THE EECNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs attach, at Annex, a memorandum on possible links betweenthe European Free Trade Association and the European economic community.2. This is a limited paper dealing simply with those types of relationship with the Community which, short of full membership,might offer a means of removing the tariff barrier between the two groups. It does not cover the possibilities of straightforward functionalco-operation and harmonisation of policy between EFTA and the eec. In this category comes a vast range of possibilities, e.g.,industrial co-operation, joint arms production, space projects (ELDO,ESRO and Satellite Communications), decimal coinage, use of the metric system, patents, industrial and food standards, colour television systems, harmonisation of professional qualifications,customs and immigration procedures.3. The paper does not purport to be a substantive document on the whole complex of policy in respect of European integration,but illustrates the issues that arise in considering the possibility oflinks between the two organisations.M. S.Foreign Office, S.W.1,26th March, 1965.
AnnexLINKS BETWEEN EFTA AND THE EECMemorandum by the Foreign SecretaryEFTA policy. The EFTA Communique of June 1961 stated &quot;The aim of efta has been from the outset not only to create a free marketbetween its members but ultimately also to achieve the economic integration of Europe as a whole in the form of a single european market&quot;. When the United Kingdom applied for membership ofthe e.c., Denmark and Norway also applied for full membership,Austria, Sweden and Switzerland for association and Portugal foran unspecified relationship. The negotiations did not progress to apoint which made it possible to see the shape of eventual agreements.Only Austria has subsequently maintained negotiations forassociation; the indications are that the Community&apos;s price for asettlement will be virtually complete acceptance of Communitypolicy and severance from EFTA.2. This note sets out from the United Kingdom point of viewpossible links with the e.c. short of full membership, but does notdeal with individual forms of functional co-operation on matters such as patents or industrial standardisation. The section onassociation with the e.c. is directed primarily towards the implications from a British point of view; it is necessary to bear inmind that by itself, far from creating an e.c.-EFTA link, it woulddisrupt EFTA.Association with the EEC3. The basis of association. Article 238 of the Treaty of rome provides that the Community &quot; may conclude with a thirdcountry . . . agreements creating an association embodyingreciprocal rights and obligations, joint actions and appropriate formsof procedure. Such agreements shall be concluded by the Council bya unanimous decision and after consulting the Assembly&quot;.Association can mean anything from 1 per cent to 99 per cent of full membership. The minimum would be an association such asthat which we have with the Coal and Steel Community, i.e., a purely formal and consultative relationship. Apart from the Africanassociates, for whom special arrangements exist, the only countrieshaving a substantive association with the e.c. are Turkey and greece. Both have a special claim for concessions as under-developed countries and do not offer a helpful precedent for the UnitedKingdom. The Austrian negotiations may be more relevant, but asa neutral, Austria is also in a fundamentally different position fromthe United Kingdom; even so, it is doubtful whether she will secureassociation except by taking on virtually all the substantiveobligations of full membership.
4. Earlier references to Association for the United Kingdom.OnT4th January, 1963, President de Gaulle said &quot;Nothing would prevent the conclusion of an agreement of association between theCommon Market and Great Britain, so as to safeguard trade, andnothing equally would prevent the maintenance of close relationsbetween England and France, for example those of science,technology and industry, as of course the two countries have justproved in deciding to construct together the supersonic aircraftConcord &quot;. This was not regarded as a serious offer of association.Shortly afterwards, however, detailed proposals were put forward by Monsieur Spaak and were seriously considered. Formally his plan was an &quot; Interim Convention &quot; designed to lead to full membership,but in practice it is the best indication we have of what associationmight mean. It provided essentially for an industrial customs unionbetween the United Kingdom and the e.c., with some harmonisationof policy in other fields, but it rapidly became apparent that in orderto meet the Dutch and the Italians, some more substantial agriculturalprovisions would have to be included. EFTA would have been dealtwith by letting the United Kingdom apply EFTA rates of duty for two years, while separate negotiations were pursued by the efta countries. The institutional arrangement would have been an interimcommittee with the United Kingdom on one side and the community on the other. The agricultural difficulties, combined with thetariff preference in favour of the Community and against theCommonwealth which is inherent in a customs union, could have raised some of the main problems of the Brussels negotiations inrespect of the Commonwealth and British agriculture. Moreover,there was no reason to suppose that the French Government wouldhave accepted even this arrangement. It was therefore abandoned.5. Present possibilities and economic implications. Thetheoretical possibilities are:(a) An ECSC type of Association.  This would be a gesture onthe part of the United Kingdom towards the Community.It would involve no real movement by either side andwould do no more than perhaps afford a vehicle fordiscussion of a closer relationship.(b) Association in the form of an industrial customs union.This would, as with Monsieur Spaak&apos;s proposal, raise themain problems of the Brussels negotiations. The common tariff would have to be applied against the Commonwealth.We should have to undertake over a period of years to effect some harmonisation of agricultural policy with its implications for Commonwealth exports and for Britishhorticulture as well as for the balance of payments andthe internal price structure. We should have to makesimultaneous arrangements for EFTA or accept the effective break-up of the Association. We should also be pressed by the Community to accept the &quot; economic union&quot; provisions of the Treaty of Rome, e.g., free movement of workers and co-ordination of economic and
commercial policy. In fact in one way or another, weshould have most of the substantive obligations of membership. We should, however, lack an effective voice in the running of the Community, since decisions wouldbe taken by the Six and once taken we could not expect to change them in the Council of Association, even though we might be able to stand aside from them.(c) Association in the form of an industrial free trade area.This  would  give  us  the  industrial  advantages  of membership of the Community and would enable us toretain the substance of our Commonwealth and EFTAarrangements. It would need much less internal economic union content and need not raise serious institutionalproblems either for us or for other members of EFTA.It could in fact give us most of the economic advantages of full membership for the price of letting the Communityinto the British market for industrial goods. But it wouldbe objectionable to the Community because it would not offer them access to the British agricultural market, itwould enable us to obtain the advantage of cheapimports from the Commonwealth and it would not require us to accept the internal economic policies of theCommunity. It would in fact raise again many of theproblems   which   caused   the   failure   of   the   1958negotiations for a European free trade area. There is noreason to suppose that French policy has changed in itsessentials and we could not expect them to agree to anarrangement  of this  type.  Nor indeed would  theCommission or other Governments be likely to agree if anything they would demand rather tougher terms thanthose proposed by Monsieur Spaak in 1963.6. Political implications of Association. The european communities are intended to serve as the foundation for a singlepowerful group determining the internal development and externalpolicies of Western Europe. Association with that group on any basis which can be foreseen would not place us in a position toexercise a significant influence on its policy. It would be an essentiallyperipheral relationship appropriate for a country such as Austria,but it would in some respects put the United Kingdom at a peculiardisadvantage since we should sacrifice such independence as we haveand should subordinate ourselves effectively to the policiesformulated by the Six.7. Arrangements other than Association. It is possible toconceive of a relationship between the e.c. and EFTA on a basisother than that of association of individual EFTA countries with the eec. The theoretical possibilities are set out below, but in assessingthem it is important to bear in mind that even those members ofthe Community who would support full membership for britain would be very hesitant about any relationship which offered us the
economic advantages of the market of the Six without our accepting the same obligations as the present members.(a) The Community joining EFTA.  This would suit Britishinterests well. Apart from the problem in terms of theCommunity&apos;s prestige, it would however raise in an acute form the Community&apos;s objections to an industrialfree trade area (see paragraph 5 (c) above).(b) An   intergovernmental  negotiation   with   the  object  of removing tariffs on industrial goods throughout Europe.This v/ould in effect be a new industrial free trade areasuperimposed upon the e.c. and EFTA. From theCommunity&apos;s point of view it also would raise the basicdifficulties set out in paragraph 5 (c). It is conceivablethough unlikely that the Community might accept somehalfway house involving a European preferential system,against the rest of the world, either across the board orin terms of specific commodities, but this would conflict with the GATT and it is questionable whether it wouldbe in the British interest to go along with it.(c) Reduction of tariffs on items principally traded withinEurope, the reductions being extended on an m.f.n. basisto other members of GATT. This is a course of actionwhich we may well pursue if the Kennedy Round breaksdown. It could be accompanied if the United Stateswished, by a parallel negotiation with them. It could beused also to supplement the results of a successfulKennedy Round. It could give us trading advantage but although it would not be without political significance,it would be no more than a first step in the solution ofour European problem.8. The German proposals. In November 1964 the GermanGovernment put forward the following proposals in the context oftheir plan for European political union:(a) Harmonisation of the final stages of tariff cuts in e.c. andEFTA. The EFTA timetable ends on 1st January, 1967,whereas that of the e.c., even if fully accelerated, is not likely to end before July 1967. Harmonisation would not help EFTA.(b) Accreditation of an e.c. representative to EFTA.   Thiswould be of little practical value but if other membersof EFTA thought it a helpful gesture we could agree.(c) Further tariff cuts between the e.c. and EFTA Governmentsafter the completion of the Kennedy Round (seeparagraph 7 (c) above).(d) Negotiations during the Kennedy Round to ensure thatintra-European trade benefits from the full 50 per centcut. The eec&apos;s present exceptions list covers a numberof items of European interest and discussions are going
on to try to reduce their impact on intra-European trade.It is unlikely that the French will let-the full 50 per centcut go through. ;-        -  ,u&quot; -(e) Contact between the e.c. and EFTA on conjunctural and monetary problems. This already exists between theindividual countries in the OECD, the IMF and theGroup of Ten. -!At the EFTA Ministerial meeting in November, Ministers &quot; noticedwith interest51 the German proposals. The Germans put them to the eec Council, but there has as yet been no follow-up.9. Any trade or tariff negotiation (as distinct from anapplication under the Treaty of Rome) would normally be handledfor the e.c. by the Commission but on the EFTA side by representatives of member Governments. It might be possible, ifsuch negotiations led to a closer relationship, to create some formalconsultative council. The EFTA Secretariat have already been discussing with the Commission the idea of periodic joint meetings on a strictly technical level. Monsieur Lange, the Swedish minister responsible for EFTA, has in the past aired the idea of anEEC-EFTA contact committee. It seems likely however that anything more ambitious would meet with opposition from theCommunity; and our own experience of contacts with theCommission suggests that they will be of extremely limited value solong as there is no positive will on the part of all the member governments to see Britain and the other members of EFTAexercising a real influence in the formation of common Europeanpolicies.10.   Conclusion(a) Association with the e.c. under the Treaty of Rome wouldprobably require acceptance of most of the obligations of full membership without a corresponding degree ofcontrol. We should appear as second-class citizens andthe effect could even be to frustrate rather than promote the achievement of the type of European policies we want.(b) Short of formal association, there might theoretically be a closer relationship between the Community and EFTA.Complete removal of the tariff barrier would, however,raise the problems of the 1958 negotiations for a free trade area and it is scarcely conceivable that these could now be overcome on a basis which would be beneficial to British interests.(c) The value of and scope for any lesser European tariff negotiations would depend very much upon the outcome of the Kennedy Round. -
