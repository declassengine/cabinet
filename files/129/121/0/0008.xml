S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)53COPY NO, _CABINETTHE NEED FOR AN OPTION ON THE F-111AMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence&apos; I believe that there are grave political and military dangers incancelling the TSR. 2 unless, at the same time, we secure an option onthe F-111A.    Without such an option, once we have cancelled the TSR. we shall be entirely in the hands of the Americans as to the terms, price and politico-military conditions under which we might subsequently buy the F-111A, if this proves necessary.The Nature of the Option2.       Our objective must be to secure from the United StatesGovernment an option to purchase the F-111A which binds them to supplyit to us at the best possible price, while leaving us free as to whether we take the option up, and the numbers we purchase if so.    This freedomis required until we have completed the defence review.3.       This has been our objective in the negotiations with the UnitedStates which are still in progress.    Since I circulated C.(65) 57, newinformation has become available.    The United States Government hasmade a far more attractive price offer for the F-111A.    This wouldmake the first ten aircraft available at  2. 125 million and later Mark IIaircraft at  2.32 million.    These figures include about  335, 000 peraircraft for a research and development charge which the United StatesGovernment has said it will waive in full if necessary to maintain the basic aircraft price (including any effect of wage awards) at the levelquoted.    This is as firm and as good an offer as we could hope to secure.There can be no doubt that the existence of the TSR. 2 has produced it.Once the TSR. 2 were cancelled, v/e could not rely on getting so good an offer again.    For comparison, the TSR. 2 cost estimate is  2.9 millionexcluding the research and development cost of up to  300 million.4.      If we secure the option, we would not have to place a small initialorder for training aircraft until January, 1966.    No further orderswould need to be placed until two years from now.    Thus, we shall have completed our defence review before these decisions are needed.5,       The United States Government is expected to confirm specifically to-day that the terms of the option arrangement do not commit H. M.G.to purchasing F-111A aircraft.-1-SECRETnC.(65) 581st April, 1965

conclusions.      An option in favourable terms on the F-111A is indispensableif the TSR. 2 is to be cancelled.    Today&apos;s offer coupled with the specificassurance that the arrangement would not commit us to buying anyF-111As offers us a uniquely favourable opportunity.    I recommendthat we should -(a) cancel the TSR. 2;(b) conclude an arrangement with the United StatesGovernment for an option on the F-111A;(c) make an announcement on the lines of the revised draft at Annex.D.W.H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.1st April, 1965-2-

ANNEXiiREVISED DRAFT TERMS OF announcement on F-111A OPTION[To be preceded by a passage dealing with cancellation of TSR, ZJH. M. G, have no intention of requiring our forces to foregothe aircraft at present planned to replace the Canberra towards theend of this decade without making certain they can carry out theiroperational tasks by other means.    It will not be possible to define these tasks precisely until the defence review is completedlater this year; but it seems likely that the military commitments which this country can be expected to face in the 1970s will requirethe R.A.F. to possess some long-range strike/reconnaissance aircraft.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government have made arrangements,therefore, with the United States Government by which it hassecured an option on the F-111A aircraft at a price which would bring a saving of at least  250 million compared with the TSR. 2.This is a cash saving even after taking account of cancellationcharges on the TSR. 2 and interest charges, on long-term credit facilities which the United States Government would make available for any F-111As we decided to buy.    The saving hasbeen calculated on the basis of an order for the maximum numberof aircraft required to fulfil our existing operational commitments.It may well be possible, however, to reduce this number of aircraftsubstantially as a result of the defence review.    On certainhypotheses about long-term commitments it might even bepossible to dispense with this type of aircraft altogether.The nature of the option is, therefore, such that her majesty&apos;s Government have until the beginning of next year todecide whether to take it up.    Any initial order would be a verysmall number for training purposes.    It would not be necessaryfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to place a follow-up order until april, 1967.    This arrangement will enable us to complete our defence review before deciding whether to place any orders at all,and it gives us;two years from now before we need take a finalSECRE7

decision on the total numbers we require.    If it emerges that theneed for a certain number of F-111A aircraft is established, weshall consider every means of keeping this number to a minimumby making the best use of all available British aircraft.    We shall also explore every possibility of including British components inthe F-111A in order to reduce dollar costs.Meanwhile, I am able to inform the House that the UnitedStates Government have agreed to waive the 50 per cent preferencerule which operates at present against purchase of British military equipment by the United States, if and when the first small initialorder for the F-111A is placed.    In addition, the United StatesGovernment have indicated their willingness to examine their own defence requirements and use their best efforts to procure somedefence equipment from, the United Kingdom, provided that require-ments as to performance, time and cost are met.    This undertakingoffers some hope of greater success than hitherto in selling british equipment to the United States.    We shall take all possible steps tosecure United States orders for British equipment prior to taking up our option on the F-111A.
