(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?3) 6 COPY NO    0019 January 1973CABINETIMMIGRATION RULESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. I set out below for the information of the Cabinet notes on the mainchanges I am proposing to make in the immigration rules.    They have theapproval of a small group of Ministers which has met several times underthe chairmanship of the Prime Minister.    The intention is that the newrules, which take effect on 30 January, should be published on25 January and that on that day statements should be made in Parliamentabout the main change j.    I am holding consultations with government supporters and I have it in mind to arrange more than usually detailedPress briefings on the scope and purpose of the changes.PRESENTATION2. The rules which were debated in the House of Commons on22 November were divided into rules for control on entry and rules for control after entry, each set covering both Commonwealth citizens andforeign nationals.    But the risk of fresh rules being disapproved will bereduced if we present the rules for European Economic Community (e.c.)nationals and for Commonwealth citizens in separate sets, with a view to separate votes in the House.    I am therefore now reverting to the practiceof having one set of rules for all foreign nationals, including e.c. nationalsand another set for Commonwealth citizens.    (There have been separaterules for Commonwealth citizens since 1962).    There will be advantage in this solution, which emphasises that e.c. nationals, notwithstanding the extent of their privileges, nevertheless remain foreign nationals.Further, the concessions that I propose for Commonwealth citizens are more easily presented in separate rules for them.IMMIGRATION RULES FOR FOREIGN NATIONS3. The rules for foreign nationals do not call for much comment since they largely repeat the substance of the earlier rules, including the special provisions for e.c. nationals.    I have at a few points amended the wordingto remove any other suggestion of preference for foreign nationals, andthere are a number of minor changes.1SECRET
4. Until 1 January Irish citizens were covered by the Commonwealthrules (and the Commonwealth Immigrants Act);  but now it seems right for them, as e.c. nationals, to be covered by the rules for foreign nationals.    It is only the rules for control after entry that are relevant.THE COMMONWEALTH RULESENTRY FOR employment, The main easement on the Commonwealth side is the provision that commonwealth citizens will be free to enter to take employment without awork permit provided that they have obtained an en-ry clearance in proof ofthe fact that a grandparent was born here.    (Those with a parent born hereare patrial under the Immigration Act 1971).    It is not easy to estimatenumbers, but the concession is likely to add some 8 millions to the 4 or millions who have a parent born here.    Such people would be admittedfor settlement on arrival (and so would be treated more favourably thanEEC nationals and more favourably than Commonwealth or foreign holders of work permits), but they would not be exempt from control and could be refused entry on grounds of personal undesirability, and would also be liableto deportation.6. I think that this concession will do much to meet the old commonwealth criticism of the earlier rules.    It will fivour those withrecent ancestral connections with the United Kingdom, who are the peoplemost Ukely to want to come here at will either to work or to settle.    Itmay be said that we are drawing an undesirable line between one lot cf old commonwealth citizens and another, but this is inherent in any concessionbased on ancestral connection.    It may also be said that if we are torecognise the ancestral link we should not stop at grandparents;  but to go further back would raise difficult questions of proof of birth since it wouldtake us to a time before the central registration of births was introduced,and the relevant nationality and immigration laws of recent years do not go further back than the birth of a grandparent.    As with the patrialityprovision in the Act of 1971, birth in what is now the Republic of Ireland ata time when it was in the United Kingdom will be within this concession,and so it will benefit the large number of Australians who have ancestorsborn in the Republic of Ireland.7. In explaining the change I propose to make it clear that the workingof the concession will be kept under careful review, and that it could at anytime be withdrawn, merely by amendment of the rules, if experience showed that to be desirable.HUSBANDS8. I also propose that the husbands and fiances of women resident inthis country should be admitted for settlement if they are commonwealth citizens and have a grandparent born here.    Admission will be for settlement from the outset and I propose that this should also be the case for

I think that this concession will do much to meet the old commonwealth criticism of the earlier rules.    It will favour those withrecent ancestral connections with the United Kingdom, who are the peoplemost ?likely to want to come here at will either to work or to settle.

such other Commonwealth husbands as are admitted on hardship grounds.This concession will not meet all the cases that have given rise to criticism, but it will meet many of them, and it does not seem possibleto devise a wider concession without opening the door to abuse.9. Both these concessions, based on the birth of a grandparent in theUnited Kingdom, are likely to attract criticism because they favour theOld Commonwealth: on this we can reply that they are based on recentfamily connection with the United Kingdom and not on a colour preference.WORKING HOLIDAYMAKERS10.        Many young people from the Old Commonwealth come here asworking holidaymakeis.    Initial admission is for 12 monchs, but themaximum period of stay is 3 years.    There is no particular logic about this limit, and now that under the Immigration Act 1971 residence here for years no Larger gives an automatic right to registration as a citizen of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, and so to exemption from control, we might take a more relaxed attitude and allow people to stay here for up to 5 years in this capacity.    At the end of that time they might or might not want toapply for registration, and such applications would be dealt with on their merits in the normal way.    This change in the concession may result in an increasing number of people from the New Commonwealth seeking to benefit from it and we shall have to be on our guard against this.    As the old rulehas been criticised as not giving enou . assurance at the outset the new rulewill stress that initial admission will normally be for 12 months.MISCELLANEOUS11. The above are the main changes in the Commonwealth rules, but Ihave also made some minor adjustments such as making it clear that commonwealth grandparents can be admitted in appropriate circumstances,and that in normal cases a Commonwealth visitor will readily be admittedfor longer than 6 months, and I have toned down the drafting in a number of places.12.        I have carefully considered whether the rules should do something to recognise service in the armed forces.    I would have liked to be ableto frame a concession on this footing but I have found that it is not possibleto be fair to all concerned without going much too wide.R home Office19 January 19733
