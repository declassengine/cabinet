CP(73) 15 COPY NO        U i13 February 1973CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NUCLEAR DESIGN and construction industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. Following discussion in the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy I now set out my recommendations on the reorganisation of the nuclear design and construction (d/c) industry and on the structure of then on &quot;executive Nuclear Power Advisory Board,2, The new d/c company must have the technical j managerial and commercial strength to build reactors on time and wrthin cost and be capable of playing a major part in international civil nuclear collaborationand in exports.    On my recommendation the Committee agreed thatreorganisation should be based on the private sector.    This view hasthe full support of the nuclear industry and the electricity supply authorities3C I am convinced that a single party should be in the lead; the two existing companies show the weaknesses of the consortium structure.Discussions since last summer with interested parties have confirmed that the General Electric Company (G.C) are the only existing private sector company with the necessary experience and strength to lead thenew company.    The unions and much of the industry have expressed grave concern at G.C being in control but the industrial interests have not putforward proposals which carry confidence or avoid the weaknesses ofconsortia,4, I believe we can negotiate acceptable terms with G.C to form thenew company.    In principle G.C are willing to accept the leading role;they would prefer 100 per cent or the majority of shares but would accept4C per cent so long as they have management control,5. I have considered three possible structures for the company, allgiving G.C the necessary leading role:a, G.C owning 40 per cent of the shares and managing thecompany under agreement for a fee; the Government 40 per centwith reserved rights entitling us to determine the managementagreement and other key policy matters; a grouping of other private sector interests 20 per cent with restricted rights.
b,, G.C owning i clear majority, the grouping of other private interests around 20 per cent and Government the minimum stakenecessary to give us authority on key policy issues.cc G.C owning virtually 100 per cent of the shares.G0 Annex I sets out the arguments on these alternatives.,7. Apart from the financial commitment - direct and contingent -involved in any Government shareholding- the d/?. reorganisation willnot affect public expenditure. The Government will remain for someyears the chief source of funds for reactor research and development(R and D) and for launching new systems. The Atomic Energy Authority(sea) will continue their current major role on R ana D9 though tho new company would play an important part in formulating reactor R and Dprogrammes.8, Control of strategic nuclear issues (such as United Kingdomreactor choice) will remain with Government through our statutory powers over the Generating Boards^ the sea and British Nuclear FuelsLtd.9. My discussions indicate that G.C recognise the apprehension shownin the industry and will accept that the Government should have reservedrights on tho company^ purchasing policy, which the/ agiee must be open,on international links and on the control of shares;  and that they will further accept that these rights could be attached to a relatively smallshareholding.    I also believe G.C would accept a shareholding groupingof other private sector interests so long as this did not restrictmanagement control.    These proposals inevitably mean a greaterinvolvement of G.C in high technology industry;  however, their influence in the new company will be counterbalanced by retention of government control on key issues and by the existence of the proposed Nuclear Pov/erAdvisory Board - see paragraph 12,    These counterbalances will confineGovernment intervention to those matters which are probably theGovernment&apos;s concern, &apos;    1       110.       In the light of the discussion at the Committee^ I recommendthat G.C hold a majority of the shares, that the other private interests(as a group) are offered around 20 per cent and that the Government havea minority stake sufficient to secure our reserved rights effectively,    Asingle preference share (as in the case of British Lion Holdings) might besufficient but I believe that a larger stake, of up to 20 per cent, may be needed to demonstrate our commitment to the new company&apos;s success.In negotiation I would aim at the smallest shareholding consistent withcur objectives,11.        An early decision and announcement of the Governments intentionsis very desirable.    I shall carry out the necessary negotiations rapidly.
12.       Annex II sets out my proposals for the non-executive Nuclear PowerAdvisory Board, representative of major interests, which would provideus with concerted advice on our civil nuclear strategy.    My officials are currently clearing details with the Departments concerned,13.        My recent visit to North America has impressed on me the need+0 have an up-to-date and authoritative assessment of nuclear capabilitiesand trends abroad, to assist in formulating our strategy for international collaboration.    Following our decision on nuclear reorganisation I proposethat a high-level team, which might be led by the Minister for Industry should at once visit Europe and North America for this purpose.RECOMMENDATIONS14.       I therefore Invite the Cabinet to agree thatt-aD I should now negotiate with G.C, consulting the other interests concerned, to set up a private sector based companyon the basis recommended in paragraph 10.b,, I should establish the Nuclear Power Advisory Board as outlined in paragraph 12, subject to clearance with the Departmentsconcerned.c. Subject to negotiating satisfactory terms with G.C, I shouldmake an early announcement of our decisions.d9 A high-level team should visit Europe and North America asproposed in paragraph 13.P w department of Trade and Industry12 February 1973
confidential annex 1ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES FOR THE COMPANYThere is much to support G.C owning all or the majorityof the company&apos;s share capital: ,(i)       it gives them clear management responsibility;(ii)      it commits a larger part of their resources to thefinancial consequences of error and failure;(iii)      it identifies the new company unambiguously withGEC so as to give it weight and credibility with,prospective partners and customers throughoutthe world;(iv)      it reduces Government involvement in the costlyrisks of reactor construction though not of R &amp; Dand launching new systems.     Government would haveto partake pro rata with their shareholding indelivery and performance guarantees coveringcontracts worth upwards of  100 million for the nuclear part of a power station alone.2.     On the other hand:(i)       full or majority ownership by G.C will be bitterlycriticized in political and industrial circles, aswell as by the trade unions.     A Government holdingwith power to safeguard public and competitors1interests and to determine the management agreement could be presentationally important in getting thenew company launched;(ii)      most of the companies in the existing consortia haveargued for a shareholding by them to show overseascustomers their continuing nuclear stake.     Thereis no strong industrial logic for this but itcould be important presentationally to avoidaccusations of partiality to G.C and to reduce therisk of obstruction;(iii)      under the 40:40:20 structure the management agreementwith G.C could be terminated and the G.C holdingacquired, thus restoring to Government control thecompany, which under the other alternatives would remain with G.C.
CONFIDENTIALCOLYIDSKTIALANRiSXNUCI23AR POlffiR ADVISORY BOARDIntroduction1      On the advice of an Inter-Departmental Official Committee, we decided last summer (0^(72)40th) tliat ci Nuclear Power board should be sot uu with the responsibility of providing concertedadvice to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on strategy for the use of nuclear power.   This followed fro:r. our judgement thatthe existing machinery for advice and consultation available to theDepartment of Tiv.de and Industry did not seem adequate to ensurethat Government decisions were based on full consultation with thevarious industrial interests and, in particular, that the consumerinterest of the generating boards was taken into account at all stages of the development of new nuclear systems.2      The Government&apos;s intention to set up a Board to this end was announced in the statement on the future of the nuclear industry on8 August 1972.3      The rest of this note sets out briefly my present proposals onestablishing the Board,Name4      The Board is to be a purely advisory body which is not to bebacked by legislation.    It will not have executive functions. the nuclear Power Advisory Board (NPAB) is the most suitable title for it.
CONFIDENTIALC02^iiTi;::i&apos;iALTerms of reference5      I propose for the formal terms of reference:&quot;To provide the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry withcontinuing advice on all strategic aspects of civil nuclear energy policy.&quot;(On matters of safety of civil installations, I will continueto he. advised and the KPAB will in future he advised by theChief Inspector of Nuclear Installations and the NuclearSafety Advisory Committee).Within these general terms of reference I envisage the following subjects as coming within the scope of the Board.   This is notnecessarily a firm list.   The choice of subject will depend on developments and on the Board itself:i the choice of reactor systems to be developed in the UK, takidomestic, international and overseas trade considerationsinto account jii specific programmes of development work which are believed to have commercial potential (including prototypeand design studies) and the allocation of this work, e.g. betweenthe new Company and the ASA;iii the allocation of Government funds for R and D;iv the ordering of nuclear power stations;v possible ways&apos; of developing international collaboration;vi the position of specialist component manufacturers;vii the underlying nuclear research programme;viii major system developments of longer term applicationo.g. fusion.- p -
6      The KPAB v;iil also be able &quot;to initiate its own studies and maker e c omme naations.7      I will appoint its Chairman and members, and its Secretariatwill te provided by my Department.Chairman8      The choice is between a IS?I Minister or senior official a?;d anindependent Chairman.   On balance I regard an independent Chairmanwith relevant industrial experience as preferable.   The industryseems to expect it and his position would not ho complicated, as would a DTI Chaiiman&apos;s, by the individual statutory relationships between the Department and some of the proposed members.   Ke would bein a   &quot;better position to get the members to give clear and committedviews and to produce concerted and firm (if not always unanimous)advice even though the members1 individual interests could diverge.Membership9      The membership should be representative of all the main interestsin the nuclear field.    At the same time the KPAB will perform &quot;betterif its formal membership is small.   The following outside membership is proposed:The new d/c company - (one member)The Electricity Supply industry - (one member eachfrom the Electricity Council, the CEGB and the SS2B).The sea .   - (one member)3IIFL, the fuel company - (one member)The nuclear power component industry - (one member)I am looking further to see if the representation of the electricity industry can be reduced to two.
CONFIDENTIALCOI^TiJJLVriAL3.0    As regards Government Departments&apos;; it is proposed that there shouldbe a member from my Department who would consult tho other Department!?involved and represent Die Government interest on the Board.    Clearmachinery would be established for such consultation,    I do not considerwe can have more than one voice of Government on the Board.11    Members would be expected, so far as is possible, to participatewith full commitment on behalf of the bodies they represent..Confidentiality of reports12    Since the NPAB&apos;s role will be a continuing one, unlike many externalCommittees, it will need to have a close and regular relationship withthe DTI.   The intention is not normally to publish its advice.    It maybe difficult to persuade the Select Committee on Science and Technologyto accept this but we do not believe it Would be suitable to make anygeneral promise to make public any advice, recommendations or reportsof a body whose members will be representative of the industrial interests and whose advice is to be given on a continuing basis and is bound to be based on commercially confidential information.    It would prejudice the hTPAB&apos;s work if its members did not feel protected in thisrespect.   The Select Committee, of course, would be at liberty to examinemembers if they wished.8 February 1973
