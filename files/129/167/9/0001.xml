(CONFIDENTIAL)THE NEW PARLIAMENTARY building memorandum by the Minister for Housing and ConstructionINTRODUCTORY1.      In their  th Report  (Session 197V72) of h July 1972 the SelectCommittee on House of Commons  (Services) recommended by a majority of11  to 3 that the House should adopt the winning design for the newParliamentary Building, with modifications, and that constructionshould start as soon as possible.     Hitherto, because this is primarilya House of Commons issue, the Government&apos;s attitude has been broadlyneutral.     However, the Report has not yet been debated;    and afterconsultation with the Leader of the House and the Chief Secretary tothe Treasury I consider that we should now review the proposal in thelight of recent information on its probable cost.SCOPE AND DESIGN OP THE BUILDING2.     The building would stand on a podium bounded by Parliament Street,Bridge Street, the Victoria Embankment and Derby Gate.      It wouldprovide L(. 0 single rooms for Members of Parliament and ancillary office,social, and recreational accommodation linked by an undergroundconcourse with the Palace of Viestminster and the underground car park.In January 1 9&amp;9 the House of Commons noted that the design would be thesubject of a Commonwealth architectural competition.3.     The conditions for the competition allowed a cost limit ofat January 1970 prices.      They excluded the cost of demolishingexisting buildings, reproviding public access to the WestminsterUnderground Station together with a new ticket office, and supplementaryworks such as access to the Palace of Westminster and to the undergroundcar park in New Palace Yard for pedestrians and vehicles.ij..     The first prize of  8,000 was awarded to Messrs Robin Spence andRobin Webster.     A copy of the assessors&apos; report is at Annex A.      a modified version of the winning design is on view in the Upper WaitingHall.PUBLIC REACTION$.     Although the Royal Pine Art Commission have generally favoured thewinning design serious reservations have been expressed by many experts.The Greater London Council recently expressed strong opposition inletters addressed to about 100 London Members of Parliament.COSTS6.      The only cost so far published is      .all.      Cost inflation hasincreased this to  9.2M.      The assessors stated that the sum allowed&quot;presents a tight target for a project of this nature and that a firmopinion of the feasibility of the cost estimates requires furtherinvestigation15.     My Department has just completed this.      The results are at Annex B.      Pending discussion with the architects these figurescannot be publicly disclosed but they suggest that the updated costlimit of  9.2 million, which excluded many major items, would be Iinadequate.     We are starting detailed discussions with the architectsbut the figure for the building alone is probably now of the order of.   1(confidential)
(CONFIDE NT! AL) 16M.     Much of the additional cost arises from supplementary works not included in the conditions of the competition.      The total cost of the project including supplementary works and site acquisition could be between  29M and  37M.      I believe this is now wholly unacceptable.ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES7.     The gist of the cost information (excluding that still to beagreed with the Architects) should be reported to the services committee as soon as possible.      I believe the Government should nowgive a clear lead to the Committee to reject these plans.      If, as Ibelieve they will, the Services Committee then withdraw their support for the new building we shall need to consider alternative proposals foraccommodating Members.     As an interim measure it would be possible toprovide accommodation in the existing buildings on the Bridge Streetsite for about J4.OO Members in single rooms and for more than 350secretaries if that was required.     There are a number of alternativepossibilities for the longer term:-(a) the retention of the better buildings on the site suchas Norman Shaw South, the Whitehall Club and possiblySt Stephen&apos;s Club and the gradual redevelopment of therest of the site by infilling.      This would avoid theneed to undertake large scale works for London transport and the immediate reprovision of Cannon Row PoliceStation (although I am advised that the present station is no longer regarded as adequate and will have to bereplaced as soon as possible);(b) the Services Committee has proposed that pending completionof the new building Norman Shaw North might be madeavailable to Members,      If the new Parliamentary Buildingwent ahead Norman Shaw North would almost certainly be needed for rehousing Cannon Row Police Station.      otherwise it could accommodate about 190 Members and 133 secretaries.This is, of course, fewer than could be housed on theexisting site and the first floor of the building is  minutes brisk xvalk from the Chamber;(c) additional accommodation might also be made available byinfilling within the existing Palace.      Present andforeseeable arrangements x^ithin the Palace and elsewhereare summarised in Annex C.conclusions.      [j..5M has already been spent in the acquisition of sites onBridge Street.     A further  2.1M will be required to complete theacquisition of the site as a whole.      If the remaining portions werenot acquired, the scope for any future development on the site would be severely limited.      I consider that we should retain full control of any future development on this site, and that in order to achieve this x*/we should complete acquisition of the remaining portions.9. It would nevertheless be misleading to suggest that any alternativedevelopment involving the construction of a single building on this sitewould cost substantially less than the present scheme. In the light ofthe information now available on costs I consider that I should recommend to the Services Committee that the proposal to redevelop the2(confidential)
(confidential)Bridge Street site to provide a single new Parliamentary buildings should be abandoned, and that the full range of possibilities for providing accommodation for Members on this site should be examined.RECOMMENDATIONI invite the Cabinet to agree:1.      that I should complete the acquisition of the remaining portions of the Bridge Street site;2.      that I should recommend to the Services Committee that they shouldnot proceed with the winning design for the new ParliamentaryBuilding;3.      that I should indicate to the Services Committee that, as an interim measure, accommodation could be provided for Members in existing buildings on the Bridge Street site and if necessary inNorman Shaw North;I4..      that, in consultation with the Lord President, I should preparealternative proposals for the use of the site which would satisfy the long term need for Members 1 accommodation and report theseproposals to the Cabinet.PCDepartment of the environment  Marsham Streetsvn26 January 1973(confidential)
Report of the AssessorsOut of a total of 246 entries seven projects were selected to proceedto the second stage of the competition.The assessors have completed their work and make the followingawards:First prize 230Second prize 54Third prize     1 6shared       j      and 158In addition to schemes 37,159 and 236 from Stage II, qualifying forhonoraria, we also commend schemes 212,183 and 179 from Stage l.*Number 230This is a solution of outstanding merit. It demonstrates, in the words of the author&apos;s &quot;Summary of Objectives&apos;, that it is both desirable and possible to meet the unique opportunities presented by the site andto provide conditions of a high standard for those working in thebuilding.It firmly marks the corner between Whitehall and Bridge Street.While separate in identity it is complementary to the Palace andstrengthens the definition of the Parliamentary precinct. It creates acovered square open at ground level capable of offering a variety ofamenities. It is a design that gives equal weight to social and aestheticvalues. It takes advantage of the river frontage.The assessors have been advised that, from the points of view of structural, mechanical and access systems,this project can be satis-factorily realised while maintaining the integrity of the concept.Number 54This is a solution of considerable architectural merit. It is functionallywell organised. It is direct, restrained and of high competence.The statement by tho author that The cluster of separate towersreduces the apparent scale and bulk, so as to relate the complex toits majestic parent across Bridge Street&apos;, is accepted. It does so how-ever at the cost of a firm relationship to the Parliamentary precinct as awhole.* Soo insido back coverNumber 6The organisation of the two basic floor-plan units is ingenious. the resulting form of the building, however, makes difficult its harmoniousintegration into the wider context of its surroundings.Number 158The simplicity and scale of this solution appealed to the assessors, but its development has failed to fulfil certain important functionaldemands of the programme.The assessors would like to make the following comments:a The assessors understand that it is the intention of the promoterto integrate the car park to be provided in New Palace Yard withthe project. The assessors welcome this intention as essentialto the successful development of the total Parliamentaryprecinct.b The assessors recommend that any building required for access to the new Underground Station, if sited to the north of the project, should be below ground level. The resultant open spaceshould be landscaped as a visual extension of New Palace Yard.c The assessors suggest that consideration should be given to therealignment of the Bridge Street Frontage in relation to theNoilh Side of Great George Street.d The assessors are advised that the sum of  5-4 million (as atJanuary 1970) allowed by the promoters presents a tight targetcost for a project of this nature, and that a firm opinion of the feasibility of the cost estimates requires further investigation.IRobert H.
