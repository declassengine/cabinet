MEMBEPv.S&apos; OUTSIDE FINANCIAL, INTERESTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilL Recent events, and the current consideration being given to this issue by a Labour Party Committee, have underlined the urgent need for usto decide whether or not any action ought to be taken in this field, andj if so, what the action should be,2. The issue appears clearly one where any action should be taken withthe largest possible measure of general agreement throughout the House.But before any substantive consultations take place, either within the party or with the Opposition, we must first reach our own conclusions on what we consider would be in the best long-term interests of the House.3, I think we need to set up reasonable arrangements which would not preclude or discourage che acceptance by Members of outside employment and business interests or unduly infringe their personal privacy in financial matters but would feelp in protecting Members from imputationsof irregularities or improper concealment of significant financial interests.The present position with regard to the declaration by Members of peisonalfinancial interests is outlined at Appendix I.4. The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure discussed this question on 23 November 1972 but were divided in the^r views.    some ministers considered that no change in the present arrangements was needed.    Others felt that whilst ultimately Members could not, and shouldnot, be absolved from exercising their individual judgment in thesematters, there would be advantage, particularly in the absence of clearguidance in Erskine May or elsewhere, for the House to put on modernrecord the broad standards to which it expects Members to adhere, thusgiving them the force of rule rather than relying on ill-defined custom.The draft resolutions embodying this code of conduct, which I put forward to the Committee, together with amendments which were then suggested,are at Appendix II,    They are a modification of those proposed by theSelect Committee on Members&apos; Interests (Declaration) in 1969.1CP(73) 12 COPY NO     0 712 February 1973CABINET
5. The Ministerial Committee were also divided on whether more than this was needed,  or example whether there should be a voluntary register of Members&apos; financial interests, and, if so, what range of financial interestsit should seek to cover.60 Ar the Select Committee concluded in 1969; any attempt to devise a comprehensive register of &quot;financial interests&quot; seems bound to fail.    an almost limitless variety of interests can arguably be said to fall within thisdescription - not only aU forms of paid employment (including retainers) butalso ownership of property, family interests, shareholdings, and receipt ofhospitality, as well as trade union sponsorship.    The greater the degree ofcomprehensiveness, the more unacceptable would become the invasion ofMembers&apos; reasonable privacy in financial matters, and the greater the riskof unjustified and unscrupulous political charges being based uponinformation revealed in this way,7, A possible solution to this dilemma that has been consideredwould be to set up a register of &quot;financial interests&quot; that would be &quot;openended&quot;, in the sense that it would be left to the Member to interpret for himself what he construed as a &quot;financial interest&quot;, possibly above acertain minimum amount,    It stems undeniable, however, that such a register, although nominally voluntary, would in practice becomecompulsory, certainly for Ministers;  and that the detailed publicationof private financial matters thit would be expected would De unacceptable.8. Since, therefore,, to attempt to establish any form of comprehensiveregister of Members1 financial interests, whether compulsory or nominallyvoluntary, would be undesirable as well as being impracticable, the alternatives seem to be either to drop the idea of such a register altogether,or to propose one cf limited scope.9o The latter course is not free from difficulty, since differing views are bound to be held as to the interests which should and should not be covered.    The precise scope of a limited register would require furtherconsideration.    I would propose, however, that as a basis for further discussion in the Party and with the Opposition the register should, broadly speaking, cover payments for the representation in the House of outside interests, whether in the form of retainers or sponsorship fees, or for particular services, and paid appointments (including directorships);  butnot property or shareholding interests, though controlling interests maypresent a particular difficulty.    The register should be on a voluntary basis.    I believe this will lessen the criticism of its arbitrary scope.10.        I believe however that we should try and lead the House towardsthe proposals I have outlined in this paper.    The advantages are thata, If we do not initiate action now we may be forced to doso by circumstances.b. We cannot allow the initiative to rest with the opposition parties,
c It is highly desirable to afford Members recognised meansof protecting themselves from imputations that they have irregularor concealed financial interests,da It would reassure public opinion and confirm that the house is concerned to maintain its reputation for integrity.It.        I accordingly seek the agreement of colleagues to my initiatingdiscussions within the Party? and with the Opposition, about the resolutionsat Appendix II, and about the institution of a limited and voluntary register of Members1 interests on the lines indicated in paragraph 9.J PPr4vy Council Office12 February 1973
APPENDIX present PROCEDURAL POSITION REGARDING THE DECLARATION BY MEMBERS OF PERSONALFINANCIAL INTERESTS1        The only declaration concerning personal interest which the rules ofthe House specifically require any Member to make is negative in character -a disavov/al of any &quot;personal interest^ in an opposed Private Bill.   Each memberof a committee on an opposed Private Bill is required to declare that he hasno personal interest in the Bill.2        The general obligation upon Members to declare their personal interestin the subject under debate is customary but is not a rule of procedure.It is a custom of comparatively recent origin-   Mr Speaker Morrison, in referring to this practice stated:    &quot;There is a custom whereby hon Members, in makingspeeches, if they have an interest, declare it.    I think myself that that has grown up as a matter of custom because hon Members desire to be frank withtheir fellow Members, and it is sometimes a matter of prudence, in case anhon Member should be suspected of unavowed motives&quot;.   It is not the practice for Members to declare an interest when asking a Parliamentary Question.3        As regards voting, the rule that a Member whose pecuniary interest willbe affected by the result of a division should abstain from voting is longestablished.   The basic ruling was expressed by Mr Speaker Abbott in l8ll:&quot;This interest must be a direct pecuniary interest, and separately belongingto the persons ..... and not in common with the rest of His Majesty&apos;s subjects,or on a matter of State policy&quot;.   There has only been one recorded instanceof the votes of Members on a public matter being disallowed - in 1892 on a motion for a grant in aid in connection with a projected East African Railway.V it
k        In his speech at the time when the Select Committee on Members&apos;Interests (Declaration) v/as set up in I969 the then Leader of the House(Mr Peart) stated in referring to the guidance available to Members on thissubject, &quot;The outstanding feature of Erskine May in this field is itsnarrowness, its imprecision and its extreme brevity&quot; (OR l*f May, I969, col 1558)
APPENDIX ii draft RESOLUTIONS ON MEMBERS1 FINANCIAL INTERESTSCCODE OF CONDUCT&apos;)(i)        A Member of this House should not allow himself to be influencedin the exercise of his Parliamentary duty, or in the carrying outof his responsibilities to his constituents, by any personalfinancial interest outside this House, of whatever kind,,(ii)       A Member should disclose, in participating in any business* in the &apos;. .House or in dealings with Ministers and Government Departments,any personal financial interest&apos; , of whatever kind, which he considers that the House might regard as relevant -* This would cover, for example, not only debates but PQs andcorrespondence with Departmentso    It was suggested in the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure that it wentmuch too wideo/ It was proposed in the Ministerial Committee that 1 personalfinancial interest&apos; would need to be further defined as &apos; anypecuniary interest, whether direct or indirect and present or expected, which a Member might reasonably consider that theHouse might regard as relevant1o
