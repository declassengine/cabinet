Second Report from the Select Committee on theParliamentary Commissioner for AdministrationSession 1971-72Observations by the GovernmentIn their Second Report of the 1971-1972 Session, published on 28 June1972,the Select Committee made two recommendations to which this white paper contains the Governments response.DELAY IN REPAYMENTS OF TAX1. In paragraphs 22-24 of their Report, the Select Committee commentagain on the fact that interest is not payable on repayments of tax which aredelayed, a matter previously raised in the Select Committee&apos;s First Reportfor the 1970-71 Session. In paragraphs 14-17 of the Governments Observa-aions on that Report (published in July 1971 as Cmnd. 4729), the Chancellorof the Exchequer outlined the difficulties in devising arrangements for thepayment of interest on repayments of tax.2. The Chancellor is glad to note that the Select Committee recognise the practical problems, and that they do not wish to see a situation createdrequiring substantial increases in the staff of the Inland Revenue.3. The Select Committee consider, however, that where the taxpayer allegesundue delay by the Department and this is clearly established, &quot; it shouldbe possible in the individual case to arrive at a commonsense judgment onthe extent to which Departments own handling of the case has beenunreasonably slow, and on the amount of interest justified to remedy theinjustice caused by that part of the delay &quot;. The Committee consider thatit is unreasonable to withhold this remedy because of the practical problemsof establishing in other cases whether there has been undue delay. They note that, by contrast, the taxpayer himself is in certain circumstances requiredto pay interest to the Inland Revenue on tax not paid within two months.4. The Chancellor has considered the Select Committee&apos;s proposal that interest should, where claimed by the taxpayer, be paid in some cases onthe basis of a &quot; commonsense judgment &quot;. He considers, however, that thissuggestion could not provide a workable basis for paying interest nor doeshe think that it would be acceptable either to Parliament or to the public that interest should in effect be paid in cases where its amount could bedetermined without undue difficulty, but not in others.5. The Chancellor considers that the proposal would create very serious problems for the Inland Revenue Department. Although the Committeesuggest applying a commonsense judgment to claims for payment of interest,reasonable consistency of treatment between one taxpayer and another couldonly be achieved on the basis of complicated rules specifying the circum-stances in which interest was or was not to be paid. The Select Committeehave however accepted that there are practical difficulties in the way of doing this. In the absence of such rules, a taxpayer could not know whethera claim should or should not be submitted. Claims would therefore bemade in very many cases simply in the hope that they would be sym-pathetically considered.   Since payment of interest would of necessity have
to be discretionary, these claims would result in a great deal of correspondenceand argument in individual cases about the extent to which any delay hadbeen &quot; reasonable &quot; or &quot; unreasonable &quot; and. even in cases where it was accepted by the Department that interest should be paid, about its amount.There is no reason to suppose that the Committee&apos;s proposal would requiresignificantly smaller numbers of additional staff in the Inland RevenueDepartment than a wider proposal to pay interest in all cases of undue delay by the Inland Revenue.6. The Chancellor also notes that the Select Committee refer to the factthat the taxpayer may be liable for interest on tax due, but he does not accept that the cases are analogous. In general, the charge of interest onlyarises where the tax due exceeds  1,000 and remains unpaid two monthsafter the liability has been finally determined although there may havebeen considerable delay on the part of the taxpayer in agreeing the liability.Relatively few repayments of tax are, however, for more than  1,000, andas explained in paragraph 16 of Cmnd. 4729, once the amount of a repay-ment has been agreed, payment normally follows quickly.VISITS BY THE PUBLIC TO TAX OFFICES7. In paragraph 27 of their Report, the Select Committee acknowledgethat a taxpayers affairs must often be handled in a tax office at a distance from his home ; they agree that when a taxpayer needs a personal interview,it is best for him to visit a nearby tax office. The Committee considerhowever that the Department should take steps to make more widely knownthe facilities which are available.8. The Chancellor fully accepts the importance of local access and in an adjournment debate on 15 July 1971 (Official Report, columns 882-892),the then Financial Secretary told the House of the plans which the InlandRevenue had to improve and extend the local enquiry service.9. The main problems relate to PAYE taxpayers who work in scotland or in the London area. In Scotland, all PAYE files have been brought together in the computer centre (Centre 1) at East Kilbride. In the london area, a great part of the PAYE work has been dispersed to special taxdistricts in the provinces.10. For these two areas, the Inland Revenue have established a numberof Local Enquiry Offices, which a taxpayer in need of assistance may eithertelephone or visit. In most cases, enquiries can be answered on the spot(e.g. by issue of a form) but in other cases the taxpayers file can beobtained within a few days from the office where it is held. Most of these local Enquiry Offices have been set up within existing tax office accom-modation: others are Principal Local Enquiry Offices with separateaccommodation. The staff of these Offices are specially trained to providethe necessary service. There are at present either in operation, or shortly to open. 29 offices in Scotland, 34 in the London area and Home Counties,and one in Manchester.11. If a taxpayer is not within easy travelling distance of a Local EnquiryOffice, he may obtain help by visiting any convenient tax office.12. The Inland Revenue have taken steps to tell taxpayers in Scotlandand the London area about the local facilities which are available to them,and will continue to make the service generally known.   When a taxpayers
file is taken into Centre 1, the Centre automatically notifies him of the localenquiry facilities available. Publicity to the London taxpayer is beingcontinually improved; leaflets are circulated with the help of employers,or enclosed with returns or notices of coding.13. The opening of a new Principal Local Enquiry Office in London inSeptember 1972 not only received Press and radio publicity but also markedthe start of an advertising campaign in London evening newspapers, nationalnewspapers with Southern editions and in the programme papers of radio and television.14. The Chancellor is satisfied that all suitable steps are being taken tomeet the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery office at St. Stephens Parliamentary Press(302856)     Dd 230791  25  2/73
