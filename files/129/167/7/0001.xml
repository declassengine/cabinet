THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 7 COPY NO   v 424 January 1973CABINETTHE FUTURE OF broadcasting memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Select Committee on Nationalised Industries in their second report of Session 1971-1972, presented in August (HC 465), considerthe Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and make 30 recommendationseveral of which raise wide questions of broadcasting policy (the full Hstis at Annex B).    Nine recommendations fall to be answered by theMinister of Posts and Telecommunications, and the remainder by the IBA.The Authority have also commented on some of the Ministers nine,    Adraft White Piiper containing the observations of the Minister and of theIBA is at Annex A.2. The Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting has considered therecommendations which concern the Government, and the Minister!proposed observations on them.    The most important are those (Nos. 4,27, 29 and 30) which bear on the future of broadcasting after 1976, whenthe Charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the television and Sound Broadcasting Acts and the Hcences of the broadcast relay companies are all due to expire.    The proposal for a wide-rangingindependent inquiry to be held before that date has attracted vociferoussupport in a number of quarters, including sections of the communications industry and the media, and some of our own supporters.On past experience, however, the practical value of such an inquiry is open to question.    Moreover the BBC has anew chairman, while the termof office of the chairman of the IBA ends this year;  and it is desirablethat the heads of both organisations should be allowed time to make their influence felt before being called to account.    The fact that it is as yettoo early to foresee the exact timing and extent of the importanttechnological developments which are to be expected also suggests that a review of the structure of broadcasting should be postponed for a few years the Committee has therefore concluded that the present arrangements should be extended until 1981 - this would need legislation in relation tothe IBA - and that we should not at this stage seek to finalise our attitudetowards an independent inquiry in 1975 or shortly after.1
3. A decision to extend the present arrangements and to dispense witha full inquiry involves rejecting one of the Select Committee^ main recommendations, and will give rise to some controversy,,    A replyto the Select Committee will not, however, fully set out the government&apos;s policy,    A number of other issues need further study.    These include:the question of the fourth television channel;  the broadcastinp needs ofScotland, Wales and rural England;  and the representation of viewers&apos;interests.    At the Prime Minister*s suggestion the draft reply recordsthat these issues will be covered in proposals which the Government will bring before Parliament before seeking approval for the extension till 1981of the Television and Sound Broadcasting Acts and the BBC Charter.    Itwould be possible to cover other subjects (eg the development of cabletelevision) in this further pronouncement of Government policy.    Butit would be undesirable at this stage to point to other major subjects for early study since that would reinforce the Select Committee&apos;s view thata wide-ranging independent inquiry was needed now.4, Three other matters in the proposed reply to the Select Committeecall for commenta. In his observations on the four main recommendations, theMinister of Posts and Telecommunications proposes to announce the setting up of a limited independent inquiry into the broadcastingneeds of Scotland, Wales and rural Englandj but its terms ofreference will not mention the fourth television channel, the useof which will have to be decided in a wider context than that of theproposed inquiry.b. Recommendation 9 refers to the IBA levy.    the ministerial Committee on Broadcasting will be consideringproposals about this, but it is too soon yet to make any statementof the Governments viewsec. Recommendation 25 canvasses a consumer organisation forall communication media.    The Committee did not consider tnis an acceptable proposal;  but the broadcasting authorities are being consulted about the ways in which viewers&apos; interests can best berepresented.5. In the light of the above comments and explanations, I invite mycolleagues to approve the proposed terms of the Minister&apos;s reply to theSelect Committee&apos;s Report.R home Office24 January 1973
SECOND REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE on nationalised INDUSTRIESSESSION 1971-72Independent Broadcasting Authority(formerly Independent television authority)Observations by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications and the IndependentBroadcasting AuthorityPresented to Parliament by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunicationsby Command of Her majesty february 1973LONDONHER MAJESTVS STATIONERY office net cmnd.

SECOND REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE on nationalised INDUSTRIESSESSION 1971-72INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING  AUTHORITY  (FORMERLYINDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITY)Only 9 of the 30 recommendations in the Select Committee&apos;s Report are for the Minister to consider and his observations on them are .contaiBedin Part I. Most of the recommendations deal with matters which are theresponsibility of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and its ohserya-tions on them are contained in Part II.PART IObservations by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications1. Four recommendations (Recommendations (4), (27), (29) and (30))are concerned with the future of broadcasting after 1976:Recommendation (4). When the future of broadcasting after 1976 isexamined, consideration should be given to the advantages and disadvantages of placing transmitting and planning functions under theAuthority (paragraph 29).Recommendation (27). No decision should be taken on allocatingthe Fourth Channel except as part of a general review embracing the broadcasting needs of the country (paragraph 106).Recommendation (29). The Minister should set up a full rangingenquiry at the earliest opportunity to consider broadcasting after 1976.This enquiry should consider not only the BBC and the Authority, butalso take into account newer technological developments. Such an enquiry should study the systems of other countries and commissionstudies of the long term social cultural economic, political and technicalimplications of alternative systems and invite public debate to considerthe options open (paragraph 167). There should, thereafter be periodicand systematic reviews of the operation of the chosen structure(paragraph 128) and of the new technological developments which areintroduced (paragraph 136).Recommendation (30). In considering the structure of broadcastingafter 1976, the systems adopted by various European countries shouldbe explored, with the object not of eliminating advertising its a source of broadcasting revenue but of ensuring that its effect on programmecontent be less than at present where the sale of advertising time andthe planning and production are in the same hands (paragraph 169).
2. The Government recognise the force of argument for an independentreview. However, since the Select Committee reported, the views of the television Advisory Committee have been presented. It finds that notechnical advances affecting the basis on which the present structure of broadcasting rests are likely to develop until the 1980s. By then, however,there will be a reasonably early possibility of two more television channelsand more knowledge of the technical and commercial potentialities of wiredbroadcasting. The outlook for satellite broadcasting will also be clearer.It seems therefore that the technical premises on which broadcasting policy should be founded will not have changed greatly by 1976. It will bepossible at a later stage more accurately to assess the extent and timing of technical developments. In the Government^ view it would be moresensible to take any necessary decisions then.3. Some practical experience of independent radio is desirable beforebroadcasting policy is reviewed.4. For these reasons, together with the fact that a new Chairman of the bbc has just been appointed and should be given time to settle in, theGovernment consider a full-ranging enquiry undesirable now. They propose the extension until 1981, of the Television and Sound Broadcasting Acts andthe BBC Charter without any substantial change. The licences authorising the services provided by broadcast relay organisations would be extendedto the same date. Separate consideration is being given to the question ofa fourth television channel.5. However, there is one group of related problems which could, with advantage, be studied more immediately. The Government intend to commission an independent enquiry to consider the arrangements made toprovide coverage by the broadcasting services in Scotland, Wales and ruralEngland; whether the programmes provided specially for reception in those areas adequately meet the needs of the people living there; whether any changes are desirable in these arrangements and programmes; and if so howsuch changes should be financed.6. Recommendation (5). The Minister should include the proposal ofsome form of rolling contract in preference to the existing fixed system inhis consideration of the future of independent television in the years after1976 (paragraph 39); consideration also being given to allow new blood to compete periodically for contracts (paragraphs 40 and 152).There is no reason why, under present legislation, the authority should not adopt a system of rolling contracts, provided of course thatthe remaining duration of the legislation is long enough. The proposed extension until 1981 of the legislation would permit the Authority, if itwished, to adopt such a system and also to consider new applicants forcontracts.7. Recommendation (9). Future adjustments to the levy should bemade in the light of more detailed inspection of the costs incurred in makingparticular types of programmes, especially those not likely to attract largeaudiences (paragraph 54).This recommendation has been noted.   As the Select Committeerecord, the possibility of a change in the system is being studied.
8. Recommendation (18). Section 3 of the Act should be re-examined and, if need be, modified to enable the Authority to relax its controlsomewhat in the area of public policy and social issues to ensure that whitebalance is preserved overall a greater freedom to experiment is afforded tothe broadcaster (paragraph 73).It appears to the Minister that the question at issue is the Authority&apos;sinterpretation of its duties under Section 3 of the Television Act ratherthan the wording of the Section itself.9. Recommendation (19). To secure wider showing of programmes of merit, the Authority should sponsor, or be capable of providing,experimental programmes for the network in addition to those of aneducational nature. The terms of the Act should be reviewed to make this possible (paragraph 74).This would significantly change the functions of the Authority. from being a purely regulatory body it would become one which also corn-missioned or undertook programme production on its own behalf. TheGovernment do not consider that so significant a change should beintroduced in their proposed extension of the Television Act to 1981.10. Recommendation (25). The need for a consumer organisation,established by statute, for all communication media should be included inthe Ministers deliberations on the future of television after 1976 (paragraph91).Whilst the Government are giving careful consideration to ways inwhich viewers&apos; interests can best be represented, they believe it would be undesirable to establish a single consumer organisation for allcommunication media.11. Recommendation (28). The Minister should consider the advisability of broadening the membership of the Authority (paragraph 120).The need to secure that the Members of the Authority are among them able to bring a wide range of experience to bear on the dischargeof their responsibilities is borne in mind when appointments are made.Whenever they are made in future the question whether the range of experience represented in the membership is comprehensive enough willbe examined. There are no present plans for changing the number ofmembers, but it is reviewed from time to time.12. The issues reserved for further consideration in this White Paper (He.the question of a fourth channel; the recommendations of the limited enquiry into the broadcasting services in Scotland, Wales and rural England; the representation of viewers&apos; interests) will be covered in proposals which theGovernment will bring before Parliament before seeking approval for theextension until 1981 of the Television and Sound Broadcasting Acts andthe BBC Charter.
Observations by the Independent Broadcasting AuthorityFOREWORDThe Authority has carefully studied the Report of the Select Committee on nationalised Industries.The Report contains much which is common ground between the SelectCommittee and the Authority. Thus, a major theme running through theReport is the paramount importance of the programme output. TheAuthority agrees. Its comments therefore begin with a section on thestandard of programming. This gives the Authority&apos;s views on balance and quality in a self-supporting broadcasting system operating only one television service.The second section deals with the programme functions of the authority in Independent Television. It records that the Authority will be giving further consideration to increasing iis involvement in scheduling. It expressesreservations about the Television Act being revised to enable the Authorityto move into actual programme production or commissioning.In the third section, on the regional structure of Independent Television,the Authority describes the advantages which the plural system of independent Television provides. It accepts the need for the potentialitiesot the regional as well as the central companies to be used in the best interests of the service.The fourth and fifth sections discuss the Committee&apos;s recommendations on advertising and on information and research.An appendix refers to the Committee&apos;s Summary of Recommendations,and either comments briefly on each recommendation or else gives a cross-reference to the main discussion.I.  STANDARD OF PROGRAMMINGIn its investigation, the Committee was concerned more with themachinery of Independent Television than with its output. But, as the Reportitself makes clear, it is by the standard of the programmes that the authority and the companies will first and last be judged.On the credit side, the Committee agrees that, by comparison with 1960,balance in prime viewing time is much improved; that a high proportion of serious programmes is provided; and that the quality of individual programmes of all kinds is high. The Report pays particular tribute to thequality of the productions in news, current affairs, arts and drama.But, in general, the Committee feels that &quot;the overall output of programmes falls below what might have been expected &quot;. This raises thequestion what it might be reasonable to expect; what is a proper balance,and what constitutes quality; and the practical question how they are to be ensured.
The Report treats balance and quality together. They should be distinguished; not only because they represent different aspects of programme output, but also because the problems of ensuring them aredistinct. A well-balanced schedule can consist of programmes each of poor quality; and programmes all of high quality can constitute an ill-balanced one.balance the Authority agrees with the Select Committee that the chief successesof television are programmes that extend the limits of viewers&apos; awareness.An important aim in scheduling must be to introduce such programmes asoften as possible. Ideal balance is not, however, a simple matter and calls for the exercise of continuous judgment between the claims of the familiarand unfamiliar.The need greatly to increase the opportunities for the unfamiliar led theAuthority to put forward, on its own initiative, its ITV 2 proposals, which resulted from its preparation in 1970 for the proposed Annan Committee.The Select Committee did not relate its views on balance to the inevitablelimitations of a single-channel service. Instead the suggestion is made thatall that is required is for the Authority to exercise greater powers. This,in the Authority&apos;s view, is to misunderstand the constrictions of the system:balance on a single-channel ITV service will, whatever the powers wieldedby the Authority, always be different from that which could be achievedon two channels.How best to overcome the single-channel handicaps and to include morethoughtful and unfamiliar items which can be really said to communicate with viewers (as opposed to being included to satisfy an arithmetical concept of balance among different categories of programme) is the subject of continous attention. The Authority is giving further thought to thearrangements for the control of scheduling to see if changes are desirable,and it shares the Committee&apos;s wish to see a wider range of programmesbroadcast at peak times. It is, however, convinced that good balance isnot a simple question of putting less popular items into peak times at theexpense of the more popular ones. Balance at peak times on a single-channel service will continue to be different from the balance over the programmes as a whole, and the Committee here appears to havemisunderstood what is statutorily required (see the note in the Appendixon Recommendations (15) and (16)).QualityQuality presents different problems from balance. The Authority doesnot (as the Committee seems to) regard &apos; quality&apos; as the opposite of&quot;popular&apos;: popular programmes need not be of lesser quality than thosedesigned for a minority. Balance, of a kind, can be ensured byorganisational means. What cannot be similarly ensured is thatdocumentaries are enlightening, plays moving, and comedies funny.Certainly not every programme on Independent Television has thequality that the Authority, or indeed the companies, would like to seeattained. High quality, or distinction, belongs by definition to that whichrises above the average: and, in every art-form, the productions in which7
one takes pride are the exception rather than the rule they stand on theshoulders of much standard work in which and through which the providersof excellence learn their trade and practise their craft. The Authority doesof course accept that it is no more capable of ensuring an unbroken flow of fine programmes than universities are capable of seeing that all theirpupils win first-class degrees. But it is its task to see that the opportunitiesare wide enough and the encouragement strong enough, that as many high quality programmes as possible are made, and that sub-standard work isfirmly criticised. The Authority&apos;s programme activities are not confined to approval of schedules and thereafter to hope. When poor quality isdiagnosed, by the Authority or by its advisory committees or by its staff,this is taken up with the producing company. Equally, productions ofexceptionally high quality also attract comment, so that the forces ofemulation and example may do their work.Quality cannot be prescribed: it grows out of the creative talent towhich the system has access. So, in tUe Authority&apos;s view, quality is bestachieved in a situation where the programme companies and those who workfor them have the freedom (in the Committee&apos;s words) to produce their bestcreative output. A theme of the Committee&apos;s report is that this freedomwould be increased by being reduced and by the Authority having greatercontrol. The paradox is one that is tempting to the Authority; but, for thereasons given in the following sections, it is a temptation that it believesmust be resisted. The relationship between the Authority and the companieshas not in the past been static, and the Authority agrees that further changesmay be desirable; but it does not accept that simple solutions are to beachieved just by reducing the companies&apos; responsibilities.II.   THE PROGRAMME FUiNCTIONS OF THE authority the present system a  television system financed solely by advertising could take many forms.At one extreme, individual private companies could compete with eachother, governed only by market forces and by restrictions on broadcastingfrequencies. At the other, a single State-owned organisation could itselfproduce all the programmes and collect the advertising revenue.The Television Act adopts an intermediate position. Under it there is a division of function between the Authority and the programme contractors.On some matters the division is exact: the Authority must own and operate the transmitters, while, in all normal circumstances, the contractors mustoperate the studio facilities and produce the programmes. Responsibility forprogramme planning and scheduling is shared, and the Act leaves open anumber of possibilities for the way in which the sharing is arranged.The benefits and implications of a plural system the policy and practices that the Authority has adopted are based onthe belief that a strength of Independent Television is its plurality. TheAuthority has considerable powers by which, as was described in its evidence,it exerts a marked influence on the system.   To increase these powers
would be to run the risk of losing the benefits of plurality. Taken to itslogical conclusion, the argument that the Authority itself should have greaterpowers would entail that it should become a body like the BBC, but financed by advertising revenue rather than by licence fee. Anything less is unlikely to satisfy those criticisms of ITV which, though concentrating on the detailedinterpretation of the Television Act, are based on a distaste for any profitmotive in broadcasting: but it could well give rise to other criticisms, of monopoly, reduced access, and lack of response to public attitudes; and itwould be at variance with Parliaments decision that Independent Televisionshould be a system of private enterprise under public control.Independent Television is a service which by comparison with the othertelevision services in the world contains an extremely high proportion of itsown production as distinct from material acquired in recorded form from elsewhere. (In 1971-72, 7,000 hours of programming were produced by itsown studios and outside broadcast units; in 1972-73, the figure will be appreciably higher.) The plural system which produces these programmes is something that the Authority thinks it important to preserve, and its task isto ensure that the best possible programmes are produced by the companies.The Authority does not see this as being best achieved by itself prescribingprogrammes. As has been said in Section I. good programmes must comefrom the creative ideas of people who work for the programme companies:and it is they too who know whether there exist the human and studioresources to turn the ideas into realities. Neither does the Authority acceptthe validity of the distinction drawn in paragraph 161 of the Committee&apos;sReport, where it is stated that &quot; it is inherent in the system that the companies should be the producers of programmes while the Authority is responsiblefor maintaining standards and quality&quot;. Standards and quality are notseparable items which can be superimposed on an alien product. Underthe Television Act, the duty of securing programme standards and qualityhas to be extended, through the programme contracts, by the Authority to thecompanies. The final responsibility under statute is the Authority&apos;s; but itis one which can only be satisfactorily discharged by getting standards and quality from the producing companies.The case for a Programme Planning board for the reasons explained above, the Authority has so far felt it rightto proceed by indicating the type of balance that it requires and then tocome into the Drogramme planning process when ideas have been assessed asviable and realistic by those who will actually be producing them, and whenthey come forward for consideration alongside the others that are available.The problem which the Committee correctly identifies is at what point andin what manner the Authority&apos;s part in the process can most effectively be played.The Authority has itself considered how its influence on schedulingmight occur earlier than at present. The proposal it has made for a programme Planning Board is closelv linked to the new situation which would arise with a two-channel service. The second channel would contain a thirdblock of programmes in addition to the blocks of guaranteed access for the
central and regional companies; this third block would be filled by equalcompetition from the companies and outside producers, and it was to regulatethis competition, as well as to secure compliance with Section 25 of the television Act, that the Programme Planning Board was proposed. (Section 25provides that, in a two-channel situation, the broadcasting of the same kindof programme at the same time on both channels must, as far as possible, be avoided.)If the Government sets up ITV 2, with an increase of time and scope forprogrammes, then the Authority believes that the machinery proposed lastyear for its own involvement in scheduling is right; if, however, ITV&apos;s outputcontinues to be on one channel only, the Authority would want to considerafresh whether the Programme Planning Board or some other means mightbe the right way of increasing its involvement in scheduling.Programme initiation and production by the authority in the nineteenth of its recommendations, the Committee suggests thatthe Authority should sponsor, or be capable of funding, experimentalprogrammes for the network, and that the terms of the Television Act shouldbe reviewed to make this possible. Related suggestions are made in thethird and eighth recommendations.There is no difference between the Authority and the Select Committeeabout the need to encourage experiment and freshness in the programmes.The Authority has therefore seriously considered whether it would want toback any of these recommendations by urging that, when the Television Actcomes to be reviewed before 1976, they should be made statutorily possible.Plainly, proposals of this kind can only properly be considered againstthe background of the full legislative arrangements for IndependentBroadcasting after 1976. The Authority&apos;s present views, however, are against any proposals which blur the existing division of functions between theAuthority and the programme companies for programme production.As has been described above, the Authority sees its task as being to ensurethat the best possible programmes are produced by the companies. It does notbelieve that the two distinct tasks of programme production and of regulating the production of others can satisfactorily be combined. The roles are distinct,and require different staffing and resources: one cannot both hold the ringand enter the ring. Even were this not so, the Authority would not wishto see the companies&apos; own responsibility for innovation lessened: if it becameexpected of the Authority that it should itself rectify any shortcomingsby commissioning special programmes, there would be a tendency for those responsible for programme ideas in the companies more and more to cede this responsibility to the Authority.The Select Committee does not accept this view, and the matter is one on which the Committee and the Authority differ. The Authority fullyaccepts, however, that programmes that do not earn as much as they cost should be produced. Unprofitable programmes in this sense occur inIndependent Television both within and outside peak hours. More can andshould be done now that the companies&apos; financial position is healthy.  The
very full exchanges that the Authority had with each company in the yearfollowing the reduction of the levy were designed to stimulate activity of thiskind. Not all the results of these exchanges have yet been seen, for television programmes, if properly planned and prepared, take time to appear on thescreen. And, just as their equivalents on the BBC usually appear on BBC-2or outside the peak evening viewing hours, so a number of these programmes are not seen at peak time but (for example) at 12 noon (for pre-schoolchildren), at 3 p.m. (travelogue), or after 10.30 p.m. On a single channelthere will often be a tendency for new elements to be overlooked.III.   REGIONAL STRUCTUREGeneralThe previous section has stressed the importance that the Authorityattaches to the plural system of broadcasting that it has developed overthe past 17 years. As the Authority stated in its evidence, its aim has been to have as many programme companies as could be supported by areas that were reasonable units both in technical terms and in terms of communalaffinity. The present arrangements stem from a detailed review in 1966-67of possible changes in the structure. The Authority then decided to divide the Northern area into two, and to enable each central area, except London,to be served seven days a week by a single company; no further sub-divisions were thought feasible in the regional areas. The structure will be reviewed again before 1976. As the National Board for Prices and Incomes pointedout, re-structuring could lead to cost reductions. It does not necessarily follow that it would be desirable; the benefits of cost-reduction will need tobe weighed against the other benefits that re-structuring would lose.The effect of. the structureDrawing upon the evidence it received from one group of witnesses, theSelect Committee observed that &quot; the body of people making vital decisions in the industry is a small unrepresentative one and that, if onlyunconsciously, this small body impresses its own values upon what we seeand hear over the air &quot;. In fact, the regional structure ensures that manyvaried influences shape the pattern of programming. Each of the fifteenseparate programme companies is equally represented on the Authority&apos;programme Policy Committee and on the companies&apos; Network programme committee; and each is responsible to the Authority for the precise mixtureof network, local, and acquired material that comprises its own schedulefor its own area. Each company is in turn influenced by a variety ofrelationships, with organisations and individuals, within the particular areait serves. Each management is answerable to a Board of Directors mainlydrawn from and living in its contract area. Each has its groups of advisers,particularly in the field of education and religion. Every programmecontroller accounts to his Board, and in several cases has a defined relation-ship with a programme board or committee made up of people both abovehim and below him in his company&apos;s hierarchy.Within the Authority itself, relationships with the companies are at all levels from the chairmen of the Boards to the specialist staff within thedifferent sections of the programme departments: relationships which arc
sometimes formal and often informal often harmonious but sometimesabrasive. The attitudes of the Authority&apos;s own programme staff are affected by their contact with Members of the Authority, the results of research into appreciation of and reactions to the programmes, theircorrespondence with viewers, the reports of the monitors, and their con-consultations with advisory committees and with one another, whether operatingat the centre or in the regions. Members of the Authority themselves comefrom varied walks of life and they have their own contacts, formal andinformal, with the managements of the companies, including the programmecontrollers.Diffusion of responsibility for programme output may well seemponderous in action, with its committees and patiently sought agreements.But it ensures that many people (some might argue too many) do participate in planning the programme service: the body making vital decisions inIndependent Television is anything but small.The role of the regional companiesAlthough each programme company has a similar relationship with theAuthority, there is a real practical difference between the group of centralcompanies and those serving the regions. The regional companies areavowedly dependent upon a steady supply of networkable programmes fromthe five central companies, and are apt to speak with different voices aboutcontributions to the network from the regions as a whole. In general, duringthe period of restricted hours, the regional companies have recognised thattheir first task was to serve their own areas with programmes which would satisfy local tastes and interests; and that, if beyond that they had offeringsto make to the network, they were being fairly considered.The Committee&apos;s recommendations call for guaranteed networking of programmes by the regional companies during prime viewing time. TheGovernments decision to free the hours of television broadcasting createdan opportunity to move in the direction which the Committee desires. its effects are now seen in the current autumn schedule. The increase in totalbroadcasting hours has meant that the spare capacity of several regionalcompanies could be used for the supply of more network programmes.Consequently, the amount of fully networked regional material has nownearly doubled since the beginning of the year. The Committee considersthat, while these moves are to be welcomed, much more is needed for the regional structure to serve adequately the interest of the public. TheAuthority is in sympathy with this view. The extension of broadcasting hours has begun a transformation in the programme structure of independent Television which a favourable decision on the Authority&apos;proposal for an ITV 2 would further accelerate.It is important that programmes should be chosen on their merits, and regional contributions will vary according to the widely different sizes and resources of the companies. The extent to which regionally producedprogrammes should in the future be networked in or around peak time still remains to be seen; the system which has excluded this possibility except on rare occasions is undergoing a change. The output of five networkcompanies previously left very little space in the restricted hours allowed
to ITV; the possibility of ear-marking some of that space for regionalcontributions did not appeal even to the enthusiasts for more regionalparticipation (Q 594-5). Now, as the Authority said in its request of June1971 to the Minister for derestriction, the increase in hours offers part ofthe solution to this problem, and a second channel would offer more.The Committee also recommends that liaison between a major and a regional company should be established so that production facilities andequipment could be afforded by the larger to the smaller companies. Forthe reasons it has already made clear, the Authority would not want to seethe independence of the regional companies reduced; but, in its consideration before 1976 of the future regional pattern, it will take into account whatsharing of facilities might be encouraged, in addition to that which alreadyoccurs.IV.  ADVERTISINGGeneralAdvertisements, while attractive to some viewers, do by their verypresence displease others; it is therefore likely that the arrangements madefor them, and in particular any occasional placing of them which seems toincrease their intrusiveness, will be the subject of special criticism. TheAuthority does not take the view that its arrangements for advertisingcannot be improved: but the diminution in criticism over the past 12 yearsleads it to believe that its system of control has been in the main successful.It will continue to give thought to ways of improving this system; but itdoes not suppose that there will ever be a time when every viewer isreconciled to advertisements and the commercial structure which they represent. Dislike of a whole system will always find expression incomplaint about the details.The placing of advertisingThe Authority agrees that advertising breaks in programmes needcontinuous scrutiny. It realises how strongly some people feel about them.Errors sometimes occur; but, however far they are reduced, it is inevitable that, given the limits imposed on a system that is dependent upon advertise-ments alone for its revenue, there will continue to be breaks that some people will resent.The Committee recommends that the Authority should consider thebunching of advertisements so as to reduce the pressure for maximumaudiences. It quotes in support of the recommendation the practice adoptedin Switzerland, Germany, Holland and Italy. In all these countriesadvertisements provide only a small part of the television services&apos; revenue.No service which depends solely upon advertising has found it possible togroup its advertisements more than does ITV. Nor would the Authorityconsider it sensible to try to do so. Taking into account the amount of advertising that ITV must carry to pay its way, the Authority does notbelieve that further bunching would prove more acceptable to viewers orreduce the need for programmes to attract and keep large audiences.
Although not able to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation onbunching, the Authority agrees that the pressure for maximum audienceswhich advertising can exert is something that needs to be controlled. Whilebelieving that this influence is less strong in 1TV than in any other servicewholly sustained by advertising revenue, it intends to look further at thisquestion between now and 1976; and, well before the Committee reported,it had taken the initiative in offering to arrange in 1973, for members ofthe European Broadcasting Union, a special symposium to consider currentadvertising practices and policies in public service broadcasting.Discussion programmes about advertisingThe Committee refers to the practice of the American FederalCommunications Commission, which enables consumer associations to begiven time on the air to answer the claims of advertisers. It should benoted that, unlike the Authority, the FCC exercises no control overadvertisements before they are broadcast. While the FCCs system allowsmisleading statements to be corrected after they are made, the Authority&apos;sseries of controls aims at preventing misleading statements being made inthe first place.Consumer programmes to report the results of comparative tests weretried out on BBC Television in the early 1960s. They did not prove whollysuccessful, and the Molony Committee on Consumer Protection itself hadreservations about them; it did not endorse the suggestion made at the time that the ITA should be required to engage in this activity. The Authoritynevertheless welcomes programmes that are concerned with consumer affairs or that take a critical look at advertising. Recent examples of suchprogrammes on ITV have been Granada&apos;s &apos;* Open Night&quot;, and &quot; world in Action&quot; on aspirin-based products, and Thames&apos;s &quot; Images&quot;. TheAuthority recognises the need for further programmes of this kind, and in considering future plans it will bear in mind the Committee^ recommenda-tion about discussion programmes to examine the claims of advertisers&apos;products.Prime time for health and safety announcementsThe Authority already affords to the COI time free of charge to showadvertisements on health and safety and other measures. During the last twelve months, over 20,000 free transmissions of this nature were made overthe ITV network on behalf of the COI. The time made available in thisway, if it had been purchased, would have cost the Government about 2 million. The Committee recommends that the Authority should consult the COI as to the best means of achieving provision for showing certain types of announcements in prime viewing time. The Authority will be discussing this recommendation with the COI and the implications that itsimplementation would have in terms of the other facilities provided to theCOI by ITV and for the advertising outlets in other media for which theCOI at present has to pay. A question of principle raised by theCommittee&apos;s recommendation is to what extent BBC and ITV should differ from other media in the facilities they provide for Governmentannouncements.
GeneralThe Authority accepts that public broadcasting services should beprepared to explain to the public the background to, and reasons for, theirpolicy and practices. It has, over the years, expanded the information and research side of its activities, starting in 1964 with the appointment of a senior officer responsible to the Director General for this. Since then,through its Annual Reports, the annual handbooks, occasional publications,press releases and other public statements, including the series of &quot; ITANotes &quot;, the Authority has given to the public generally a wide range ofinformation about ITV. This has been supplemented by the informationprovided to the Prices and Incomes Board and to the Select Committee itself.The Authority does not regard the present position as static. it recognises that the Report shows a need for more public information aboutthe Authority&apos;s policies and planning. It will be taking note of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations: and, with Section 24 of the Television Actparticularly in mind, it will be considering further how best it can take account of the interests of the public at large as opposed to those ofparticular interest groups.Research(a) PublicationThe Authority accepts the Committee&apos;s recommendation that means should be found of giving greater publicity to its research activities, includingboth its audience research programme and any wider-ranging policy-reviewstudies that it undertakes. Problems exist, particularly with the moretechnical research, of finding suitable media for publication and of presenting the results in a way that evokes interest but not misinterpretation. It isclearly important, however, that where possible these problems should be overcome, and the Authority will be giving further thought to ways ofmaking its research activities better known and understood.(b) Audience studiesThe belief that the bulk of the Authority&apos;s research is aimed at studies of audience size is incorrect. In 1971-72 only a quarter of the Authority&apos;sresearch budget of  83,000 was spent on measurement. Moreover the aim off the studies is not simply to obtain data on ratings, but to understandpatterns of viewing, and audience tastes and preferences. While the first essential of the research is necessarily to find out what actually happens, it isthe explanations that are of greater interest and importance. An enormousamount of information is available from records of viewing behaviour,indicating what people actually do in a choice situation as opposed to whatthey say they want to do. Hardly any analysis of this had taken place untilthe Authority started its ASKE studies, which now provide information onsuch questions as the extent to which people view programmes of a similarkind, and the extent to which there are specific minority tastes and patterns of viewing.
The largest single item in the Authority&apos;s research budget is the cost ofthe audience appreciation research that is carried out in the London area.Earlier research has shown that public attitudes towards networkedpeak-time programmes vary only slightly from region to region, and anybenefits gained by carrying out research on a wide geographical basis havenot been thought to be worth the extra costs. The changes brought byderestriction may lead to this being reconsidered.(c) Future research the Committee suggests that research is required into the present and potential needs of the television audience. Empirical research into &quot; needs &quot;notoriously presents great difficulties; and the needs of the television audienceare more a matter for debate and discussion of values and objectives than for research. The Authority readily accepts, however, that viewers&apos;preferences, understanding and interests should be the subject of researchthat is helpful to programme planners and producers. Examples of suchresearch which the Authority has already conducted, into adult education,drama, news, religious broadcasting and sport have been described inevidence to the Committee and in the Authority&apos;s Annual Reports. among other recent studies was the study of News and Current Affairs (which wasnot &quot; a comprehensive study &quot; but a study of the public&apos;s comprehension).This, and a study of attitudes to advertising, the Committee criticises for the size of the samples. The latter was in fact based on a sample size of over1,000 adults; statistically this was an adequate sample for the purpose, andsample size is in itself of less consequence than sample design. The formerwas not a sample survey, nor described as such, but based on groups of 100consisting of cross-sections of the public.The Authority will certainly be considering the further development ofits research programme and in the light of the research activities of theprogramme companies themselves it will be considering also what roles in research should be played by it and by the companies respectively.(d) Support of research by outside bodiesThe Committee indicates in paragraph 65 that the Authority shouldresume giving &quot; substantial resources to universities or other research bodiesto carry [out] other types of research &quot;. A necessary pre-condition for thiswould be evidence that there are social scientists whose work would producefindings of relevance to the Authority, and that they are hindered from pursuing their research because they are unable, for reasons other than lackof merit, to obtain funds either from their own institutions or from thenormal grant-giving bodies such as the Social Science Research Council. Ifsuch evidence is presented, the Authority will be prepared to consider makinggrants for specific projects; but it is unlikely to provide general funds forthe development of research institutions. And it is conscious, from its own experience and that of other sponsors of research, of the need to ensure thatany research it supports is not only concerned with socially important questions but has also some likelihood of providing socially importantanswers.
Regional officersAn important part of the regional officers&apos; duties is to keep in touchwith the local community. The Authority agrees that their existence shouldbe made as widely known as possible to the public. It may be that theAuthority did not, in its evidence to the Committee, fully explain the extentto which regional officers already keep in touch with the public in their area, by a variety of means, and report each month to the Director Generalthe reactions, comments, and criticism which they obtain by this means.The role of the regional officers in meeting and hearing a cross-section of thepublic is of special importance at a time when particular interest groupsrepresent their own views as being those of the public and claim uniqueknowledge of what constitutes the public interest.17th November, 1972
AppendixNOTES ON recommendations.   ProgrammingThe Authority will be giving the consideration that the Committeerecommends.   Its present views are described in Section II.2.   Regional officers the regional officers&apos; relationship with the public is referred to inSection V. The Authority agrees that their existence should be widely known.Other aspects of the Committee&apos;s recommendation:(a) AreasIn paragraph 22 of its Report the Committee remarks that the areas for which regional officers are responsible do not in all cases match the areas served by programme companies. This might suggest that the regional officers&apos; areas are not based on those of the companies. Thisis not the case. What the Committee may have had in mind is that three regional officers cover two programme company areas each; theseare the regional officers at Plymouth (Westward and Channel), Glasgow(Grampian and Scottish) and Newcastle (Border and Tyne-Tees). the size of the population served is an important factor in determining the disposition of regional officers, and there are no compelling reasons for having one regional officer to each company irrespective of its size.The Authority agrees that the location of its offices in London doesnot necessarily preclude the need for a regional officer for that area. an argument against the need for such a post is that, as the Report elsewherepoints out, there is always a danger of metropolitan interests prevailingover the regional, and with the contacts that the headquarters staffalready have with the two London companies the appointment of a london regional officer might be seen as causing additional imbalance.It is, however, a possibility that the Authority has considered in the past and will look at again.(b) Strengthening of roleThe Keport suggests that the regional officers&apos; role should be strengthened in some way in relation to the Authority. Regional officers are subject to normal chains of command, like other members of theAuthority&apos;s staff. In exercising the Authority&apos;s policy they are left a wide latitude on how they do so, and no evidence to the Committeeindicated that they were unreasonably overruled.3.   Experiment and development in programme productionThis, together with the eighth and nineteenth recommendations, is discussed in Section II.The recommendation is based on the argument that, since the authority has an experimental and developmental department in engineering, it shouldhave a similar department in the field of programme production. the argument assumes that the Authority&apos;s responsibilities for transmission and
programme production are the same.   This is not so.   Even if the Actwere changed so that they were, the requirements for experiment anddevelopment in a technology such as broadcasting engineering aredissimilar from those in an art such as programme production.4.   Transmitting and planning functions as the Committee states in paragraph 28 of its Report, the authority would itself be opposed to the idea that it should lose its responsibilities for transmission. The reasons for taking this view are set out in paragraph 4of the Authority&apos;s memorandum which is reproduced as Appendix 2 on pages 315-318 of the Committee&apos;s Report. In general, the Authority sees noreason to believe that any other public body could operate the ITV andBBC transmission services at the required standard more efficiently or more cheaply than can the broadcasting authorities themselves.The Authority also believes that it should retain its responsibilities for planning the ITV transmission network. This is because, as stated inparagraph 4 (ii) of Appendix 2, any broadcasting service is concerned notonly with the quality of its transmissions but also with the areas to whichthey are available, their rate of expansion, and their costs. The need tohave control in these fields is particularly relevant in a federal structure suchas Independent Television.5.   The future form of contractsAs the Committee records, the Authority is in favour of stability in thesystem, and reasonable security for existing companies, with the safeguardsthat a system of rolling contracts would provide in the form of regularreviews of performance. The Committee&apos;s recommendation repeats and does not resolve the dilemma of reconciling this with the opportunity for new applicants to be considered. In discussion of the recommendation inparagraph 40, the Committee emphasises the need for the opportunity for new blood to compete for contracts even with companies whose performancehas not been faulted. The Committee thus advocates the policy which theAuthority followed in 1967, and for which it is elsewhere criticised.In paragraph 34 the Committee states that &quot; the evidence submitted to your Committee makes it clear that the Authority did not warn the industry as a whole well in advance of the possibility that there might be a substantialreorganisation of the structure &quot;. The Authority was not asked for evidence on this point. Public statements by the Chairman of the Authority in 1963,1964, and 1966 in fact made it plain, well before 1967, that there wouldbe open competition between existing programme companies and newapplicants. It followed from this policy that a company whose performancehad not been such as to require a warning would still be competing witha new applicant whose promise might appear to the Authority greater thanthe established company&apos;s achievements.6.   Direct supervision of a temporary service the recommendation implies that the Authority should carry sparesenior managerial staff in case it wished to take over the running of a company in a crisis.   The Authority doubts whether the possession of
such staff would have yielded a better solution than was achieved to theLondon Weekend problems of February 1971, and it would find it hard to justify making such elaborate provision against a situation which hasbeen rare in the past and which it hopes will be even rarer in the future.7.   RentalsThe eight main criteria for determining companies&apos; rentals are given onpage 69 of the Authority&apos;s evidence to the Committee. This information could be amplified by some further observations on each occasion; but thereis no arithmetical formula which can be applied automatically and whichfits every situation. In order to produce the right rental for each company the Authority has to exercise judgment. It agrees, however, that the fullest possible information should be given, though its use of confidential information must respect the rights of a company and the duties thatdirectors have to their shareholders.8.   Use of reserve fund to provide programme subsidiesTogether with Recommendations (3) and (19), this is discussed inSection II. Like Recommendation (3), it is based on a false analogy betweenengineering and programme production. The Committee records that it was&quot; struck by the contrast between future plans to use the reserve fund for theextension and improvement of the transmission service and the relative lackof plans for the development and improvement of programmes&quot;. Thereare indeed no plans to use the reserve fund for the latter purpose. Plans toimprove the transmission service, and to use the reserve fund for thispurpose, are within the proper scope of the Authority&apos;s functions. the suggestions implied in paragraph 46 for the use of the reserve fund heoutside its statutory power.9.   The levyThe Authority welcomes the Committee&apos;s comments in paragraph 54 onthe shortcomings of the existing levy system, and on the Authority&apos;s initiative in looking for a more satisfactory solution. The essential feature of a new system must be that it does not remove money which ought to be spent onprogrammes. Both the Authority&apos;s proposals have this as their aim, and both seem more practicable than an attempt to adjust the levy to the costs of particular types of programmes.10.   Programmes of local interest the Authority&apos;s Report and Accounts for 1970-71 described on pages25-27 the local originations by the network companies. (Similar information is given in the Report for 1971-72 on pp. 23-25). Further details over thelast three years are contained in Appendix 17, provided by the Authority, on pages 361-364 of the Committee&apos;s Report. It was explained in the concluding paper of that answer that the authority has not placed quantitativerequirements for local output on these five companies in the same way as ithas done for the other ten; that the local origination commitment of thelatter has been related to their known resources and has taken into account the fact that they have not had to provide a regular supply of major network
programmes; but that, nevertheless, the Authority expects and gets areasonable output of local programmes in each of the areas served by thefive major companies.Local programming is the primary task of regional companies and it isuseful for their purposes that they should know what quantity ofprogramming each week on average the Authority is looking for; but they also know that the Authority attaches more importance to the character and quality of their programmes than to the mere provision of a specifiedminimum number of hours. On the other hand, the primary task of thefive major companies is the provision of network programmes; but they in turn are well aware of the Authority&apos;s expectation that they should provide,in addition, a reasonable output of local programmes.II, 12, 13.  Regional companiesThese recommendations are discussed in Section III. The authority will continue to seek opportunities for regional contributions to benetworked.14.   ResearchThis is discussed in Section V. The Authority will continue to keepits research programme under review.15, 16.   BalanceGeneral questions of balance are discussed in Section I.The Committee implies that the Television Act requires that theprogramme balance should be the same at all times of the day and week.This is not what the Act requires, and the paraphrase of Section 1 (4) (b)which appears in paragraph 10 of the Committee&apos;s Report is not an accurateone. The Section requires the Authority to ensure that programmes maintain a proper balance &quot; having regard both to the programmes as a whole andalso to the days of the week in which, and the times of the days at which,the programmes are broadcast&quot;. It is reasonable therefore for the Authorityto have regard to the differing programme requirements of particular days and times, and to decide for example that there are some times of the day and of the week when a concentration of information and education is more appropriate and some when it is less.17.   Programme Planning board the Authority&apos;s views are set out in Section II.18.   Section 3 of the Television act the Committee recommends that Section 3 be re-examined so as toenable the Authority to relax its control in the area of public policy and social issues. The evidence which the Committee quotes on this pointreferred specifically to permissiveness in writing for drama: the witnessremarked that &quot; As the world gets more permissive, so the writers expect
more licence. The BBC allows writers more licence than the ITA.&quot; TheAuthority does not believe that in this respect, which refers to Section3 (1) (a), the Act requires modification; as for Section 3 (1) (e), which is themain topic of the Committee&apos;s concern, but on which it does not quote any evidence, the Authority doubts whether its effects are now as restrictive asthe Committee suggests. It has been remarked by critics in the past year, inrelation to a number of programmes, that ITV is allowed a healthy freedom to comment within its general framework of impartiality.19. Change in Television Act to enable the Authority to provideexperimental programmesThis is discussed in Section II. The Authority would not itself wish topress for such a change.20, 21, 22, 23.   AdvertisingThe Authority&apos;s views are given in Section IV.24.   Trades unions is a regular series of consultations between the Authority and the FBUhas been arranged, and the first meeting had taken place before theCommittee reported.25.   A consumer organisation for all communication mediaIn stating a case for a consumer organisation dealing with allcommunication media, the Committee remarks that the need for a bodyof that type was recognised by the Beveridge Committee in 1949. this does not appear to be a correct representation of that Committee&apos;s views.The Beveridge Committee proposed a Quinquennial Review of the BBCby &quot;a small independent Committee&quot;, but made no proposal for any body on the lines suggested by the Select Committee. It saw it as being, in thecase of the BBC, the task of the Governors to keep the Corporation intouch with public opinion and subject to external criticism: it made proposals on ways in which public representation might be strengthened,but it specifically rejected the idea that the machinery for it should beoutside the Corporation or that any Committee or Council independent ofthe Corporation should be responsible for it.The case for a consumer organisation in broadcasdng was also considered by the Pilkington Committee. It concluded that the case against such a body was compelling.The Authority agrees with the views of the Beveridge and PilkingtonCommittees on this. It acknowledges, however, the concern that has ledto the proposal once again being raised, and the need for its own machineryfor self-criticism to be seen to be working efficiently. The Authority willlook at this point in conjunction with what the Select Committee says aboutthe composition and functions of the General Advisory Council, afterinviting the members of the Council themselves to discuss the matter.

26.  Public accountabilityAs stated in Section V, the Authority recognises a general need for* more information about its policies and planning to be made available andto be brought more clearly to public attention.Particular points on which the Committee comments:(a) Canadian Radio Television commission the Committee makes several comparisons between the authority and the Canadian Radio Television Commission, with the suggestionthat the Authority should adopt some of the Commission^ practices.As will be clear from the Committee&apos;s own Report, there are significantdifferences between the roles of the two bodies (and some of therecommendations that the Committee makes would, if put into effect,make the differences still greater). Quite apart therefore from views thatmay be held on the rival merits of ITV programmes compared withthose of Canadian Television, it does not follow that the practices ofone body are necessarily appropriate for adoption by the other. TheAuthority will, however, make further studies, to supplement theknowledge it already has at first hand of the position in the USAand Canada, and in other countries not visited by the Committee,to see if there are relevant lessons to be learnt.(b) Public hearingsWhile not recommending that the Authority should itself hold publichearings when inviting applications for contracts, the Committeeindicates that it is favourably inclined towards this being done, and itrecommends that the Authority should study the CRTC practice. TheAuthority&apos;s own study to date of Canada, Australia and New Zealandleaves it doubtful whether the practices there are a desirable model.The public nature of the hearings may turn the proceedings into a quasi-judicial affair, with counsel representing the applicants, each having theopportunity to cross-examine each other, and each having the opportunityto appeal to a higher authority after the licensing body announces thedecision it has reached in private session. Apart from causing theproceedings to become legalistic in nature, public hearings would also, inthe Authority&apos;s view, inhibit applicants with connexions with existing organisations from coming forward, and inhibit also the eliciting ofinformation that is needed for decisions to be made on the award of contracts. Public hearings would do nothing to lessen the uncertaintythat at present faces all applicants, and would in fact prolong it.The Authority agrees, however, that information should be givenabout the contracts that are awarded, and it is on this basis of &quot; treatiesprivately negotiated but publicly announced &quot; that the arrangements forthe award of Independent Local Radio contracts will be based. Theprocedure laid down in the Sound Broadcasting Act stems from theAuthority&apos;s own views.27.  The fourth channelThe Authority regards it as its duty to press for the adoption of any measure that it considers would lead to an improvement in the independent television service. It therefore wishes to see implemented the proposal itput forward in its submission ITV 2 for the use of the fourth channel.

A careful reading of the NBPI Report and of the Authority&apos;s ITV2submission suggests certain inaccuracies in paragraphs 100-101 of theCommittee&apos;s Report. But these do not affect the general view of theCommittee, which the Authority readily accepts, that all proposals for theuse of the fourth channel should be given a fair hearing.28, 29, 30. These recommendations are most specifically addressed to theMinister, and the Authority offers no comment on them.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3137626  Dd. 141180  K      1/73SBN  S3  BBS   B
ANNEX BSECOND REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONALISEDINDUSTRIESSummary of Recommendations(1)        The /Independent Broadcasting/ Authority should give considerationto the strengthening of the effectiveness of its senior staff to deal withprogramme output and perhaps implement now what it proposed, should second independent television channel be created; namely the appointmentof two programme planners /see also Recommendation (17^/,(?)        Regional Officers should be appointed on the basis of one for eachprogramme company, their role to be strengthened and their existence made known to the public in each area,(3) The Authority, to further its task of ensuring a programme outputof high quality, should make arrangements for experimental and develop-ment work in the field of programme production,(4)        When the future of broadcasting after 1976 is examined, considera-tion should be given to the advantages and disadvantages of placingtransmitting and planning functions under the Authority,(5)        The Minister should include the proposal of some form of rollingccntraet in preference to the existing fixed system in his consideration ofthe future of independent television in tha years after 1976;  considerationalso being given to allowing new blood to compete periodically for contracts.(6)        Should another management or financial crisis arise, as in the caseof London Weekend Television, the Authority should be more adequatelyequipped to handle it by making provision for a temporary service to be operated under its direct supervision.(7)        The criteria for determining the rental should be more preciselyand publicly defined by the Authority.(8)        Consideration should be given to the stimulation of programmes ofmerit and the encouragement of their creation, in particular by smallregional companies, by the use of the Authorityrs reserve funds to providedevelopmental subsidies,(9)        Future adjustments to the levy should be made in the light of more detailed inspection of the costs incurred in making particular types of programmes, especially those not likely to attract large audiences.(10)      The major, like the smaller, companiiss should be asked by theAuthority to produce programmes of local interest.1
(?J)       Guaranteed networking of programmes should be made available tothe regional companies during prime viewing time,(12)      The regional companies, once they have shown competence, ought,like the major companies, to have their network times guaranteed on thebasis of plans alone and not on the basis of finished products.(13)       Liaison between a major and a regional company should beestablished so that production facilities and equipment might be afforded by the larger to the smaller companies.(14)       The Authority should re-examine and strengthen its research onprogramme content and on identifying present and future needs of audiences.(15)       The Authority should take steps to implement more fully than now the requirements of Section l(4)(b) of the Act with regard to balance of programmes by days and time of day,(16)       The Authority should adopt a more positive role to secure balancedprogramme output at prime viewing time and at weekends.(17)       The Authority should now take steps to set up a body on the lines ofthe Programme Planning Board proposed in its submission to the Ministerputting forward proposals for an ITV2.(18)       Section 3 of the Act should be re-examined and, if need be, modified to enable the Authority to relax its control somewhat in the area of public policy and social issues to ensure that while balance is preserved overall,a greater freedom to experiment is afforded to the broadcaster,,(19)      To secure wider showing of programmes of merit, the authority should sponsor, or be capable of providing, experimental programmes forthv5 network in addition to those of an educational nature.    The terms of theAct should be reviewed to make this possible.(20)      The provisions of the Act concerning natural breaks should be morestrictly observed,(21)      Provision should be made to show, in prime viewing time, certain types of announcements about health and safety measures.    The authority should consult the Central Office of Information as to the best means of achieving this,(22)      The Authority should institute discussion programmes, for theservice as a whole, to examine the claims of advertisers&apos; products andto report the results of tests and should consider whether it might enableconsumer associations, which test products., to be given time on the air to answer the claims of advertisers.
(23) The Authority should consider &quot;bunching&quot; and other ways of spacingadvertisements, so as to reduce the pressure for maximal audiences,(24)      Formalised procedures should be instituted whereby representativesof unions drawing their membership from the industry are able collectivelyto discuss with the Authority professional matters involving all relevantaspects of the quality of independent television programmes,(25)      The need for a consumer organisation, established by statute, forall communication media should be included in the Minister1 s deliberationson the future of television after 1976.(26)      The Authority should study the methods of greater publicaccountability adopted by other countries, notably Canada, including their method of holding public hearings when inviting application for or when renewing contracts.    The Authority should also providesufficiently precise information to permit the public to examine the criteria on which decisions are based on such matters as the particularregional structure chosen and the rentals charged.    Prior to major policy decisions, the Authority should publish proposals and invite public debate.(27)      No decision should be taken on allocating the Fourth Channel except as part of a general review embracing the broadcasting needs of thecountry.(28)      The Minister should consider the advisability of broadeningthe membership of the Authority,(29)      The Minister should set up a full-ranging inquiry at the earliest opportunity to consider broadcasting after 1976.    This inquiry should consider not only the BBC and the Authority, but also take into accountnewer technological developments,,    Such an inquiry should study thesystem of other countries and commission studies of the long-term social,cultural, 5Goaomics political and toahnical implications of alternativesystems and invite public debate to consider the options open.    Thereshould, thereafter, be periodic and systematic reviews of the operationof the chosen structure and of the new technological developments whichare introduced.(30)      In considering the structure of broadcasting after 1976, the systemsadopted by various European countries should be explored, with the objectnot of eliminating advertising as a source of broadcast&amp;ig revenue but of ensuring that its effect on programme content be less than at present wherethe sale of advertising time and the planning and production are in thesame hands.24 January 1973
