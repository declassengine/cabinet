UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY SS government cp(73) 1 COPY NO        I 912 January 1973CABINETPRICES AND PAY - THE NEXT PHASE:  DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to have before them at the meeting of the Cabineton Monday, 15 January, the latest draft, attached (with a copy of the draftCounter-Inflation Bill), of the White Paper to be published on Wednesday.17 January,    An oral report will be made to the Cabinet at this meeting inthe light of the consideration of the draft which will meantime continue,particularly the section dealing with rents and pay.A treasury Chambers12 January 1973
DRAFT WHITE PAPER/TITLE/1 .     In the tripartite discussions last year the Government, theTUG and the OBI agreed on three objectives:   to maintain a high rateof growth and to improve real incomes;    to improve the position ofthe low paid and pensioners;   and to moderate the rate of costand price inflation.     On 6 November 1972 the Prime Ministerannounced that it had however not proved possible to reach agreement on the means of achieving these aims.     The Government now had no alternative but to bring in statutory measures.     There would be atemporary standstill during which the Government would work out proposals designed to secure the objectives.2.     The Government now announce the next stage of their programme.This White Paper describes the policy to be pursued and the newlegislative framework which will supersede the Counter Inflation(Temporary Provisions) Act 1972.     A draft Bill is published in acompanion White Paper (Cmnd. 5206).3.     The Government commend these proposals to Parliament and tothe nation because they are essential if the higher rate of economic growth which is being achieved is to be sustained.     Inflation isthe biggest single threat to our prosperity and to the improvementof our standard of living.     By making our products less competitivein home and overseas markets and by impairing confidence in our ability to   maintain growth, it endangers employment and investment.1
It also damages industrial relations and is socially unjust.k.     Inflation is a world wide problem.   Many countries have sharedin the recent sharp acceleration in the rates of price and payinflation.   We must plan on the basis that the fight against inflation will continue for a long time to come.   That is why theGovernment&apos;s proposals include some continuing machinery fortackling inflation.   But these proposals are fully consistent withprogress towards voluntary arrangements.5.     The Government acknowledge the cooperation and understandingshown by all sections of the community in the operation of the standstill.   In the next stage the Government v/ill continue to rely on voluntary cooperation to the maximum extent possible.They believe that cooperative arrangements to check inflation arethe best way to proceed, and this White Paper explains how theGovernments proposals leave the way open for agreed voluntary arrangements in the future.   But meanwhile responsibility forcombating inflation and safeguarding the higher rate of economic growth in the interests of the whole community rests with theGovernment.6.     The draft Bill provides for the establishment of two newagencies: a Price Commission and a Pay Board.   It also gives tothe Government and the agencies for a 3 year period powers toregulate prices, pay, dividends [and rentsj.   It is intended thatall concerned with prices and pay should observe the relevantpolicies outlined in the next section of this White Paper, and in2----       &apos; a   t?  n  -n        m
the Appendix.   The Government will embody these policies in a codefor determining prices and pay, which will be laid before parliament in a statutory instrument and will, on approval, be applied by the agencies.   Ministers will ensure that the agencies receive on a selective basis the necessary information about price and pay increases to enable them to apply the code to particular cases.   They will thusplay a key role in implementing the policy within the code and willhave powers to enforce their decisions.   The Bill will also give special powers to Ministers to ensure that prices reflect fairly theeffects of the replacement of purchase tax and selective employment tax by value added tax.7.     To allow Parliament adequate time to consider the Bill and toavoid a gap between the expiry of the powers under the CounterInflation (Temporary Provisions) Act and the date when the powers under the new Bill become operative, the Government will ask parliament to approve an Order-in-Council for a 60 day extension ofthe Act.   The legislative proposals are described more fully later in the White Paper.   The next section sets out the policies.THE POLICIES8.     The Government&apos;s policies are directed to attacking the rise inprices. A large part of price increases stems from domestic causes which we can influenee or control, especially pay and otherincreases.   However some causes of price increases are outside thecontrol or influence of the United Kingdom.   Ve are heavy imporbersof food and raw materials.   The prices of these fluctuate on worldSECRET3
markets and in recent months many of them (eg meat, grain, wooland metals) have risen sharply.   More broadly, the prices of nearly all our imports are affected by inflation in other countries andby rising demand as a result of higher living standards throughoutthe world.   For example, there have been increases in the cost ofmany imported components and semi-manufactures for industry.    Someprices will be affected gradually over the next few years by our obligations to the European Community.   We can as a communityprotect some of our more vulnerable members against these increases.The Government are pledged to protect retirement pensioners by maintaining the purchasing power of their pensions and giving thema share in the nation&apos;s increasing prosperity when pensions arenext uprated.   This White Paper contains proposals designed to give special help to the low paid.   But increases in import costs are a charge   on the living standards of all of us which, as a nation, wecannot avoid.9.     Nevertheless the Government are determined to press home the attack on the domestic causes of rising prices.   In working outthe policies to achieve this described in the next paragraphs, theGovernment have therefore had in mind three objectives:   to steadyprices, to be fair, and to sustain a faster rate of economic growth.   And in considering methods for implementing the policiesthey have looked for those which are as straightforward as possible,require the minimum of complex administration and allow flexibility in operation to meet differing circumstances.
S E C E 23 TCONTROL OP PRICKS10.   The Government intend to exercise firm control over prices.Manufacturers will not be permitted to increase their pricesexcept to the extent that they have to meet unavoidable cost increases.    The extent to which these can be passed on in increased prices will be prescribed in the code of rules which the price commission applies.   For this piirpose allowable costs will be strictly defined and there will, for example, be a reduction in them to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are used to keep prices down.   Pay increases which do not comply withthe policy will not be allowable.   There will thus be no Questionof passing on all cost increases automatically as price increases.Manufacturers will also be required to reduce their prices if costreductions occur.Limit on profit margins11.   These requirements will be backed by a limitation on profit margins on sales in the home market; net profit margins as a percentage of sales will not be allowed to exceed the average levelin the best two of the previous five years.   If the limit isexceeded, price reductions will be enforced.Prior notification12.   Large firms will be required to seek prior approval for price increases for manufactured goods.   This requirement may also beapplied to other firms v/ith a substantial share of the market forcertain important products.    Smaller firms not required to seekprior approval for price increases may be required to proviceregular information enabling the Price Commission to monitor tUeirprices effectively.
Distributive Trades13.   Distributors1 gross percentage margins will be held at theirpresent levels and this control will be backed by a limitation of profit margins comparable to that applied to manufacturers.   Thiswill limit gross margins where the distributors purchase pricerises sharply.    It is the Governments intention to ensure thatthe restraint exercised over manufacturers&apos; prices is fullyreflected at the retail level;   and that where unavoidable increasesoccur in the price of fresh foods and imported products, the resultant retail increases are no more than is strictly justified.1^-.   Further information on how price control will operate formanufacturers and distributors and for other indixstries and services is set out in the Appendix.    In devising all these arrangements it will be the Governments aim, with the cooperationof the firms concerned, to minimise interference with normalbusiness activities.    The Government will consult those concerned about further developments of the policy.Transition to Value Added Tax15.    Special arrangements will be made to ensure that when vatreplaces purchase tax and selective employment tax on 1 April,price increases are no larger than is justified and that where thereis a net reduction in the tax burden the full benefit is passed onto the public.    Information will be given to the public and guidancewill be issued to traders on the price movements which will properlyreflect the tax changes.   The Government will seek to work out ayoluifery agreement with manufacturers and retailors under v/hi6secret&apos;
would undertake that their price changes arising from the transition would be consistent with this guidance.   However theGovernment propose to take the necessary powers in the Bill toensure that the consumer is treated fairly in the tax change.Statutory price fixin Joodies16. Prices determined by bodies such as the Traffic commissioners and the Civil Aviation Authority will be subject to the policy andarrangements will be made for these bodies to apply the code.7
SECRETNationalised Industry and other Public Sector /prices3.7.   In general, the Government propose that the prices of the nationalised industries should be subject to regulation on thesame principles as apply in the private sector, and they will be within the scope of the Price Commission, just as pay in theindustries will be within the scope of the Pay Board.   This means that nationalised industry export prices will not be subject tocontrol.   The charges for international air travel and for certainair navigation and landing services, and British Rail-charges for international traffic, will also be outside the control.   prices for coal and steel are subject to our obligations as members ofthe European Coal and Steel Community.18.   In the interests of price restraint the nationalised industries, with full Government approval, have held down their prices during the past eighteen months at very heavy cost.    Theeffect of the policy for the next stage described above will bethat the industries will be permitted to increase their pricesonly on the same strict criteria as private sector undertakings and the code of rules governing consents by the Price commission will be framed accordingly.   Those in deficit will not for the timebeing be permitted to increase prices in order to reduce thepresent levels of. deficit, but the Price Commission will not under its rules withhold increases which it would allow to a privateundertaking facing similar cost increases.8
S E G R ST19,   Where Government Departments are regularly engaged in trading operations on a substantial scale, proposals to increase their prices will be referred for advice to the Price Commission whichwill be asked to apply the same principles in examining them as to nationalised industry prices.   /The trading services of localauthorities and similar public bodies will also be within the scopeof the policy and the code will apply to them,./School Meals20,   The Government have decided that the increase in the schoolmeal charge from 12p to 14p from 1 April 1973 announced in cmnd. 4515 will be deferred for the time being.9
RENTS21 Nearly all house rents are already regulated by law. In theGovernments view, the policy embodied in the Housing Finance act of fair rents, coupled with a comprehensive system of rebates and allowances, is the right one.THEN: A[Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the next stage of the counter-inflation programme, the Government have decided to slowup for the time being the progress towards fair rents.   they propose first, that the increases in local authority rents due in1973/7^ under the Housing Finance Act and the correspondingScottish Act should be reduced from an average of 50p to an averageof 25p a week.    In the private sector powers under the new bill will be used to phase increases when fair rents are registered for existing regulated tenancies and where the resultant increase ismore than 30p a week.    In addition, the Government propose, as aspecial step to help the low paid and other tenants who need helpmost, to increase by  2.50 the needs allowance which is used to calculate rent rebates and allowances.   The effect v/ill be that many council and private tenants will pay little or nothing of anyrent increase even if their income increases significantly, and substantial numbers v/ill pay less than now.] [The Bill will alsocontain powers to limit increases in commercial and agriculturalrents]OR: B[This Act.; and the corresponding Scottish Act, have recently bea&quot;ooroved bv parliament,   ^he Gov^r^m^rt&apos; s &quot;Do^policy o^ rents durj n^rnext stage v/ill therefore be to rely on the Housing Act provisions for phasing towards fair rents and stabilising rents at the fair.10SECRET
rent level.   But in order to assist lower paid tenants theGovernment will increase by  2.50 the needs allowance which is used to calculate rent rebates or allowances.   As a result thoscouncil and private tenants who cannot afford the full rent oftheir dwelling will have to pay little or nothing of any rent increase even if their income increases significantly, and manysuch tenants will pay less than now.]11
S E C R E TPAY  &apos;22.   Pay is the largest single element in those costs which are under our own control or influence and which are reflected inprices.   There is no prospect of achieving a reduction in therate of price inflation unless increases in pay are brought wellbelow the levels reached immediately before the standstill whenincreases in both wage rates and earnings were running at 15-&quot;16per cent above&apos;a year before.   Por some time to come these pre-standstill increases will continue to give rise to price increases*Bat over a period the rate of pay increases must be brought morenearly in line with the growth of output available to support them, so as to reduce price inflation progressively and improve the prospects of a sustained faster growth in real earnings.   TheGovernment intend therefore that the rate of pay increases shouldbe brought down steadily but substantially over the next 12 months?The pay limit23.   The policy for the next stage from now until the autumn of1973 is as follows.   Negotiations may take place within a limit of an addition to the annual pay bill for the group of employees concerned of [h%] plus  1 a week for each employee.   This is an addition for the period of 12 months beginning with the normaloperative date of the group concerned, ana relates to pay exclusive of overtime.   Further particulars are given in the Appendix.s. e c r :-: t        ii
2V.   In the Governments view the increase in the national paybill which this limit is likely to produce (including increasedearnings from overtime etc) is the maximum consistent, as a first step, with securing a significant reduction in the inflationaryimpact of pay on prices.    The limit is deliberately expressed asan addition to the pay bill for the group of employees concerned,and thus leaves scope for negotiation and for flexibility inapplication to the circumstances of the particular workers.The Low-paid25.   The form in which the pay limit is expressed is howeverdesigned to favour low paid workers, by giving them a better dealthan a single percentage limit.   The Government attach importanceto this and they trust that negotiators will have full regard toit.   Certain other aspects of the policy will particularly benefit the lower paid.   Where women&apos;s rates are still less than men&apos;s,negotiators will be free to decide on increases above the pay limit which would reduce the differential by one third by the end of 1973Any improvement beyond that will have to be met within the limit.The Government also propose to pursue in consultation with the TUGand CBI proposals worked out in the tripartite talks whichenvisaged the establishment of a board with the task of helping toimprove the capacity of industry to raise relative pay levels forthe lower paid.   Finally, in consulting industry on certain aspectsof the guidelines referred to in the   Appendix, the Government willparticularly wish to discuss the question of threshold agreements,which cou3.d be of special importance in protecting the living standards of How paid workers.13   &apos;S E C R E T
SB COT/Settlements made before the Standstill or deferred by the Standstill26 &amp; 27/14
S; E C R E TAnnual Settlements28,   It will be an important requirement of the policy that pay increases should not operate sooner than twelve months after the operative date of the last increase of the group concerned.Scope of the pay policy29.   The limits on pay increases apply to all wages and salariesfrom shop floor to board room level, and to virtually allimprovements in terms and conditions of employment, fringebenefits etc.    The coverage is the same as that in paragraphs 10to 12 of Cmnd. 5125* but further details are set out in the AppenThe limits apply also to the fees and charges of self-employed persons.Subsequent   stage of the policy30.   The pay limit described above will operate until the autumn.Thereafter a lower rate of pay increase more nearly in line with national growth should apply so that the attack on priceinflation can be carried a stage further, but the Government willtake account of other factors in coming to a decision on this,including the progress already made in reducing the rate of increase of prices.   Moreover, the Government look forward to full consultation with both sides of industry on that further-stage of the policy during 19735.
DIVIDENDS31.   The Government propose to continue the control of dividends in the next stage of the policy.    The present control by reference to the corresponding dividend a year earlier id 11continue until the end of the extended standstill.   Thereaftersdividends declared for a company&apos;s account year will not be permitted to bring the total declarations for that year to morethan JJf J above the amount declared for the company&apos;s precedingaccount year.   Further details are set out in the Appendix.1.6
/PROPERTY SPECULATION31a. The Government intend to create a situation in whichunjustifiable gains cannot be made from property speculationwhich exploits temporary local shortages.   Further measures will be taken to increase land availability.    The Governmentare prepared to legislate to deal with the unacceptablesituation in which office premises continue to remainunoccupied at a time of increasing demand for office space//17SECRET
III   THE LEGISLATION .  &apos;32.   The draft Bill published in Cmnd 5206  contains three main elements:(i)     provision for the establishment of a Price Commissionand a Pay Board, for their procedures and functions andfor the issue to them by Ministers of a code of rules governing prices and pay, which would be embodied ina statutory instrument and to which they will berequired to have regard in carrying out their functionsThese sections of the Bill will come into effect whenthe Bill receives the Royal Assent.    They will enablethe agencies to implement a statutory policy whenstatutor3r powers of control are in force, and also to operate under a voluntary policy.(ii)     provisions which will enable Ministers and the agencies to control prices, pay, dividends /and rents/while they are in force.    These provisions will comeinto force when the order embodying the code of rules for the agencies is made.    These powers will thenrun for 3 years, after which they could be extended for further periods of twelve months, but only afteraffirmative resolutions of Parliament,(iii)     a special power available from the date on which theBill becomes law   until 30 June 1973   to cc ntr-cl.18
S 33 C R E Tprices in the period of transition from purchase tax and selective employment tax to value added tax, soas to ensure that they properly reflect the tax changes the Government hope that this power will beavailable by 1 April, when value added tax firstapplies.33,   The first purpose of the Bill is thus to give the Governmentthe powers for a sustained attack on inflation, beginning witha period during which the tise of statutory powers   is unavoidable.   But it is also a flexible instrument capable ofaccomodating a wide range of policies including an entire^voluntary approach.    In particular, the Price Commission and pay Board could play an important part in policies of voluntaryrestraint of different kinds, as well as under a range of policies backed by statutory controls.Guidance to the agencies and activities of controls34.   The Bill requires Ministers to prepare a code of rules to guide agencies in dealing with price and pay questions which cometo them under the control powers, or are referred to them by ministers.    This code requires approval by affirmative resolutions of each House of Parliament.   Subsequent amendments of the codewould require similar approval.   The Bill also provides that ministers shall consult   consumers, employees and employers andother bodies which they consider appropriate19S ORET
before making the order embodying the code, or subsequentamending orders.    The code represents both terms of reference forthe agencies and a statement of the policies which the Governmentasks those determining prices and pay to observe and which the.agencies are required to use the control powers to enforce.35.   The Bill also requires Ministers to ensure that the agencieshave the prior notifications of.proposed increases in prices and pay which they need to implement the policy.   Ministers areempowered to reqiiire firms and employers to notify proposed increases and it is intended to use this power selectively tocover the more important prices and pay settlements.36.   The Government propose to establish the agencies very soon after the Bill becomes law.   However, the new control powers will not be available until the order containing the code for the agencies has been made.    The Counter Inflation (temporary provisions) Act will cease to have effect as soon as the newcontroD. powers become available.Role of the Agencies when controls are in operation-37.   When the statutory powers are in operation the agencies willhave a very important executive role, and can also have an advisory one.    The consent of the relevant agency   will have to...&quot;be obtained before prices or pay   can   be increased, by firms20
SEC It lii Tand employers required to give prior notification.    The agencieswill receive direct any application which the policy requiresand will he free to approve or reject pay or price increases inaccordance with the code.   Ministers (but not the agencies)would be free to make exceptions not contemplated in theguidelines, but only where very special circumstances justifiedthis. : -38.   The powers to control dividends /and rents7   rim for thesame period as the powers to control prices and pay, but the bill provides in these cases for control by Ministers.     In the caseof dividends however it would be possible for Ministers totransfer to one of the agencies the day to day administration ofthe control.39.   Offences under the Bill include the contravention of a notice or order forbidding an increase, or part of it, issuedby an agency of by a Minister;    striking or threatening to do soto force an employer to contravene a notice or order;    refusing to supply information or supplying false information.    All theseoffences are punishable by fines.21cj p r* p v niO   J.J        IV X&apos;i   j.
