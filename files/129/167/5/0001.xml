THE PROGRAMME FOR CONTROLLING INFLATION tTHE SECOND STAGE1. in the tripartite discussions last year the Government, the TUC andthe CBI agreed on three objectives: to maintain a high rate of growth andto improve real incomes ; to improve the position of the low paid andpensioners ; and to moderate the rate of cost and price inflation. On 6thNovember 1972 the Prime Minister announced that it had not proved possible to reach agreement on the means of achieving these aims. TheGovernment had no alternative but to bring in statutory measures. Therewould be a temporary standstill during which the Government would workout proposals designed to secure the objectives.2. The Government now announce the next stage of their programme.This White Paper describes the policy to be pursued and the new legislativeframework which will supersede the Counter Inflation (Temporary Provisions)Act 1972. A draft Bill is published in a companion White Paper(Cmnd. 5206).3. The Government commend these proposals to Parliament and to thenation because they are essential if we are to sustain the higher rate ofeconomic growth which is now being achieved and which is the only basis for increasing our prosperity. Inflation is the biggest single threat to thatprosperity and to the improvement of our standard of living. By makingour products less competitive in home and overseas markets and by impairingconfidence in our ability to maintain growth, it threatens the value of ourourrency and endangers jobs, as well as investment which can create morejobs. It also damages industrial relations and is socially unjust.4. Inflation is a world wide problem. Many countries have shared in therecent sharp acceleration in the rates of price and pay inflation. We mustplan on the basis that the fight against inflation will continue for a longtime to come. That is why the Government^ proposals include continuingmachinery by which inflation can be tackled. This machinery could alsobe used under voluntary arrangements when they can be agreed.5. The Government acknowledge the co-operation and understandingshown by all sections of the community in the operation of the standstill.In the next stage the Government will continue to rely on voluntary-operation to the maximum extent possible. They believe that co-operativearrangements to check inflation are the best way to proceed, and this white paper explains how the Governmenfs proposals leave the way open foragreed voluntary arrangements in the future. But meanwhile responsibilityfor combating inflation and safeguarding the higher rate of economic growth in the interests of the whole community rests with the Government.6. The draft Bill provides for the establishment of two new agencies: aPrice Commission and a Pay Board. It also gives to the Government andthe agencies for a 3-year period powers to regulate prices, pay, dividendsand rents.   It is intended that all concerned with prices and pay should
observe the relevant policies outlined in the next section of this White Paper,and in the Appendix. The Government will embody these policies in a code for determining prices and pay, which will be laid before parliament for approval in a statutory instrument. It will then be applied by the agencies. Ministers will ensure that the agencies receive from firms and employers the necessary information about price and pay increases to enablethem to apply the Price and Pay Code to particular cases. They will thusplay a key role in implementing the policy within the Code and their decisions will be binding under the law. The Bill will also give special powers to Ministers to ensure that prices reflect fairly the effects of theabolition of purchase tax and selective employment tax and the introductionof value added tax.7. The legislative proposals are described more fully later in the white paper. To allow Parliament adequate time to consider the Bill and toavoid a gap between the expiry of the powers under the Counter Inflation(Temporary Provisions) Act and the date when the powers under the newBill become operative, the Government will ask Parliament to approve anOrder in Council for a 60-day extension of the Act. However, provided thenew Bill is enacted by 31st March, the standstill on pay will come to an endon that date and the pay policy described in this White Paper will then bebrought into operation. Because of the need for special care about pricemovements in the period following the introduction of VAT, the standstillarrangements for prices will continue until the end of April. Thereafter thenew policy for prices described in the White Paper will apply.The Policies8. The Governments policies are directed to attacking the rise in prices.A large number of price increases stem from domestic causes which we caninfluence or control, especially pay and other increases in incomes. Howeversome causes of price increases are outside the control or influence of theUnited Kingdom. We are heavy importers of food and raw materials.The prices of these fluctuate on world markets and in recent months manyof them (eg meat, grain, wool and metals) have risen sharply. Morebroadly, the prices of nearly all our imports are affected by inflation inother countries and by rising demand as a result of higher living standardsthroughout the world. For example, there have been increases in the costof many imported components and semi-manufactures for industry. Someprices will be affected gradually over the next few years by our obligations to the European Community. We can as a nation protect some of ourmore vulnerable members against these increases. The Government arepledged to protect retirement pensioners by maintaining the purchasingpower of their pensions and giving them a share in the nation&apos;s increasingprosperity when pensions are again increased next autumn. This white paper contains proposals designed to give special help to the low paid.But increases in import costs are a charge on the living standards of all of us which, as a community, we cannot avoid.9. While therefore some increases are beyond our control, the Governmentare determined to press home the attack on the domestic causes of rising prices. In working out the policies to achieve this described in the nextparagraphs, the Government have therefore had in mind three objectives:
to steady prices, to be fair, and to sustain a faster rate of economic growth.And in considering methods for implementing the policies they have looked for those which are as straightforward as possible, require the minimum ofadministration and allow flexibility in operation to meet differingcircumstances.CONTROL OF PRICESManufacturers&apos; prices10. The Government intend to ensure that prices are firmly controlled and to reinforce the effects of competition in doing so. Manufacturers willnot be permitted to increase their prices except to the extent that they haveto meet unavoidable cost increases. The extent to which these can be passed on in increased paces will be prescribed in the Price and Pay Code. Forthis purpose allowable costs will be strictly defined and there will, forexample, be a reduotion in them to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are used to keep prices down. Pay increases which do notcomply with the policy will not be an allowable cost. There will thus beno question of passing on all cost increases automatically as price increases.Manufacturers will also be required to reduce their prices if cost reductionsoccur.Limit on profit margins11. These requirements will be backed by a limitation on profit marginson sales in the home market; net profit margins as a percentage of saleswill not be allowed to exceed the average level in the best two of the previousfive years.  If the limit is exceeded price reductions will be required.Prior approval12. Large firms will be required to seek prior approval for price increases for manufactured goods. This requirement may also be applied to other firms with a substantial share of the market for certain important products.Smaller firms not required to seek prior approval for price increases maybe required to provide regular information enabling the Price Commissionto monitor their prices effectively.Wholesale and Retail Prices13. In operating the price control, the gross percentage margins ofdistributors (that is, wholesalers and retailers) will be held at the level of a recent base period. This control will be backed by a limitation of profit margins (average of the best two of the previous five years) comparable to that applied to manufacturers. The effect will be to limit gross marginswhere the distributors purchase prices rise sharply. The Government intend to ensure by these requirements that the control exercised over manufac-turers&apos; prices is fully reflected at the retail level. It would also be wrong to allow extra profits to be made as a result of increases in world pricesof food and other products by those trading in them. Where thereforesupply prices rise steeply eg because of large rises in world prices, it maybe necessary to make further special arrangements to limit margins.14. Further information on how price control will operate for manu-facturers and distributors and for other industries and services is given in
the Appendix. In devising all these arrangements it will be the Govern-menfs aim to minimise the extra administrative requirement on the businesssector. The Government will continue to consult about further developments of the policy.Transition to Value Added Tax15. Special arrangements will be made to ensure that when VAT replacespurchase tax and selective employment tax on 1 April, the full benefitof any net reduction in tax is passed on to the public, and any price increases are no larger than is justified by the tax change. The Government therefore propose to take the necessary powers in the Bill to ensure that the consumeris treated fairly in the tax change.Statutory price fixing bodies16. Prices determined by bodies such as the Traffic Commissioners andthe Civil Aviation Authority will be subject to the policy and arrangements will be made for these bodies to apply the Code.Prices of Nationalised Industries and other public sector trading services17. The prices of the nationalised industries will in general be subject toregulation on the same principles as apply in the private sector. They willbe within the scope of the Price Commission, just as pay in the industries will be within the scope of the Pay Board. Nationalised industry export prices, like those of the private sector, will not be subject to control. Thecharges for international air travel and for certain air navigation and landingservices, and British Rail charges for international traffic, will also be outsidethe control. Prices for coal and steel are subject to our obligations as members of the European Coal and Steel Community.18. In the interests of price restraint the nationalised industries, with fullGovernment approval, have held down their prices during the past eighteen months at very heavy cost to the taxpayer. The effect of the policy for thenext stage will be that the industries will be permitted to increase prices towhich the policy applies only on the same strict criteria as private sectorundertakings. The Price and Pay Code which will govern consents by thePrice Commission will be framed accordingly. The Code will not howeverfor the time being permit the nationalised industries concerned to increase prices by more than their cost increases in order to reduce their deficits.Subject to that, the Price Commission will not under the Code withholdincreases which it would allow to a private undertaking facing similar cost increases.19. Where Government Departments are engaged in substantial trading operations, proposals to increase prices will be referred for advice to thePrice Commission. They will be asked to apply the same principles in examining them as to nationalised industry prices. The trading services oflocal authorities and similar public bodies will be within the scope of thepolicy and the Code will apply to them.School Meals20. The Government have decided that the increase in the school mealcharge from 12p to 14p from 1 April 1973 announced in Cmnd 4515 will be deferred for the time being.
RENTS, RATES AND LANDHousing21. Nearly all house rents are already regulated by law. In the Govern-menfs view, the policy embodied in the Housing Finance Act of fair rents,coupled with a comprehensive system of rebates and allowances, is the rightone. This Act, and the corresponding Scottish Act, have recently beenapproved by Parliament. The Governments policy on rents during the next stage will therefore be to rely on the Housing Act provisions for phasingincreases towards fair rents and stabilising rents at the fair rent level. Butin order to assist lower paid tenants, the Government will increase by  3.50 theneeds allowance which is used to calculate rent rebates or allowances. Asa result those local authority and private tenants qualifying for rebates orallowances whose income goes up as envisaged in the Governments policieswill generally have to pay no more rent, and many of them will pay less thannow. A married tenant with two children and a weekly income of  35 whois living in a local authority house with an average rent (ie about  3.60)will normally pay no more rent than now.Rates22. The Government recognise that improvements in social services andin the environment, which are in themselves very desirable, involve extra expenditure by local authorities. Rates are however important both in commercial and industrial costs and in household budgets. The Governmenthave therefore substantially increased the Exchequer contribution to the financing of local government expenditure through the rate support grant for1973-74 with the aim of enabling local authorities to keep the average increase in rates down to a level consistent with the need to contain inflation.Because of wide variations in the circumstances of different local authorities,a uniform level of rate demand cannot be expected. The Government intend,however, to establish arrangements to monitor proposed increases in ratesand where rate demands appear to be at an unnecessarily high level theyreserve the right to call in the local authority concerned and require them to reconsider their proposal.Land and Business Rents23. The Government fully recognise the extent to which rising land pricescan contribute to general inflationary pressures. They therefore, intend,before the next stage of the policy comes into operation, to bring forward proposals which will increase the availability of building land and reducethe extent to which it is possible for people to make disproportionately highprofits from transactions in land. They also intend to continue in the next stage of the policy the standstill on business rents. These enter into the costof many goods and services, and unlike housing rents are not subject tocontrol under any permanent legislation. There will be powers in the bill which will enable the Government to continue to control them. consideration will be given during the next stage to longer-term policy for business rents.PAY24. Pay is the largest single element entering into prices which are under our own control or influence.   There is no prospect of achieving
a reduction in the rate of price inflation unless increases in pay are broughtwell below the levels reached immediately before the standstill whenincreases in both wage rates and earnings were running at 15-16 per cent above a year before. For some time to come these pre-standstill increases will continue to give rise to price increases. But the rate of pay increasesmust be brought more nearly in line with the growth of output availableto support them, so as to reduce price inflation progressively and improve the prospects of a sustained faster growth in real earnings.The pay limit25. The next stage of policy will run from the end of the pay standstilluntil the autumn of 1973. During that period, the total of increases in pay for any group of employees (to run for 12 months from the date ofimplementation) should not exceed the sum which would result from thepayment of  1 a week per head plus 4 per cent of the current pay bill forthe group, exclusive of overtime.26. This limit is deliberately expressed as an addition to the pay bill forthe group of employees concerned. It thus leaves scope for negotiation andfor flexibility in application to the circumstances of particular workers andthe amounts that they receive, but the Government believes that the emphasis should be on the lower paid. Within the limit no individual should receive an increase of more than  250 a year. In the Governments view, the increasein the national pay bill which the limit is likely to produce (includingincreased earnings from overtime etc.) is the maximum consistent withsecuring a significant reduction in the inflationary impact of pay on prices.Settlements deferred by the Standstill27. The first 90 days of the statutory period of standstill which parliament has already approved end on 27th February. Once that period is over, theGovernment do not think it right that any pay increase caught by the standstill should be held up for more than 90 days from the normal operative date of the group concerned. From 28th February deferred increases will therefore be permitted to take effect without retrospection 90 days after their normal operative date or on 1st April, if earlier. This is subject to the requirement that that date is not less than 12 months after the previoussettlement. Increases which were agreed on or before 6th November whenthe standstill was announced will be allowed to take effect in full. In allcases negotiated after that date the cost of settlements must be at therate of  1 per week per head plus 4 per cent. If negotiators wish to makea settlement for less than 12 months in order to revert to their normaloperative date, they will be free to do so, provided they keep within that rate.Scope of the Pay Policy28. As during the standstill the policy will apply to all employmentincomes, including income from sel-employment, and to all wages and salariesfrom shop floor to board room level. With a few exceptions referred to inthe Appendix, it will cover improvements in terms and conditions of employ-ment, fringe benefits etc. Further particulars of the pay policy generally aregiven in the Appendix.
The Low-paid29. The form in which the pay limit is expressed is however designedto favour low paid workers for whom it would give a better deal than asingle percentage limit. The Government attach importance to this and they expect negotiators to pay full regard to it.30. Certain other aspects of the policy will particularly benefit the lowerpaid. First where women&apos;s rates are still less than men&apos;s, negotiators willbe free to decide on increases above the pay limit which would reducethe differential by one third by the end of 1973. Secondly, the provision inthe Appendix that certain improvements in hours and holidays may be negotiated outside the pay limit will benefit the low paid. Thirdly, theGovernment also propose to pursue in consultation with the TUC and CBIproposals worked out in the tripartite talks last autumn which envisaged the establishment of a board to help improve the capacity of industry toraise pay levels for the lower paid. The increase in the needs allowance forrent rebates and allowances will greatly assist the low paid Finally, inconsulting industry on the Price and Pay Code the Government will par-ticularly wish to discuss for the subsequent stage of the policy the question ofthreshold agreements, which could be of special importance in protecting the living standards of low paid workers.Subsequent Stage of the Policy31. The policy set out in this White Paper will operate under the prices and Pay Code until the autumn. During this stage the Government will undertake full consultation on the policy for the subsequent period, so thatthe attack on price inflation can be carried further.32. These consultations will cover the level of pay increases which wouldbe appropriate in relation to the movement of prices and the rate of growth of the national economy. The Government^ aim in these consultations willbe to develop a policy which will enable the possibilities of economic growthto be fully realised in terms of the improvement of the real earnings andstandard of living of the community as a whole, while bringing down therate of increase of prices and money incomes.33. As an integral part of these consultations, the Government will seek the help of the Pay Board in its advisory capacity on problems of relativitiesand anomalies both within and between groups of employees. Resolution ofthese problems must occupy an important place in any policy to deal with inflation in the longer-term which is to be effective and seen to be fair. the aim will be to find ways in which, within the overall pay limit for the subsequent stage, progress can be made in dealing with these problems andin encouraging the resumption of longer-term improvements affecting pay,such as productivity and restructuring schemes.DIVIDENDS34. The Government will continue the control of dividends in the next stage of the policy. The present control by reference to the correspondingdividend a year earlier will continue until the end of the standstill on pay.
Thereafter, dividends declared for a company&apos;s account year will not normally be permitted to bring the total declarations for that year to more than 5 percent above the amount declared for the company&apos;s preceding account year.Further details are given in the Appendix.THE LEGISLATION35.  The draft Bill published in Cmnd. 5206 contains three main elements:(i) provision for the establishment of a Price Commission and a pay board and for their procedures and functions, and for a Codegoverning prices and pay to which they will be required to haveregard in carrying out their functions. The Government will berequired to prepare the Code, embody it in a statutory instrumentand submit it for approval to Parliament. These sections of theBill will come into effect when the Bill receives the Royal Assent.(ii) provisions which will enable Ministers and the agencies to controlprices, pay, dividends and rents while they are in force. these provisions will come into force when the order embodying the code of rules for the agencies is made. These powers will then run forthree years, after which they could be extended for further periods of twelve months, but only after affirmative resolutions of Parliament.(iii) a special power available from the date on which the Bill becomeslaw until 30th June, 1973, to control prices when purchase tax and selective employment tax are replaced by value added tax, soas to ensure that they properly reflect the tax changes. The Govern-ment consider that this power will be needed by 1 st April, when the tax change takes effect.36. The first purpose of the Bill is thus to give the Government thepowers for a sustained attack on inflation, beginning with a period duringwhich the use of statutory powers is unavoidable. But it is also a flexibleinstrument capable of accommodating a wide range of policies including an entirely voluntary approach. In particular, the Price Commission and pay Board could play an important part in voluntary policies of different kinds, as well as under a range of policies backed by statutory controls.Price and Pay Code for the Agencies37. The Bill requires the Treasury to prepare a Code under which the agencies will operate in dealing with price, and pay questions which come tothem under the control powers, or are referred to them by Ministers. This coderequires approval by affirmative resolutions of each House of Parliament. Sub-lequent amendments of the code would require similar approval. The Billalso provides for consultation with consumers, employees and employers andother bodies which are considered appropriate before the order embodying the Code, or subsequent amending orders, are made. The Price and pay code represents both terms of reference for the agencies and a statement ofthe policies which the Government expects those concerned with prices and pay to observe.38. The Bill also requires Ministers to ensure that the agencies aregiven those prior notifications of proposed increases in prices and pay which
they need to implement the policy. Ministers are empowered to requirefirms and employers to notify proposed increases and it is intended to use this power selectively to cover the more important prices and pay settlements.39. The Government propose to establish the agencies as soon as possible after the Bill becomes law. However, the new control powers will not beavailable until the order containing the Code for the agencies has beenmade. The Counter Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act will cease to haveeffect as soon as the new control powers become available.Role of the Agencies when controls are in operation40. When the statutory powers are in operation the agencies will havean important executive function, and can also have an advisory one. Theconsent of the relevant agency will have to be obtained before prices orpay can be increased by firms and employers required to give prior notifica-tion. The agencies will receive direct any applications for consent to increases and will be free to approve or reject them in accordance with the Code.Ministers will be able in exceptional circumstances and after consultationwith the agency to approve increases not authorised by the agency.41. The powers to control dividends and rents run for the same period as the powers to control prices and pay, but the Bill provides in these casesfor control by Ministers.42. Offences under the Bill include the contravention of a notice or order forbidding an increase, or part of it, issued by an agency or by a minister ; striking or threatening to do so to force an employer to contravenea notice or order; refusing to supply information or supplying falseinformation.  All these offences are punishable by fines.
APPENDIXSCOPE OF THE POLICYPrices of most manufactured goods and services supplied to the home market will be subject to control. The prices of goods and servicesexported will not be controlled. Other goods and services which will be exempt from control include:Imported productsFresh food and other similar products subject to fluctuations fromexternal or seasonal causesGoods and services whose prices are regulated as a result of inter-national agreements or arrangementsGoods and services sold by auctionSecondhand goods.2. Manufacturing enterprises will not be able to increase prices in the domestic market except to the extent that allowable costs rise. Distributors&apos;gross percentage margins will be held. Within this, there will in certain cases be more detailed scrutiny of margins on individual items where pricesrise substantially, particularly as a result of world price movements. Inaddition to these controls on prices and margins, there will be a restriction of net trading profits operated at the level of the whole enterprise, or of approved major sub-divisions. These profits, expressed as a ratio of profitsbefore tax to sales or turnover, will be held to the average of the best twoof the previous five years.3. The Government intend that precise rules on costs, profits andmargins should be firmly established as soon as possible. Consultation with industry, trade and commerce will continue about the Price and Pay Codewhich will apply after the end of the standstill, and will be administered by the Price Commission. The Government wish all firms to know assoon as possible how the control will apply to them, so that they maymake the necessary preparations in good time and so that the burdenof administration on them and on the Price Commission is reduced to theminimum consistent with effectiveness.4.   The code for determining prices will include the following points :(a) The costs to be allowed will be strictly defined.(b) Only salary and wage increases approved by the Pay Board orconsistent with the Price and Pay Code may be included.(c) An offset to allowable costs will be required to take account of increases in productivity.(d) Price reductions will be required in certain circumstances eg wherecosts fall.(e) The date from which cost rises will be taken into account will normally be the date of the beginning of the standstill ie 6thNovember, 1972.
(/) The Price and Pay Code will give the Price Commission some latitudein applying the controls in certain cases eg to deal with a losssituation ; or where the Price Commission is satisfied that applicationof the general rules would impede investment.5. The code will apply to all enterprises but different administrative arrangements will apply to different sectors as follows.MANUFACTURERS6. For the purpose of control, all companies whose main activities is in manufacturing will be divided into three Categories. The largest firms(Category I) and other firms with a relatively large share of the market for particular goods, will be required to notify the Price Commission beforeincreasing prices of goods they sell. The period of notice will be specified inthe Code after consultation. The Price Commission may authorise the increases requested or it may refuse consent. Unless the Price Commissionnotifies the applicant to the contrary within a time to be specified theproposed price increase may be implemented. Category I firms will also berequired to submit to the Commission regular reports of their costs, prices andprofit margins for scrutiny in connection with the application of these arrangements.7. Medium-sized firms (Category II) will not be required to obtain consentbefore increasing prices, but they will be required to submit regular reportsof their costs, prices and profits to the Price Commission. The commission will be empowered to investigate as It considers appropriate. If necessary,the Commission may require that prices should be reduced.8. Smaller firms (Category III) will also not be required to obtain prioragreement to increase prices, nor will they be required to submit returns tothe Price Commission. But they will be subject to spot checks. All enter-prises above a minimum size will have to keep records in appropriate form,and may be required to justify price increases to the Commission.9. The definition of the three Categories will be worked out urgently inconsultation with those concerned, but the Government envisage that allmanufacturing companies with a turnover over  50 million a year will fall intoCategory I, though that Category may well need to go wider.SERVICE INDUSTRIES10. Special arrangements will be made, after consultation, for the applica-tion of the cede to service industries. In the case of certain services, particu-larly those provided by small firms, the Price Commission may need to assesscost changes in the provision of services on an industry or sector basis andto indicate the extent of any price increases considered to be justified.11. Service industries will be subject to profit control on the same basis as manufacturers.COMMISSION SELLING12. Where goods or services are sold on commission, that commission,expressed as a percentage, will not generally be increased.
DISTRIBUTORS.13. Distributors&apos; gross percentage margins will be held at the level of abase period which in the Governments view should normally be the lastaccount year of the firm concerned before the introduction of the Code.This will, however, be subject to consultation. This control will limit grossmargins where the distributors&apos; purchase prices rise sharply. The Govern-ment intend by this means to ensure that the restraint exercised over manu-facturers&apos; prices is fully reflected at the retail level. Where supply prices ofgoods rise particularly sharply, eg where they are affected by large rises in world commodity prices, it may be necessary to make special arrangementsfor margins to ensure that retail prices do not rise to an unreasonableextent.14. Large distributors will be required to furnish regularly to the price commission particulars of their turnover, gross margins and profits. TheGovernment envisage, subject to consultation, that a limit of the order of 10 million annual turnover will apply. All distributors whose turnoverexceeds  50,000 will be required to keep records of the same information which may be examined by the Price Commission.TRANSITION TO VAT15. The Governments intentions are described in paragraph 15 of theWhite Paper. The Government will be holding urgent consultations withthose concerned to work out arrangements for ensuring that the tax changes are properly reflected in prices of goods and services.16. The Bill will empower designated officers, including Weights and measures inspectors under the direction of Ministers, to investigate prices to see that they properly reflect the tax changes.TENDERS17. Prices quoted in competitive tenders will not be subject to priceapproval by the Price Commission, but enterprises offering tenders v/ill berequired to conform to the Code, including the rules for allowable costs.They will be subject to the overall profit control.B:  PAY18. All employment incomes, including income from self-employment and other incomes fixed on an individual basis, will be covered by the policy.The policy will apply from the end of the pay standstill until the autumn of1973. (The particular treatment of settlements deferred by the standstill is dealt with in paragraphs 35-36 below.) The following paragraphs set out inmore detail for immediate guidance how the Government intend that thepolicy should be applied. This same guidance will be embodied in the price and Pay Code which, after consultation with industry and subject to theapproval of Parliament, will apply after the end of the pay standstill andwill be administered by the Pay Board.THE PAY LIMIT19. The policy will be based on the principle that settlements should notbe made more frequently than at 12 month intervals and that no group shouldreceive increases in excess of the pay limit during their next 12 month period.
20. The annual limit to which pay settlements must conform will in generalbe related to the group covered by the settlement, not to the individual.The total cost on the annual pay bill of all pay increases affecting any of thegroup during a 12 month period must not exceed the equivalent per head of  1a week plus 4 per cent of the average pay bill per head over the previous year.The cost of overtime working should be excluded from the calculation savefor the cost of any increase in the premium paid for such work. Within thispay limit no individual should receive an increase of more than  250 a year.21. Within this total figure there will be scope for negotiations, forexample on the extent to which the increase is to be weighted in favourof the lower paid, to which as indicated in the White Paper the government attach importance. Negotiators will also be free to decide the extent towhich the increase takes the form of improvements in other terms andconditions of employment, as an alternative to a straight increase in pay.OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS22. The cost of improvements in other terms and conditions of employ-ment must be included in the total cost of settlements. Improvements inpensions and redundancy payments schemes may, however, be negotiatedoutside the pay limit, as may reductions in standard working hours downto a net 40 hours per week and improvements in annual holidays up to3 weeks.23. All new benefits under share option and share incentive schemes were subject to the standstill announced in Cmnd. 5125. This standstillwill continue for the time being. The Government will be initiatingconsultations with a view to seeking a way of enabling such schemes (whichthe Government believe provide desirable incentives) to be implemented infuture within the framework of pay policy.EQUAL PAY24. The Government stand by the requirement of the Equal Pay Act1970 to achieve equal pay by the end of 1975. They wish orderly progress towards this to continue and any remaining differential between men&apos;s andwomen&apos;s rates may therefore be reduced by up to one-third by the end of1973 outside the pay limit, if necessary. Increases outside the limit for thispurpose may only be made where pay settlements within the limit do notwiden the existing relativity between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates.25. The Government therefore do not intend to make an Order underthe 1970 Act to make it mandatory to bring women&apos;s rates of pay up to 90per cent of the corresponding men&apos;s rates by the end of 1973.PAYMENT BY RESULTS26. Where settlements affect workers covered by schemes of payment by results (including pieceworkers), increases in pay which will arise fromthe operation of such schemes must be included within the pay limit exceptin so far as such increases are due to increased output within the terms ofexisting schemes.
PRODUCTIVITY AND PAY RESTRUCTURING SCHEMES27. In this stage of the policy any new productivity and pay restructuiingschemes will have to be implemented within the pay figure, if necessary bystaging. Future treatment of such schemes will be a matter for consultationwith industry and others concerned, including the Pay Board.NATIONAL, LOCAL AND PLANT NEGOTIATIONS28. Where settlements for a particular negotiating group are concluded at more than one level, e.g. a settlement at national level is supplemented bysettlements at local or plant level, the total resulting increase must be withinthe pay figure.LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS29. Further guidance will be given by the Government afterconsultation with industry about the payment of increases agreed before the standstill but not due for payment until after the standstill ends, for exampledie later stages of long-term agreements and cost of living sliding scales.30. As regards the conclusion of new agreements, negotiators are free toreach settlements providing for staged increases at not less than 12 monthintervals, but the later stages will have to conform to whatever guidelines are operating then, on which the Government will be consulting industry.ARBITRATION ETC.31. The policy applies to all settlements whether reached by direct negotiation, conciliation, arbitration, or by other methods of pay determina-tion whether statutory or otherwise. The cost of Industrial Arbitration Boardawards under section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act and similar legislation will, however, be outside the pay limit.PERSONAL INCREMENTS32. Personal increments of any kind may be paid so long as any additional cost on the annual pay bill of the group concerned is counted against the pay limit. Where, however, existing pay is expressed in a predetermined range orscale and the increments are regular and of specified amounts, any cost of movements within the range or scale on the annual pay bill of the groupconcerned will not count against the pay limit. The cost of any improvements in existing ranges or scales must be contained within the pay limit.NEW EMPLOYERS AND NEW WORK33. The policy will apply to the fixing of pay by new employers or for new work. In all such cases rates of pay should be no higher than thosecurrently paid in the locality by other employers for the same or similar work.OTHER EMPLOYMENT INCOMES34. The policy applies to all other employment incomes including incomesfrom fees and allowances, save re-imbursement allowances in respect of expenses necessarily incurred in the course of employment. All self-employed
persons should take account of the relevant guidelines when determiningtheir fees and charges, in order that their income from them net of allowablecosts should conform to the pay limit. The agencies will have the powerto restrict the charges and incomes of any category of the self-employedwhen they appear to be increasing excessively. Scales of fees or chargesmay in suitable cases be made subject to notification. The Governmentare a major user of many of the services of professional bodies and will ensure that the policy is followed in their day to day dealings with such bodies.SETTLEMENTS DEFERRED BY THE STANDSTILL35. Settlements and other increases (such as personal increments) whichwere due to be implemented before the 90 day standstill, ie before 30thNovember, 1972, may take effect from 28th February. Thereafter, increases which have been deferred may be implemented 90 days after their due date or at the end of the standstill if that is earlier. In both cases this is subject tothe due date being not less than 12 months after the previous settlement.36. Subject to the above provisions on timing, settlements deferred duringthe standstill which were reached on or before 6th November, 1972, will beallowed to take effect in full but without retrospection. For others whowould normally have been due for an increase during the period coveredby the standstill but had not reached a settlement by 6th November, the costof the settlement must be at the rate of  1 per week head plus 4%. Ifnegotiators wish to make a settlement for less than 12 months in order to revert to their normal operative date, they will be free to do so, provided they keep within that rate.NOTIFICATION OF PAY INCREASES37. Under the new legislation an Order will be made indicating thearrangements for notification of pay increases, including arrangements fornotification of certain increases in advance of implementation. The categories of pay increases required to be pre-notified will be announced after consulta-tion with industry, but are likely to include those covering 500 or moreemployees ; certain others may be required to be notified when implementedand all but the smallest firms may be required to keep necessary records of settlements implemented.Cs DIVIDENDSCOMPANIES AFFECTED38. Paragraph 34 of the White Paper will apply to dividends declared by all companies incorporated in the United Kingdom except:  (a) Investment Trusts as defined in Section 359 of the Income andCorporation Taxes Act 1970.(b) Close companies to the extent that they increase distributions inorder to comply with the special tax rules concerning such companies.(c) Companies entirely in the beneficial ownership of another company or companies where ordinary payments are exclusively inter companytransactions.
39. Companies which still have commitments under prospectuses issuedbefore 6th November 1972 will be permitted to honour them. The Treasurywill also be prepared to consider such cases as recovery situations, where an earlier account year may be a more suitable basis for comparison, and increased dividend declarations in order to resist an actual takeover bid.If a company considers that there may be sufficient reasons for exceptionalconsideration, the Treasury should be consulted in good time before any action is taken.DIVIDENDS AFFECTED40. The dividends affected are all dividends payable in cash (excludingfixed rate dividends) and analogous distributions out of the assets of a company otherwise than by way of repayment of capital.CALCULATION OF DIVIDENDS41. Dividends declared in respect of a company account year should not bring the total amount of dividends declared in respect of that account yearto more than 5 per cent above the money amount declared in respect ofthe company&apos;s preceding account year. Pro rata adjustments should, how-ever, be made to take account of any differences in the lengths of companyaccount years, increases in paid up share capital (where these reflect thevalue of new cash subscribed or other real considerations), or reductions in share capital.PROCEDURE42. The Treasury will, when the legislation comes into force, lay an Orderapplying Clause 8 of the Bill to all quoted companies other than thoselisted in paragraph 38 above. A statutory order or notice can be appliedunder the legislation to companies other than quoted companies (unless otherwise excepted) and they will be expected to comply with the limit.Printed In England by Her Majcsty&apos;s Stationery Office at St Stephen&apos;!

Counter-Inflation BillEXPLANATORY note the Bill provides for the control of prices, pay, dividends andrents following the expiration of section 2 of the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972. It creates twoAgencies, the Price Commission and the Pay Board, and providespowers for them to restrict prices and pay in accordance witha code to be formulated by the Treasury. It also provides forrestrictions to be imposed on dividends and rents. These powers are exercisable initially for three years. There is also a temporarypower to control the effect on prices of the introduction of value-added tax.Clause 1 provides for the establishment of the Agencies andthe appointment of their members. It is supplemented by theprovisions of Schedule 1.Clause 2 provides for the Treasury to prepare a code to whichthe Agencies are to have regard in performing their functions under the Bill, and which may contain practical guidance for those concerned in decisions on levels of prices and pay. the code will be contained in a statutory instrument, subject to parliamentary control.Part II of the Bill sets out the general powers to restrict prices,pay, dividends and rents. The temporary power which relates to the introduction of value-added tax is set out in Part III.Clause 3 provides for the provisions of Part II to be broughtinto force at the same time as the code and for them to cease to operate after three years. The clause enables the operationof Part II to be terminated before the period of three years hasexpired or for its operation to be extended, for periods of up to twelve months at a time.Clause 4 enables the Minister to make an order providing forprior notice of price or pay increases to be given to the appropriateAgency. The order may forbid the implementation of anincrease until the Agency has had time to consider it.Clause 5 enables the Price Commission to restrict prices or charges in relation to transactions effected while Part II is inforce and requires them to exercise their powers for the purposeof ensuring that the relevant provisions of the code are im-plemented. Provision is made for the Commission to givepeople an opportunity of making written representations before any restriction is imposed.Clause 6 contains provisions for the restriction of pay by the pay Board, corresponding to those in Clause 5.Clause 7 enables other statutory provisions relating to prices and pay to be modified by order.
Clause 8 empowers the Treasury, by order or notice, to restrict the declaration or payment of company dividends while Part IIis in force.Clause 9 gives a general power to make orders restrictingincreases in rents.Clause 10 confers upon the Minister temporary powers tocontrol prices or charges to ensure that they correctly reflect the tax changes which occur on 1st April 1973 (the introduction of value-added tax and car tax and the abolition of purchase tax and selective employment tax).Clause 11 empowers the Minister and the Agencies to obtain information and inspect documents for the purposes of the Bill.Clause 12 creates offences and prescribes penalties in respect ofcontraventions of the Bill and of orders or notices under the Bill.Clause 13 supplements clause 12 in its application to offences byunincorporated bodies.Clauses 14 and 15 contain provisions modifying the Bill in its application to Scotland and Northern Ireland.Clause 16 defines &quot; Minister &quot; as meaning the Minister for theCivil Service, the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Ministerfor Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister of Posts and telecommunications.Schedule 1 empowers the Minister (who can be any one or more of the Ministers specified in Clause 16(1)) to refer to an Agencyany question relating to prices, charges, pay or company dividends,and requires the Agency to examine the question, or keep it under continuous review, and report to the Minister. The Schedulealso relates to the constitution and proceedings of each agency and to the appointment of their members, officers and servants.Schedule 2 contains provisions for approving increases inprices, charges or pay. These include provisions for the granting of consents in cases where restrictions are imposed by orders ornotices under Part II.Schedule 3 contains supplemental provisions, relating inparticular to the making of orders and giving of notices.Schedule 4 is concerned primarily with the enforcement oforders and notices imposing restrictions.Financial Effects of the bill the expenditure on the two Agencies will depend on thenumbers and complexity of the matters they are concerned with,but is expected to be about  3 million a year.Effect of the Bill on Public Service manpower in the short term the Bill is likely to require an increase in public service manpower of about 700.
