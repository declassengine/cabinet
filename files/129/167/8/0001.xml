HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 8 COPY NO24 January 1973CABINET67PUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  PRIORITIES AND control memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. When the Cabinet settled the public expenditure programmes for therecent White Paper (Cmnd 5178) they recognised that they had not disposedof the main problem and invited me to circulate a further report in the newyear (CM(72) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 6).    This was to cover a, continuing examination of programmes and projects, andreassessment of policies as necessary, to keep totals under controland priorities right;  and b. critical scrutiny of the rate of increase of programmes asthey are rolled forward to 1977-78, with no presumption that therates in Cmnd 5178 can be continued.THE problem. We managed - just - to bring the expenditure figures down to ourtarget of 3, 8 per cent average growth, in demand terms, over the period1971-72 to 1976-77.    Our medium-term economic forecasts suggested thatthis was barely compatible with our tax policies - anything more threateneda reversal, to higher tax burdens.3. We also increased the contingency reserve to a record level - 700 million by 1976-77,    But we knew that even so it was already virtuallycompletely mortgaged throughout the period by the large extra claims,clearly foreseen but not yet precisely quantifiable, summarised in Annex 1.4.        Subsequent developments, including notably progress with Phase ii of our counter-inflation policy, have made it the more obvious that thoseclaims are real and indeed underestimate in some cases the money and resources we shall require for public sector operations.    Nor must itbe forgotten that although in 1970 we cut our predecessors&apos; programmesheavily, we have since raised expenditure to the point where our present plans represent a higher level of spending than our predecessors&apos; - see thechart at Annex 2.
5. We cannot yet be sure what the latest forecasts for the economy,short and medium-term, will suggest.    But there are signs, particularly from the trend of the unemployment figures, that pressure on resourcesmay begin to re-emerge more quickly than had formerly been thought, andwe shall certainly have to ensure that adequate resources are available to correct present trends in our trade balance and for productive investment.IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE6. To cope effectively with this situation we must reconstitute a truecontingency reserve rising to at least  300- 400 million by 1976-770    Wecan only do this if this amount is found by savings within the programmesthemselves.    Even so, since we are bound to be fuced with further spendingproposals of high priority, which cannot a1; present be foreseen, our room for manoeuvre will still be restricted.FINDING NEW SAVINGS7. Actior. is  necessary on two main fronts.    The first relates to theconduct of the 1973 Survey operation, now in its early stages.    It will always be difficult, as we found last year, to detect the services wheresavings are possible if we start our search after the annual Surveys have provided us (in June) with the costings of policies as they stand.    TheSurveys should be sontructed from the outset with political guidance from us on the areas of expenditure for which, in changing circumstances, wewould be prepared to consider reduced priority,8. This does not mean that we should try to settle the programmesnow.    It means that we should instruct officials to present us in the 1973Survey, which will extend to 1977-78, with costings for selected items notonly on the normal basis of existing policies but also on the basis of reduced priority for them.    At Annex 3 I make some suggestions asto how we should do this;  but I stress that this is only a partial list and I hope that my colleagues will be ready to put forward their own proposals.MONITORING9. Second, we must monitor very carefully developments of existing policies and new proposals as they come forward currently.    The new approach under the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC), designedto create essential room for manoeuvre, would be vitiated if we let thatroom be eroded meanwhile by insufficiently stringent day-to-day control on decisions which commit the future.    The Chief Secretary and I will keep a sharp eye open for important issues of this kind, and if necessary bring them before the Cabinet.CONCLUSION10.        Subject throughout to close monitoring of current spendingproposals, I propose that, in preparing the 1973 PESC Report, officials should be instructed:2
a. Wherever the implications for expenditure of &quot;existiagpolicy&quot; up to 1977-78 are less than precise, to set out the forecastsin terms ofi. the interpretation which, in the absence of specialMinisterial instructions, would normally be used in a SurveyReport;  and ii. an alternative^ feasible interpretation designed toproduce a lower level of expenditure.b. In such areas as those suggested in Annex 3, expanded aswe may agree, to set out alternative, lower costings, indicating the policy implications which would be involved.,    In doing this for1977-78 the figures up to 1976-77 should be reconsidered in order toestablish, where appropriate, alternative paths through the intermediate years.A treasury Chambers24 January 1973
ANNEX  1PRESSURES ON THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE1.       The provision for the Reserve rises to  700 million in 1976-77i   the highest  ever.     Nevertheless,   it is subject to  some very heavy pressures:(a) Defence,   on present policies,   could needperhaps another  100 million above the provisionalfigure for 1976-77 in Cmnd 5178.(b) Expenditure in support of our prices and incomes policy cannot yet be fully quantified but may well have to be substantial  and continuing,eg in financing large nationalised industrydeficits.      - &apos;(c) The Reserve has to cover the cost of upratingsocial  security benefits to the extent  already agreed  ( 200 million).     But  the pressures - including those in the context of prices and incomes policy-  for further improvements would if accepted entailfurther,  potentially very large,   claims.(d) Some nationalised industries may well needsubstantial  assistance beyond what is  allowed forin the programme figures for reasons unconnected with price restraint,   eg in order to maintaininherently  unviable services in coal  and railways.(c)    Assistance to private industry under theIndustry Act,  and possible support  for new aircraft1

This will be to a considerable  extenta matter of fiscal  adjustment and redistribution of income between taxpayers.     But  it will be  essential tokeep a tight rein on other claims on resources,   in theperiod both before and after 1977,   so as to keep  the initial cost of the scheme manageable and ensure thatthe countervailing fiscal measures required at the timeof the scheme&apos;s introduction can be kept within bounds.

(CO N F 8 D E N &quot;fSALjANNEX 3INITIAL SELECTION OF POSSIBLE AREAS FOR SAVINGS1.       The attached table shows the size and rates of growth of expenditure programmes  (before disbursementof the contingency reserve).2.       In view of the pressures on the contingency reservelisted in Annex  1,    300-^00 million would need to beadded to it  for it to be realistic;   and this involvessubtracting from the programmes this amount of expenditure.3-       The jDroblem at this stage is to provide a broadindication of areas of expenditure which may offer scope for savings as compared with a straightforward costing of &quot;existing policy&quot;.     It will not be until  illustrativecostings have been made on this basis,   and the implications worked out in the Survey Report,   thatactual modifications of policies or programmes can bedecided.     If,  however,   it then appeared that  300-^00million could not be found from the areas initiallychosen for examination,   the  search would need to beextended to others.4.       It is therefore desirable that the initial  listof services where the former degree of priority may nowbe modified should be as long as possible.    individual ministers will be able to make their own  suggestions
CONFIDENT. IAIbut the following should be included:(a)     Overseas aid:    The rate of growth providedfor up to and including  1976-77  is substantially in excess of the average for public  expenditure as a whole.     Officials should report on the implications of a more modest rate of increasein 1977-78.(h)     Agriculture:    Consider the possibility ofphasing out,  more rapidly than at present planned,various domestic  agricultural  support  schemes as our farmers receive progressively higher returnsfrom the Common Agricultural Policy,  which weshall be financing through the e.c. Budget.(c) High technology:     The  1973/Report  shouldreflect a more hard-headed look at this  expenditure from the point of view of the return to thecountry.     We shall need to take an extremelycritical view of any new projects.(d) Nationalised industries:    A stringent  scrutiny of prospective rates of increase of capitalexpenditure,  with proposals  for alternativephasing where possible.(e) Roads:     Indicate the implications of someSurvey
(CONFIDENTIAL.)slowing down of the rate of increase of expenditure,taking account of growing environmental concern overland use and control  of motor traffic.(f)    Miscellaneous local  services:     Give analternative costing of a lower rate of growthfor both current and capital  expenditure.     In thisconnection it is relevant that the Secretary ofState for the Environment has already informedlocal  authority associations that the Governmentwould be considering how to  reduce the future growth of local  authority current  expenditure.
