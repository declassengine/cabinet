HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government cp(73) II COPY NO      U12 February 1973CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW - PROPOSALSFOR 1973-1975Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. We have to determine our programme of Programme Analysisand Review (PAR) studies for 1973 and, provisionally, the twosucceeding years.2. In the light of consultations at Ministerial and official levels,I propose the programme set out for 1973-1975 in the Annex to this paper.    The studies are grouped to show their contribution to sixbroad themes of policy.3. If this programme is accepted, then in the space of five years,taking account of the 1971 and 1972 programmes, half of the whole field of public expenditure will have been subjected to review of the underlyingreasons for the expenditure and of the possible alternative courses ofaction which are open.4. The value of this process was well shown by the recent white papers on education policy, which were based on PAR studies.     there might be advantage in aiming more frequently at explaining to thepublic our conclusions from such studies, using White or Green Papers,or other means, as may be appropriate in each case.3. Subject to further reviews of the programme at annual intervals,I seek the approval of the Cabinet to the proposals listed in the annex to this paper.P JTreasury Chambers12 February 1973

a. Studies completed

i. The public employment service (DE)[DHSS]

ii. Fertiliser &amp; lime subsidies (MAFF)[DAFS, MANI]

iii. *Export promotion (DTI) [FCC, CCI]

c. Studies proposed.

i. Tourism (DTI - 1973)

£25 million. A scheme of grants and loans to stimulate hotel building is now coming to an end. There is likely to be pressure for its renewal in some form, and furthermore new proposals for support to tourism are being suggested. In view of the new emphasis on tourism as a means of assisting regional development an interdepartmental review of the whole subject has been proposed. This could appropriately and conveniently be a PAR.

ii. Selected declining and grov/th industries, andindustr:/ generally in the regions (DTI - 197/l- and 197s)The amount of expenditure involved cannot be stateduntil the studies are core clearly defined, but assis-tance to industry on regional employment grounds alor^eis running at  150 million a year rising to  350 million in 1976-77*    It is envisaged that the work might bearranged so as to produce PAH reports in each of thetwo years, but the precise scope of the studies anddivision into two reports will need further definition:for example, in so far as the interest of the problemsof declining and growth industries is in the social consequences, this might fit better with review ofthe problems of regional unemployment than with reviewof the problems of the industries themselves.Groundwork for the studies is likely to be found inthat at (a) above, in a current CPRS study, and in thefirst results of application of the 1972 Industry Act.On regional aspects account will need to be taken of regional policy developments in Europe;    and of thecase for labour-related, as well as capital-related,subsidies to the assisted, areas./DOE, SO, VO, DS7iii. The labour market (DE 1974) 20m upwards, depending on scope.   Subject to exaraina-tion of. methods, and being satisfied that essentialdata can be obtained, the Department of Employment see good case for a PAR within the area of government _

2. RESOURCES DEPLOYED IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF URBAN AND RURAL LIFE.

a. Studies completed

i. Exchequer assistance to public transport outside towns (DOE) [SDD, WO]

ii. New towns in Great Britain (DOE) [SO, WO, MAFF, DTI]

b. Studies in progress

i. Road safety (DOE) [HO, DES, SO, WC]

ii. Urban transport policy (DOE) [HO, SO, WO]

Note: Urban freight distribution is under consideration in DOE as a separate policy issue requiring as early decision as possible.

c. Studies proposed.

i. Inter-urban highways (DOE - 1973)

£322 million. Although the future inter-urban primary network is settled, there remain substantial issues that are to do with the general theme of getting the best value for money. These include the phasing of the programme and the question whether existing standards of design and construction are satisfactory.

[SDD, WO]


*    *Inter-urban public passenger transport (DOE - 1977!-)No significant figure can be attached to such a forward-looking study.    The PAR (carried out jointly with DTI)would be concerned with options for future expenditureon research and development into the technology of long-distance inter-city transport.    It would examine the comparative costs (capital and operating) and the relativebenefits of different modes of long-distance publicpassenger transport as they are likely to be operated inthe 1980s and beyond, within the United Kingdom and betweencities in the United Kingdom and the continent./DTI, SDD, VQ7iii.*Urban deprivation (HO - 1975)The programme is too fragmented to identify costs readily.The PAR would be intended to examine the whole problem of urban deprivation, the objectives of Departments collec-tively in this context, and the best ways of achieving them.It is not yet clear whether the problem can be handled inthis way.   The first stage would &quot;be an exploratory fact-finding exercise, which might lead to firm proposals fora PAR which could be submitted to Ministers in mid-1975./DHSS, DOE, DE, DES, SO, WQ7The next three studies represent a progressively wideningreview of housing policy^ producing material for each successiveyear of the period:7
iv.   House improvement grant a (DOE - 197?)Zl&amp;A million.   A review of the present system of grants for the improvement of local authority and nrivately-ownedhouses (to instal modern amenities and prolong the life of the properties).ZSDD, V/Q7v. Housing policy phase I (private sector) (DOE - 1974) ?0-40 million as cost of rent allcv;ances (but tax relief for mortgage interest running at some  ?CC-400 million).A study in the field of private sector housing, probably to consider objectives and policy options for privaterented dwellings in the light of the decline in numberof such properties offered for rent.j/SDD, WQ7vi. Housing gollcj phase. 11 (general) (DOE - 1973) 13G8 million.   Allowing for the need for the effects ofthe Housing Finance Act shake-up to take their course,a fuller-scale review of housing policy seems appropriate for about 1975^    This could extend eg to further aspectsof availability to particular groups of people (eg theyoung and the old);    tax reliefs;    and availability ofland.ZSDD, VQ7vii. Pollution (DOE - 1973)The programme is too fragmented for a figure to be readilyidentified.   An across-the-board review of anti-pollutionpolicies is envisaged..8

Higher education and schools (two studies: DES andWO; SSD)Studies in progressNone.Studies proposed.     Higher education and schools expenditure II (DES -1973-74). 2341 million.   Consolidation and development of the 1971and 1972 PARs will cover the further development of theforecasting of educational expenditure with the aim ofmaking ten-year forecasts on a regular basis, a feasibilitystudy for a post-graduate loans scheme, and pursuit ofmore fundamental issues, as they are identified, affecting-objectives and strategy in the longer term./Bed, wo, dhss, dti, de711 *    *Getting ready for work (de - preparatory work in.1,973 with a view to completion by late 1974-)Not costable.   The aim would be to review arrangementsfor the training and preparation for employment for young people.   It would have regard to employment and wider
social trends, existing provision for the training of young people, the balance between training and further education for young people, and changes which will result from the proposed legislation on employment and training.The review would enable gaps and weaknesses in existing arrangements to be identified, and suggest how they mightbe remedied.Notes:1. At some stage PAR studies in the area of non-advanced further education will need to be undertaken by the Education Departments.This will be considered when the 197^-1976 PAR programme is drawn up.2.     A PAR on the Training Opportunities Scheme may also be desirable in 1975i hy which time it is planned to have expanded to 60,0C0 -70,000 places.    DE intend to formulate proposals as other studiesin this group proceed, subject to the agreement of the proposedManpower Services Commission.ZSES, SO, UQ710

This PARwould examine the appropriate cash provision for disablementand the criteria for entitlement./&quot;SHHD, WO, DOE, DE/(iii) Priorities within the Health Services (DHSS - 197h-1975) 2,795 million is the current total for the Health Servicesbudget.   The aim of this PAR is to undertake a comprehensivestudy of priorities in 1975.   This, however, requires muchpreparatory work, from 1973 onwards, including prior studies in depth of particular aspects - possibly eg the determinants ofresource use, the shape and size of capital expenditure, or particular client groups such ^as -the mentally ill.   It will befor later determination which of these will be studied in 1974./&quot;SHHD, W0711
JNote:   Certain of the PARs in the DHSS field may usefully beextended at some stage to cover the mobilisation of voluntary effortalongside the public services.(iv)   ^Statistics for social policy (CSO - 1973)Probably at least  h.5 million.   The PAR would be a review of potential major interdepartmental requirements for statistics &apos;for social policy, the extent to which they could be met from existing statistics, and insofar as they cannot, the optionsfor, and the political and economic costs of (i) developmentof new sources (eg 1% intercensal survey and other general purposesurveys etc) and (ii) modifications in existing statisticalprogrammes,,^&quot;&quot;since this PAR would involve collection of material toestablish requirements of statistics for developments of an interdepartmental nature, rather than those for statisticalprogi-aiTufles within Departments, the main role would be played by CSO and OPCS.   The role of Departments - HO, DHSS, DES,DOE, DE, SO, WO - would be little more than checking draftstatements of their position^?

The i971 Home Office PAR exercise   on theTreatment of offendersiserved to emphasise the critical importanceof manpower in the management of the penal system.   Preliminaryresults of intensive studies now in progress of the use and deployment of staff and of the management structures of individual establishments together with increasing staff shortage,suggest the need for further examination of existing assumptions about prison service manpower.   Other suggested subjects forfurther study in the 1971 PAR are being followed up, but notnecessarily in the form of PAR exercises./&quot;shhd, doe7
