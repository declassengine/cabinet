DEFAULT BY CLAY CROSS URBAN DISTRICT council under THE HOUSING FINANCE act memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentVIEWS OF DERBYSHIRE COUNTY council. As foreshadowed in paragraph 11 of CP(73) 17, the Minister for housing and Construction has had a private meeting with three leading members of the Derbyshire County Council.    Their view was that theCouncil would be willing, if the Clay Cross councillors do not appeal andare disqualified next week, to appoLit persons to act in the place of theClay Cross Urban District Council.    They were divided on whether those persons&apos; functions should include the Council&apos;s functions under the housing finance Act or whether it would be preferable for me to appoint a HousingCommissioner to undertake them.IF THE CLAY CROSS COUNCILLORS APPEAL2. We still have no certain knowledge whether the Clay Crosscouncillors intend to appeal against the decision of the district auditor.If they do, they will remain in office and will form the Clay Cross Counciluntil the appeal has been disposed of, and no action on the part of thecounty council could be taken in the meantime.3. If the council continue their maverick behaviour, eg encouraging arent and rate strike, there are no comprehensive powers to replace themunless special legislation is passed - presumably in general termo inorder to avoid hybridity.4. The council might be directed to perform their statutory duties bywrit of mandamus.    But this would probably result in the councillorsbeing committed to prison for contempt of court - a piece of martyrdomwhich they might welcome.1CP(73) 20 COPY NO     C i20 February 1973CABINET

5.        In such a situation the early appointment of a housingcommissioner to implement the Housing Finance Act might take some ofthe steam out of the situation and result in the council acting morerationally in other fields,,    But there is no knowing whether they .vould,and they might do their utmost to frustrate the commissioner.IF THE CLAY CROSS COUNCILLORS DECIDE NOT TO APPEAL6.        Disqualification would take effect without further formality on theexpiration of the statutory period (ie at the end of February).7. The county council would be entitled, as from the moment the disqualification took effect, to appoint persons to act as the council undersection 72(3) of the Local Government Act 1933.8.        An appointed substitute council would probably have a better chanceof carrying on day-to-day council activities if the controversial aspects of housing were taken out of their hands.    Conversely a housingcommissioners task would probably be easier with a substitute councilrather than the existing one.      But the appointment of a housingcommissioner would be represented as a notable victory for the Clay Crosscouncillors.9.        A substitute council would operate until the date on which Clay Crosswas declared to be a &quot;successor parish&quot; under the Local Government Act1972 (assuming, as is likely, that it will be so designated.)   It would bepossible to defer the designation until March 1974 so as to postpone anysterile round of abortive elections while Clay Cross remains a housingauthority.CONCLUSION10.        Until we know whether the surcharged councillors will appeal nofirm decisions can be taken.    I will keep my colleagues informed of developments.G r department of the Environment20 February 19732
