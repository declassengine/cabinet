TENANCIES OF HIGH RATEABLE VALUE DWELLINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. At their meeting on 15 February the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Minister for Housing and Construction, to circulate a paper on the courses which might be adopted in response to pressure fromthe Innler London Members to amend the Counter-Inflation Bill to restrict the rents of high rateable value (RV) tenancies,2. There are two categories of tenancy which do not come within the fair rent system but where tenants pay market rents and do not enjoysecurity of tenure:a, 20, 000 tenancies (10, 000 in London, 10, 000 elsewhere)which are outside the Rent Act because of their high RV (over 400 in London, over  200 elsewhere).    The tenants are middle-class and relatively affluent.b* 600,000 furnished tenancies, concentrated in conuibationsand areas of housing stress, with access to Rent Tribunals.    the tenants include a high proportion of very poor families.In both categories, hardship arises for a significant proportion of tenantsbecause rents are rising fast, some landlords act rapaciously, and thereis a shortage of alternative accommodation to rent,3. The present situation with regard to high RV tenancies is described in Annex A.    The case made by the Inner London Members for extendingrent control to them is at Annex Ba and is based primarily on steepincreases in rents, shortage of alternative accommodation, theunprincipled behaviour of some property companies, and the inequityof leaving these tenants outside the fair rent system.    The Inner LondonMembers are therefore pressing:a. In the short term, for the Stage 1 standstill on the rents of high RV tenancies to be extended for the duration of Stage 2.b. In the longer term, for RV limits to be raised to givetenants full security of tenure under the Rent Acts and access to the fair rent system,1CP(73) 19 COPY NO M *16 February 1973CABINET
To this end, they tabled an amendment to the Counter-Inflation Bill inStanding Committee.    They subsequently agreed to withdraw this amendment on receiving a private assurance that the Governmentwere giving serious consideration to their proposals, but they willpress their case on Report unless they receive adequate assurances that the Government will take the measures which they advocate.4. There are several courses open to the Government:a. To stand firm and seek to defeat any amendment tabledon ReportArguments for:i. It would not be practicable further to freeze theserents without giving security of tenure.    The case is finelybalanced and raises the allied and much more difficult issues of security for furnished tenants and the governments general housing policy for inner-urban areas.    It wouldbe better to take action only after mature consideration and by substantive Rent Act and Housing legislation.ii. To accede to the wishes of the Inner London members could expose the Housing Finance Act policy to further strong and dangerous attack and lead to charges of discrimination infavour of the rich unless something were done at the sametime for furnished tenants.iii. If we take short-term measures in the context of the counter-Inflation policy, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to avoid getting committed to permanentcontrols.Arguments against:i. The Government might well be defeated, precipitatingthe need to make an immediate statement of policy not at atime of the Governments choosing,ii. The Government might appear to be condoning theactivities of the less respectable London property companies,to be leaving these tenants defenceless in face of demands for higher rente during a period of price and wage restraint, andto be turning its back on its own London grass-roots support,iii. If in the longer term the Government does wish toraise the RV limits,, it would be better to do so now.b. To take no action now but to announce on Repor* that theGovernment intends to bring forward proposals in due courseArguments for:i. It would show that the Government was serious inits intentions to tackle the problem.
iia        It would avoid the awkwardness of actingprecipitately under the Counter-Inflation measures and allow time for mature consideration,iii,,       It would avoid the risk of attack on the linesof discriminatory action in favour of the rich in Stage 2.Arguments against:i, It would be unlikely to satisfy the Inner LondonMembers.ii. It could well result in the worst of all possibleworlds.    The tenants would get no immediate benefit and landlords would see the red light and quickly selloff all their vacant property in order to beat the eventuallegislation,c. To accede to the wishes of the Inner London Members tofreeze those rents for the duration of the Counter-InflationmeasuresArguments for:i. It avoids the risk of public defeat,ii. It can be represented as fair in the context of counter -Inflation,iii. It will put the Government in a good posture againstthe less-principled property companies.Arguments against:i. It will put the Housing Finance Act policy at riskbecause no action is being taken to freeze the rents of council tenants.ii. Unless equivalent measures are taken for furnishedtenants, it will seem highly discriminatory.iii. The effect on the futui e availability of rentedproperty may be serious,iv. It will result in the need for long-term controls.d. To accede at once to the longer-term demands of the inner london Members by raising the RV limits in perpetuityArguments for:i. It would ensure the whole-hearted support from the inner London Members, and, if similar provisions weremade for furnished tenants, from much wider quarters,ii. It would protect existing tenants for all time,iii. It would be consistent with the fair rents policy.
Arguments against:i. It would be acting precipitately and in the wrongcontext.ii. It would largely dry up the supply of accomodation to rent,iii. It is open to objection cn grounds of discrimination against council tenants and, if nothing were done for them,furnished tenants, who include the families who are thehardest hit in the present housing situation0rv\        It would require early substantive legislation.5. If we decide to take some action, we shall probably need to makea further Order under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Actto give security of tenure (this may be ultra vires); to amend the Counter-Inflation Bill also to provide for security of tenure by order;  and to beprepared for substantive legislation before the powers in the Counter-Inflation Bill expire.    It would be important to ensure there was no lapsebetween any statement of intent and taking action,6, There are no implications for public expenditure.R home Office16 February 19734
ANNEX a background - THE MARKET situation. There are 2. 3 million tenancies of unfurnished dwellings owned by private landlords in England and Wales.    Under the Rent Act 1968and the Housing Finance Act 1972 tenants of such properties enjoy fullsecurity of tenure and are either within or are corning into the fair rent system which also now applies to council tenants ard housing associations.    Fair rents are typically well below market rents.2. High rateable value properties are, by definiticn, the bestunfurnished lettings and include mansion-flats with RVs of  800 andmore.    When leases fall vacant, the new annual rental for a flatimmediately above the rateable value limit for London is now likely tobe approaching  2, 000 per annum.    The tenants of these propertiesinclude relatively aftluent middle-class people, some of whom may beretired and used to living in Central London or along the South Coast -in London perhaps a third of the 10, 000 tenancies might fall into this category.    Particularly at the more luxurious end of the market, the tenants will include businessmen and professional men (some occupyingcompany flavs) and a significant   number of transient foreigners includingdiplomats.3. The majority of these properties are owned by large propertycompanies.    Somo are pursuing a continuing policy of renting.    Others,taking advantage of the strong demand for owner-occupation and thebouyant property market, have preferred, on obtaining vacant possession,to sell their flats on long-leasehold instead (the &quot;break-up&quot; process).Thus the pool of accommodation for renting is shrinking, though it ispossible still to find flats for renting at this high RV at the market rent.Several of these companies also continue to let flats below the RV limitby pooling their rental income from market and fair rents, but the break-up process is also well established for properties below thelimits i
ANNEX BTHE INNER LONDON MEMBERS&apos; case. The Inner London Members (and, to a lesser extent, south coast Members) base their case for raising the RV limits on thefollowing arguments:a. The supply of rented accommodation above the RV limitsis already drying-up (&quot;break-up&quot;):  giving tenants security of tenure will slow down this process.b. Under conditions of scarcity partly created by somelandlords keeping their prapaittea empty, rents are risingvery fast (they may be doubling when a 5 or 7 year lease falls in).    People on fixed incomes - and during Stage 2 - aretherefore faced with impossibly high rents, or having topurchase their flats on long-leasehold at a high price, orof finding alternative accommodation.c. As a result, the middle classes are being driven from central London, to be replaced by foreigners, companies andhotel-type operators to the detriment of the social life of thecapital.d. The Rent Act limit of  400 RV in 1965 was arbitrary;produces gross inequities in rental payments;  and is no longerappropriate when there is a scarcity of accommodation abovethe limit.    It would be logical to apply the fair rent system,now so widespread, to this small remaining area of unfurnishedproperty.e. Some London property companies are rapacious andunprincipled, and because of scarcity, can operate as aquasi-monopoly.     The Government should not be seencondoning their operations.f. The Government&apos;s supporters in London are looking tothe Government for action.
