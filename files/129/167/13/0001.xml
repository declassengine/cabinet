CP(73) 13 COPY NO12 February 1973CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW PROGRAMME, 1973-75Memorandum by the Prime Minister1, The establishment of a three-year programme of policy reviewsunder the Programme Analysis aad Review (PAR) system, as set out inthe memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(73) 11), is animportant step forward in the development cf PAR.0    PAR is an importantinstrument of policy analysis, to which we must attach a high priority.    as this programme is completed a number of very important policy areas willbe studied and the Governments forward strategy clarified,,2. I am particularly concerned that we should obtain results from this programme in its earlier years.    The later we receive the results, theless useful they are likely to be to ue.    There may be good reasons whythe completion of most of the 1972 PAR studies has been delayed.    Butwe cannot afford the same degree of slippage in the coming two to threeyears as has occurred with the 1972 PARs;  and we should aim to improveon the programme wherever possible rather than to allow it to slip.3, I am well aware that the programme will make heavy demands onscarce analytical resources in Departments, as well as on theadministrative staff involved.    We must increase our analyticalresources where this is necessary and can be done.    We must alsodo all we can to accord the programme the priority which it needs inorder to bring it, and especially the more fundamental and interdepart-mental topics, to a timely conclusion.4. Ministers in charge of Departments should therefore make a pointof supervising progress with the various studies in the programme, inorder that we may be sure that matters on which it would be advantageous to have formed views in the next two years will be brought before theCabinet Committees concerned in good time.E H10 Downing Street12 February 1973
