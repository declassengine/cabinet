CP(73) 18 COPY NO U i16 February 1973CABINETHOUSING FINANCE ACT 1972: POSITION OF MERTHYR TYDFILCOUNTY BOROUGH AND BED WAS AND MACHEN URBAN DISTRICTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for wales. I report for the information of my colleagues the position in the twohousing authorities in Wales which are still refusing to implement the Act.2. On 8 December 1972 I appointed Housing Commissioners to implement the Housing Finance. Act in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough and Bedwas andMachen Urban District,    The present situation is as follows,RENTS3, Both Housing Commissioners sought a direction last December,under Section 62(4), that they should make a rent increase of less than  1per week,    On 29 December I directed that the increases should be 55p inMerthyr Tydfil and 85p in Bedwas and Machen,4, Collection of rents at the new levels started in Bedwas on12 February and in Merthyr on 19 February.    The position in Bedwason 15 February was that 1, 485 of the 1, 702 tenants had been visited byrent collectors.    1,109 paid the increase and 376 declined,    217 tenantswere still to be visited on 15 and 16 February.    Collection in Merthyr Tydfilwill begin on 19 February,REBATES5. Both Housing Commissioners have introduced rent rebate cchemes.Applications are still being received, and the position at 15 February inMerthyr Tydfil was that out of 6,400 tenant^ 2, 680 were receiving rebates,2,200 of these were tenants formerly receiving Supplementary Benefit, sotheir position is unchanged.    The other 480 receive an average rebate of 1,48, based on the old rents; rebates in respect of the increased rentsare now being worked out.1t
60 In Bedwas and Machen, out of 1, 702 tenants, 420 are Supplementary-Benefit cases, and a further 187 are receiving rebate at an average of  1. 75,141 of these are paying less rent than they did before the Act was passed.LOCAL ATTITUDE7. Neither Commissioner has reported any serious difficulty withcouncillors or the public in carrying out his functions, and council officialsare very co-operative.8, There has been no move by either council to discontinue their opposition to the Act, and I believe they are waiting to see the strengthof tenant reaction against the rent increases.AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS9. Implicit in my decision to appoint Housing Commissioners wasthat an extraordinary audit should not be directed, and I am clear thatin local conditions this is not called for.    The District Auditor expectshis annual audit of the two authorities&apos; accounts to take place in August.This may, of course, result in a surcharge on the councillors responsiblefor any loss to revenue.    There may be other housing authorities which byreason of tardy implementation of the Act will also attract audit query and possible surcharge.PJMTWelsh Office16 February 1973
