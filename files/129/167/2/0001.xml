DRAFT WHITE PAPERSIHTH SPECIAL REPORT OP THE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE,SESSION 1971-72The Government have noted the Sixth Special Report of theExpenditure Committee in the 1971-72 Session (HC 2+76) on :&apos;Workof the Committee&quot;,     Eor the convenience of the House, this white Paper states the views of the Government on the recommenda-tions in that Report.Recommendation IThe Committee considered the present rule that all reports&quot;by Sub-Committees have to be considered and endorsed by thefull Expenditure Committee before their are published to &quot;be somewhat unsatisfactory.     The Committee recognised theneed to maintain a common approach.     They suggestedhowever that this could be secured in other ways throughthe full Committee and the Steering Sub-Committee.     they recommended therefore that Standing Orders should be amended so that their Sub-Committees could report direct to the House.This would be a matter for the House to decide.      In theGovernment&apos;s view, however, it is important for the expenditure committee to develop an effective co-ordinated approach to the scrutiny of public expenditure;    and they believe that the recommended change would not be helpful in this respect.Recommendajtion IIThe Committee proposed that changes should be made in thearrangements, originally proposed by the Procedure Committeein 1968-69, for an annual two-day debate shortly after theWhite Paper is issued - ie normally shortly before christmas.     The Committee said that it was intended bythe House that they shou.ld assist in the consideration ofthe annual White Paper   by presenting their comments upon it;    but that in practice the debates have been held too soon for the Committee to make even a preliminary scrutinyand report.They recommended that in future there should be an earlyone-day debate on general strategy;    and a second one-daydebate six weeks later following a preliminary report fromthe Committee.CONFIDENTIAL
Although it was originally intended that the annual White papers on public expenditure should be the subject of two-day debates,only one day was taken on the first occasion.      In the next year there were two Public Expenditure White Papers (Cmnd U515 andU578).     The first of these covered part of the subject of a two-day debate, of which the second day was the supply day, anda third day was taken for debating the other White Paper.     Lastyear, two consecutive days were provided.    However,  in spite ofa number of good speeches, the debase was generally acknowledgedto have been disappointing.The Government welcome a closer and better informed Parliamentaryinterest in public expenditure.     This might be best brought about by a steady increase in the influence of all the work which theExpenditure Committee undertake;    and a different use of theParliamentary time which is available to debate the White paper and the Expenditure Committee&apos;s reports might well be helpful.The Government would support an experiment in which one daymight be devoted, soon after the annual White Paper&apos;s publication,to a debate on general strategy in public expenditure;    and inwhich further time might perhaps later be taken for a debaterelated more closely to a report or reports of the expenditure committee.     This procedure might involve, at least in some years,bringing before the House substantial reports prepared by theCommittee in the preceding Session, with perhaps some furthercommentary prepared in the light of the new White Paper.Recommendation IIIunder present arrangements, three days a year are allowed for debating Select Committee reports.     At least one ofthese days is regularly taken up with reports from thePublic Accounts Committee;     and the present Governmenthave undertaken to provide at least one day for reports from the Expenditure Committee.      The Expenditure committee proposed that three full days should be provided for theirSub-Committee reports;    and that the number and approximatedates of such debates should be decided early in the Session.The Government consider that discussion through the usual channels has proved to be the acceptable means of deciding how to allocate limited time in Parliament, for the purposes,amongst others, of debating the various Select Committees&apos;reports (of which there were shout hO in the 1971-72 Session).
comrnendat i. on JCVThe Committee pointed out that Departmental observations ona Sub-Committee report rarely appeared less than four months after the report had been published.     they recommended an instruction to Departments that their observations should be made available not more than twomonths after publication of any report.As the Expenditure Committee establish themselves,  their recommendations are likely to relate to more and more substantial issues.      It may not be wise,  therefore, to impose on Departments a general rule that they must publish within tv/omonths considered responses to such recommendations.     Put theGovernment agree that, in accordance with the spirit of therecommendation, Departments should always do their best to respond expeditiously to reports of Select Committees.
