r$ EMCP(7:-i) 14 COPY NOU i12 February 1973CABINETREPORT OF THE LAYFIELD PANEL OF INQUIRY INTO THEGREATER LONDON DEVELOPMENT PLANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. On 1 February the Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy andthe Environment agreed the general Ikes of a statement to be issued whenthe Report of the Panel of Inquiry into the Greater London Development Plaz(the Layfield Report) is published later this month.    At the Prime Ministerrequest I am now bringing the matter before the Cabineta2. The Plan was prepared by the Greater London Council (GLC) as thefirst statutory development plan for the Greater London area and submitted for approval in 1969.    Tt was unprecedented both in its scale and in the controversy it excited, and it was subjected to an unusually long andthorough process of inquiry, lasting over two years.3. The Report runs to some 1,400 pages and covers a very wide range of issues, most of them falling within the responsibility of myDepartment but some concerning other Departments as wellc    A copyof the summary chapter prepared by the Panel themselves is at Annex A0It is clearly impossible to cover all of these issues in an initial statementard the draft which I attach at Annex B concentrates on a generalconsideration of the main ones, namely population and employment,housing, and public transport, traffic and roads, leaving for futurestatements our views on such matters as the Office Development Permitsystem, on which I shall be bringing proposals before colleagues in due course.4C At Annex B is a revised draft of the statement, which takes accountof the discussion at the Committee end of points subsequently raised bycolleagues in correspondence.    (To assist colleagues who saw the earlierversion I have sidelined the passages where changes have been made).4, To sum up the broad conclusions of the inquiry:    on population andemployment the Panel think that the Plan was unduly pessimistic about theeffects of a continuing decline in London&apos;s population, which they regard as inevitable and possibly even beneficial,, because of the improvement in living standards that it permits for those who remain.    Although
endorsement of these views implies criticism of the GLC, it has thepresentational benefit of reassuring public opinion about some of thealarmist prophecies that have been made about Londonls future.6. On housing the Panel accept the emphasis placed by the Plan onimprovement; and make recommendations on the private rented sector and on the new house building programme that are broadly acceptable.I have deleted from the earlier draft some words which were criticised as implying an excessive commitment to public expenditure, and redraftedparagraph 24 to give a better statement of our policy towards the privaterented sector.7. The Panel make detailed recommendations for the improvement cfpublic transport and for greater restraint of traffic which can be endorsedin general terms, though the details will have to be carefully studied overthe next few months.    It was suggested to the Committee that the endorsement of the GLCs policy for bus lanes should take account of the reservations of the Metropolitan Police.    The police are consulted aboutevery bus lane proposalbefore a decision is taken, and in view of thisparagraph 31 of the statement does not I think need to be altered.8. The most controversial feature of the Plan was the road proposals,and especially the three Ringways.    I consider that we should accept thePanelJs views that Ringway 1 is needed to relieve pressures on the environment in central -London (I have inserted some words to make itclear that the precise alignment of all the roads is still to be settled),and that a substantial part of the southern arm of Ringway 2 should be abandoned,,    I also consider that we should reserve our position on thePanel1 s suggested deletion of most of Ringway 3S which it would be imprudent to endorse at this stagec9. I believe that early publication of the Report, together with astatement of firm conclusions on a number of major issues, will be generally welcomed, and I invite the Cabinet to approve the draft at annex B.G r department of the Environment12 February 19732
CHAPTER XXVSUMMARYINTRODUCTION2^.1 In this chapter we set out briefly our main recommendations and the principal reasons for them.    We do   notset out every recommendation or reason, and we have inevitably,to compress, or even it may be sometimes distort, what is saidelsewhere in our Report.    In order to see the full extent of our recommendations and to clarify any doubts about our meaning, the relevant Chapter of our Report must be read.    Most of our recommendations we incorporate into suggested modifications tothe WS, but some depend on action outside the Plan.    We do notdistinguish, in this Chapter, between these two types of recommendation, although the distinction will be clear in the body of our Report.background^.2 We had to bear in mind that,on the one hand, the GLDP,if approved, will be treated as a structure plan, but that, onthe other, when in 1963 the London Government Act created the glc and imposed upon it the responsibility for preparing theGLDP, no one had any idea of what a structure plan might be.    TheGLDP, and the ideas about structure plans, have evolvedconcurrently and it is the GLCs misfortune that it was expectedto produce a plan without any clear guidance about how it mightwork in practice.    Inevitably,in some ways,the GLDP falls far short of what a good structure plan might be expected to containbut, equally, the difficulties which were experienced with theGLDP show somo of the dangers that structure plans may face.The defects shown by the GLDP, e.g. the failure to distinguish between what should go in a strategic,and in a local, plan,over-ambition, failure to relate policies to aims, may well occurwith structure plans themselves.
STATUTORY DOCUMENTS25&quot;. 3Three documents were submitted for statutory approval:(a)(b)(c)The VS.The Roads Map.The document.The WS is the subject of a very large number of suggestions for modification by the GLC.    In some cases, such as employment,these suggestions cast a new light on parts of the WS.   We have,in many cases,to report on the basis of these suggestions becauseotherwise we would have ignored new and valuable information andthe changes of policy to which it led.   We submit a substantiallyamended WS,which we drafted,and which we recommend should be approved.25.4 The Roads Map gave us great difficulty because it contains two incompatible categories of road, one (the primarynetwork) consisting of existing roads and proposals, the other(the secondary network) consisting almost wholly of existingroads.    We think the legal arguments which the GLC used tosupport the Map must be wrong because they lead to suchanomalous results.    If those arguments are not wrong, theRegulations from which they derive should be amended.   Werecommend that, in any case, the Map in its present form shouldnot be approved.25.5 The document, we also recommend, should not be approved.The evidence does not enable us to understand most of the policiesit is alleged to contain, and those that we do, we findundesirable.    The Map is liable to be used for the purposes ofdevelopment control, which we consider to be wrong, and it raisesquestions about land and site boundaries which were not appropriate for an Inquiry into a strategic plan.25.6 These are four policies which we consider depend on the map and our comments on them are:(a) The maintenance of the broad characteristics of settlement and work areas.    It was never made clear to uswhy these characteristics should be maintained or what&quot;maintained&quot; means.    The characteristics were defined sobroadly that they are useless for any conceivable planningpurpose.
(b) The maintenance of structural divisions.    Theseseem to us to be an entirely subjective division of Londoninto various patterns which serve no useful purpose.(c) The maintenance of the large areas of openland which have structural significance (Metropolitan OpenLand).    Some of this is public open space e.g. RichmondPark, about which it seems otiose to have such a policy;some is private open land for which the proper policiesshould be advanced in local plans.(d) Additions to the Green Belt.    These raise questions about the rights of individual land  owners   whichare not appropriate for decision in a strategic plan.POPULATION25.7 Our view about the GLCs estimates of population for greater London is that they are out of date, based on a dubiousmethodology, and assume that the Plan should and would be successful in stemming the decline of population.    We are not ablehowever, to offer instead estimates which we would regard asbeing reasonably accurate, because such estimates could be derived only from the full results of the 1971 Census, which arenot yet to hand.   We recommend, therefore, that as soon asthe full 1971 Census results become available, the GLC should undertake a revision of its population estimates usingconventional methods.    For the purposes of our Report, we adopta I98I estimate of 6.37 to 6.55 millions based on a range ofdemographic projections produced by the Council and assuminga continuation of current trends in migration, although we recognise a higher figure may be possible.    We essay a judgementthat,by 1991, the population might be as low as 6.0 millions.25.8 We emphatically recommend rejection of the GLC viewchat there is any particular danger in either a lower level of population, to which tho present rate of decline of population is likely to lead, or tha particular rate of change itself.    Thearguments put forward in support of the view that the declineshould be retarded are either, in our view, illogical or areunsupported by evidence.    In any case, we see very little likelihood that policies could be successful in restraining anyparticular rate of change.    We formed the view that long-term
population movements, of the sort that are taking place in London,are not likely to be significantly affected by the policies oflocal authorities.   It follows that, first, we do not think that the population forecast should have assumed that such policieswill materially alter demographic trends, and second, that wherethe methodology used for making forecasts diverges from establisheddemographic methods,it should be examined lest it conceals policyassumptions.25?. 9 There was much discussion at the Inquiry about theeffect of the decline in population on the composition of thepopulation.    The GLC feared that the proportion of the rich andpoor was increasing at the expense of the middle income group. &apos;We found no evidence that this was so.25.10        We do not find the method, based on the dwelling stockand occupancy rates, which the GLC used for forecastingpopulation, to be adequate.    Not only does it contain.the normaldemographic assumptions, but it was found to employ furtherunstated assumptions, which were then seen, after examination,to have been modified to bring them into line with policyassessments.    We appreciate that the normal demographic methodof forecasting may be inadequate for some purposes, but it seemsto us to be greatly more reliable than the GLC method.    However,we recommend that the GLC should work further on its method inthe hope that it can be made sufficiently reliable for use as asupplement and possible corrective to demographic forecasts.EMPLOYMENT25.ll        The GLCs principal policies on employment sought to relate labour supply and demand to each other in the varioussectors of London through use of floor space controls and, atany rate in the later stagos of the Inquiry, to reduce the rate at which employment was leaving London.    We reject both these policies; we find the first unworkable and the second undesirable.The evidence does not   lead U3 to believe that the GLC properlyconsidered the limitations of its powers or influence,oraddressed itself to the proper employment problems for a planning authority: the alleviation of medium-term imbalances in demand and supply as they occur, and the encouragement of growth inspecifio locations.   Our recommendations suggest, or recommend,
policies which should be pursued in those fields.2%.12        We found it very difficult to decide what aims planning authorities could realistically hope to pursue in employment,given the limited influence they could hope to exercise.    we considered GLC policies in the light of eight possible aims,which emerged from the evidence, but found it difficult to decide which aims and policies the GLC wished, in fact, to pursue in thelight of the changed assessment of the employment situationwhich it made during the course of the Inquiry.    The GLC wrotethe Plan in the belief that the demand for labour in London was greater than the supply, and that the basic problem for theCouncil was to reduce the growth of demand by rationing theallocation of floor space for office and industrial development.During the Inquiry, however, the GLC came to take the oppositeview and urged that demand was falling more rapidly than supply,particularly in the industrial field.    Accordingly, the Councilintended that the outflow of jobs should be reduced.    The basicpolicy for slowing this outflow was still by the control offloorspace; but the Council&apos;s belief now,was that just as a target set below the estimated demand for new floor space would reduce the number of jobs, so a target set above the estimateddemand for new floor space would increase the number of jobs.The evidence does not support either of these propositions.25.13        The eight aims we considered were:(a)	Relating labour supply and demand.(b)	Improving real income.(c)	Improving environmental conditions.(d)	Contributing to national objectives.(e)	Influencing rates of population change.(f)	Increasing the choice of employment opportunities(ct\ \ 0 &apos;	Increasing productivity.(h)	Keeping firms prosperous.only (a),	(c) and (d) we need discuss here.    The otherseither were not pursued by the GLC or are not capable of precisepolicies.
25-14        Labour supply and demand can be related both in timeand place.    Relationships over periods of less than three, or over ten, years appear to us to be beyond the powers of a localauthority to achieve, but where research and monitoring showcertain long-term trends to be occurring, e.g. unemployment forthe low-paid manual worker in Inner London, a local authority should bear them in mind.   We concentrate, therefore, on the relationship in the medium-term, i.e. three to ten years, withinsectors of London. The sectors, as at present defined, consistof groups of boroughs.    Such sectors should correspond to labour markets, and we recommend that steps be taken so to define them, but until such sectors are adopted, the sectorscomposed of groups of boroughs must suffice.25.15        It is this medium-terra sectoral relationship of supplyand demand which the GLC hopes to influence through itsfloorspace policies.   We do not think it can.    Its evidence doesnot show that it could forecast with any useful degree ofaccuracy what the likely labour supply and demand would be inthe future; and it also showed that it does not have any realknowledge of the relationship between floor space and the numberof people employed.   We cannot recommend, therefore, acceptanceof the policies which purport to allocate floor space in order to relate supply and demand.   We recommend, however, that localauthorities should 3eek to learn what is happening to the relationship of supply and demand and act to check undesirabletrends.    We suggest a group of policies by which this might bedone, such as (depending on whether there is an excess of demandor supply) giving planning permissions more or less readily,improving transport facilites, encouraging the emigration ofworkers in jobs, financial aid to firms, and similar measures.Those should be written into the WS.25.16 In regard to employment,we considered the improvement ofenvironmental conditions under three heads,    These are:(a) The improvement of conditions in a locality bythe rehabilitation of outworn industrial areas for industrial use and by removing non-conforming industry.   Werecommend that these policies should bo pursued activelyana that the removal of non-conforming industry should bolinked with the expansion of certain areas that we describeas Growth Areas and identify later.- 63O -
25.1k        Labour supply and demand can be related both in timeand place.    Relationships over periods of less than three, or over ten, years appear to us to be beyond the powers of a localauthority to achieve, but where research and monitoring showcertain long-term trends to be occurring, e.g. unemployment forthe low-paid manual worker in Inner London, a local authority should bear them in mind.

Such sectors should correspond to labour markets, and we recommend that steps be taken so to define them, but until such sectors are adopted, the sectorscomposed of groups of boroughs must suffice.25.15 It is this medium-terra sectoral relationship of supplyand demand which the GLC hopes to influence through itsfloorspace policies.   We do not think it can.    Its evidence doesnot show that it could forecast with any useful degree ofaccuracy what the likely labour supply and demand would be inthe future; and it also showed that it does not have any realknowledge of the relationship between floor space and the numberof people employed.   We cannot recommend, therefore, acceptanceof the policies which purport to allocate floor space in order to relate supply and demand.

(b) The improvement of the relationship betweenemployment, other land uses and transport.    We considerimprovement of the transport linkage between home and workwhen summarising our transport recommendations.    We hereconsider moving either employment or homes.    We do not recommend a specific policy for relocating employment closer to residential areas because, usually, workers come from allover London to their places of work; employees might wellnot be living in the areas where the jobs go.    In fact,travelling problems might become worse because, while most people can get easily to Central London, where so manyjobs are, the number who can get easily to other areas is substantially less.    Voluntary movement by firms out of central London, in cooperation with their workers, is indeedto be encouraged, but a policy which deliberately restrictsgrowth in the centre in order to put jobs closer to homes isnot.    Nor do we recommend building many more homes closer to where jobs are, i.e. close to Central London.    This would serve only to increase the very difficult problems of residential densities in Inner London.   We do consider,however, that employment areas should be linked to other facilities, such as shopping and recreation.   We alsostrongly believe that new employment centres should beestablished in locations where goods can be moved without causing conflict with normal life.(c) The improvement of the physical structure of theCentral or other Areas.    V/e do not believe that the deterioration in the quality of life in the centre derivesmainly from excessive employment or lack of people livingthere, or failure to give priority to other activities.We believe it is due, primarily, to increased traffic and thebulk of new building.    The first can be controlled bytraffic restraint, while the quality and bulk of new building should be checked by strict use of plot ratiocontrol and other local environmental planning considerations.We believe that outside the centre, our proposals for growth Areas will focus growth on particular areas whichwill give them added vitality and prosperity.    We stronglysupport the GLCs policy of concentrating new office andindustrial development into specific locations, and, although we are not able, through insufficient evidence, to endorse
the selection of the locations set out in the suggestedmodification to the Plan by the GLC, we consider the policy should be supported and the list approved as an interim measure.2p.I7        We do not understand what the GLC means by &quot;contributing to regional and national planning objectives&quot;.   We looked at twosuch relevant objectives, i.e. the development of the SPSEstrategy and ODP and IDC policy.    On the first, we found noreason to think the Plan,or our recommendations, inconsistent withthe strategy; on the second, we consider that IDC policy should bmodified, so that firms who are willing to move within london should be able to do so, and to encourage the rehabilitation ofdecaying industrial areas.   ODP&apos;s, however, we think areinappropriate for the control of the growth of London&apos;s offices.We recommend that consideration should be given to a system of taxes or charges which would raise the cost of employing people in London.25.18        In conclusion, we summarise the limited nature of theemployment aims and policies which ought to be in the Plan as:(a) A group of policies to deal with medium-term problems in the sectoral relationship of labour supply and. demand.(b) Rehabilitation of worn out industrial areas andthe removal of non-conforming industry.(c) Encouragement of new locations of employment in specific locations and in accordance with criteria, but without the use of negative controls elsewhere.(d) Ensuring employment opportunities in specificcases.Outside the Plan, we consider control through ODP&apos;s to be inappropriate.    We recommend a study of a financial measure tobring the cost of employing people in London closer to thesocial costs involved.   We specifically considered the effects of our recommendations on Central London and concluded that future demands for office development can be met, but strictlymanaged in accordance with local environmental needs.
HOUSING25*19        There are two basic difficulties at the root of theLondon housing problem;   the increasing rate of obsolescence ofthe existing housing stock and the concentration of poorhousing conditions in the private rented sector, together withthe decline in its size.    Programmes for new house building arean essential element in dealing with these difficulties, but ontheir own they are in no way sufficient.   Unless there are substantially increased rehabilitation programmes, more people will be living in poor conditions in I98I than now, because thenumber of new houses built will be more than balanced by thenumber of old houses becoming obsolescent.    Unless action istaken to maintain the private rented sector, and to improveconditions within it, overcrowding and homelessness will increase.Unless action is taken to coordinate entrance into, and management of, the public housing stock of London, the best usewill not be made of good housing resources and those most in need will not obtain adequate housing.    In order to deal with allthese questions we strongly urge that a housing authority for london, which has strategic powers, is essential.    In this, wefollow Professor Cullingworth and others.25.20        A strategic housing authority, and the maintenance ofthe private sector, are matters for you and not for the Plan,which the GLC had to produce on the basis of the existing lawand distribution of powers.    Our recommendations  on these important issues,do not, strictly, therefore,form part of thematerial which you must approve, modify or reject.    However,our considered view is that approval of the Plan, even modified as we propose, would not substantially assist London&apos;s housingproblem unless you deal with these matters.    Indeed, we think the proposals would remain largely academic.25.21        We find the housing content of the WS thin andunconvincing,    While the nature of the problem of obsolescence is recognised, and its concentration in housing stress areas isalso recognised, there is, no analysis of the fundamentaldifficulties, no quantitative programme for new building orimprovement, no review of policies in the public sector, noproposals for density control and a quite inadequate figure foroverspill.    Some of these defects, notably the target for new
building and density controls, are the subject of modificationssuggested later.5.22        As we say above, we analysed the main difficulties asthe obsolescence of stock and the condition of the privaterented sector.    It follows from this that we were not basicallyconcerned with overall figures and the crude balance of thenumber of households and the number of houses, because, besidesbeing extremely difficult to estimate, we do not think that they provide a very valuable assessment of the problem.   Nevertheless,we felt constrained to examine the statistics, largely becausethey played such a large part in earlier consideration ofLondon&apos;s housing problems.   We conclude that, provided there isnot a substantial increase in the number of one person householdsassumed to want separate homes, provided that new building   and rehabilitation meet the proposed targets, then the ranges oflikely homes and households will, taking London overall, overlap.It is, however, the condition of the stock which gives us suchconcern.   We found it impossible, with the information availableto us, to make any precise estimate of the condition of thestock in 193l,but we did come to the broad conclusion that, ifdemolitions   and rehabilitations went on as at present expected,then there might well be 265,000 to 390, 000 unsatisfactorydwellings in London in 1981. a substantial number of which wouldbe so obsolete that they would have to be demolished.25.23        Before considering these figures further we should consider the programmes for new dwellings.   We do not want togive the impression that large-scale programmes for new building are not vital; they are, particularly for public authority housing.   Without them, the private rented sector willbe even more overcrowded,- rehabilitation will be hampered, andgeneral housing conditions much worse.   At a late stage in the inquiry, the GLC submitted a suggested modification to the Plan,which proposed an interim target of IjJLj.0,000 to 580*000 dwellingsto be built between I967 and I98l, replaced by later figures whenmore information was available.   When this target -was advanced,we did not consider whether it was too big; our question was, isit realistic, i.e. will there be sufficient land and, money available to achieve It?   We had some doubts about the financial burden falling on certain agencies, particularly the Inner- 63*4- -
Boroughs who would have large scale rehabilitation programmes,although we considered the total burden was reasonable in thelight of London1s resources as a whole.    But because we did not,and could not, have evidence about the workings of the housing finance Act, we could not pursue this question.    On landavailability, we have the gravest doubts.    During the course ofthe Inquiry the GLC produced for us a study which showed that only about 18,000 acres of land would be available up to 198l.Admittedly, there were many doubts about the statistics and what&quot;available&quot; meant, but our conclusion is that it is not possibleto reach the targets for house building mentioned above on suchan acreage at acceptable densities.   We have, therefore, torecommend that a study should be made of land in the Green Beltwhich could be used for housing.25.21).        Our estimate of the condition of the 198l stock assumes that 200,000 to 275*000 houses will have been improved and 50,000converted by then.   This is an increase on existing rates, but one that can be expected with existing policies.    These figuresserve to indicate the scale of the increase that will benecessary If any inroads are to be made in the numbers of houses in poor condition in 198l.    Such an increase will not beobtained without a study of existing policies and action beingtaken to remove present difficulties, whether these be oflandlords and tenants not willing ( perhaps  for perfectly good reasons) to have their houses improved, or of difficulties aboutgetting grants for certain types of repairs.    It is also necessary for authorities to take to heart the advice given inyour Circulars about the economic advantages of rehabilitationover redevelopment.    The housing priority areas are large, butfairly distinct, areas, largely in Inner London but stretchingover into Outer London, of poor housing, much of it in theprivate rented sector.    They will need to be the subject ofconsiderable programmes of redevelopment and rehabilitation inthe next decade.   The GLC proposes to give them priority and weconsider it is right.    But wo do not think that a large-scale attack can be made on the problems of these areas with thepresent organisation of housing authorities and powers.    Thereare two main reasons.    First, each area must be dealt with inaccordance with a coordinated plan covering tho wholo of the area.But,as the areas themselves involve several boroughs, there Is
no one authority which, has the competence to make such a plan,let alone carry it out, and can meet the need to coordinate alarge number of differing authorities.    Second, rehabilitation$ and redevelopment needed for new housing purposes and to securethe improvement of the amenities and facilities of the area, willboth create an enormous problem of decanting, i.e. rehousingfamilies to reduce overcrowding or because their houses arebeing demolished.    It will be impossible to handle these broadproblems without the full metropolitan resources of public housingbeing available.2%.2$        We are also concerned about the manner in which the GLCarrived at its proposed aim for planned overspill,usually looselydescribed as 20,000 persons per annum.    This figure seems to usto be a quite arbitrary target unrelated to any consideration ofthe need for overspill as a help to London&apos;s housing problems.We consider a figure of 30,000 to new and expanding townsto be more in line with the contribution overspill should make.Until,therefore, a better figure can be calculated,we recommendthat this figure be adopted.   We also recommend that theIndustrial Selection Scheme should be reviewed.2^.26        The WS does not deal with density controls.    in response to criticism the GLC, at a late date, suggested a modification to the Plan to lay down a range of 70 to liiOhabitable rooms per acre as that which should be the range withinwhich densities for new family residential dwellings should fall.We consider the higher end of the range too high in the lightof views by GLC expert witnesses that about 100 persons per acreis the highest density that is desirable in new public housing.We, therefore, recommend a range of 70 to 100 habitable rooms per acre ,   making it clear that there may be exceptional reasonsfor exceeding both ends.    Development should not generally beallowed at densities lower than the lower end of the range,andthe main consideration governing the point at which the densityshould lie within the range.should be the circumstances of the site and locality.
POLLUTION25-27        Pear about pollution (noise and exhaust fumos) fromtraffic underlies many of the objections made to the Plan.Because measures to alleviate such pollution are highly technical and largely governed by national considerations, we do not makespecific recommendations, but report the basic points inevidence.    On traffic noise,we were told that there is insufficient protection from noise in new schemes,and the grantscheme does not help all those affected.    In particular, peoplefind the effect of noise outdoors, in parks and gardens, hard tobear.    An impressive body of opinion demands higher standards. the basic concern about pollution from exhausts relates to leadpollution.   We were given expert evidence on this which disagreeswith the Government&apos;s views.25.28        Aircraft noise is another source of complaint.    although we recommend the deletion of the paragraphs on aircraft noisein the WS,because they seem to us to have little point, weconsider this is a serious problem.25.29        The evidence about water pollution was prompted largely by the increased demand for use of the Thames and otherwaterways for recreation.    It is generally appreciated that the basic difficulties of improving the quality of the water liefirst in the very large capital investments needed for theimprovement of sewage works, and secondly in the fragmentationof authorities.    Our observations are that, so far as London isconcerned, the proposed reorganisation of water   authoritiesjustified.TRANSPORT25.30        The present state of transport, particularly road transport, in London is unsatisfactory.    Movement of people andgooda is frequently erratic, difficult, slow and expensive.Journeys by public transport are often uncomfortable andunpredictable as well.    The effects of heavy traffic onresidential and shopping areas have become damaging and unacceptable in many places.    The growth in use of the privatecar is, more than anything else, responsible for this
unsatisfactory state; failure to recognise that the many aspectsof transport in London are interdependent and need to be plannedkand organised as parts of one broad system is, perhaps, thegreatest obstacle to alleviating it.    Recognition of the integralnature of London&apos;s transport problems and the vital need for a unified strategy to maot them are essential.    All transportdecisions should then be taken with a full understanding of the aims of London&apos;s transport strategy.    To achieve such a strategy,and to secure its implementation, are the fundamental aimsunderlying our recommendations.25.31        Any satisfactory transport proposals for London should bring together in hanaony policies in four major fields; public transport, the management and restraint of traffic, the-improvement of the environment and the provision of roads.    TheGLDP, as submitted, does not contain such a coordinated policy,although the GLC went some way to constructing one in theproposed modification to the Plan which it later submitted.There are a variety of reasons for this omission, many of whichare the unavoidable consequences of the organisational andfinancial frameworks within which the GLC was obliged to plan.Objectors were quick to notice the deficiencies of the Plan,although sometimes less ready to acknowledge the underlyingcauses.    The Council, for its part, fully recognised the existingorganisational limitations, but appears to be resigned to them.25.32        In the interests of clarity we comment separately on each of the four major fields of transport mentioned above.Ideally, we should like to consider the relation of each fieldto the others and to the overall strategy and so emphasise theimportance we attach to their close interrelation.   But to doso would make our Report unacceptably long.   This section should,therefore, be read and understood In the light of the importancewo attach to the need for a sot of unified policies for London&apos;stransport.
Public transport25.33        London today has a highly developed radial railnetwork1.    This network is well suited to bringing large numbersof people into Central London, or into some centres in OuterLondon, such as Croydon.    Rail services are preponderantly usedfor journeys to and from work in the morning and afternoon peakperiods.    At other times they are under used.     There has been a continuing tendency towards greater concentration of demandwithin the peak periods.   The consequences of this greaterconcentration are more, and more prolonged, discomfort for passengers, greater pressure on bottlenecks in the system and higher operating costs without corresponding increase in revenue25.3k        London&apos;s rail services are not well suited to carryingpeople either on orbital journeys, or in small numbers.    London&apos;bus network is better placed to do this.   But the buses suffer from road congestion, which makes them slow and unreliable, andcrowding in the peak periods.    The service is deteriorating.Deterioration and rising costs are leading to further loss ofpatronage.    A spiral effect is evident, and it is one whichwill continue unless action is taken to stop and then reversecurrent trends.    This will be difficult; such action will need to be determined, vigorous and persistent.25*35        The GLCs proposals for public transport amount tolittle more than the incorporation in the Plan of the investmentproposals of the individual public transport operators.    these were drawn up, quite properly, by the operators in the light oftheir respective objectives and financial positions.    Thegeneral intent of the Council is said to be &quot;to improve public transport in all possible ways&quot;, but we heard little evidence toindicate in concrete terms how this unexceptionable butextraordinarily vagus aim was to be achieved.1.    Mainly BR, but tho tuba and surface railways of LT also play an Important role.2.   ws para *.y.
2^.36        The importance of a good public transport service asan element in a satisfactory overall transport strategy is^threefold.    First, it provides for those who have no access toa car, either because they are poor, or cannot drive, or another member of the family is using it, or they have chosennot to buy one.    Second, it can attract those who might otherwiseuse private cars and in this way reduce the demand for new roads.This in turn can reduce the cost of new roads.    Third, by providing an acceptable alternative to the private car, goodpublic transport makes measures to restrain the use of private cars both more acceptable to the public and less restrictive of personal mobility.    In order to do those three things well,public transport services must be:(a) Reliable.(b) Convenient and reasonably cheap to use.(c) Comfortable for the passenger.At present, reliability is imperilled on the railways bycongestion in peak periods.    Bus services are unreliable, largely because of road congestion.    Public transport services are ofteninconvenient to use, because interchanges, where passengers canchange from one form of transport to another, cause too muchdelay and discomfort.   Timetables of buses and trains are illcoordinated, ticketing arrangements are inadequate.    Coverageby bus and LT rail services is patchy.    Public transport isexpensive to use and becoming more so.    At peak periods public transport is markedly uncomfortable.   At all times, passengerswaiting at stations or bus stops, or using interchanges,experience varying degrees of discomfort.    Our recommendations are designed to reduce or remove all these defects.25.37        A prime difficulty in remedying those defects which weidentify in public transport is the inadequacy of the organisational and financial frameworks within which public transport opoi-ates.    Each public transport operator has its ownorganisation, its goals and its own financial structure and aims,very largely determined by the statutes and directions underwhich each operates.   And these organisational and financial arrangements are not directed towards the achievement of an integrated transport system for London.    Indeed, the objectives of an Individual operator are often inimical to the achievement of such an aim.   We do not believe, particularly in the light of- 6I4.O -
the evidence of recent years, that these attempts atcooperation between operators, local authorities, and Government,can overcome the difficulties and contradictions inherent in thepresent arrangements.    Only by ensuring that all concerned havecommon aims, and are not deterred from pursuit of those aims by financial considerations peculiar to individual parties, canmatters be improved.    And this, in turn, depends firstly,on the setting up of a central body with responsibility for transport policy.   We offer suggestions as to how this might be done, butwe were not given evidence on which we could base a firmrecommendation for a particular solution.    Secondly, this central body will need financial assistance commensurate with the goalsit must achieve.25.38        An equally important requirement for the provision of adequate bus services is a much wider use by the GLC of its powers to manage road traffic.    It should use these powersselectively to free buses from the general congestion on theroads.   We make recommendations for this also.Management and restraint25.39        Management, in the sense of so controlling road trafficthat more journeys can be made at higher speeds withoutproviding any additional road space, has been extensivelypractised.    Management, in the sense of removing traffic fromareas where it causes damage to the environment, and restraint,directed to reducing the demand for road space, are relativelyundeveloped.25.40 The GLC proposals in the Plan are confined almost exclusively to the development of restraint by control overparking.    The evidence does not lead to the conclusion that the degree of restraint proposed would, in practice, be achiaveu.In particular, it appears that the GLC itself can not guarantee that the Borough Councils will carry out the GLC proposals.Furthermore, we do not consider that the GLC proposes sufficientrestraint to bring about the other transport objectives.3.   As e.g. by tha creation of tsuo lanes.
2$.h[l        Ideally, we would have wished to recommend roadpricing as the chosen instrument of restraint.    Road pricing isa system by which vehicle trips can be related most nearly tothe social oosts they cause and to the levels of traffic it is desired to aohieve.   But it seems clear that an acceptable roadpricing   system could not be in operation for about ten years,and effective restraint is badly needed before then.   We canonly,therefore, recommend that work to develop a system should becarried on urgently.    To deal with the present and immediatelyforeseeable future we recommend three basic sets of restraintmeasures:(a) Management schemes to canalise traffic on toroads where it does less environmental damage, to limitaccess to other roads where it does greater damage and tomake bus operation easier.(b) An increase in the number and effectiveness ofparking control schemes.(c) The Introduction of area licensing.The effective application of any restraint measure is partlydependent on the improvement of traffic forecasting methods sothat the detailed effects of particular measures may be predictedwith some degree of realism.   We recommend,as a first priority,that the GLC should so develop its present forecasting techniques,and until they are developed, impose parking restrictions weoutline below.25&quot;.I(.2        Parking policies should be extended to impinge on traffic that could be carried by alternative means, and on traffic which occurs at the worst times in the most crowdedareas.    Parking policies must be better enforced; we stronglysupport the GLC proposal to make the owners of cars   the personsliable for breaches of parking orders.    The GLC should completetrio metering of the Inner London Parking Area (and tho borough councils that of town centres), but the total number of on-streetparking places in the centre should bo reduced to about 20,000instead of the proposed 31,000.    Charges should be much increasedfor on-street and off-street public car parks.    This might causesome private car parks to be made available for public use, whichwould be a valuable aid in reducing the excessive number ofprivate non-residential parking spaces in the   centre,   publicoff-street car parking should be limited to 35,000 in the Central
Area and the use of, and charges for^ such parks should be strictlyregulated.    The level of private non-residential parking shouldbe reduced, both by lowering the number of places permitted in new buildings (and insisting the Borough Councils keep to thispolicy),and by legislation which would enable the GLC, where appropriate, to reduce the number of parking places in existing buildings.    Finally, the number of off-street parking places inresidential development in the Central Area should be reduced below an average of one space per dwelling.25.^3       It is not enough to rely on parking controls becausethey do not affect through trips and their charges cannotreflect the cost of movement   of vehicles in an area.    Somethingelse is needed.   We recommend area licensing as being a schemewhich has some of the advantages of road pricing, which couldbe quickly introduced, but which could be easily ended if andwhen a road pricing system becomes available.   We are aware ofthe difficulties, set out in &quot;Better Use of Town Roads&apos;,&apos; of introducing such a system, but the GLC should start now toconsider how such a scheme might operate within the bounds ofthe Inner London Motorway, with the intention of bringing it into operation in stages, starting as soon as practicable.25.114      We do not doubt that car owners will sufferinconvenience by these measures, but we are convinced they are essential to improve the environment for all.    We think theywill operate fairly between individuals, and be publiclyacceptable.   We reinforce the importance we attach to fairnessby suggesting the operation of company cars should be reviewed.But the measures proposed will only be effective,and beaccepted by the public, if their timing is carefully linked toimprovements in public transport and the road structure.    Tohelp bhls, target dates should be set by which each stage isto be carried out.
The environment

25.45 The effects of large volumes of road traffic, particularly large numbers of heavy vehicles, upon those who live, work, or take their recreation alongside or close to the roads, are intolerable and should be mitigated. New high capacity roads, particularly motorways, will, by their presence alone, also have unacceptable effects, such as visual intrusion and severance of a community, unless determined positive action is taken to see that these effects do not happen.

25.46 Better control of road traffic depends upon coordinated action in the fields of restraint, traffic management, provision of additional road capacity, improvements in public transport services, the delineation and implementation of environmental areas and remedial works to properties alongside new traffic routes. If the environment is to be protected, very much greater care must be taken in the design and construction of new roads. The choice of route and alignment, and the handling of landscape and architectural treatment of the road and its surroundings, must be directed to mitigating adverse effects on the surroundings to the greatest degree possible.

25.47 To secure that the effects of road traffic are significantly mitigated and that new roads are properly integrated into the urban fabric, we recommend:

(a) The provision of a network of roads, the main function of which will be to carry traffic (see para 25.50), with a total length of about 1,100 miles.

(b) Traffic, other than purely local traffic, should largely be confined to this traffic network by the use of restraint and traffic management measures.

4. The proposals in the Report or the Urban Motorways Committee and "Development and Compensation -Putting People First", which were published when our Report was nearly complete, go a long way to meeting our views. We welcome them most warmly. Some of our recommendations, however, are not covered by these proposals; we hope they can be taken into account when legislation is being drafter.


(c) Public transport services, particularly buses,should be improved, so that the necessary restraint and management of road traffic does not lead to any significant loss of personal mobility.(d) Environmental areas should be delineated, and traffic management measures applied to kosp these areas free of all but essential local traffic.(e) Wider powers and financial aid should beprovided for land acquisition for environmental purposes and necessary remedial works to properties alongside new roads.A code of practice governing such works should be drawn up.(f) Responsibility for the environmental treatmentof areas adjoining new roads should be clearly defined,and steps should be taken to ensure that necessary works are carried out in conjunction with the road construction.(g) There should be a greater readiness to meet the extra cost of depressing new high capacity roads belowground level, and,where appropriate, covering them, inorder to secure the environmental advantages of such treatment.All these steps will mean that roads will cost more.    We thinkthat should be so, and may help, to see that the true cost of newroads are appreciated when the need for them is assessed.    Itshould also ensure that the burdens created by new roads fallmainly upon the community, and not upon the individuals who may be harmed by those roads.Roads2$.l$       ROads in London are the responsibility of yourDepartment, of the GLC and of the Borough Councils.    the division of responsibility between these various authorities isIllogical and their work is not coordinated.   The present road system of London can not meet all the demands of Londoners formobility and pleasant living conditions,    Main roads arecongested, particularly at peak periods.    Traffic seeking toavoid this congestion uses other roads, particularly residentialstreets, while many main roads pass through town centres andshopping centres; traffic should be removed from such roads toimprove the environment.    Conditions will gat worse unlesseffective action is taken.   As incomes rise, more people wish toown and use cars.    If nothing were done, road traffic would- 6k5 -
become more and more congested.    Eventually congestion wouldbecome so bad that it would deter many people from using theircars.    At the same time, essential journeys and goods&apos; movementswould become very slow and expensive.    The bus services wouldbe very badly affected.    The use of residential streets bytraffic would increase and the&quot;environment would deterioratefurther.    Clearly, this situation is unacceptable.    Equallyclearly, it could not be avoided only by restraining road traffic the degree of restraint heeded would be draconian, would be unacceptable to the public and would damage the economic life ofLondon.    Some new roads must be;built&apos;.-    The crucial questions are(a) What kinds of roads should there be?(b) How much additional road space should beprovided?   And where should it be provided?What klnd3 of roads?25\lj.9       The GLC answer^er to this first question is a proposedhierarchy of roads in three tiers.&quot; These are:  &apos;(a) Primary roads.&apos; &apos; These would be high capacitylimited access roads, built to motorway, or near motorway,standards.    They would carry&apos;the&apos;Tdrtger-distance movements.(b) Secondary roadsThese would be roads of majortraffic importance, providing links with the primarynetwork &quot;and carrying shorter&apos;1&apos;journeys. &quot;(c) &apos;&apos;       Local roads. &apos;i!!&quot;Your Department gave evidence that &quot;It was&apos; considering proposals to rectify the present illogical distribution of responsibilities for London roads.25.5*0&apos;      Roads can have a number of&quot; different &quot;functions .    some are intended mainly to carry traffic j others are intended mainly to serve the activities carried on beside them, such as shoppingor- living.&quot; It is the conflict bdtwoon traffic and other functions on the same road that produces adverse effects on the environment,    It is important that, as far as possible, each roadshould be assigned one predominant function.    This moans thatroads should be classified according to their functions.    we recognise four distinguishable functions, each requiring roadsof different character.    These four functions are:(a) Roads serving longer distance movements;particularly by large and heavy vehicles.    These roads will- 6I4.6.-
become more and more congested.    Eventually congestion wouldbecome so bad that it would deter many people from using theircars.    At the same time, essential journeys and goods&apos; movementswould become very slow and expensive.    The bus services wouldbe very badly affected.

Equallyclearly, it could not be avoided only by restraining road traffic the degree of restraint heeded would be draconian, would be unacceptable to the public and would damage the economic life ofLondon.    Some new roads must be built&quot;.    The crucial questions are(a) What kinds of roads should there be?(b) How much additional road space should beprovided?   And where should it be provided?What kinds of roads?25-^4-9       The GLC answer to this first question is a proposedhierarchy of roads in three tiers.    These are:  &apos;(a) Primary roads.1 &apos; These would be high capacitylimited access roads, built to motorway, or near motorway,standards.    They would carry&quot;the&apos;loriger-distance movements.(b) Secondary roadsThese \jould be roads of majortraffic importance, providing links with the primarynetwork &quot;and&apos; carrying shorter1&quot; journeys .(c) &apos;v      Local roads.Your Department gave evidence that &quot;It was&apos; considering proposals to rectify the present illogical distribution of responsibilities for London roads.25.50&apos;     Roads can have a number of different&quot;functions.    some are intended mainly to carry traffic&apos;; others are intended mainly to serve the activities carried on beside thorn, such as shoppingor living.    It&apos;is: the conflict between traffic and &quot;other functions on the same road that produces adverse effects on the environment.    It Is important that, as far as possible, each roadshould be assigned one predominant function.    This moans thatroads should be classified according to their functions.    we recognise four distinguishable functions, each requiring roadsof different character,    These four functions are:(a) Roads serving longer distance movements,particularly by large and heavy vehicles.    These roads will- 6k6 -
serve the main areas of transport attraction and generationin London and will link with the national motorway network.On such roads, the traffic function will be paramount and,in most cases, it will be the sole function.(b) Other roads essential for the strategic needs ofLondon, but serving shorter movements.    Those roads wouldprovide   access to the network of roads comprising (a) above and to major centres.    The traffic function will be themost important function of these roads, but it will not always be possible to minimise frontage access orpedestrian movements at road level, though this should remain a desirable aim.(c) All purpose local roads carrying relativelyheavy flows of short distance movements, perhaps between10,000 and 25,000 vehicles per day, but the size of flowwould not be the determining factor.    The traffic functionwill be important, but proper arrangements will have to bemade to meet the needs of frontagers and pedestrians andthese may involve some limitation on the free movements oftraffic.(d) Local streets giving access to local areas andpremises.   Such roads should generally lie within the boundaries of environmental areas but might occasionallyform such boundaries.    The movement of pedestrians, theprovision of local access, and the activities carried on inthe premises bordering the roads would be the predominantfunctions.    Traffic movement would take a subordinate place.25.51        We recommend that:(a) The top two tiers (para 25-50 (a) and (b)) shouldtogether constitute the class of &quot;principal roads&quot; forwhich the GLC would be the highway authority.    The top tierwould be &quot;primary principal roads&quot;; the second tier &quot;otherprincipal roads&quot;.(b) The third tier (para 25.50(c)) would become&quot;borough roads&quot; and the London Borough Councils,with theCommon Council of the City of London,would be the highway authorities.- 61+7 -
(c) The fourth tier ( para 25.50 (d)) would become&quot;local roads&quot;, and the London Borough Councils, with theCommon Council of the City of London,would be the highway authorities.How much additional road space should be provided?25.52        To answer this question the GLC relied heavily on LTS?This indicated a range of demand for 1991 of between $0 and 60million vehicle miles of main road travel by 1991.   This rangecompared with an estimate that 23 million vehicles milesactually accrued by 1962.    In the light of these figures, and oftheir proposals for restraint, the Council proposed to provideby 1991 enough extra road space to cater for double the 1962mileage.    The full network which the Council proposed would nothave been completed by 1991, and further new roads would havebeen built in the following decade.25*53        Our own approach to the question of how much additionalroad space should be provided is different.   Although weconsider that LTS  overestimates the demand, and that greaterreliance should be placed on restraint and management   and on public transport, than is implicit in the Plan, we do not thinkthat the imperfections of traffic prediction processes will permit us to make a precise estimate of the reduction in size ofthe GLDP network through those processes by giving differentweights to these factors.   We,therefore,approach the question ofsize by stipulating:(a) It is desirable to complete the planned roadnetwork in twenty years. Planning of roads beyond thisperiod is not sensible at the present time.(b) The road network must be large enough for theroads efficiently to discharge their intended functions, sothat local roads can be kept clear of unnecessary traffic,we now discuss what shape and placing of the network thesestipulations lead to.5,   The London Trarf lc Survey, its successor, the London Transportation Study, and subsequent testscarried out by tho GLC on LT3 data.-  6I4.8 -
Where should additional road space be provided?2^.Sh        The Plan includes proposals for a primary networkconsisting of three rings (plus the North Orbital and M25outside the GLC boundary) and thirteen radial3.    It alsoproposes a secondary road network consisting almost entirely of present main roads, although this is said by tho GLC to besubject to amendment in the light of further planning by theCouncil and the London Borough Councils.25.55        Our judgement, based on consideration of the functions which principal primary roads should fulfil, is that theprincipal primary road network should consist of an inner and anouter orbital, with broadly the same number of radials as are proposed by the Council.    Our consideration of the shape ofnetwork we should recommend starts from the limitations imposed,in practice,by existing and committed roads.    It becomes clear from this that the important choice we must make in our recommendations is between Ringway 1 and Ringway 2 as thealternative broad alignments for the Inner London Motorway.    the choice we recommend is for Ringway 1.    This choice (modifiedat the south eastern corner) reflects our judgement that:(a) A road on this alignment would have a highpotential to attract traffic which would otherwise useCentral London streets, or use them to a greater extent.Radial   primary roads linked to the Inner London Motorwaywould provide convenient primary routes for much of the traffic to and from suburban areas, and the elimination ofRingway 2 would not,therefore, lead to excessive loads onthe secondary network.(b) In contrast, a road on the Ringway 2 alignmentwould not attract traffic from Central and Inner London,with the result that a very heavy load would be thrown on other roads in those areas, particularly at the stubends of radial primary roads which already penetrate beyondRingway 2.(c) Only the Ringway 1 alignment, therefore, willmake possible the environmental improvements in theCentral Area which are so badly needed.(d) The economic return on the Inner London Motorwaywill be higher than was calculated by the GLC forRingway 1.
(e) The choice of the Ringway 1 alignment will assist in the planned redevelopment of some areas of poorhousing.Our recommendation on the choice of alignment for the inner london Motorway having been made, the choico of alignment forthe outer orbital   is dictated largely by what alr-ady exists,or is committed.    We,therefore,recommend rejection of Ringway3 because the orbital ring outside London is already virtuallycommitted and does not need to be duplicated.    The NorthCircular Road we also include in the network, largely because it is already there.    Finally, we recommend alterations to someof the radials to alleviate the worst environmental problems that would be caused by the GLDP network, such as the Redbridgeinterchange   and the M23 terminus, and suggest a cross Thameslink at Thamesmead because of the likely effects of the ChannelTunnel and the airport and seaport at Maplin Sands.    The full effect of our proposals is shown on Figure 12.3-6   The reductionin the mileage, together   with our recommendation that, withspecial exceptions, widths should not exceed dual 3-l&amp;ne,means that the network of primary principal roads will have roughly &apos;75$ of the capacity of the comparable GLDP proposals, and willC03t roughly one third less.25.5&amp;        The secondary road network in the Plan is not,in ourview,acceptable as a basis for the network of other principalroads and borough roads which we propose.    The GLCsexplanations of this network are unsatisfactory and conflicting.We, therefore, recommend that you should not approve this partof tho Plan, but should require new network plans to be drawnup and submitted .to you.   We expect these two networks together to -be of the order of 700 miles in total length; this figure is advanced as a rough order of magnitude only.    The GLCestimated that its    proposed, secondary network would cost halfac much as    its .proposed primary network.    We find this costestimate as unsatisfactory as the secondary network itself; wehave no evidence on which we can reliably estimate the cost,either of the GLCs proposals, or of our own.6.  Faga
Summary : the integrated transport strategy25.57        We believe that the totality of our transportrecommendations will, if accepted and implemented, make Londona better place for Londoners to live in without impairing their ability to move about.    We stress, once again, that we see all our transport recommendations as integral parts of a singlerecommendation, namely,, the overriding need for a coordinatedand unified transport policy.    London&apos;s transport policy mustbe viewed as a whole.CENTRAL LONDON25.58        We deal with the most important problems about central london in our recommendations on  transport and employment.However, because of the importance of Central London,we agreewith the GLC that the WS ought to contain a Section about it.We feel, however, that the WS is inadequate because it does not contain a satisfactory definition of the Central Area, nor doesit list the activities which should be encouraged there, nor does it relate the other parts of the Plan to Central London.Neither, does it deal adequately with one of the most importantproblems in Central London, i.e. tourism.    On the other hand,it contains a great deal of material about possible (in somecases vory hypothetical) development in Central London which isnot appropriate to a strategic plan and which we recommend should be deleted .25-59        The GLC accepts that the Central Area should be defined to correspond with the Registrar General&apos;s StatisticalCentral Area.    We agree, provided that it is recognised thatpolicies must not be cramped by the existence of a line on a map, but must be able to react to the movement of forces whichtake place in tho Central Area and Inner London generally.    the glc also produced a list of activities for the Central Area.We consider these will be of some assistance to Borough councils and of help to developers.   We found the evidence of theirwitnesses on tourism to be one sided.    They look to a reductionof the number of tourists without fully examining what are theproblems they create.    We recommend that the GLC should carryout studies of theso problems,and the possible alleviation ofthem,before arriving at any fixed view.    However, wo recognisethat there are problems, and that, in particular, the siting of
new hotels must he carefully considered.GROWTH AREAS AND OTHER CENTRES-?.$.60        The GLC designates in the Plan twenty two StrategicCentres and six Major Strategic Centres (plus Brent Cross).These Centres were selected largely on the basis of theirshopping turnover, and are the localities where shoppingdevelopment is to be concentrated.    This policy is backed up bya table indicating proposals for the net change in shoppingfloorspace in the various sectors of London from 1966 to 198l,which we recommend should be deleted.25.61        We strongly share the view of the GLC that it isimportant to establish areas, particularly in Outer London,where growth can be concentrated and the maximum use be madeof investment.    However, we believe that the GLC method ofselecting these centres, by concentrating on their shoppingactivities,to be mistaken.    We consider that there are two types of centre which should be developed outside Central London.The first is an area where major growth, and particularly thecreation of new employment, should be centred.    This should be linked with the provision of major public and shoppingfacilities.    These areas should be few, because otherwise theywill not succeed in concentrating growth.    The essentialcriteria for their selection are good access to public transportsystems, good labour catchments, ability to attract growth(which means as well that they should not be too close to central London) and that they should be one of the centresssiected for employment growth in the employment policy.   Wewere nob able to mount an independent study to select such areas, but we consider that four of the GLC Major StrategicCentres would fulfil the criteria; Ealing, Croydon, Ilford andKingston;    We recommend,thsrsfore,that you approve these areas as Growth Areas.    The two other proposed Major Strategic Centres,Wood Green and Lewisham, should be subject to further study toaeo if bhey are suitable as Growth Areas.
25.62        Apart from these Growth Areas, we believe that it is right that a large number of local centres should be designated as centres to serve largely as local service and shoppingcentres.   We do not know, however, whether the centres described in the Plan as Strategic Centres aro right for this purpose,bocause we lack knowledge of their accessibility to theirsurroundings.    Such accessibility, and particularlyaccessibility to the secondary road network and bus services,is of prime importance in the selection.   We recommend,therefore, that the Strategic Centres in the Plan should notbe approved as Local Centres, but the GLC should prepare, inconjunction with the new secondary roads map, a new selection ofCentres.COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT AREAS,  ACTION AREAS, AREAS of opportunity, MARKETS25.63        This section of the Plan suffers from the changes in egislation which occurred while the Plan was being prepared and considered.   We had to consider it in the light of theproposals in the Plan and the objections.25.61;        The listing of Comprehensive Development Areas fromearlier plans is convenient for developers and others, and werecommend the list remains in the Plan.   While we have doubts about whether the principles which went into selecting ActionAreas for insertion into the Plan are right, because boroughstructure plans disappeared, we were not able to pursue thequestion.    We recommend the list of Action Areas be approved,subject to amendments which the GLC agreed with Objectors.On Covent Garden,   London Docks and Kings Cross Action Areas,weare unable to recommend alterations to the list as requestedbv Obiectors as thAv ay*a oil  aubiect to further decisions bvyou.25.65        We recommend leaving the list of Areas of Opportunityas it stands in the plan with the modifications agreed betweenObjectors and the GLC.   We recommend deleting the provisions relating to markets from the Plan as being unnecessary in a strategic plan.
URBAN OPEN SPACE25.66        Urban open space covers the policies for public open space, the Green Belt, what was called Metropolitan Open Land,^and the Thames.   There should be a unifying policy for variousopen areas within and around the city.25.67        We agree with the GLCs view that there is not sufficient public open space within London, particularlyInner London.    But we do not accept that the Council has founda means of deciding how much more public open space there shouldbe, and where it should be.   The Plan rightly rejects the old system of &quot;x acres per 1,000 population&quot;, because it takes no account of differing uses of open space and accessibility, andproposes a hierarchy of types of open space, of which each typeis to be within a certain distance of a person&apos;s home.    Thissystem is as objectionable as the old, because it takes no-account of accessibility by transport or of densities.   Werecommend, therefore, that the provisions of the Plan,which use these theories to construct standards for the provision of open space,be struck out.   The GLC should pursue its search for an acceptable principle, while local plans should contain adequate,realistic and specific provision for open space, based upon local requirements and with due regard to neighbouring areas.25 08        Given recent Governmental pronouncements, we did notthink it right to consider whether the concept of the GreenBelt,itself, is valid.    Given,therefore,the concept, we find thePlan lacking in proposals to ensure that the green belt shouldbe effectively used, particularly for agriculture and publicrecreation.    There is, moreover, no indication how green beltland should be vised if it is no longer useful as Green Belt.We recommend that those planning authorities concerned with theMetropolitan Green Belt should study the agricultural use of theland to consider whether any action is needed to support suchuse.   Where land is no longer suitable for agricultural use,but remains in the Green Belt, the study should consider what other green belt use is suitable for it.   We agree with the glc that derelict land (largely a green belt problem) should nolonger continue in London.   We recommend that the Council should offer financial assistance to Borough Councils who are unableto undertake the burden of rehabilitating it.   We were unable to- 65k -
find that tho GLC had made any adequate study of whether landcould be released from the Green Belt for housing.    We considerit vitally important that where land is not serving a usefulgreen belt purpose, it should be considered for use for other purposes.    Wo recommend that the GLC, with the Borough Councils,should carry out an urgent review of land, particularly near the boundaries of the Green Belt, to see if, without impugning the concept of the Green Belt itself, some land can be released for housing purposes.25.69        Metropolitan Open Land is a concept which the evidencenever enabled us fully to understand.    It is linked to the document,which we recommend should be deleted from the statutorydocuments.    We do not consider the policies Metropolitan OpenLand was designed to advance to be either sufficiently preciseor desirable to remain &quot;in the Plan.   We,therefore, recommend itshould be deleted wholly, although we recognise that extension ofthe Green Belt may be desirable.25.70        We consider there is only one major strategic issue in relation to the Thames.    This is to ensure the best use ofriparian land so that the River can better serve recreationaland amenity purposes.   We agree with the GLCs proposal to divide the banks into areas where industrial and commercial use would be encouraged, can stay,    or should be discouraged.    Werecommend, hoxvever, that these areas should not be preciselydefined in this Plan,since those definitions are the function of local plans.THE URBAN LANDSCAPE25.71        We respect the GLCs evident concern over the effectof change, whether planned or not, on the attractive parts ofLondon, and we succor t the Council *s view that- certain areas ofLondon are so important for the goiiyral attractiveness of thecity that they should be mentioned in the Plan, together withspecial planning policies uhieh should apply to them.    We alsoagree that the Plan should contain a statement requiringBorough Councils to consider tho declaration of Areas ofArchitectural and Historic Importance as conservation areas.Where we differ principally from the GLC in this field is thatxtfe believe that a number of matters mentioned in the WS, trees
and London Squares, are better dealt with in local plans, while others, which depend on the document and which we discuss in paras^ 25^5 and 25.6,are not really meaningful.2^&apos;72        We consider that our main task in this section is todecide whether the GLC exercised its judgement reasonably indrawing up the list of Areas of Special Character in the WS.We think it did, particularly bearing in mind that borough council can declare additional Areas of Special Character   intheir local plans.   We also agree, in general, with the looselyworded statements of policy for the Areas.   We recommend,however, that amendments be made to the Areas concerning central london Parks and Greenwich Park.PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES25.73        The Plan contains passages relating to education,hospitals, prisons, gas, water   and electricity undertakings,sewerage and sewage disposal and waste disposal.   We conclude that it is largely their requirements for land which matter ina strategic plan.   We take the view that the need for land forother    (primarily housing) needs in London is so great that theCouncil should satisfy itself that it really is essential that land is used in London for these purposes.   We recommend thatthe Council should examine critically any proposal to expandhigher education in London and should discuss x^hether existingactivities must be retained.    It should study   whether   thedemand for land for hospitals can be reduced.   We are also concerned about, and recommend that all steps should be takento reduce, the impact of the student population on the privaterented sector of the housing market.25.7h-        We considered the provisions in the Plan relating to high buildings, plot ratios, daylighting and sunlighting.    Werecommend the last two be deleted from the Plan.    They are notstrategic matters and can be dealt with in local plans. This istrue generally of plot ratios, except for the Central Area andfor Growth Areas.  -In the former case, we recommend that, inmaking local plans, the London Borough Councils should considerwhether plot ratios should be lower than at present and that
control should be strictly exercised.    In the latter case werecommend that care should be taken that plot ratios are sufficiently high to encourage development, while still ensuring;a good standard of development.25.75 We broadly   support the Council&apos;s proposals tocontrol high buildings by means of dividing London into areas where high buildings are appropriate or otherwise.    We do notthink the policy sensible, however, unless there is a map toindicate where the areas are.    We recommend, therefore, that you should not formally approve the proposals until a suitablediagrammatic map is produced to your satisfaction.MONITORING25.76 We attach great importance to the establishment bythe GLC of an effective system of monitoring.    By this, we mean a system for the collection, analysis and publication ofmaterial which is designed to enable authorities and the public to follow the success, or otherwise, of the policies of the plan and to judge the effectiveness of changed policies if theyprove necessary.   While the GLC has collected much information,we do not consider that it possesses an effective system inthis sense.    It should have one whose results should be made public at stated intervals.CONCLUSION25.77 If our Report ha3 one theme, it is to establish links between on the one hand, aims and aspirations and, on the other,the policies needed to bring them about.    Our basic criticism of the Plan is that there are, too often, either no links between its aims and policies, or no policy at all to support a wholly desirable aim.    We attempt not to recommend aims unless we can also recommend policies which are likely to achievethem.    Where we are not able to do so we reject the aim,desirable though it may be, as unrealistic.
ANNEX B, &quot;GREATER LONDON DEVELOPMENT PLAN  Draft Statement by the Secretary of State for the Environment.1.      INTRODUCTION1A.     The Government are today publishing the Report of the Panel of inquiry into the Greater London Development Plan, and in view of the exceptional importance of the Plan and the need to dispel as muchuncertainty as possible about London&apos;s future they are issuing at thesame time this statement of their initial conclusions.1.       The Greater London Council submitted the Plan for approval inAugust 1969.     This was as ambitious a venture in metropolitan planningas has ever been attempted in this country.      It had to cover an areaof over 600 square miles and nearly 7&quot;! million population, and to dealwith a wider range of subjects than had ever before been tackled in atraditional development plan.     It was (in terms of the planninglegislation enacted in 1968) to be treated as a Structure Plan whichwould establish the framework for planning roads, housing and other-urban activities in London over the next tv/o decades.2.       The Government of the day decided that because of the unprecedented-dented scale of the Plan and of the great public interest in it, itshould be subjected to a special process of examination and inquiry,and accordingly they set up a Panel of Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Mr Prank Layfield, Q.C., to examine the proposals, hear objections,and review alternative strategies.     The Panel sat on 237 days over aperiod of nearly two years, and considered some 28,000 objections.They delivered their report on 18 December 1972, and the government thought it right to publish it as soon as it could be printed, togetherwith their own first conclusidns on it.
3. The Government wish to express their gratitude to Assessors^ and Officers of the Panel, who undertook a process of inquiry whichwas without precedent and raised considerable difficulties for allconcerned.     The Government also wish to acknowledge the debt owedby the public to the Greater London Council both for the work theyput into the first preparation of the Plan and for the help theysubsequently gave to the Panel during the process of inquiry.      this involved preparing substantial revisions to the original plan in response to changed circumstances and to the points raised by the Paneland by objectors.L. The Panel&apos;s Report which is now being published is long andcomplicated, and is not only concerned with changes to the submittedPlan, but also contains proposals on local and national government organisation and policy.      It will be many months before theGovernment can complete all the statutory and administrativeprocesses involved in considering the recommendations, proposingmodifications, considering further representations and making allthe final decisions which will lead ultimatelv to a fully revised and approved Plan.     Ordinarily the Panel&apos;s recommendations wouldnot be published until the Government&apos;s provisional conclusions couldbe exhibited alongside them, but there are good reasons to adopta special procedure in this case.     First, there has never been a Plan of such wide scope, nor an Inquiry which concerned   .itself so deeply with the principle on which such a Plan should bebased.      Secondly, planning in London - particularly planning fortraffic, an endemic problem in a city of such a size - is in dangerof coming to a halt.     Thirdly, what is decided for London is not of importance to London alone;    other planning authorities have to
prepare their own plans within the broad framework of the strategic Plan for the South-East, which has itself to beresponsive to the needs of the Greater London area.      It thereforseems to the Government to be necessary to introduce into the planning process in London a measure of certainty such as hasnot existed in the past throe years.5. The Government strategy for dealing XV ITH this Plan istherefore as follows -(a) Along with the publication of the Panel&apos;s Report theGovernment are providing in this statement an indication of the views they have formed on certain major issues.They are not at this stage committed to any of the specific modifications to the Plan that the Panel proposefor the present they are concerned only to enunciate someof the decisions of principle and general policy whichwill guide them in developing, in consultation tvith the glc and other bodies as appropriate, more detailed proposals for modifying the Plan.(b) Other statements of this kind will be made public, as and when the Government are in a position to make them.Later this year, the Department of the Environment will begin to promulgate formally the more important draftmodifications which the Government are minded to make tothe Plan.      Under &quot;well established procedures these draftmodifications will be subject to further public scrutiny

Under well established procedures these draftmodifications x^ill be subject to further public scrutiny
and if necessary further public inquiry.      If necessary as Secretary of State will make use of my power to approve the Plan in stages.6. Many of the provisions of the amended plan will involvea heavy call on physical and financial resources over twenty years or more.      In making this first statement, the government do not commit themselves to a detailed and precisely phasedlong-term pattern of investment.     Decisions on the execution of major investment projects deriving from the Plan can be takenonly when those projects have been developed in much more detail;and will still depend on the availability of resources and thestrength of competing demands at that time.     But this does notdiminish the need, to establish a policy framework within which further work can be done.7. The most urgent matters arising from the Plan and the panel&apos;s Report arePopulation and EmploymentHousingTransport, traffic and roads.There are other issues arising from the Plan and the Report;    theswill be covered in future statements.2.      POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT8. The Panel rightly recognise that population and employment are   closely inter-related and fundamental to the proper planning of London; and rightly deal with them at the beginning of theirreport.

POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT8. The Panel rightly recognise that population and employment are   closely inter-related and fundamental to the proper planning of London; and rightly deal with them at the beginning of theirreport.
9. The population of London has been declining for some time,and is likely to continue to do so.      One of the general objectives of the submitted Plan was to try to restrain thisdecline;    this on the grounds that on present trends the level of population in 198&apos;t would be too low, and the rate of declineleading to it too fast, for the good of London as a whole.      Inparticular the GLC feared that these trends would lead to imbalancein the demand for and supply of labour, more commuting, higher rate burdens for those remaining in London, and a loss of theyoung, skilled and well-educated people whose continued presencewould be essential to a balanced community.      The Plan accordingly proposed that a 1981  population of about 7.0 to 7.3 million shouldbe aimed for.10. The Panel have rejected this view.      After long study ofall the evidence they conclude that there are no significantdisadvantages to be feared from a lower population than the GLChad envisaged, and advantages to be gained in terms of a morespacious environment for those who remain.      They recognize thatsome cities elsewhere face problems because of the exodus of youngand prosperous families from the inner city, but see no evidenceso far of any marked trends in this direction in London.      Theythink that the GLC should however keep a close watch on the socialeffects of the changing composition and distribution of thepopulation.11. The Panel take the view that in practice the local planning authorities can have only a marginal influence on the size,
odistribution and composition of the population.      Consequentlythey consider that the GLCs population estimates for 1981, whichassume that policies to slow down the decline in London&apos;spopulation can be successfully introduced over that period, areunrealistic.     They conclude, that on the information availableto them the population in 1981 could well be in the range of1.37 million to 6.55 million, and could fall as low as 6 million by 1 991 .12. The Government agree generally with the Panel, and accept that it is right to plan for a population in London that is likelyto be significantly less than 7-0 million in 1981 and couldc ontinue to decline for some years thereafter.      They accept the panel&apos;s suggestion that revised population forecasts should beprepared in the light of the full results of the 1971 Census whenthey become available, and that the GLG should keep the position under continuing review.     For their part the Government will wishto consider the implications that a lower population in Londonwill have for the development of the wider regional strategy.13. During the course of the Inquiry views on the employment situation in London changed in a number of ways.      Partly as aresult of this, partly as a result of new points emerging fromthe Panel&apos;s public sessions, the GLU modified the approach to questions of employment which they had originally adopted in thesubmitted Plan.     The Panel - and the Government in this statement -address themselves primarily to the revised proposals put forward by the GLC in the- later stages of the Inquiry.
confidentsThe GLC&apos; s policies lor employment had two main themes:to use floor space controls to relate labour supply and demand to each other in the various sectors of London;    and to reduce therate at which employment is leaving London.      The Plan was drawnup on the basis that there was likely to be an overall shortage oflabour in London in the 1970&apos;s, but by the time the Inquiry endeda labour surplus was being predicted, at least in certain sectors of the employment market.15&apos; The Panel&apos;s views on employment and on the policiesavailable to local planning authorities to influence it are closely related to their views on population.      Since they consider that over the long term a local planning authority can only marginallyinfluence the scale and location of employment within its area,they say that all that the GLC can realistically aim for in the context of the Plan is to deal x^ith medium term problems in thebalance of labour supply and demand between different employmentsectors in London.     Accordingly they criticize the general approach of the Plan to questions of employment as over-ambitious.16. On specific issues they regard the policy of seeking toreduce the rate at x^hich jobs are leaving London as unjustified.The GLC feared that a continuing exodus of jobs x^ould have an adverse effect on the income of Londoners, principally by removing the jobs which earn good incomes;    but the Panel, after a lengthyreview of the complex evidence on this difficult subject, have come to a quite contrary viex\T:    that on balance a continuingdecline in population and employment at recent rates is likely to
CONFIDENT! At&quot;reduce greater benefit in living and working conditions for everybodyconcerned - both those who stay and those who leave.employment set out in the Plan.      They also think it impossible tomake accurate forecasts of the future scale and location of labour supply and demand.      Because there is no regular relationship between a given amount of office or industrial floor space and the number of people employed, they say that the proposed use of floor spaceallocations is not a practicable means of bringing labour demand and supply into balance, and they recommend that this approach should be rejected.18.        V/ithin London the Panel strongly support the GLCs policy of concentrating new office and industrial development into specificlocations, and they accept, X\Tith some qualifications, the areas listedby the GLC.     As a general proposition the Panel say they do not believethat the deterioration in the quality of life in the centre derivesmainly from excessive employment or lack of people living there, or failure to give priority to other activities.      They believe it due,primarily, to increased traffic and the bulk of new building.19. They further recommend that a group of policies should be written into the Plan to deal with the medium term problems of supplyand demand referred to in paragraph 15 above, and with the rehabilitation of worn-out industrial areas.      These should include use of planningcontrols, improvement of transport, public acquisition of sites, andfinancial assistance.20. The Government broadly accept the Panel&apos;s approach, which willgovern their further consideration of the Plan and their further development of the regional strategy.21. But the Panel&apos;s discussion of employment in London alsoextends to matters of national policy.      In particular they17.In consequence they criticize the two specific policies for
GONFIBEN . SAL&apos;recommend that the system of Office Development Permits should bodiscontinued, on the grounds that it operates only on new office development, requires the agency operating it to make discriminationsof genuine need on which judgements are particularly difficult, and can have only a marginal effect on the total volume and distributionof employment.      They recognize that employment in central Londonimposes social costs on the community which are often not properlymatched by the private costs falling on employers, and recommend thata study should be carried out of a possible system of taxes or charges to correct this disparity.      They further suggest that the policies which at present govern the grant of Industrial Development Certificatesshould be modified to allow greater opportunities for short-distancemoves, and thus encourage the rehabilitation of decaying industrial areas.22* On all these matters the Government will carefully considerthe Panel&apos;s views, but they must at this stage reserve their position.They do however endorse the Panel&apos;s comment that ODPs and IDC1s are essentially Instruments for controlling the national and regionaldistribution of employment, and that there is no reason for transferringcontrol of them to the GLC.3.     HOUSING23. The Panel agree with the view of the GLC that&quot;Improvement of housing is the most vital step in improving the whole environment of London.&quot;Even though the number&quot; of dwellings and the number of households may bebrought into balance by the end of the 1970&apos;s there are likely toremain serious deficiencies:     notably in the condition of the olderhousing stock, much of which is in the private rented sector, and in the concentration of poor housing conditions in certain stress areas, mainly in inner London,     The Government accept this.CuNnuo^l I IML
CONFIDENTIAL2k.The Government agree broadly with the Panel on two basic points;The improvement of the older housing stock must bestepped up.     Action has already been put in hand on this.The provisions of the Housing Act 1969 have been implementedvigorously;    the Government have increased their contributions towards the costs of improvements and conversions of olderhousing undertaken by housing associations;    and a further review of improvement grant policy is in hand.     The increaseof activity so far has been encouraging.      In the year 19&amp;9,10,000 improvement grants were approved in Greater London.In the 12 months from October 1971 to September 1972 thefigure rose to 29,000.     And the Government hope and expect to see further progress in the next few years.ii.      The rate of new house building must be kept up.     Thisis essential if programmes of redevelopment and rehabilitationare to succeed.     It will entail a search for additional landfor housing, and the Panel suggest that it may be necessaryto seek to identify areas in the Green Belt where developmentr\ n m    4- o lm    -r\ 1 n r\ a    t.t -i 4-In    4- V* o    1 00 o f    V* o TJrri   4- r\    4- Vv a    r% nri r* c* T\&quot;4&quot; Anumber of steps have been taken to stimulate new constructionsince the Panel embarked on their Inquiry.     The housing finance Act 1972 will bring new financial help to relieve the problems of high cost faced by housing authorities inLondon.      A Tjondon Housing Action Group, with a MinisterialChairman, was formed in 1971  to co-ordinate the housingactivities of the GLC and the boroughs;    and has already made a significant contribution to a Departmental review ofland requirements.     A consultants&apos; report received last monthCONFsDENTlAl10
confidentialwill open up the possibilities of major, good, new housingdevelopment in the Dockland area of East London where theproblems of both housing deprivation and poor environmentare particularly marked.     The Government are determined to preserve an effective Green Belt round London.     They accept,however, that further study of land requirements for housingmay need to embrace the possible use of land which now serveslittle purpose as Green Belt if new housing in London is tobe built to acceptable environmental standards.     They accept,also, the recommendation for a more limited study by the localauthorities concerned of the uses to which land on the green Belt fringes is being put.2I4A.       The Panel state that unless action is taken to maintain theprivate rented sector and to improve conditions within it,overcroxvding and homelessness will increase.       The Government arereviewing the role of private renting in meeting London&apos;s housing needs, and recognise that, particularly in areas of housing stress,tenants are among those who are subject to the greatest pressures.The improvement of the housing stock, the provisions of the rent Act 1968 for rent regulation and of the Housing Finance Act 1972for rent allowances - now to be extended to furnished tenants bythe Furnished Tenants  (Rent Allowance) Bill - provide a measure of help.     But the Government believe that the problems of housingstress and homelessness cannot be resolved within the context of theprivate rented sector alone.
confidential25.There are two further Panel conclusions which, whilstacceptable in broad principle to the Government, will requireThe Panel suggest that the figure of 20,000 people a yearprovided for in the Plan should be increased to 30,000.The Government wish to reflect further on this.      Inparticular they will want to review the likely absorptivecapcity of the new and expanding towns involved in theLondon overspill programme.ii.     A new general policy (adopting in part a modificationsuggested by the GLC) on density of new family housing.On the one hand they recommend, primarily for environmentalreasons, that there should be no more building at the very high densities previously adopted in some parts of London.On the other hand they wish to prevent building at lowdensities which would waste land for housing.     The Governmentsympathise with the objectives of both these recommendations.further considerati-f*rsr.T    vo pi    -f-V* ftThey are asfollows.x.The rate of overspill housing should be stepped up.
confidentialBut they will need to consider further the implications of the Panel&apos;s specific recommendations, both as to therather narrow range of permitted densities they propose(70 to 100 habitable rooms per acre) and the categories ofexceptions to this range which they envisage.seem to call for immediate comment.      It is that, in their opinion and that of others, there should be an effective strategic housingauthority for Greater London.     They have it in mind not only thatsuch an authority would co-ordinate the planning and programmingof new construction and rehabilitation in the public sector, butthat its existence would be conducive to the creation of a commonwaiting list and a common system of tenancy allocation.      The Panelrecognise that this is outside the scope of the Plan as such, andthe Government will wish to consider it over the longer term.But it must be remembered that both the areas and the functions oflocal authorities in Greater London were reorganised from top tobottom in 1963.      It needs to be recognised that a further substantial change in authorities&apos; powers might bring long-term benefit only atthe cost of short-term loss of effectiveness whilst the changes are brought into operation.      Legislative and administrative developmentsmentioned in the immediately foregoing paragraphs offer a prospect that the co-ordinated policies which the Panel rightly favour maybe achieved within the existing structure.26.There is one other major point on which the Panel&apos;s viewsTRANSPORT TRAPPIC AND ROADSa.The need for a co-ordinated approachThere have been. important develop:
confidentialtransport since the Plan was submitted in 1969* and these have been reflected both in the revised draft of the transport sections ofthe Plan put forward by the GLC in the later stages of the inquiry and in the Panel&apos;s comments and recommendations.      The G-LC made animportant contribution to public discussion in their own green paper, &quot;Traffic and the Environment&quot;, which was published inJuly 1972.     More recently we have received a Report on UrbanTransport Planning from the House of Commons Select Committee on expenditure.28. The Panel stress the need for comprehensive and co-ordinatedtransport policies in four major fields:    public transport, traffic management and restraint, improvement of the environment and roadbuilding and improvement.      The Government wholly endorse this view and welcome the progress which the Panel have made in proposingsuch policies for London.     It is not of course possible tointroduce a complete and final set of policies at once.      Policiesneed to be kept under review, and some decisions  (e.g. on the shape of the primary road network) take effect over a much longer time spanthan others.      What is accepted as important is that individualdecisions should be taken in the context of policies for the whole range of relevant topics.29. In the same way the best use of the resources likely to beavailable, and the implications for public expenditure, need to beconsidered comprehensively and account taken of the extent to whichlonger-term commitments to major investment will be capable of adjustment.
CONFIDENTIAL30. It is with these considerations in mind that theGovernment have begun their consideration of the Panel&apos;srecommendations in the transport field.b.      Public Transport31. The Government agree with the Panel that public transport in all forms should be given higher priority than proposed inthe Plan, since it uses fewer resources, serves more people, and does less damage to the environment, than the private car.     they also agree that if it is to do its job properly it must be reliable,convenient and comfortable.     They have themselves alreadyrecognised the urgent need for better public transport   by such measures as committing nearly  125 million in grants for major improvements to London rail services for new London Transport busesand for new bus lanes, and offering grant for a Thames hovercraftservice.32. The Panel make a number of specific proposals for improvingexisting bus and rail services, and these will need to be carefullystudied in consultation x^ith the GLG and the transport operatorsconcerned.     The Government agree with the emphasis the Panel puton developing a system of reserved lanes for buses and taxis, andwelcome the future programme of new lanes announced by the GLCsince the Inquiry.     They also accept the Panel&apos;s views about theneed to improve interchanges betx^een rail, bus and car.33. The Panel recommend a re-examination of the investmentproposals of the British Railways Board and the London Transportconfidential
confidentialExecutive as incorporated in the Plan.     The Government agree thatthis is needed, and have accepted a suggestion made by the GLCthat arrangements should be put in hand Tor a joint study of theLondon commuter services to be carried out by the DOE, the GLC, the this study will not however hold up urgent improvements that are justified in their own right.transport is the present organisation and financial structure,and recommend that the possibility of establishing a new transportauthority for London should be examined.      The Government howeverconsider that the real issues at this stage are ones of policyrather than organisation.      The present organisation dates from as recently as 19&amp;9, when the GLC became the transport planning authority for Greater London.      To some extent the development ofco-ordinated transport policies, as envisaged in *y(jyt has beenretarded by the Inquiry into the Plan itself;    the completion ofthe Inquiry no*w leaves,the way open for full co-operation between all the parties involved.     As to finance, the Government arealready considering major changes in the system of grants to localauthorities towards the costs of all forms of transport, includingBRB and the 1te, under the direction of an independent chairmanThe Panel suggest that a major obstacle to improving publiroads.c.Traffic Management and Restraint35.The Government accept that improved public transport and
confidentialnew road building on any realistic scale will still need to be accompanied by better traffic management which will canalisetraffic on to the most suitable routes, and by increased trafficrestraint.      Such measures will reduce the demand for road space,agree with the GLC and the Panel that it is right to make the owners of vehicles, rather than their drivers, liable for parking and similar offences which attract fixed penalties, and legislation forthis purpose will be introduced as soon as possible.      They alsoaccept the Panel&apos;s general views about the need to limit the amountof parking, both on-street and off-street, especially in inner london, and will be examining the Panel&apos;s specific recommendations in consultation with the GLC as traffic authority.-     The GLC havealready set out some possible changes in present parking controlsin the Green Paper mentioned in paragraph 27 above.37. The Panel regard parking controls as inadequate by themselves, and recommend the early introduction of a scheme of area licensing, under which a supplementary licence would be needed to use a car in certain parts of London.      For the longer termthey look to road pricing as the best means of rationing the useof available road space.     The Department of the Environment arealready carrying out a study of different techniques for restrainingtraffic, including both area licensing and road pricing, andfollowing this it may be appropriate to have a practical test ofthe administrative and operational problems involved in the latter.relieve congestion, and protect the environment.36.As regards parking controls, the Government entirely
-    CONFIDENTIALIt should be stressed however that premature introduction of such measures could raise economic and social problems as well asrisking damage to the environment through the diversion of traffic on to unsuitable roads.d.      Roads38. The road proposals in the Plan were the most controversialof all, accounting for about 21,000 of the 28,000 objections.It is in this field above all that the Government feel that early decisions of principle i^ill serve to allay public uncertainty andcurtail property blight.      The road proposals in the submitted Planare illustrated at Figure 1 and the Panel&apos;s alternative proposals atFigure 2.    None of these road proposals was concerned with precisealignments, nor is any of the Government&apos;s conclusions as set out in thefollowing paragraphs39* The submitted Plan postulated the construction of threeorbital Ringways:Ringway 1, narrowly skirting inner London.Ringway 2, running through the suburbs, roughly along the line of the present North and SouthCircular Roads.Ringway 3, skirting the GLC boundary.k1. London&apos;s system of mainly radial roads is ill-adapted toorbital movement, which is particularly important to much commercialtraffic.     Among the consequences of this deficiency are heavycongestion of the radial system, especially in the centre and at other nodal points, severe economic penalties through inefficientmovements of goods and people, and great environmental damage from

They took this view with full regardto their recommendations for much greater restraint of traffic formany improvements in public transport, and in the light of theirviews about the likely future levels of population and employment.In the Governments view they were plainly right to do so.. The Panel propose that Ringway 1 should remain in thePlan, with one important change;    namely that at the easterlyend it should not, as proposed, cross Blackheath but should berouted through Deptford and cross the river to the Isle of Dogs.The Government agree that an inner motorway is needed to relievecongestion in central London, and accept in principle that Ringway 1should remain in the Plan.      They will need further time to considerthe proposed alteration to the eastern section, the implications ofwhich will have to be considered along with decisions yet to betaken on the future of Dockland.      They therefore reserve theirviews both on this alteration and on the associated proposal fora Dover Radial Road which has been the subject of separate inquiry.Ii2. As regards Ringway 2, the Panel propose that the southerlysection  sw- the&apos; M20 in the east to the Mix in the west should be struck out of the Plan, with the present North Circular Roadremaining in existence as an improved all-purpose road.     Again,the Government; accept the Panel&apos;s recommendation in principle.
COiv4riuciM l IAUlj.3. As regards Ringway3, the Panel suggest that the wholesouthern and western sections (from the M20 in the south east to theA1 in the north west) should he struck out.     The Government need more time to consider this.     Some provision will have to be madefor orbital movements in these areas, and it will be necessary to study further whether the need can best be met by a motorway on theline of Ringway 3 or by other road improvements.     To some extentthis will depend on how far the proposed South OrbitalRoad, and the north western sector of the North Orbital Road, whichare outside the GLC boundary, can be made to carry this traffic,ijif. The Panel propose that a number of main roads runninginto London should be extended to join the proposed Ringway 1 , andthat the route of some others should be amended.      The government accept this in broad principle, and are initiating studies of the recommended amendments.45. The Panel are critical of the proposals in the Plan fora network of secondary roads.     The Government accept that theseproposals will need to be re-examined, especially in the light ofthe main decisions of principle about the primary roads and abouttraffic management and restraint.      But they consider that untilnew proposals can be worked out the proposals in the Plan should serve as the basis for planing and carrying out schemes of high priority involving secondary roads.lj.6. The Panel think that the reduced set of primary roadproposals they have recommended could be implemented in about20 years, and make specific recommendations about their phasing.confidential

The Panel have proposed a new categorization of what are described in the submitted Plan as primary, secondary and localroads.      The Government accept that some change is needed in thenomenclature of roads in London to match the allocation ofresponsibility for them.      The particular nomenclature proposed bythe Panel will need to be studied in the light of the Government1sintention, which the Panel endorse, to transfer responsibilityfor trunk roads in London to the GLC, and of the provision in theTransport (London) Act 1 9&amp;9 under which the GLC will take over responsibility for certain roads from the London Boroughs.5.      CONCLUSION51. The Panel&apos;s report and&apos;this statement are being put onsale through H.M. Stationery Office.      Not everybody&apos;will want to buy copies, however;    and therefore the Department of the environment are also asking local authorities in Londo n to makecopies of the two documents available for reading by interestedmembers of the public.      It is important that the citizens of

The Government hope and expect that by stating-now the conclusions on some of the major issues, and by followingthis up by the announcement of further conclusions, as soon aspracticable, they will not only hasten the statutory processesbut also stimulate confidence in the final preparation of a plan which will be of the utmost importance to the future of the capitcity.52.This statement began by saying that the Government
