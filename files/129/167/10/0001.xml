SteelBritish Steel Corporation: Ten Year Development StrategyI. introduction. On 21st December 1972 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryannounced a strategy for the modernisation and expansion of steel production by the British Steel Corporation (BSC). It involves the commitment of some 3,000 million of resources over the next 10 years a massive investment for thefuture, representing the highest ever sustained level of investment in the industry.The strategy is not free of risk. Moreover the reshaping of a major industry onwhich some communities are dependent inevitably creates employment and social problems. But in the Governments judgment it is the course best calculated to assure for Britain an efficient, profitable, modern industry ableto compete with the rest of the world and to assure future employment, buildingon the great tradition and skills already existing. It is the purpose of this white Paper to explain why, and to show how the Government propose to tackle the social consequences.2. It is upon the efficiency of our steel industry and its ability to supplyproducts of the right quality at the right time and at competitive prices that much of British industry depends to support the growth of its own productionand take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Common market and expanding world trade. The steel investment strategy which the Governmenthave approved will enable BSC to make this vital contribution to economic growth, and at the same time, within a growing world market in steel, to assureBritain&apos;s continuing place among the major steel producers of Europe andthe world.II. Background3. BSC accounts for about 90 per cent of United Kingdom crude steel production:1968  1969  1970  1971    1972UK (million ingot tonnes*) ..      .. 26-3   26-8  28-3  24-2    25-3BSC (million ingot tonnes) ..      ..23-9  24-4  25-6  21-8    22-and supplies about two thirds of finished steel products in the United Kingdom(though the proportion varies from product to product):1968  1969  1970  1971    1972(first 9months)^BSC (per cent)........ 66-1   69-3  70-4  66-6    63-7Private sector (per cent)     ..      .. 24-8  24-4  24-1   24-6    23-9Imports (per cent)t......   9-1    6-3    5-5    8-8    12-4BSC exports directly a substantial tonnage of finished steel products:1968 1969 1970 1971 1972UK (million product tonnes)J .. 4-0 3-6 3-7 4-4 4-2BSC (million product tonnes)       ..   3-6    2-9    2-7    3-7     3-7* The metric tonne of 1000 kilograms,t Latest available figures.t Imports and exports tend to rise at times when svorld steel demand is low and supplies arein surplus, and to fall as demand picks up and the pressure on supplies increases.
4. Between 1955 and 1970, the trend growth in United Kingdom steeldemand averaged 1-7 per cent per annum, though there were large cyclicalfluctuations:30,----1co1955 1960 1965 1970UK steel demand (home deliveries)With the much improved prospects for national economic growth, UK steeldemand in the 1970s is likely to grow 50 per cent faster, because of rising demandfor investment goods, consumer durables, motor cars and equipment for north Sea oil exploitation; for all of these BSC is the principal UK steel supplier.Our accession to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) placesBSC in a market which consumed some 120 million tonnes of crude steel in1972 and which has excellent prospects of continuing growth. World steeldemand is expected to increase at 4-5 per cent per annum up to 1980 andcross-frontier trade to grow even faster. Steel demand in the UK, as in otherindustrially-developed countries, will grow more slowly than the gross national product: it is a common feature of developed economies that steel usage per unit of national product falls as development progresses.5. All the major steel-producing nations have plans to expand steelmakingcapacity:Crude steelmaking capacity in 1971 and planned capacity in 1975*		(m. tonnes)	1971	1975West Germany     ......	......     57-S3	66 l3Belgium	......     15-63	18-43France       ........	......     27-23	34.73Italy ..........	......    22-53	30-43Luxembourg	......      6-13	6-43Netherlands	......      6-33	7.43USA..........	......      1251	1501Japan        ..	..   116-71	1442* Sources: (1) Economic Commission for Europe.

6. During the past decade the world steel industry&apos; has been troubled byexcess capacity. Except at peaks in the steel demand cycle, prices have beendepressed to relatively unprofitable levels. Looking to the future, however, BSCbelieves that the world steel industry now recognises the need to match theexpansion of capacity much more closely to the expected growth of demand:and the Corporation^ considered judgment is that the medium-term outlook for the world steel industry in general, and for BSC in particular, is promisingand justifies substantial investment in further steelmaking facilities in Britain.7. The steel industry&apos; operates in a highly competitive international environ-ment. To earn its share of an expanding world market, BSC must both minimisecosts and ensure that the quality of its products matches the increasinglyexacting standards required by consuming industries.8. The use of rich foreign ores transported in large bulk carriers, of largemodern blast furnaces and of large scale steel plant employing the basic oxygen(BOS) process all offer major cost savings. Costs will be lowest therefore atintegrated iron and steel %vorks which have ready access to a deep water oreterminal and preferably a capacity of 6m tonnes or more a year. This is the pattern now being followed by the steel industry world-wide in the constructionof new works, examples being:Fos (France) .. .. 3-5m tonnes by 1975 7m tonnes by 1980Dunkirk (France) 4m tonnes now 8m tonnes by 1975Taranto (Italy)..      ..   3-9m tonnes now 10-5m tonnes by 1980Fukuyama (Japan)   ..   12m tonnes now 16m tonnes by 1974Oita (Japan)   ..      ..    4m tonnes now 12m tonnes eventually9. Electric arc steelmaking still holds pride of place for the production ofspecial steels. Small steelworks using electric steelmaking and continuous casting,usually with capacities of a few hundred thousand tonnes a year, are alsocompetitive for a limited range of more general products and in close proximity to their markets, where there is enough scrap for them. Looking further ahead,pre-reduced iron is likely to be used as a partial alternative to scrap, depending on improvement in the economies of direct reduction processes.10. But for bulk steelmaking the large modern blast furnace and the basicoxygen process are likely to hold sway for many years; and the economies of scale at large coastal works are such that in most circumstances there is a significant saving in concentrating production there, even if the semi-finished steel is then transported to an inland works to be finally converted into finished steel products. But concentration of modern steelmaking at a few large worksmeans that older and smaller units at less suitable sites must be phased out,with the loss of the jobs in them. Already since nationalisation employment inBSC has been reduced by over 31,000. This process, which causes difficultsocial problems, must be expected to continue.HI.   The planning process11. Investment planning in BSC starts with an assessment of marketprospects ten years ahead. In the light of this a strategy is framed indicatingin broad terms the scale and pattern of facilities offering the best returns. Thisbecomes the basis of bsc&apos;s corporate plan. It is such a strategy which BSCand the Government have now setded.
12. The strategy must be firm enough, especially as regards the majordevelopments, to guide current investment planning. Nevertheless there is bound to be uncertainty about prospects so far ahead and they will be re-assessedeach year, and the timing of developments reviewed, when the corporate pianis rolled forward and discussed with the Government.13. BSC prepares annually a five year programme of investment based onthe strategy for submission to the Government. In this way the government can review the progress of the strategy before giving firm approval to capitalexpenditure for the second year of the programme and provisional approval for the third year.14. A detailed appraisal is made of each project, in accordance with theeconomic principles described in Nationalised Industries: A Review of Economicand Financial Objectives (Cmnd. 3437), before final approval is given by the BSCBoard. The procedures agreed between the Government and the Corporationprovide for full details of theappraisal of projects of major significance to be givento the Department of Trade and Industry, so that the Government may take a view on these projects before they are submitted to the BSC Board for final approval.15. These arrangements will not be significantly affected by our accession toECSC. The European Commission periodically produces a statement of general objectives for the industry&apos;s guidance. BSC, like all Community steel enterprises,will be required to notify the Commission of its investment projects beforeplacing contracts, and the Commission may issue opinions on such projects to the enterprise and Government concerned. These opinions are advisory andare not binding on enterprises.IV.  The pattern of development proposed by BSC16. Investment in the British steel industry during the mid-1960s was lowcompared with that of its international competitors, and the companies fromwhich the Corporation was formed in 1967 were, in general, financially weak.Nationalisation brought to BSC a large number of works with obsoleteInvestment in UK iron and steel industry and BSC at 1972 prices  million	UK Steel		Industry^	BSC1960	276	1961	370	1962	299	1963	171	1964	137	1965	123	1966	115	1967	128	1968	119	911969	125	881970	178	1311971	25 If	212t1972 (Estimated)		2181973 (Estimated)		230* Source: National Income and Expenditure 1972 (adjusted to 1972 prices),t Provisional figures.
technology and low productivity. Over the period 1964-1970 inclusive,investment at 1972 prices averaged little more than  130 million p.a. Since then the rate of investment has approximately doubled.Over the next 10 years, BSC investment is expected to average some  300 million a year (see paragraph 37).17. The need to rationalise the Corporation^ inheritance has been common ground, from the time of nationalisation to the present day, both in parliament and between management and labour in the industry. bsc&apos;s first developmentstrategy concentrated on exploiting the potential of the existing plants at fivemajor steel works: Port Talbot, Llanwern, Scunthorpe, Lackenby and Ravens-craig. By 1970 all the major projects involved were under way or firmly planned and consideration of the second development strategy, covering the rest ofthe decade, began.18. The framework for this strategy was considered by the Joint steering group (JSG), a joint Government/Corporation group set up to examine BSCsdevelopment and financial position. The Group&apos;s conclusion, reported to theHouse of Commons by the Minister for Industry on 8th May 1972, was thatthe Corporation would need capacity of between 28 and 36 million ingot tons*in 1980-81; it recommended that the Corporation should evaluate alternative courses within that range. BSC carried out a detailed evaluation exercise inthe light of which the Board decided on their preferred strategy.19.  Its main features were:(a) a continuing planning process, with considerable flexibility, avoidingpremature commitment to fixed tonnage targets and dates;(b) a programme taking the Corporation^ capacity from its present27 million tonnes to 33-35 million tonnes of liquid steel by the late1970s and to 36-38 million tonnes during the first half of the 1980s;(c) within those ranges, the five existing major steelmaking plants at port Talbot, Llanwern, Scunthorpe, Lackenby and Ravenscraig shouldeach be brought up to its optimum capacity (in the case of Port Talbot,to about 6 million tonnes); a start should be made as soon as possible on a new steel complex located on the south bank of the Tees; and perhaps two new smaller electric arc steelworks should be built, oneof which should be located in Scotland.20. The Board resolved to develop new and improved arrangements for consultation on closures and to improve the compensation given on redundancyor redeployment, and to continue to co-operate to the full with Government andother agencies in finding alternative industry to provide new jobs in areasaffected by steelworks closures.V.  The Governments consideration of the proposals21. The BSC Board chose this strategy because they judged it likely tobring the best returns. The Corporation has been set the objective of achievingan average return on net assets of 8 per cent over the four years to March 1977,and at least as high a return will be expected thereafter.* Equivalent to 28-37 million tonnes in round figures.
22. The Government in addition had to consider the wider implications for the national interest, in particular:\ i i J     i i  i i ^ *. 11VJ      tllV     ,HI tl IV^,J     1      J &apos; 1 VJv.Ill.VU     Mil    UVVV^/IU LT1V     U   &apos;V-     VI      lllkf     -HUM lUilUUteconomic resources required, i.e. that the return on the investmentwas likely to match that expected if the resources were used in otherways;(b) the steel supply needed by British industry as a basis for future growth and the effect on the balance of payments;(c) the effect on employment, both generally and in particular areas, andthe balance of development between regions;(d) the implications for public expenditure.23. In considering these factors the Government, like the Corporation,recognised that BSC operates in a world market; its prices will be determined by international prices. Attempts to charge more would result in lost market share.Equally, the competitively-determined world prices are unlikely to leave BSCmuch scope to cut its own prices and still make adequate returns on the national resources entrusted to it; and Government subsidies to offset poor financialperformance cannot be given under ECSC rules. Moreover excess capacitycould endanger employment. The Government therefore paid particular atten-tion to the robustness of the proposed strategy if the market for steel turned out either better or worse than had been assumed.24. The strategy relates both to the total capacity to be attained and to the plant configuration to be employed in attaining it. These two aspects are considered separately in what follows.Total capacity25. Discussion in the JSG highlighted the implications of aiming at highand low capacity. Broadly, a low course would aim at a much reduced share of export markets and some reduction in the Corporation^ share of the home market. Its advantage would be that a better return might be expected onthe new investment in unfavourable market conditions. But it would offer lessscope for modernisation than a higher capacity course and leave no room for having a new works of modern design. It would neither obtain the lowestpossible operating costs, nor provide as good a base for subsequent expansionas a higher course.26. A course aiming at a high capacity would avoid these disadvantagesand would take full advantage of modernisation to reduce production costs and improve product quality. It would equip the industry to meet the growing,and increasingly exacting, demands of consuming industries without highimports and so to contribute to economic growth; and enable it to stand up to world competition and to win a good share of export markets.27. But to aim too high, or decide on a fixed target of capacity to be achieved by a particular date, irrespective of the way the market might develop, wouldbe foolhardy. Because of the penalties of running large-scale modern steel
plant below capacity, and the uncertainty about prices in the world market,such a course would involve great risk; for although it might provide moreemployment and be more profitable in the best market conditions, jobs wouldbe in jeopardy and financial returns reduced if the growth of remunerativesales outlets did not match the capacity to which we had become inflexiblycommitted.28. The Government, like the Corporation, recognised the advantages ofa bold high-investment course, but had been concerned about this element ofrisk, particularly the risks to the long-term security of employment. they therefore welcomed the emphasis placed on flexibility in bsc&apos;s proposals.Within the agreed strategy decisions will be taken in the light of developmentsover the decade, including market trends and the changing efficiency of individual works. The right timing will be important both for major develop-ments and for closures.29. The Government are satisfied that, with the agreed arrangements for regulating the timing of the major developments (see section III), the proposedstrategy is the right basis on which to develop firm investment programmes.It takes full advantage of the scope for modernisation while minimising therisk.30. Social implications and the balance of development between regionsinfluenced both the Corporation and the Government in their approach to the strategy throughout its preparation and consideration. Because of the highproductivity of large modern plant the number of jobs which the industry would offer would not rise proportionately with total capacity; it is moreaffected by the plant configuration which is adopted.Plant configuration31. The concentration of bulk steelmaking at a few main sites will reducetotal manpower and create difficult problems for some communities dependenton the smaller works which have to close. These problems might be lessened byredeveloping some smaller works so as to attain the same total capacity with less concentration.32. This possibility was examined both by the Corporation in preparingits strategy and by the Government. But it would not be in the best interestsof the industry as a whole, including those employed in it. It would meanforegoing scale economies and the advantages of large modern plant on coastalsites. Costs would be increased, and the Corporation would be less able to stand up to competition. Thus employment at large in the industry would beat risk. The Government judged it right to face and tackle the problems causedby closures for the sake of building an industry capable of achieving long-termprosperity and so providing secure employment.33. Most of bsc&apos;s works are in assisted areas, and altering the pattern ofdevelopment to forestall job losses at one place would mean fewer jobs in another. However, attention was also paid to the needs of steel-using industries in the regions and the effects on the regional economies of major changes in
the pattern of steel production. This was a matter of concern to Scotland,which has important steel-using industries such as shipbuilding, engineering and North Sea oil development. The Government were satisfied, however,that a wide range of products would continue to be produced in Scotland.They concluded that there was no case for asking BSC to depart from theproposed pattern of development in order to change the balance betweenregions.34. Special consideration was given to the location of the proposed newsteelmaking complex. The Corporation chose Teesside because of its com-mercial advantages. Teesside offered the possibility of capital savings throughjoint development with the existing Lackenby works and the better utilisation of its plant. These and other cost advantages meant that the choice of any othersite for such a complex would have imposed a cost penalty of the order of 20 million a year according to bsc&apos;s estimate. The Government heard repre-sentations from local interests at all the possible sites, and made a detailed examination of social and employment implications, environmental suitability,infrastructure provision, etc. They concluded that, if anything, the balance ofsuch considerations reinforced the commercial case for Teesside, especially as theNorth East has suffered most from the fall in steel employment that has already taken place.VI.  Implications of the strategyThe pattern of steel production35. Implementation of the agreed strategy will bring major changes in the pattern of the Corporation^ plants. The now obsolete open-hearth furnaceswill be closed before the end of the decade. Bulk steelmaking by the oxygenprocess will be concentrated at the five main existing plants and the new Teessideworks. Electric arc steelmaking will continue for stainless and alloy steels, andthis capacity will be modernised and expanded; there will also be some modernelectric steelmaking capacity for general steels. These works together areexpected eventually to provide the whole of the Corporation^ steelmaking.At other centres steelmaking will eventually be phased out, although BOSand electric arc steelmaking will continue at some of the smaller plants untilat least the end of the decade. Moreover, finishing operations will continue ata large number of works for the foreseeable future; the cost of transportingsemi-finished steel to such works for processing will be more than offset by the economies derived from concentration of steelmaking. Further details of theprospects for the main works are given in section VII.Employment36. Modernisation means fewer jobs, but is essential if the remaining jobs areto be securely based. Labour productivity in the new Teesside works is expected tobe about 800 tonnes a man year, as against 250 tonnes in bsc&apos;s best presentworks. BSC estimates that full implementation of the new developments andclosures in the strategy should more than double average labour productivity and reduce manpower by about 50,000. Closures already announced before the strategy was settled account for over 20,000 of this reduction. The decision onthe strategy means an additional 30,000 net job losses, mainly in the second halfof the decade. The effect will be severe in certain places, but the annual impact
overall will not be out of proportion with the average rate of reduction in em-ployment since nationalisation; it will be markedly below the 23,000 fall in theCorporation^ manpower in the single year ending 31st March 1972.Capital expenditure37. The Corporation calculated that simply to maintain the existing assetstructure would cost up to  200 million a year. The strategy will require total capital expenditure averaging some  300 million a year, at March 1972 prices.Annual expenditure will rise until around 1976/77 but should be in line with theannual figures published in Public Expenditure to 1976-77 (Cmnd. 5178).Annual levels thereafter will be determined in the light of commercial and public expenditure considerations. The Corporation estimates that more than half theexpenditure can be met from depreciation provisions and retained profits;the remainder would be financed from public funds. Parliamentary authority will be sought at the appropriate time to increase bsc&apos;s borrowing powers.The private sector38. The private sector supplies about a quarter of UK requirements forfinished steel products (paragraph 3), and its continued vigour and prosperityare important to the nation. The Government are satisfied that bsc&apos;s investmentstrategy does not threaten the place of the private sector or its ability to continueplaying an effective role.39. The private sector too needs to keep itself in good shape to meet itscustomers&apos; changing requirements and to seize new trade opportunities. high quality and low costs are as vital to the private companies as to the Corporation.Many private companies take semi-finished steel from the Corporation, and theCorporation^ plans for raising quality and reducing costs will directly benefitboth them and the nation.40. A number of private companies themselves have plans for modernisation and new capacity. The Government welcome such moves, and will be willingto consider proposals under the Industry Act 1972 for assistance in appropriate cases.The plant and construction industries41. An investment programme of over  3,000 million in 10 years offers the plant, construction and supplying industries a home market in which theycan prove their competitiveness with world leaders in the field. BSC has hadinitial discussions with supplying industries and will continue to keep in close touch with them about the requirements of the strategy. The Corporation is confident that the programme can be carried through successfully and believesit will provide or maintain employment opportunities for about 75,000 people in a wide range of industries and services.Foreign trade42. The investment strategy is expected substantially to increase the favour-able balance of trade on bsc&apos;s operations. The Corporation^ tentativecalculations indicate that by 1982/83 its exports of steel could be worth well
over  500 million a year (at 1972 prices). After allowing for imports of rawmaterials at about  300 million, there would be a favourable balance of well over  200 million a year.VII.  The prospect for the regions and the main works43. The following table shows rounded estimates of employment reductionregion by region under the strategy. It allows for all the possible closures (andnew developments) arising from the strategy, although some of them may notoccur in the next 10 years. Firm decisions will be taken only as developmentproceeds. Moreover, since some of the plant closures are alternatives, the tableexaggerates the likely net loss of jobs from closures and new developmentsunder the strategy.Estimated net reductionover period of strategy			BSC		Of which, netRegion	Total male	BSC	reduction		reductions	employment	employment July 1967-			already	March 1972	March 1972	Dec. 1972	Total	announced up					to 21st Dec.					1972Scotland	1,201,000	25,100	2,300	6,500	6,500Northern	767,000	40,600	10,600	6,000*1	1,000North West	1,665,000	10,200	4,000	3,500	2,500Yorks/Humber	1,193,000	44,600	4,400	4,000i	3,500E.

The steel industry in Scotland will be modernised and expanded. Allopen-hearth steelmaking furnaces will close by the end of the decade butinvestment in modern plant will raise bsc&apos;s steelmaking capacity in Scotlandfrom its present 3-7 million tonnes to 4-1- million tonnes by the early 1980s.The BOS plant at Ravenscraig is to be brought up to a capacity of about-2 million tonnes a year. In addition the Corporation will embark upon the progressive development of a new electric arc plant of up to 1 million tonnescapacity which is likely to be put at Hallside. This plant will probably be supported at some stage by a direct reduction plant producing pelletised iron* Allows for 7,500 new jobs in new works.t Allows for 6,500 possible job losses from closure of steelmaking at Corby but see paragraph59.J Allows for closure of steelmaking and associated activities at Consett and Cleveland arcplant in the Northern Region, and at Normanby Park and Templeborough in Yorks/Humber but see paragraph 54.
at Himterston. There will be substantial investment at the Clydesdale tube works and a modernisation of plate mill facilities at Dalzell. Modern rolling plant willbe retained at most of Scotland&apos;s existing works. In particular, finishingoperations at Glengarnock will continue. These developments will ensure thatScotland has an up-to-date and balanced steel industry providing a wide range of steel products; and some new high grade speciality products will also beintroduced. Scotland will therefore remain an attractive location for engineering and other steel-using industries.45. The Corporation announced in June 1972 that open-hearth steelmakingand, in some cases, primary rolling will cease during the next five years or so atClyde Iron/Clydebridge, Lanarkshire, Dalzell, Glengarnock and Ravenscraig.46. Allowing for the new employment generated by the planned investment,the net manpower reduction from all these developments is likely to be about,500, the bottom of the range of 6,500-7,500 job losses already announced by BSC in June 1972.Wales47. The steel industry in Wales too will be modernised and expanded toraise bsc&apos;s steelmaking capacity to about 10 million tonnes. Investment in wales could be as much as  900 million (March 1972 prices) over the decade,i.e. 30 per cent of the total planned. Port Talbot will be expanded fromits present capacity of about 3 million tonnes to about 6 million tonnes, withsome 1,300 new jobs, to provide high quality, competitively priced, flat products.With the help of this investment future employment in the Welsh tinplate works at Ebbw Vale, Trostre and Velindre, and at the finishing works at Shotton, willbe assured. Llanwem is being brought up to 3-8 million tonnes capacity from itspresent capacity of about 2 million tonnes; this and other developmentsplanned there could provide about 1,500 new jobs.48. Nonetheless this investment in Wales will not prevent a heavy loss of jobs, some stemming from decisions the Corporation had taken earlier.49. BSC has announced its proposal to close open-hearth steelmaking atShotton together with associated iron making and the hot strip mill during thesecond half of the decade, with the loss of 6,500 jobs. Because of the socialimpact on the area a special study was made of the alternatives. Replacementby modern plant on an economic scale would save only some of the jobs ofthose presently employed. It would cost over  200 million and its production costs would not match those of extra capacity at Port Talbot. BSC calculationsshowed that hot-rolled coil for the Shotton mills would cost substantially moreif produced in redeveloped iron and steelmaking plant at Shotton than ifdelivered from the expanded Port Talbot. Because of the cost penalty theCorporation was forced to conclude that replacement of Shotton steelmakingcould not be justified. Shotton, however, will continue as a major finishing works,employing some 6,000 men, and the market for its products is expected to growrapidly.
50. Ebbw Vale will have a secure future as a major tinplate and galvanisedsheet finishing plant in which there will be substantial further investment.However, following the Corporation^ announcement in 1970 on the future ofsteelmaking, BSC announced in November 1972 its proposals to close iron andsteelmaking in 1975 and 1976 and the hot strip mill later in the decade with,in all, the loss of about 4,500 jobs.51. After discussion with GKN the Corporation announced on 29thDecember 1972 that open-hearth steelmaking plant at East Moors in Cardiffmust close within the next five years with the loss of some 4,500 jobs (this is included in the table at paragraph 43). GKN are considering installation of theirown electric arc steelmaking plant (with 400-500 new jobs) but if they decide thatthey would prefer to continue taking their supplies from BSC the corporation is ready to build a similar plant in the Cardiff area.52. Discussions between BSC and GKN are continuing on future ownership of the Corporation^ Brymbo works near Wrexham.England53. The Northern Region has borne the brunt over a third of thereduction in BSC manpower since nationalisation. Some further closures are inevitable (e.g. the Cargo Fleet section mill). However, it is to be the site of a major new works. Teesside will by the 1980s have one of the largest and mostmodern steel complexes in Europe. The existing Lackenby steelworks will be expanded to over 5 million tonnes capacity; the new works will provide about,500 new jobs. Together they will constitute a complex having an eventualcapacity of over 12 million tonnes. Investment in the region will account for about one-third of the total planned, i.e. about  1,000 million at 1972 pricesover the next 10 years.54. Concentration of bulk steelmaking at the new Teesside works and thefive main works means that most of the smaller steelmaking plant has a limitedfuture. However, steelmaking and associated activities at Consett, Clevelandarc plant, Normanby Park and Templeborough are expected to continue untilthe latter part of the decade. At Consett the steelworks is the major employer.One or more of these four works might well have a longer-term future as a supplementary source of steelmaking for billet production. BSC will take decisions in the light of developments during the next few years in consultationwith those concerned.55. The Corporation announced on 1st February 1973 that the closure of theremaining iron and steelmaking at Hartlepool (2,850 jobs) will be completed in 1975/76. The plate mill (which together with ancillary services employs1,700 men) will continue, though if it is decided to incorporate a new plate millin the Teesside complex the Hartlepool mill would close when the new capacitybecame available, possibly towards the end of the decade.56. Investment in the Yorkshire/Humberside Region is likely to be about a quarter of the total programme. The &quot;Anchor&quot; works at Scunthorpe will befurther developed. The current expansion project there will raise capacity toabout 4-4 million tonnes, and it is planned ultimately to attain over 5 million
tonnes. Sheffield and Rotherham will remain the centre for special steels, andsteel production will be concentrated primarily on the Rotherham and TinsleyPark/Stocksbridge works.57. Only a small proportion of present steelmaking capacity is located inthe Midlands and the North West. As already announced, the remainingopen-hearth plant at Irlam will close by June 1974. That at Bihton, togetherwith the Kaldo steelmaking at Shelton, must also be expected to close during the decade. These three works are among the possible sites for any further electricarc steelmaking plant that might be needed.58. The Corporation has also previously announced the closure of coke ovens, iron making and sinter plant at Stcmton in 1974, but considerable recentinvestment in other plant at this works assures its future as a producer of a variety of iron and concrete products.59. Corby has an assured long-term future as a major tube making plant,and steelmaking will continue there at least for the rest of the present decade.The steelworks is the major employer in the town and a final decision on thefuture of steelmaking will be taken in the course of the next few years inconsultation with those concerned.VTn.  Tackling the social consequences60. It is vital for the Government to pursue policies in order to tackle theproblems created subsequent to plant closures. There is no way of modernisingthe steel industry without job losses and plant closures taking place but thereis a range of methods whereby the problems created by these job losses and plantclosures can be met.(i) There are a number of localities where the steelworks is the majoremployer and the community will be very heavily hit when steelmakingor finishing processes close down.In these cases, well before the closure takes place, it is the intentionof the Government to create an interdepartmental task force drawn from officials from the Department of the Environment, Department ofTrade and Industry, Department of Employment, Department ofHealth and Social Security, Department of Education and Science and,where appropriate, the Welsh Office.A Minister will oversee the progress of each task force and the taskforce will work in close consultation with a wide diversity of local interests. The Secretary of State for Wales has already announced thecreation of three such task forces, for Cardiff, Ebbw Yale and Shotton,which will be responsible to him and will work through the WelshPlanning Board.Task forces have also been announced for Hartlepool, and for theWorkington area where steelmaking is to close at about the end of thisyear, as announced in 1970, and Solway colliery is also to close; thesetask forces will be responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry. Further task forces may need to be established later.Each task force will have as its purpose to identify the measures
needed to improve the environment of the locality concerned, to removedereliction left by industry, to provide modern amenities, to improvecommunications, and above all to attract jobs to that locality.In Scotland, where the prospective job losses are not so highlyconcentrated in particular places, similar but more broadly based workwill be carried out under the direction of the Scottish economic planning Board by a special reconstruction team with membership fromall the relevant Departments. This will be under the supervision of a scottish Office Minister.(ii) The Government have accepted the suggestion of the General Secretaryof the TUC that the Minister for Industry together with the general secretary of the TUC and the Chairman of the British Steel corporation should act as a consultative group to consider arrangements for meetingthe problems of steel redundancies. The Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales will be closely associated with the group when problems affecting their countries are being considered. At the regional levelalso, Government officials will work closely together with representa-tives of the trade unions, the Corporation, local authorities and other bodies with a close interest in the problems in assessing the resourcesof the area and the measures needed to provide new jobs.(iii) The Government will use to the full the wide ranging powers of theIndustry Act 1972 to encourage industrial activity in the localities whereclosures are planned by BSC.(iv) The Government have already announced an advance factory pro-gramme which will provide modern factories in most of the majorareas affected by steelworks closures. Further programmes will be planned to supplement these where necessary.(v) The Department of Employment will work closely with the british steel Corporation to provide the fullest possible help in finding newjobs and advice on retraining.(vi) The Department of Employments Transfer Scheme will apply to thosewho choose to move their home and settle elsewhere in new work.Payments under the scheme are higher for those workers who takeadvantage of a course of retraining.(vii) The British Steel Corporation will play its part in promoting alternative employment. It will clear the vacated industrial sites and offer them for new industrial development or amenity. It will also make availableany of its surplus training capacity for use by employers for trainingredundant steelworkers to whom they offer jobs.(viii) The British Steel Corporation will provide the widest possible oppor-tunities for internal redeployment and retraining. The Corporationrecognises the advantage of giving long notice of its intentions to closeindividual works and will in every instance do this.
(ix) Men who are redeployed within the Corporation and those who aredeclared redundant or retire early will be given special assistance. TheGovernment are negotiating with the European Commission an agree-ment to cover the full range of benefits provided for in Article 56 of theECSC Treaty: these include &quot;tide-over&quot; payments to help steelworkerswho are unemployed or who get new jobs at lower pay, and allowances for those undergoing training for new skills.(x) The Government will continue to pursue policies to sustain a high rate of economic growth so that efforts to provide jobs are made inthe most favourable circumstances.61. The Government have confidence in their powers to encourage thecreation of new employment. The terms of assistance to industry and for improvement to the environment are now more effective than ever and there can,therefore, be confidence that the coming decade will be even more successful in attracting jobs.Printed in England for Her Majcstv*s Stationery Office bv Eden Fisher &amp; Co.
