Paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor EnergyNorth Sea oil will provide Britain with balance of paymentsgains and a new source of Government revenue.    This paper sets out the probable size and duration of these direct benefits and considers how they should be used.1.      How large and permanent are the benefits?2.      The output of North Sea oil will amount to nearly half thenation &apos;s oil requirements during 1977 and should have eliminatedour net oil import bill by 1980.    If the real price of oil remains unchanged, the addition to GNP will be between  3 billion and 4 billion in 1980 (measured in 1976 prices) and around  5 billionin 1985 - figures equivalent to 3-5 P^r cent of our present GNP.3.      One major benefit of North Sea oil comes in the form of savings of foreign currency.    Our underlying balance of payments position is likely to be improved as a result of the oilprogramme by about  5 billion in 1980, rising to  7-8 billion in1985.4.      The other major benefit is that North Sea oil will providea new source of revenue to the Government.    Receipts will be small this year and next while investment costs are beingrecovered.    But in 1979 the revenue is expected to reach overS.11 billion (at 1976 prices) and it will probably rise to atleast  31 billion a year in the mid-1980s.5.      On present evidence it seems likely that oil production will begin to fall off in the late 1980s, although it will continue at a diminishing rate through the 1990s.    The size and timing ofrenewed dependence on oil imports will depend very much on future energy development.    But benefits from North Sea oil as-1-
such, in particular Government revenues from oil production,will necessarily decline.6.      It is important to realise that even at the peak of productionin the mid-1980s the direct benefits from North Sea oil will bemodest in comparison with the size and needs of the economy asa whole.    For example,  oil revenues of about  3! billion a yearmust be put in the perspective of total public sector revenuewhich is already some  50 billion a year and a   present depressedlevel of investment in manufacturing industry which amounts tosome  5 billion a year.7.      The size of the benefits each year after the early 1980s will depend to some extent on how far the Government delays depletionof North Sea oil fields in order to secure a more gradualrundown of production later on and thereby reduce the eventualneed for imports of oil which might be very costly,    But whateverconclusions are reached on control of depletion, oil production will certainly be high enough to provide approximate self-sufficiency throughout most of the 1980s.8.      A brief outline of the Government1s oil policy and factorsinfluencing the size of the oil revenue is set out in the Appendix.2.      What are our objectives?9.      It is important to find ways of using the additional resourcesprovided by North Sea oil which will enable us to achieve full employment, economic growth and rising living standards and maintain them not only while the oil is in flow but after itruns out.10.    This will only come about if the resources of North Sea oilare used as part of an overall economic strategy to ensure thatexpansion is sustainable over a long period.    This strategymust involve public and private services as well as industry,provision of &apos;jobs as well as expansion of output and productivity,the needs of individual areas as well as those of national finance
and the balance cf payments and it should provide for greaterequality as well as economic growth.11.    More specificially we are concerned:a. to raise living standards, reduce inflation andrestore full employment in all parts of the UnitedKingdom - in particular in Scotland, Wales,Northern Ireland and English regions which have suffered most severely from industrial decline;b. to ensure that full employment and highliving standards can be maintained when the oilruns out.12.    These objectives have some immediate implications.    to restore full employment a very large number of extra jobs,possibly as many as 2\ million, will be needed in the next decade and the majority of them must be in regions which have suffered from industrial decline.    A proportion of these willbe found in manufacturing industry; many will have to come fromthe expansion of public and private services of all kinds and inconstruction, transport and distribution.    But such growth of services and other sectors will only be possible if there isat the same time a rapid and sustained increase in industrial production and productivity, involving reorganisation andre-equipment and retraining, in order to meet demand formanufactured goods without a large trade deficit.13.    North Sea oil will only provide modest assistance in makinga start on the programme of economic and social reconstructionwhich is required.    But if we are to adopt a coherent strategythe long-run objectives must be kept clearly In mind.3.      What is the overall strategy within which the oil revenueswill be spent?14.    The economic strategy which accompanies the oil revenues will-3-
be as important as the revenues themselves.    To be effectivethis economic strategy must take account of both immediate and medium term problems of managing the economy.15.    Now that the worst financial problems arising from the risein world oil prices and the world recession have been overcome,the Government has taken steps to start the economy moving aheadeven before North Sea revenues begin to be available on asubstantial scale.16.    The immediate purposes are a controlled expansion ofproduction, to continue reducing inflation and to start improvingliving standards and public services.    Co-operation between thetrade union movement and the Government has been a major reasonfor success in correcting the financial situation and reducinginflation so far.      With the return to more normal collective bargaining and following a period when living standards havebeen squeezed, there are great pressures to improve take-homepay by increasing money wages.17.    The Government has now been able to start reducing the burden,of taxation and this, together with productivity increases asproduction expands, should make it possible for the real take-homepay for working people to increase without needing large moneywage rises which would set off a renewed spiral of inflation.Reduction of taxation, the revival of investment and public spending and the growth of exports will all help to expanddemand and bring about growth of production in the coming year.18.    The approach to a longer-term strategy has been discussed by the Government,  the TUC and the Labour Party and someconclusions were set out in the &quot;The Next Three Years&quot;, expressinga joint commitment to sustained expansion of the economy with adequate planning machinery, recognising that this cannot beleft entirely to market forces.19.    Tho performance of our manufacturing industry since the war has not kept pace with that of our competitors.    Our share of_     -4- -(CONFIDENTIAL)
world trade in manufactured goods has fallen from 2 5 per centin 1950 and 16 per cent in i960 to about 9 per cent now,- althoughit has risen slightly in recent months.    Because of our poor-trading performance we have been unable to raise the&apos; overallgrowth rate of the economy and have had to cut out plans for public expenditure.    The consequence has been a fall in industrialconfidence,  investment and employment and the postponement ofcherished social programmes.20.    There are a number of problems affecting prospects for achieving high investment, full employment and a sustained growth in social spending, which include inflation, world wide recessionand the rapid increase in domestic labour supply.21.    Any strategy for using the benefits of North Sea oil topromote sustained economic recovery in Britain must thereforeensure that the oil revenues are used in expanding home production and employment.    Creation of confidence in a steadilygrowing home market is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for this.    We cannot rest our fate on the assumption that privateindustries, uncoordinated, will respond satisfactorily if leftto themselves.22.    The programme of planned reconstruction will necessitateinvestment of public funds accountable to Parliament and thedevelopment of industrial democracy.    Public agencies such asthe not and the Development Agencies will have a large role toplay in expanding investment, particularly in projects which aim to modernise and expand industry in declining areas and toimprove the industrial infrastructure.    The nationalised industries will have to carry out a great deal of productive investment.    Company investment should be coordinated by planning agreements and the industrial strategy and supported by industry act assistance.    Investment Reserve Funds built up from retainedprofits have been advocated as a mechanism for doing this.23.    Planning must also extend to the service sector and to assistance for small scale industry, with a significant rolefor the Co - opera ti v^nc v eleeme n t... AksJD cy .and local authorities.
1.      Should the revenues be hypothecated to an Oil Fund?2L\.    An important preliminary question is whether North Sea oilrevenues should be separately and specifically allocated through an Oil Fund, or whether they should be absorbed into public fundsas a whole.    The arguments in favour of such an Oil Fund are -a. that use of the revenue would be visible andaccountable, helping to ensure that they were notfrittered away and enabling the public to assess the priorities which were proposed or being followed;b. that continuing public discussion about what is inevitably seen as a precious national asset will be facilitated;c. that it will demonstrate the Government&apos;determination to use the revenues wisely and well andwill be a protection against accusations that theyhave been wasted.25. The arguments against hypothecating oil revenues in aspecial fund are -a. that it might provoke disputes on special claims;b. that the establishment of a fund could not initself show how the revenues were being used on thegrounds that there would be no way of demonstratingthat the expenditure or tax reductions which thefund financed w e r e a additional to what would have beendone in any case.    For example it means little to saythat the oil revenues are directed exclusively to financing one particular activity if that activitywould otherwise have been financed out of generalrevenues and the hypothecation of oil revenue to it made it possible to spend the same amount of generalrevenues on other activiti.es.
c. that a fund would increase pressures to use allthe revenue on extra spending, as against using somefor a reduction of taxes which might have a higher priority;d. that it would reduce the flexibility agovernment needs in managing the economy and divertattention from the thrust of economic policy asa whole on which political opinion should concentrate.5.      Plow should the revenue be allocated?26.    Whether or not the revenues are allocated through an OilFund, they will constitute a substantial extra source of finance.Choices must be made about how they are to be spent and abouthow to take advantage of the related balance of paymentssavings.    Public discussion is already focussing on this issue.27.    The broad options for allocation include:a. overseas investment,b. repayment of foreign debt,c. tax reductions,d. public services and social infrastructure,e. investment in manufacturing industry,f. investment in energy.The revenues are by no means large enough to have a significantimpact on all of these simultaneously, although the hypothecationof revenue to any one option would leave more money available from general revenues to finance other options.28.    But there are two broad views on how we should proceed.One is that the relative priority attached to each option mayalter through time, will depend on the economic and policyenvironment and hence cannot be foreseen in detail now; it would therefore not be wise to narrow down the options at this stage.On this view some options are linked (eg manufacturing investmentcan be encouraged by increased consumption following tax reductions,
and by public expenditure on infrastructure).    The other viewsis that the revenues, which at their maximum will probably amountto only  31 billion per year, are not large enough to finance morethan two of-these options on a significant scale, thatcommitment to any two would necessarily preclude spending onothers, and that the choice of options, once made,  should beexpected to endure.29.    Although the first two options have to be paid for our of balance of payments savings, these balance of payments savings from oil may, other things being equal, only be available forthese purposes if oil revenues are not spent, but are used to reducethe PSBR.    In other words, oil revenues may have to be allocated to these options.    It may therefore be necessary to choose between these and other options as ways of spending the oilrevenue.    In the same way, to provide resources for extra private investment, whether at home or overseas, would require allocatingoil revenue for that purpose and would mean that less was available for the public sector to spend.6.      What are the options?a.      Overseas investment30.    It would be possible to use the oil revenues to reduceGovernment borrowing and thereby secure a larger balance ofpayments surplus.    Exchange controls could then be relaxed orabolished so that private individuals, companies and financial institutions could buy foreign bonds, shares, property orother overseas assets.    Some would argue that investment abroadwould provide Britain with a continuing income after the oilruns out, and might reduce upward pressure on the exchange rate which makes British industry less competitive.31.    Others argue that using the oil benefits for overseas investment would pre-empt using them to expand the economy more quickly, reducing unemployment and encouraging investment at home.It is debateable how far investment by UK forms overseas is a
substitute for investment in the UK, but with unemployment highthe relevant test of which we should prefer is not simplyrelative profitability to the firm, but total value added in the uk versus post-tax profits overseas.    If we were trying to runa high current account surplus, simply to finance overseas investment on capital account, this might also tend to make sterliovervalued, thus damaging the competitiveness of British industry.b.      Repayment of foreign debt32.    Britain has $22 billion of external debts of which $20billion are due for repayment between now and 1984.    The choiceis not whether to repay the outstanding loans on the due dates -there is of course a legal obligation to do so - but how far to finance these arrangements by new overseas borrowing.33.    There are three potential sources from which the repayment of foreign debt might come:    the foreign currency reserves, a surplus on the balance of payments or further loans from abroad.The question is whether part of this debt should be repaid fromthe oil revenues.34.    The arguments in favour of making a start with reducing thetotal of our outstanding debts are that at a time of economicweakness the UK was able to borrow money on the strength ofexpected revenues from North Sea oil.    It would be unwise to rely on the reserves to repay debt as in the past inadequatereserves made us too vulnerable to events outside our control.Moreover some of the reserves are short-term funds which it wouldbe imprudent to use to repay long-term debt.35.    If we are to spread the burden of debt repayment by^aisingnew loans,    this will require a satisfactory overall balance ofpayments.    As Britain&apos;s economic performance strengthens thereshould be scope for raising new loans in this way.    Potentialcreditors will be interested in the prospects for the yeildof North Sea oil because it is this source of income in particularwhich provides assurances that loans will eventually be repaid.^ -9- ____(confidential)
We should ensure that we do not put of international creditworthiness at risk:    a Government forced to concentrate on remedyingfinancial difficutlies is unlikely to be able at the same time togive priority to domestic policies to restructure industry.36.    In order to decide how much of the debt repayment should be financed from new overseas borrowing, and how much from balance ofPayments surpluses, consideration would have to be given to the pattern of debt repayment over the whole period.    This would haveto be calculated to leave maximum scope for domestic growth andindustrial competitiveness.37.    It is argued, on the other hand, that we should not use oilRevenue to repay debt on the grounds that it would diminish theRevenue available for expansion of our own economy, that netrepayment may not be necessary since the funds of OPEC and othersurplus countries will have to be recycled for many years to come,and that if some net repayment of debt should prove necessaryafter all, room for this should be found by general economies, not by cutting down on uses planned for oil funds.0&apos;      Tax reductions38.    The Government&apos;s immediate policy of reducing the burden oftaxation on working people, before the oil revenues have built up, has  already been noted.    There is a longer-term questionWhether oil revenues should be used to finance a significant further reduction in taxation.    It is argued on the one hand that following a period when living standards have had to be squeezed there aregreat pressures to improve take hone pay by increasing moneyWages.    North Sea oil provides some scope for reducing the burdenof taxation so that the real take home pay of working people canbe increased without inflationary rises in money wages whichraise inudstry&apos;s unit costs and are Inevitably reflected in higher prices and fewer jobs.-10-
39.    Other reasons are also suggested for reducing direct taxationwith the help of oil revenues.    In 1960/61 .a married man has tobe earning 40 per cent of the average wage before paying tax, thesame man now has to earn only 35 per cent before paying tax.    TheGovernment has taken steps to raise tax thresholds and the TUChas indicated it seeks further progress on this front as well asgiving a priority to the introduction of a reduced rate band.    such measures are costly and unless a proportion of the benefits from north Sea oil are used are likely to be unattainable.40.    Against, it is argued that using oil revenues for long-termtax cuts would pre-empt funds for public services and benefits,creating a divided and unequal society with poverty for theunemployed, elderly and sick and great wealth for successfulbusinessmen and managers; that it would do little for decliningregions; and that it would provide a consumer-led boom for Germanand Japanese suppliers without providing much help to hard-pressedBritish industries.    On the other hand any attempt to reduceinequality by increasing social payments would have much thesame effect on imports and the regions as cuts in income tax.4l.    But the restructuring of benefits and taxation would be animportant consequence and benefits if the oil revenues themselveswere used for economic recovery.d.      Public services and social infrastructure42.    Oil revenues could be used to finance substantial new public spending, restoring services and construction which have had to be cut in the recession.    This would provide extra employment; itmay therefore be an essential counterpart of industrial investment and reorganisation which might not itself substantially increasejobs in manufacturing.    Using oil revenues for public expenditure will also expand the economy and raise consumption by providingextra employment.43.    As the economy expands and ordinary tax revenues increase, a portion of the oil revenue might be set aside to initiate new_____^LL:_-OiM t&apos; IljE IN 11A
(cprogrammes will need&apos;to keep pace with the expansion of the economy.f.      Investment in energy^9.    Major efforts will be needed to secure Britain&apos;s energyposition after the oil runs out, including conservation measures,more efficient conversions of primary fuels into usable forms of energy, and Development of new sources of primary fuel supply.At present substantial research and public investment is already being undertaken in all these fields.    Although the overall build-upof investment expenditure may be gradual, it is likely thatafter the mid-1980s a high level of expenditure will be needed to meet growth of the economy and to adapt to the post-oil era.50.    Investment in the North Sea itself is already funded throughallowances deducted before the main oil taxes are charged.    Theremay be a case for allocating some of the oil revenue to financeother forms of energy investment;, particularly if the investment programme has to be accelerated in the late 1980s.(confide mtial)
APPENDIXSECURING THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS FROM UKCS OIL1.      Since 1974 the Government has carried through a comprehensiveprogramme of measures designed to maximise the benefits accruing to the state from UKCS oil.    This has involved a judicious mixof new controls, taxation and stimuli.    A balance has been achieved which encourages further investment - there were133 applicants for 51 blocks in the 5th licensing round and aseries of companies successfully concluded new field financingarrangements in 1975/76 - while substantially increasing directstate involvement, the state share of the financial benefits andthe extent of state authority over offshore and onshore operations and the oil produced.2.      TaxationGovernment take from offshore oil is made up of1.)       royalty at 12JJK of the value of the oil;2)        Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) at ^5% on profits beforeCorporation tax;3)       Corporation tax on net revenue after deduction ofroyalty, PRT and expenses.The Oil Taxation Act 1975 introduced PRT.    PRT applies to each fieldseparately so that the tax on the profits on one field cannot be deferred by offsetting against it the costs of another field.Safeguards are incorporated to provide for an adequate return onMarginal fields.    The Corporation tax yield from the North Sea isProtected by the erection of a &quot;ring fence&quot; round UKCS activitiesfor tax purposes.    Together these three taxes should secure on average some 70$ of the profits derived from UKCS operations:    whereBNOC has a 51% equity interest the overall return to the state should       e to some 85%.
3-      Direct State InvolvementA further financial return to the state is provided for by thecreation of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) with aright to a 31% equity stake in all licenses from the 5th Roundonwards.    The Corporation raised $825m in 1976 by the forward saleof oil without prejudicing control over the disposal of that oil.BNOC is also involved, through negotiated participation agreements,in the operation of commercial oilfields licenced under previousrounds.    The Corporation is building up knowledge of UKCS operations at first hand in support of its advisory role to Government.k.      Direct Access to oil the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 (PSPA) provided the Secretary of State with a right to take in kind the 121% royaltyon production.    Together with BNOC&apos;s substantial equity andparticipation rights, this will provide the state with direct access to some 40-^l5m tons of oil in 1980 and hence with control over its disposal not available by other means because of international obligations.5.     RegulationsThe PSPA tightened controls over exploration and over the manner and timing of development and production of discoveries.    it provided the Government with the means to implement policy on therate at which reserves should be depleted.    Government consentis required for gas flaring and for the construction and operationof submarine pipelines.    The construction and extension of refineriesalso requires Government consent, apart from normal planningprocedures.2
6.      Guidance -A Government statement in 197;4 said that up to two-thirds of the oil UKCS produced could be expected to be refined in the UK,subject to the level of production and the way in which world markets developed.    Participation agreements provide for wide-rangingconsultation between producers and the Department of Energy, advised by BNOC, permitting, amongst other things, the monitoring ofdisposal policies and pricing.7.      StimuliThe Offshore Supplies Office has been created to stimulate themaximum UK industrial contribution to offshore activities.    Amemorandum of understanding, securing for UK industry a full and fair opportunity to compete for offshore business, was concluded with the Offshore operators in 1975-    The UK share of the offshoresupplies market has increased from l\0% in 297^ to 57% in 1976.The Government has been prepared to give assurances about themanner in which its regulatory powers will be used, in order toensure confidence in investment in UKCS operations.    assurances about use of the new powers to control rates of depletion weregiven in 197^ and contractual undertakings have been given tocertain banks.    Power has been taken to refund royalties in orderto stimulate or sustain production from a field which would not otherwise satisfy normal commercial criteria.The Government has been instrumental in the creation of a jointpublic sector/private sector    study company, Gas GatheringPipelines  (North Sea) Ltd, to finance and execute detailed evaluationof the economic case for a gas gathering system in the NorthernNorth Sea.
8.      Possible Hazards to Realisation of Fuel benefits the timing of the realisation of UKCS oil benefits could beaffected by many factors including, notably, a fall in the worldoil price but also the imposition of restrictions following a major pollution disaster or a sudden and differential surge inthe costs of exploitation of the UKCS.    But the forecast increasein the real cost of oil In the long term, if right, means thatsuch benefits will be deferred rather than lost.    There is a constant balance to be struck between, on the one harid, maintainingsufficient incentive to the private sector to ensure an adequate scale of exploration and of commitments by oil companies andfinancial institutions to new developments at the controlled ratecalculated to maximise benefits and, on the other, increasingprogressively the direct state share in the benefits, for examplethrough an enhanced role for BNOC in future licensing and throughtax changes.
