18DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,    . COPY no cp(77) 10414 November 3-971CABINET1978-79 NATIONAL. INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION RATESIN RESPECT OF EMPLOYED EARNERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social Security1- We have been unable to reach agreement with the Chief Secretary,Treasury on the Class 1 National Insurance contribution rate to be fixed for april 1978,   vhen the New Pensions Scheme starts.    Subject to agreement on this, the other changes in rates (including a reduction in the self-employed rate as endorsed in principle by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee) have been agreed with the Treasury and are given in theattached Annex.2. The present Class 1 rate is 14-g- per cent (employer 8f per cent,employee 5f per cent).    This is bound to go up next April with the start of the new Scheme, and the statutory maximum is l6f per cent (employer10 per cent, employee 6^ per cent).    We think the increase shculd belimited to 16 per cent, so that the employee&apos;s contribution can be held at per cent.3. There are strong national insurance reasons for a rate lower thanthe 16^ per cent maximum.    The Government Actuary advises that ongiven assumptions (an annual earnings increase of 10 per cent, 1, 470, 000wholly unemployed (1, 650, 000 in total) and 9 million contracted out) a16f per cent rate would produce overall an income to the National insurance fund of  10,941 million.    Inevitably the nature of the assumptions makesthis a very speculative figure, which could be in error either way.    Takingthem as the basis of calculation, however, a 16^ per cent rate would produce a deficit of about  33* million; and 16 per cent would produce a deficit of  402* million.    It would be a departure from the practice of recentyears to aim for anythong other than a large surplus.    But the national insurance Fund will ha\ e a credit balance of about  3, 700 million by Aprilnext year, and it can well support a deficit of this order.*If, for the purposes of the Government Actuary&apos;s report on the ContributionsOrder, the assumed unemployment level is stated to be less than 1. 65 million,the size of the deficit would be reduced.    Conversely, a higher figure would increase it.1
4. For five years the national insurance annual income has been morethan was required to pay benefit and administer the scheme:  we hadsurpluses of  600 million and  928 million in the last two years, andexpect another  600 million surplus this year.    These surpluses have notgone unchallenged, and there have been demands that they be spent inimproved benefits.    -Last year there was in fact pressure to reduce the ratebecause of the surplus:  we resisted this on the ground that we wanted toavoid too big an increase when the new scheme started.    With an even highersurplus now we shall at least be expected to moderate the increase.5. The Government Actuary estimates that after 1978-79 ifunemployment fell to, and remained at, 4 per cent, a 16 per cent rate would suffice for over 10 years.    For many years we have worked on the principlethat we should not look at the finances of the Fund in each year in isolation,but should take one year with another.    The confidence of the general public that what they pay in contributions is to provide for benefics will be undermined if we are seen to work only in one way - towards growixigsurplus.    We ought to make use of a very small proportion ( 400 million)of the  3, 700 million balance in the Fund to tide us over a temporaryproblem while unemployment remains high.6. This is of particular importance for April 1978 because of the effecton take home pay at a time when the next stage of Child Benefit will also have an impact.    The position is illustrated by the following figures for aman on average earnings with two children:WeeklyEarningsAdditional toEmployee&apos;contribution 80161% 0. 6016% 0.20Total Reduction inTake Home Pay(talcing account oflost Child tax allowances)161% 1. 6916% 1.29Overall Gain in family Income(taking accountof increasedChild Benefit)161% 4- 0.4116% + 0.81To hold the employee&apos;s contribution at 16 per cent reduces the impact on hispav by 40p, and increases the total family income, with child benefit, bythe same amount.    This will particularly help the low paid, who benefit more from a lower National Insurance contribution than from tax cuts costing thesame amount;  and it could be announced before Christmas.    The political advantage of the lower figure will help in our public relations task of sellingthe new scheme in the coming months.7. This assumes that the whole benefit of holding the contribution to16 per cent should be given to the employee. This would leave the employerpaying 10 per cent. We should no doubt be criticised for departing from thepresent relativity between the employer&apos;s and employee&apos;s contribution and2
loading it more heavily on the employer (who is already carrying the2 per cent surcharge) which could be regarded as contrary to an assurancegiven by the Government spokesman during last Session&apos;s proceedings onthe Miscellaneous Provisions Dill (Standing Committee A, second sitting,16 December 1976, Columns 78/9).    The Confederation of British Industryand other critics would understand the importance for income restraint of keeping the employee contribution as low as possible.8. We strongly recommend setting the Clas?: 1 contribution rate at16 per cont from Apr?l 1978, with the employee paying 6 per cent and the employer 10 per cent.    We seek the agreement of our colleagues.D ES ODepartment of Health and Social Security14 November 19773
