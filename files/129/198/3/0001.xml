DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRIT ANNS C MAJ EST Y&apos;S government cp(77) 93 COPY NO17 October 1977CABINETTHE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1977-73 AND THE QUEEN&apos;SSPEECH ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW SESSIONNote by the Lord President of the council. I attach a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Opening Speech, incorporatingthe amendments which we agreed on 11 October.    These, and other amendments and additions to the text of Annex C to CP(77) 88, are sidelined2. There are four points for further discussion:a. The paragraph on North Sea Oil (circulated separatelyunder cover of a letter dated 17 October from the Prime Minister&apos;private Secretary to the Lord Presidents Private Secretary).b. I appreciate the doubts expressed on 11 October about theinclusion in the Speech itself of a catalogue of Bills which we wishedto introduce as soon as Parliamentary time could be found.Nevertheless it remains most important in my view that the Speechshould reaffirm our commitment to the Merchant Shipping and post Office Bills, and a suggested form of words is in paragraph 8on page 4.c. I have discussed with the Secretary of State for Energy howParliamentary time could be found to fit the Electricity Bill into thelegislative programme.    The best way would be to combine this bill not only with the Bill on Drax B but also with the atomic energy Bill.    The Parliamentary time required for this combinedBill, together with the other two Department of Energy Bills, wouldbe little more than that needed for the Department&apos;s four EssentialBills if they remained separate.d. I am in consultation with the Secretary of State for employment on whether the Employment Bill should now be regarded as Essential,and will report the outcome as soon as possible.M FPrivy Council Office17 October 1977
