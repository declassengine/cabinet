DqCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S government cp(77) 106 COPY NO24 November 1977CABINETPAY POLICY AND LOW pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Following discussion of the Secretary of State for employment s paper(CP(77) 98) I was invited CM(77) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 2) to submit afurther paper setting out my own views.    This supplements my minute of 7th October to the Prime Minister, which was circulated to cabinet colleagues.2.        In its discussion, Cabinet concluded that the crucial question wouldbe whether a concession for the lowest paid would help in securing an overallincrease not exceeding 10 per cent.    For this purpose we took the &quot;lowestpaid&quot; as meaning those not earning more than  40 a week.    There seem tobe two circumstances in which a concession would help:i. If the Trades Union Congress (TUC) could be persuaded to underwrite the 10 per cent guideline in return, orii. if the chief pressure on the policy is from this group ofworkers.3. There is no evidence that the TUC will be prepared to underwritethe 10 per cent guideline in any circumstances.    The one faint possibilityis that if we can maintain it until a majority of workers have settled within it, the TUC can be persuaded to acquiesce grudgingly to it for the remainder of the round in the interests of equity.    This stage will probably not bereached until, say, March next year.    Moreover, whatever time we choosefor renewed talks with the TUC, whether about the remainder of this roundor about the arrangements for pay after next July, I suspect that low pay willnot play much part given that the TUC has shown little interest in the subject for some time.4.        As regards the chief pressures on the policy, the average earnings of the groups of workers involved in the major challenges to the 10 per centguideline so far are as follows:1
Lorry drivers  73.90British Oxygen  83.20Air Traffic Control Assistants  76.92Police Constables  76. 33 (outside London)Firemen  74.90jMiners  80*90As will be seen, none of these groups falls into the &quot;lowest paid&quot; category.A special concession for those earning less than  40 would therefore be ofno general assistance in relieving pressure on the policy.5. The one area in which some conflict has arisen is the limited oneof Wages Councils.    Wages Councils exist for those sectors of industryin which there are no effective bargaining arrangements.    They are oftenesoteric, like Button Manufacturing or Ostrich Feather, Fancy Featherand Artificial Flower making;  but some cover important groups likeagricultural workers and Licensed Residential workers.    The Councilsestablish rhinimum rates for their industries.    A number of Wages Councilshave recently made oit proposed awards which breach the 10 per centguideline, and in each case we have made representations^ against their proposals.6. Not all workers in Wages Council industries are actually paid atnoinimum rates:  for example, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food recently estimated that over 90 per cent of workers covered by theAgricultural Wages Board are paid above the minimum.    The danger inexcessive settlements lies in the fact that the awarded percentage increasein minimum rates is normally carried through into the higher rates thatare actually paid.    The only way to tackle this is to warn employers thatthey run the risk of discretionary powers being used against them if theydo so.    The danger remains even if some low pay exception is made to regularise the excessive awards by Wages Councils, and arguably wouldbe made worse in such circumstances because it would be harder to justifythe use of discretionary powers when the awards were reflected in increases for workers in the same industry earning more than  40 a week.7. The tendency to reflect increases at the bottom of the pay structure in higher rates is in my view a strong argument against any exception forthe low paid generally.    The main effect of such an exception is to jack upthe whole earnings structure, which we cannot afford.    It also establishesthe low paid as a &quot;special case&quot;, when we are doing all we can to avoidestablishing any.8. My conclusion is therefore that an exception to the 10 per centguideline in favour of the low paid would not help us to secure an overallincrease in earnings not exceeding 10 per cent, and indeed would probably
prevent us from achieving that aim.    The only other argument in favourof such an exception would be that it would offer significant relief to familypoverty.    That argument fails because of the very small proportion of thelow paid who are in fact family breadwinners, as shown in the Annex to cp(77) 98, and because fiscal action is in any case a far better way of helping them.    I therefore recommend strongly against any exception forthe low paid.D W treasury Chambers24 November 1977
