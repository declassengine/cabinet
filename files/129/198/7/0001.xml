JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(77) 97COPY NO20 October 1977CABINETNINTH REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE on expenditure 1976-77:  DRAFT GOVERNMENT RESPONSENote by the Chief Secretary, treasury. The Ninth Report of the Expenditure Committee, 1976-77, was published in July and comprised an introduction by the main Committeeand chapters prepared separately by the specialist sub-committees.    the subjects covered by the chapters were:  Defence and Overseas Services;Export Credit Finance:  Housing:  Employment of Civilians for PolicePurposes;  Health and Personal Social Services;  and HM Stationery Office.The chapters varied considerably in content:  aome dealt with policy;   somewith presentation in the public expenditure White Paper;  and some containedboth kinds of recommendations.2. The attached response has been prepared by the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned;  and has been agreed at official level.   Since it ismade on behalf of several Departments, it is proposed to publish it as a white Paper.    I am therefore circulating it for the Cabinet&apos;s information:subject to any comments I receive by 26 October, I will arrange for the response to be published as a White Paper as soon as possible.J treasury Chambers20 October 1977
Reply by the Government to the Ninth Reportfrom the Expenditure Committee, Session &apos;l976-77INTRODUCTION1.   In their Ninth Report of the l9&apos;/b-77 Session, the Expenditure Committee-considered a number of programme chapters in Part 2 of the White paper setting out the Government&apos;s expenditure plans ICmnd 6/21).   The Governmentwelcome the contribution which has been made by the Committee in directingpublic attention in this way to the objectives of selected expenditure programmes.2*   The Government have given careful consideration to the observations madeby the various sub-committees.   This White Paper gives the Government&apos;s reply tothe various recommendations.   The Committee pointed out in paragraph k of triereport that a number of these recommendations concerned the provision of additional information, and suggested that it might often be preferable for such information to be provided in separate departmental papers rather than in the public expenditurWhite Paper itself.   This general observation has been taken into account in theGovernment *s response to the recommendations concerned.CHAPTER I; DEFENCE AND OVERSEAS SERVICESdefenceRecommendationTreasury and Ministry of Defence to consider carefully inclusion in the public expenditure White Paper, and possibly also in the Statement on Defence Estimates,a table setting out details of all changes in the Defence Budget for 1975-7**and subsequent years caused by public expenditure reviews or policy decisions(paragraph 1.4).3*   The Ministry of Defence will be ready to respond, by way of written evidence,to any future requests from the Committee for tabular information of this nature,delusion of such information in the public expenditure White Paper would^balance a document intended to explain changes in the Government*s expenditurePiant, during the previous year and not to give a full historical record of allchanges during a longer period.   With the passage of time a financial presentationstarting from 1973 would become increasingly inappropriate.
Notification of cases in which compliance with the cash limit on defence spendinghas been possible solely or largely as a result of slippage or offsetting savings(paragraph 1.5)-k.   The Committee will be informed of instances where slippage has played anidentifiable significant part in assisting the Ministry to keep within its cashlimit or where this has been achieved only by deliberate reductions in theprogramme.   It is often difficult in practice to draw a clear distinction betweenunexpected slippage and the additional delays occasioned by the pressure of the cash limit.Overseas aid and other overseas servicesRecommendationsChanges since the previous White Paper to be broken down by sub-programme(paragraph 1.7);Significant changes to be explained in the Part 2 text (paragraph 1.8);Inclusion of a table in every Public Expenditure White Paper showing the cumulateeffect of changes in each programme for each year (from 1973-7^ onwards) since theoriginal estimate was drawn up (paragraph 1.8).5-   The Government agree that explanations of significant changes in this program&quot;16since the previous White Paper should be included in the text following the tableat the head of the programme chapter (table 2.2 in Cmnd 6y2l).   Inclusion of sX^the tabular information requested could tend to make the White Papers unmanageablylarge.   This information may best be given annually in the form of regularwritten evidence to the Committee.CHAPTER II;   EXPORT CREDIT FINANCERecommendationThe costs of the interest support scheme should appear in the Trade, Industryand Employment table of the Public Expenditure White Paper (paragraph 2.^7).if6.   The Government accept the recommendation that interest support costs forrate export credit should appear separately in the international trade section the trade, industry and employment table of the White Paper.   The corresponding     ,Hitentry in respect of the interest support costs for the home ship-building crea*-Tt i5will be made in the general support for industry section of the same table.   *hoped to include the figures in the next White Paper.
&apos;  Paragraph 2.19 of the report states that the Department of Industry do note part in discussions about the possible mutual effects of trade policy and export credits.   The Department of Industry do in fact participate in discussions0tl the factors to be assessed in the granting of export credit.^2ain - HOUSINGCommendations1gUres of public expenditure on housing should be shown in greater detail^graphs jj.6, 3.7 and 3.8).The Government accept in principle the recommendations that more detailed^^yses should be made available of the figures in the housing table^able ^.7 in Cmnd 6/21); that the distinction between capital and currentxPenditure should be clear; and that expenditure on goods and services shouldlstinguished from that on transfer payments.Aae layout proposed by the Committee in paragraph 3-9 will therefore be adoptedSetieral for the housing table in the next public expenditure White Paper.   However,local      ,authorities will have greater freedom to determine priorities within the newAnS investment programme system and the Government propose to issue blockOcations which will cover programmes separately identified at present.   Further,n after block allocations for capital expenditure have been made for a^-cuiar year, authorities will have the ability within defined limits to increase^nditure of one kind if they reduce expenditure of another.   Any detailednment projections for the survey period would therefore be no more thanNative (except in the aggregate) and, particularly for the later years, less^led expenditure analyses might accordingly be more helpful.   Further consideration^ave to be given to this point as the new system of capital allocations isSloped.10.     rn     .^     xo help local authorities to make fuller use of the White Paper, it is^Cessary to show how the figures in the housing table can be reconciled withSe with which they are familiar in the rate support grant settlement andewhere.   Such a reconciliation was circulated to local authorities in EnglandaXes in April (DOE circular 37/77) and recent evidence suggests that this iseetirig the need to which the Committee has drawn attention.   Subject to^     *r consultation with the local authority associations, the Government proposelssue a similar reconciliation each year in explanation of the public expenditure^       raper figures.   In Scotland, information is provided to local authoritiesouSh the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.   In view of the bulk of theAai involved it seems better to provide it in these ways than in the White*Per itself.
Additional supporting information should be provided in the Public expenditure white Paper and in an annual Housing White Paper (paragraphs 3*11, 3*16   aX1^3.18).11.   The Government accept that mortgage interest relief is relevant to consideration of housing policy and will include in future White Papers estivaof the cost of such relief for past years and the year of publication.The results of a study in 197^, to estimate the effect on supplementary benefit expenditure if housing costs were excluded from the calculation of requirements, will be included in the next White Paper.   information will also be provided of the amount of loans outstanding under guaranteeby the Housing Corporation.   The Government will continue to provide asubstantial amount of non-financial information about past performance and will keep under review the possibility of increasing the amount of sucflinformation.12.   More generally, the Government share the Committee&apos;s view that there isa need for information on housing to be collected together and presentedsystematically in addition to the regular publication of data as in housing and construction statistics.   They accept that the housing chapter of thepublic expenditure White Paper should include information relating directly to table 2.7 and will consider what further information could usefully beprovided.   They do not consider, however, that an annual housing White Papertied to the public expenditure White Paper would be the most effective way 0ipresenting a wider range of material.   The Green Paper on Housing Policy(Cmnd 6851) foreshadows the establishment within Department of the Environmetfof a special unit to analyse information about housing and to monitorprogress.   It will be one of the functions of that unit to produce from timeto time analyses over the whole housing field bringing information together and updating material given in the Green Paper and Technical Volume.   Thiswill help to maintain the wide range of background information now availableagainst which public expenditure decisions and government statements of housing policies can be considered..  The comparable arrangements&quot; in Scotlandand Wales will have to be considered further in the light of the proposalsfor devolution.
CHAPTER IV; EMPLOYMENT OF CIVILIANS FOR POLICE PURPOSES^ commendationstudy on &quot;civilianisation&quot; should be completed as quickly as possible, andits results be reported to the House (paragraphs 4.17 and 4.25).13.   This recommendation is accepted.   The area covered by this chapter of the^port has involved, and will involve, difficult decisions on the best use of resources for the police service.   The restrictions on goods and services and0Ji civilian staff were suggested to police authorities as being the leastharmful means of keeping within the limits of expenditure laid down by theGovernment and explained in Cmnd 6/21.   The economies in the police service were a*t designed to secure a reduction in total police expenditure but rather to helpaccommodate the higher cost of particular items such as police pensions (which^nly reflects an increase in the number of police who have retired); totalexpenditure on the police service is still planned to rise in real terms.The Government remain of the view that, within the police service, priority should be given to bringing the strengths of police officers up to authorisedestablishments, even if a small proportion of the additional officers has to be* used on tasks normally the responsibility of civilian staff; if the numberof Police officers exceeds the estimated growth, provision will be made fora*litional expenditure within authorised establishments.    Any growth in expenditure0* other parts of the police service has to be limited by the country&apos;s general economic position and at present must be kept within the programme in Cmnd 6721.*h* local authority associations, with the advice of their financial and professional advisers,accepted the priority for the recruitment of police officersreluctantly agreed that restrictions on civil staff and cadets would have aIess damaging effect on operational policing and force efficiency.15-   Until the current rate support grant negotiations have been completed it isnot possible to say what the position will be in the coming financial year.   TheVi*ws of the Committee in paragraphs 4.16 and 4.17 will be taken into account in^ing any reassessment necessary, as well as any views which may emerge fromthe study of civilianisation, arrangements for which are now going forward.^  aaSgudationA fun review should be made of cadet recruitment both from a qualitative andquantitative point of view (paragraphs 4.23 and 4.26).
16.   This recommendation is being implemented.   The general principles set outin paragraphs 13-15 above apply with equal force to police cadets, who do not make any appreciable contribution to immediate operational efficiency.   Althoughthe unit cost of a cadet is  1,607 per annum, this figure does not include thecost of training; the overall cost of passing a 16 year old cadet through toattestation as a police officerat 18-j is of the order of  6,000- 7,000.17.   Consideration was already being given to an enquiry into the need forcadets before the Committee began its work.   The Home Secretary proposes toset up a working party of the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales toconsider the matter with the following terms of reference:&quot;To consider the place of a cadet system in contributing towards obtainingsufficient recruits of the right quality to enable force strengths to reachauthorised establishments&quot;.It is hoped that it will report in time for any changes to be reflected in the september 1978 intake of cadets.CHAPTER V:SPENDING ON THE HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services social SecurityRecommendationThe Department of Health and Social Security to improve its forecasting of thebenefit implications of the levels and patterns of unemployment (paragraph 5*8)*18.   Every effort is being made to improve the forecasts of expenditure on benefit&apos;Considerable research has been undertaken, as a result of which revised and more complex estimating techniques have been developed.   Past experience is not alwaysa reliable guide and this makes forecasting difficult.   The cost of benefit atany unemployment level depends, inter alia, on the number of the unemployed whoare women, how many of them are married, and how many of the total men andwomen on the register have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit or are not entitled to benefit because they fail to satisfy the contributionconditions or for some other reason.   Where unemployment benefit is not payableor is insufficient to meet a person&apos;s or his family&apos;s need, supplementary benefitmay be payable.   And all of these factors are variable because of the largeturnover of people registered as unemployed, even when the level of unemployment is high.
*n future the assumptions made when making an explicit provision for uprating^improvements should be clearly set out in the White Paper.   There is no reason. * the social security programme should have its own private contingency reserveparagraphs 5.11 and 5-13).19.security programme, and this will be kept under review the Government have noted the Committee^ views on the presentation of thesocial0* for the reasons previously given to the Committee, the Government see considerable advantages in publishing the economic assumptions underlying the expenditureEjections.   Future expenditure on the individual benefits was expressed in the WhitePei&quot; in terms of the average levels of benefit during 1976-77, which amounts toSsuming increases from year to year at the same rate as prices.   In practice&apos;,aj- expenditure on the social security programme is determined by a number ofactors which cannot be provided for with certainty in advance.   The commitmentincrease pensions and other long-term benefits in line with the increase inarn*ngs, where this exceeds that in prices, implies a trend of improvement inese benefits in real terms; and the real cost of benefits in the event will&quot;So be affected by the actual movement of prices.   In addition, the demand^or y,oenefits will be substantially affected by demographic and economic factors.place of the broad allowance described as providing simply for upratingMovements in previous White Papers, it was, therefore, decided to make a^ neral provision for variability in the factors likely to affect the cost of5c,cial security programme.   This provision could have been added to thelngency reserve and not shown separately in the social security programme.ince it represented the Government&apos;s judgement of the most appropriateOvision for the cost of the social security programme taken as a whole, itsclusion within the contingency reserve would have been less informative, andeci the function of the contingency reserve as an instrument of operationalc^troi.
General comment22.   The Committee lay emphasis in their Report on the need for more detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of the health and personal social services,for more specific criteria.for tneasuringprogress towards objectives and forindicators of performance of different kinds.   The Government wish to improveand develop such measures, which provide the basis for the proper distributionof resources and planning of services.   This work is subject to two constraints:there is great difficulty in defining and measuring the final output of health services, and a limit to the capacity of the Department to undertake the analysisand refinement of data.   Of necessity, therefore, measures of an intermediate kind -levels of provision of facilities, throughput, etc - often have to be used and theDepartment must concentrate its efforts on what will serve practical purposes most directly and immediately.   But the Government acknowledge the need for the longer-tern1to improve analysis and to develop new indicators, and within the resources availablewill continue both their own work and support for research by others.recommendation the Department should make sure that it is in a position to monitor unplannedcuts that may result from the operation of the cash limits system and to checkthat they are implemented in the least damaging way (paragraph 5*15).23.   The Department guides and controls the health authorities primarily throughthe planning system.   The authorities are responsible for implementing their plans within the resources provided.   The Department looks to the authorities themselves to secure any economies that may be necessary to comply with cashlimits in whatever way the^ judge least damaging to the planned pattern of their services.   The effect of the authorities1 decisions can be monitored by the Departmeritin the subsequent planning round when any measures necessary to deal with imbalancesin the provision of services can be considered.   If the operation of the cash limit5system appeared likely to have serious and immediate effects on standards ofpatient care during the current year, the Department would expect to be consulted by the authorities concerned about the action required.RecommendationDetails of the income from personal social services charges should be includedin the White Paper (paragraph 5.17).2k.   This recommendation is accepted.
^opportunity and information should be given for more discussion in toe House ofCo**ons ^ elsewhere of the policy options when imposition of NHS and personalS0!*al services charges is being considered (paragraph 5-19).?5.  Opportunity for discussion and for the provision of information about theposition of NHS charges is presented when the necessary statutory instrumentsthe NHS (Consolidation) Act, 1977 are laid before Parliament.   Charges for?e^nal social services are essentially a matter for individual local authorities.As indicated in the Green Paper on Local Government Finance (Cmnd 6813), the^emmant have accepted the Lay field Committee&apos;s recommendation for a joint review0f central and local government policies towards charging for local services.review will cover the personal social services and the Department of Health^ Social Security will take part in it.^amendationdel pr^orities between current and capital spending should be reviewed withouty to ascertain whether an imbalance which ought to be corrected has beendelateci (paragraph 5.2h).Ane balance between current and capital spending is one of the issues to0nsidered in a review of the use of health capital and of the revenue consequencesaPital investment now being undertaken.^mendatd^nPartment should set in train studies to examine the relationship between^6tI)ent costs suitably defined and patient care (paragraph 5-26).??&quot;   Th    nne Government believe that efforts to secure the most cost-effective useiftd-   a^eraen^ skills must be based on careful and objective appraisal bylvidual health authorities, who will have to take account of many localin deciding where management costs can be reduced without damage tot services.   The outcome of these reviews will be monitored both in the^ual mt       Planning cycle andby the Department against the national target of acent reduction to be achieved by the end of 1979-80.   This continuing,      ose examination of management costs will take account of the need to^ep j11 reasonable balance the costs of services for patients and of management.studies would be unlikely to establish any clear-cut and generallyrelationship between management costs and such indicators as level ofiQn, throughput, waiting lists and unit costs, especially as a varietyCal factors would have to be taken into account.
The Committee should receive regularly figures from DHSS which distinguish between increases in unit costs that reflect lower manpower productivity and increases that reflect improved resource provision for patients(. paragraph 5*31)*28.   The Committee will be provided with regular figures derived from theDepartments monitoring of unit costs.   Where there has been improvementin the conditions of service of staff it is not easy to determine to what extent increased costs should be ascribed to this, rather than to improvedpatient care.   For example, if junior doctors were to work fewer hours this might benefit doctors (by increased leisure) and also patients (by having lesstired doctors attending them).   The Department is studying historic data witha view to improving the method lor analysing the causes of increases in unit costs,and will keep the Committee informed of the results.recommendation the expenditure planning and priority-setting of DHSS should be synchronisedso as to enable Parliament to examine the relationship between the two(paragraph 5*32).29.   The Department&apos;s annual reassessment of priorities is in fact linked withthe expenditure forecasts in the White Paper.   In future years the aim will beto issue planning guidelines annually to health authorities in March,indicating resource assumptions for the forthcoming public expenditure period and to provide regularly for a forward year within the survey period anillustrative projection of the average level of provision and current expenditure on various services that is consistent with priorities and withplanned public expenditure.   Local authorities will receive similar guidance as respects the personal social services.   It is hoped that this timing will facilitate examination by Parliament.recommendation the Department should publish its analysis of the regional responses to the1976 Consultative Document, and an explicit statement of the criteria used in deciding whether or not local divergencies from national priorities are justified (paragraph 5*33)*
^&apos;  Revised policy guidance published by the Department in September 1977lllcluded a summary of comments on the Consultative Document (including thosey regional health authorities) and also a brief analysis of the main points&quot;^ging from the strategic plans submitted by the regional health authorities^s year.   A judgement as to whether local divergencies from national^iorities are justified can only be made after discussion between the Departmentwie particular region, and it is not possible to lay down rigid criteria forA fuller analysis of the regional plans will be published early in 1978,blowing discussions with individual regional health authorities.lamentations(1)ide 36arly set out the cost of policies so as to allow Parliament toftQ  lry costs which arise from new commitments as distinct from those arisingon-going commitments;obi ^c:*-fy criteria for measuring the progress towards achieving the policyctives implicit in new commitments;evl ^provide a more detailed analysis of who benefits in what ways from publicSuture.p^graph 5.35)31commentary in Cmnd 6721 (Part 2) on the health and personal social, l,^Ces programme gave some indication of how far expenditure plans cateredt     ew as distinct from on-going commitments.   The Department will continueProvide this information and consider how it might be improved.   Most of theeveln-&quot;-opments in the health and personal social services programme do not takeo^m of specific new commitments, but are developments of existing services.0f th^    nese, the annual planning guidelines and the programme budget issuedSUlarly ^        Department give a better indication of the projectedopment of services than can be provided in the public expenditure White Paper.WlH also give a measure of progress towards policy objectives, and an^lon of the projected distribution of resources between different groupsesult of these developments.

32.   The Government recognise the importance of measures of the kind suggested.Some indicators are already in use within the Department and in the NHS tomonitor the development of services and to establish targets for the distributionof financial resources.   Planning the best use of resources available for the health and personal social services will always involve decisions and judgement thatcannot be precisely quantified.   The levels of provision of specific facilities andthe length of time on waiting lists are also used as indicators, monitored regularlyand published in DHSS Annual Reports and statistical publications.   Indicators ofrelative need for resources for hospital and community health services have been developed by the Resource   Allocation Working Party.   Througn the NHS planning systeB1. ptwee::Department will be able to analyse progress towards greater equality of provision Deregions, areas and districts and changes in the balance of provision of different types of service for different patient groups.   In the personal social services lev^5of provision are similarly monitored, and attempts are being made to refine theindicators of need and to improve the distribution of the rate support grant.33.   As indicated in paragraph 22 above, there are difficulties and constraintsin the further development of indicators.   The methodological problems ofmeasuring performance and patient satisfaction are considerable; the work iscostly and uses scarce staff resources.   But some work is being undertakenwitnin the Department and research elsewhere is being supported.   The department will continue these efforts.CHAPTER VI - STATIONERY AND PRINTING (HOME)recommendation the introduction in principle of repayment and a trading fund for HMSO(paragraph 6.16).aThe Department should begin now to develop, for the longer-term, indicatorsof performance.   The Department should in particular develop -(a) Measures of access to show how far people in different areas have thesame chance of obtaining treatment of care and whether access is improvingover time.   And(b) Measures of quality provision to show improvements (or deteriorations)in the physical environment, amenities and patient satisfaction(paragraph 5*36).
As was stated in evidence the main objective in the period immediately ahead must be the development of the new management accounting systems andfading accounts.   These will enable more information to be made availabletQ Parliament and the public.   These developments will not prejudice thequestion of introducing general repayment and a trading fund; indeed they area Pre-requisite of these developments, decisions on which will need to be taken11 the light of experience gained in operating the new management accountingProcedures.   The views of the Committee will be taken fully into account atthe time.^ commendationdicing policies should be considered and any price reductions adequatelyadvertised (paragraph 6.19).Pricing policy for government publications is kept under continuouseview, and any price reduction will be advertised as the Committee recommends.*e Government agree with the Committee that the financial aim (break-even taking0tle year with another) conflicts with the widest possible readership ofPublications.   The price of the daily parts of Hansard is already belowthe marginal cost.   The number of copies sold to the public is amall(currently about 2,000) and has been declining over the last 20 years.* Price reduction could stimulate some increase in sales, but would^crease the overall cost to the Government.   As regards other HMSOPlications, if  kg price t0 the public could be reduced, additional sales&quot;u-Sht follow, the revenue from which could suffice to offset the cost of producingextra copies.   But if the price reductions were brought about by makingcopies produced for official use bear all the initial publication costs,overall effect would again be to increase the net cost to government ofeovernment publishing.thethethe^^ommendaUon&apos;JtLae annual report should give a detailed account of all Stationery Officectivities.   The General Sub-Committee should be consulted before decisions6 taken about the form of the accompanying accounts (paragraph 6.22).
56.   The Government will take account of the Committee&apos;s views in reachingfinal conclusions about the content of the annual report, and in determining the form of accounts.57.   The Committee also suggested that the cash limits fixed for HMSO for 1977-appeared to be lax, in that they amounted to  116 million against expenditurein Main Estimates of  90 million.   The cash limits covered some expenditure onbehalf of the National Insurance Fund which in the Estimates, unlike the cash limits, is offset by receipts from the Fund.   The amount provided in theEstimates, comparable with the figure of  116 million in the cash limits, istherefore  100 million and not  90 million.s
