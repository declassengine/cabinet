DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT81CP(77) 94 COPY NO21 October 1977CABINETWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for industry. At its meeting on 21 July (CM(77) 27th Conclusions, Minute 5), theCabinet invited us to prepare a revised draft paper on the WiderImplications of the Industrial Strategy, for submission to the national economic Development Council (NEDC).    The Ministerial paper for NEDCand the annexed report by officials have been revised in the light of theCabinet discussion, and of written comments from our colleagues (though we have not felt able to accept every one of the comments made).    Theyhave been further revised after discussion in a small group of Ministers(GEN 98).2. Our earlier paper for Cabinet (CP(77) 84) explained the work of theofficial group which had led up to the NEDC paper in its earlier draft.    Itwent on to:i. list the new commitments and proposals contained in that draft;ii. explain that certain important issues had not been discussed in the draft because it would be difficult to raise them on a tripartite basis at present;iii. list certain other policy areas which the official group wishedto draw to Ministers&apos; attention;iv. make proposals for further work in this field.3.        In this memorandum, we confine ourselves to summarising themain changes that hav^ been made to the earlier draft.    The main changesin the report by officials (Annex B) are as follows: -a. A section (paragraphs 1.10-1.12) has been added on education and Training for Industry.
b. The paragraph (1. 20) on the overlap of incomes of people in, and out of, work now has a concluding sentence to show that weare trying to take steps to overcome this problem.c. In paragraph 3.2 there is no longer the implied suggestionthat employment legislation is to stop dead.    The draft now says that the Government will take full account of the volume of measurescarried out in considering any fresh proposals in this field.d. There is now (in paragraph 5. 2) a reference to the low levelof company taxation in the United Kingdom, and also to the lowerburden of social security contributions by industry than in othercountries.e. Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 have been added to cover the point that industry are concerned to avoid over-elaborate inflationaccounting and company reporting requirements.f. Paragraph 9.2 includes a reference to the National ResearchDevelopment Corporation.g. The passage on competition policy (paragraph 12.1) no longerincludes a commitment to provide &quot;guidance&quot; on this to industry,since this is still for discussion by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy (El).h. Paragraph 13. 3 contains a clear commitment that we should aim for a greater interchange between the Civil Service and industry.The passage now says that we should be aiming for exchangesapproaching 200 at any one time by the end of the decade.In addition, the covering paper (Annex A) now gives more emphasis to the crucial need to improve our industrial performance, by all means possible,if we are to achieve our long term social and economic objectives.    the drafting has also been tightened up.4. The new commitments and proposals contained in the revised draftare the same as in the earlier draft, except in the areas of employmentlegislation and competition policy already mentioned.    The commitments in these two areas now amount to:i. An undertaking to take into account the volume of recentmeasures in considering future employment legislation.ii.        A review of the role of competition policy as part of theindustrial strategy.2
5. Our proposals for future work in this field remain as set out inparagraphs 8-11 of our earlier paper.    Likewise, we would draw theattention of other Ministers as before to certain policy issues which theofficial group did not cover in their report, or did not cover fully.conclusion. The Cabinet is invited-a. To approve the attached papers for submission to NEDC.b. To endorse the proposals contained in the papers (as summarised in paragraph 4 of CP(7?) 84 subject to the changesnoted in paragraph 4 above).c. To approve the proposals for further work in this fieldas set out in paragraphs 9-10 of CP(7Y) 84.d. To take note of the points in paragraphs 5 and 6 of cp(77) 84.D W HE G VTreasury Chambers21 October 19773
ANNEX A  APT NEDC PAPERWIDER IMPLICATIONS OP THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of^ate for Industry.JNTRODUCTION1-     Industry holds the key,to the generation of wealth.   Irt thePost-war period we have been afflicted with a climate of opinion -effete and wrong-headed - in the UK which has been at best indifferentafid at worst hostile to the role of industry in society.    This tendencyis deeply rooted in our history,  class system and social structure.Society has not given the men and women who work in our manufacturing industry - at all levels - adequate recognition of their key role.M^ch of the best of our national talent has been brought up to believe^at it is not nice to dirty their hands at the workbench or in theengineering shop.    They have been influenced towards employmentoutside industry-    Of course manufacturing is not the only sectorv*ich creates wealth and contributes to our trading performance.    Butit is in our manufacturing industry,  despite its traditional dominancea^d its concentration of capital and skills, that we have lagged mostCobspicuously behind our major industrial competitors.2-     That is why the Government,  in the November 1975 White Paper &quot;an approach to Industrial Strategy&quot;,  committed itself to identifying theindustrial implications of the whole range of its policies and undertook to &quot;give greater weight, and more consistently than hitherto, to thefteed for increasing the national rate of growth through regeneratingindustrial structure and improving efficiency.   For the immediatefuture&quot;,  it said,  &quot;this will mean giving priority to industrialdevelopment over consumption or even our social objectives.    Thereis no other way of developing the industrial base on which theGovernment&apos;s whole programme of economic and social reform depends.&quot;
MFiDErlilA!3*     The attached paper is a first survey of the broad areas ofGovernment policy (outside those directly covered by the work of&quot;the sector working parties) which bear in one way or another on industrial performance and efficiency.    It also describes certainaction already taken or now proposed to give a higher priority to&quot;the needs of industry,  and makes proposals,   subject to the views of&quot;the Council,  on how this problem should be tackled in the longer term.is no easy matter to change the deeply rooted attitudes andaccumulation of policies which have contributed to industrial decline,^he change will take many years;    but the Government is determined tocontinue with this work.   The objective must be to ensure that Britishindustry receives at least the same degree of support,  and as favourable an environment, as is given to their own industries by&quot;the countries which compete with us. , That is the very minimum thatwe seek.FUTURE ACTION^*     The Government proposes,  subject to the views of the Council,&quot;to carry out further reviews of areas of policy which pose long-term problems for industrial efficiency.    These are outlined in theattached paper as follows: -(i) the employment of graduates by industry (paragraph 1.9);(ii) public sector manpower policy (paragraph 1.18);(iii) tax and social security in relation to work incentives(paragraph 1.25);(iv) the effect of standards and specifications on the exportpotential of products purchases by the public sector(paragraph 11 .3);(v) mobility between the civil service and industry(paragraph 13.5)5(vi) the burdens on industry (paragraph 13-6).5.     In addition it proposes that:
(COM RDE NT iAl)(i) Ministers from the non-industrial Departments should attend NEDC from time to time to discuss their contributionto the industrial strategy.    A start was made in July whenthe Secretary of State for Education and Science and theSecretary of State for the Environment attended the Council.(ii) SWPs should be invited to take note of the continuingwork on the wider implications of the industrial strategy and to give their views on priority areas for changes,inGovernment policy.(iii) There should be regular reports to the Council onthe progress made on the wider implications of theindustrial strategy.conclusion.      It is now impossible to imagine Britain&apos;s industrial scenewithout the tripartite Industrial Strategy.    That is a measureof the success we are beginning to achieve.    In the improvingeconomic climate we must not relax our efforts.    It would be disastrous if we now took it easy and cast away oppertuinities which may not easily return.7. As part of the work, we must make real progress on the wider implications of the strategy. The attached paper draws attention to a wide range of problems, to many of which thereare no easy or quick solutions. The Government would welcome the Council&apos;s views on effective ways in which these problemsmight be tackled.3(confidential)
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGYREPORT BY officials.     The attached report has &quot;been prepared in accordance with aremit by the Prime Minister dated 16 February for a Group of officials under Treasury chairmanship to prepare a draft paper for NEDC on the linking of industrial to other policies.   TheGroup included representatives of the Departments of education and Science, Employment, Energy, Environment, Health and social security, Industry, Prices and Consumer Protection, Trade,Transport, and the CSD, CPRS, FCO, MAFF and MOD.2.     This report (with the omission of this page) is intended toform an annex to a joint NEDC paper by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State Tor Industry.

LABOUR.1-     The Supply of Labour to industry*1       It is essential that a fair share of the nation&apos;s most ablemanpower - at all levels - is employed in manufacturing industry,and that their education, training and motivation are such, thattheir ability can be fully utilised in industry.   Therj is good reason to believe that this is not happening, and has not happened or a long time in the UK.   A decisive shift of some of our mostable manpower into manufacturing must be looked for if the regener-ation of industry is to be achieved and sustained.1*2      Schools Education.  -The influence of the education system onthe economic performance of the country has been an important themein. the current public debate on school education, in which representa-tives from both sides of industry have played a full part.   TheSecretary of State for Education and&quot;Science published in July 1977a consultative document &quot;Education in Schools&quot; (dealing with Englandand V/ales) which set out conclusions and proposals for further action.Among the points in this document which are particularly relevant tothe industrial strategy are the following:i. - although there is some public criticism of the schools,there is no clear evidence of a general decline in standards.In some schools the curriculum may have become overloaded tothe detriment of essential skills, including literacy andnumeracy.   No other aims should divert attention from theseessential elements of the curriculum;ii. the balance and breadth of the school curriculum in eachlocal education area will be reviewed by local education-authorities and their teachers, and industry and commerce willbe involved in this process;iii. schools need to do more to prepare pupils for the transition to adult and working life, in particular byequipping them with a basic understanding of the functioning of the economy and activities, especially manufacturing industry, which create the nation&apos;s wealth;
iv. attention will be given to the development of methodsof monitoring the performance of the school system, especiallyin English, mathematics and science;v. various steps will be taken to improve the quality of the teaching force eg by requiring applicants to teacher training to have minimum qualifications in mathematics and English,and by developing in-service and induction training.    (In thisconnection the Secretary of State recently announced a specialprogramme to train serving teachers or unemployed qualifiedteachers in subjects important to the industrial strategy);vi. encouragement will be given to the recruitment to teacher training of people who have had experience outside education;vii. attention must be given in initial teacher training toacquainting teachers with the national importance of industryand commerce and to helping them to convey this to their pupils;viii.local education authorities will in general need todevelop more systematic approaches to the recruitment, careerdevelopment, training and development of teachers, includingprocedures for assessment advice, and where necessary, earlyretirement;ix. communications between employers, trade unions and theschool need to be improved especially at the local level.Joint efforts should relate to such matters as improvingunderstanding of the importance to our national life of productive industry and trade; the provision of work experienceas part of a school course; increased opportunities for people in industry to visit schools, and teachers and pupilsto visit factories; and the appointment of managers and trade unionists from industry as governors of schools;x. local education authorities, schools and industry should consider together how careers guidance can best/developed toensure that young people get correct and up-to-date information about jobs and training opportunities in local industry.   Manyschools will need to adjust their priorities to make room inthe curriculum for careers education for all pupils not later than the age of
1.3      Higher Education.   As far as higher education isconcerned, the evidence suggests that the intake by manufacturing industry of graduates falls short in &quot;both quality and quantity.The recently published consultation document,&quot;Industry, education and&apos; Management&quot;, reviews in detail some of the evidence for reachingsuch a conclusion.   Many SWPs have also drawn attention to shortages in the supply of skilled manpower., particularly qualified engineers and scientists.1.4      While there has been a substantial increase in the output of graduates entering employment over the past 25 years, the proportionentering employment in the manufacturing sector has decreased froma 1961 peak of 41% to 25-9% in 1975.   The actual number of graduatesrecruited by industry has increased over the same period from 4611 to6098, but in recent years has varied widely from year to year,reflecting such factors as the fluctuations in the economic cycleand the fall in employment in the manufacturing sector: the general level of recruitment in the 1970&apos;s has been lower than in the peakyears of the late 1960&apos;s (8238 in 1969)-   These figures do not,however, reveal the final destination of the very large number of graduates who do not directly enter employment.   The table belowsummarises an attempt to identify the sectors entered by all of those1971 graduates known to have entered employment in the United Kingdomwhether after obtaining their first qualification or later.   It stillrelates to only about two-thirds of all 1971 university graduates:Percentage entering:Public Service 15Education 35Manufacturing ^ cIndustryOther Industry 7Commerce other 191001*5      The evidence covering the supply to industry of highly qualifiedManpower is, however, complex and difficult to interpret.   It must&quot;be noted, for example, that the stock of graduates in industry has
?isen markedly and that graduates are spreading into occupationallevels not traditionally associated with them.   Supply considerations are prominent among the matters covered in the recently publishedspecial report commissioned by the British Association for the advancement of Science with Government support.   The Government forits part is making a detailed factual study, making use of all available data including the experience of University AppointmentsBoards.1*6      It is, however, generally agreed that the quality of thegraduates recruited by industry should be improved; manufacturing industry in particular has not been attracting its proper share ofthe most able young people in the country.   Engineering graduates,of whom the large majority take jobs in industry, have tended in thePast to have on average poorer A level qualifications than those inmost other subjects.   While industry gets its full share of the more4able amongst these graduates, a variety of factors including socialattitudes and the fluctuating patterns of recruitment by industry have contributed to keeping the overall quality lower than it should be.There is, however, evidence that the trend is beginning to change.An apparent shift in attitude has led to both a marked upturn in thenumber of applications for courses in engineering and science in higher education, and an increased willingness on the part of graduates to seek employment in industry.   There is also evidence&quot;that industrial recruitment now is steadier and more buoyant, whilethat of the public sector has abated.   The institutions of higheroducation for their part have at present some spare capacity on&quot;the science and engineering side, and though this may be fairly quicklytaken up, the opportunity exists for developing more courses witha clear industrial slant.1*7      The long-term objectives for ensuring an adequate supply and use of highly-qualified manpower in industry must therefore be:i. to increase the quantity and quality of the graduateoutput seeking industrial employment;ii. for industry - particularly small and medium-sized firms -to alter its recruiting patterns to absorb more of the outputof higher and further education;
takeniii. to increase the account/of industrial needs in the planning of degree courses in universities and polytechnics;iv. to increase the knowledge and understanding of industryamongst teachers in higher education.1*8      The following first steps towards these long-term objectivesnave been taken:i. the DES has announced two financial incentives intendedto attract able students into courses of particular value to industry:scheme (still to be worked out in detail) ofindustrial scholarships to be run in collaboration with industry.   The full support of industry will berequired if this scheme i&apos;s to be successful, and theGovernment hopes that progress can be made as fast as possible;b.     a modification of the awards arrangements to enableemployers to give students financial support up to1  500 (in addition to present disregard of  185) withoutreduction of grant;ii. in the post-graduate sphere priority is being given tothe development of courses designed and run in close association with industry;iii.    a limited number of Universities, selected becausethey are strong in both engineering and management studies,are setting up first degree engineering courses of very high standard, with a pronounced orientation towards industry,designed for exceptionally able students who are likely to move into senior  positions in industry.iv.   the UGC and the Council for National Academic Awards arealso considering what kind of degree courses can best meetthe needs of the growing number of students who will find their way into a broad range of jobs in industry not traditionallyfilled by graduates.
L*9      These are, however, only the first steps, and far-reachingGanges in attitudes and practices may be required before the0Hg-term objectives will be reached.    The Government will giveEither consideration to these problems in the light of the statisticalUrvey mentioned in paragraph 1.5 above, and the British Association1 s^port.    The enquiry under Sir Montague Finniston into the engineering^ofession which was announced on 4 July will also be relevant.* &apos;0     Education and Training; for Industry.    Industrial training isCeritral to the industrial strategy and largely falls outside the scope0^ &quot;this paper.   However, an increasing amount of training is carried out111 colleges of further education.    One of the most important areas inls respect is technician training. The Training Services Agency (TSA)have recently launched courses for technicians in electronics and computei^intenance (amongst other specialisms) and advised industrial training0ar&apos;ds (ITBs) on developing a strategy for technician training.   Moreover,!^e Manpower Services Commission (MSC) Review and Plan shortly to be^lished envisages giving high priority to extending the range ofechnician courses particularly where these can be linked to the industrnlstrategy.1     The main contribution of the national network of some 700 further6 ^Cation (EE) colleges is in the primary education of technician, craftaQ(^ operative personnel for industry providing courses leading to6ciihician and other qualifications.    The EE sector also contributes toe &quot;training and retraining of industrial personnel - by shorteusrve courses mounted at the request of firms or groups of firms, and [the EE element in MSC and TSA programmes.    Colleges will provide0Urses to meet demand as they perceive it and as needs are identified^-brought to their attention by, notably, employing organisations, thei the ITBs and the various Regional Advisory Councils for FurtherCation;    and these arrangements will call for the closest co-operation at present the further education sector is meeting the buoyantCartel for vocational courses and appropriate curricula developmentsDemg encouraged.    It is also making a substantial contribution toariagement and trade union education.   Much, closer working Tetweencation and. training is being promoted in relation to TrainingPortunities Scheme and ITB courses, by means of the &quot;unifieda^ional preparation&quot; schemes jointly fostered by DES and the TSA, and
CONFIDENTIALrespect of the new Youth Opportunities Programme.1.13     TWHr. R.r.tnr Manpower Policy-     Many SWPs have expressed concern that the public sector is absorbing too great a share of ableManpower, particularly the well-qualified.    So far, the Governmenth-as not sought to adjust the intake of qualified manpower to the public sector on the grounds of its impact on the supply available toSchist ry.1*14    As far as graduates are concerned, the proportion directlyentering employment who eitered the public services (excludinge^cation) rose from 14.8% in 1965 to 26.2% in 1975 but fell back to21-1% in 1976.    The recent decrease in the intake of graduates by public sector caused by public expenditure constraints has been associated with (although not necessarily the sole cause of) anCreased number of graduates seeking industrial employment.W    Statistics relating to other qualified people entering publicSe^ices are not available, but estimates based on the 1971 Census of?0Pulation suggest that whereas 47 per cent of those with degree andequivalent qualifications are employed in the public sector (ie^lic services   plus nationalised industries) 60 per cent of thoseVith qualifications not of degree level but usually obtained after theaSe of 18 (a high proportion of which are in teaching and nursing butaIso include HNC and END) were employed in that sector, as were 28 per cen0f those with GCE A level or equivalent qualification but no higher^alifications.    Nor comparison, slightly over a quarter of the total population were employed in floe public sector in 1971.    The skillsSeised at the technician and craft levels are much more specific and^^-related than tfose possessed by newly-qualified graduates.   The publicPrivate sectors are, generally speaking, in competition for thosep6oPle only at a point when they leave school and before they areGained.
1.16    SWPs have in particular argued that, in many cases, manufacturing industry is unable to compete with the pay and conditions offered by the public sector.   If this were widely the case, there wouldbe a formidable combination of market and cultural forces whichwould lead to the public sector pre-empting qualified manpower indisproportionate quality and quantity.-1.17    This is, however, an area where facts are difficult toestablish, where care must be taken to examine comparable jobs,and where generalisations are unlikely to be valid.   It is also necessary to take account of the relativities between manufacturing industry and other parts of the private sector.1.18    The Government believes that there is reason to be concerned at the possibility of pre-emption by the public sector of resourcesof able manpower at the expense of industry.    It considers that muchtoore account must now be taken in public sector manpower policies oftheir implications for the supply of labour to industry, and ofRelativities between the public sector and industry where they arecompeting for the same type of manpower.   It proposes to conduct afcore searching examination of the facts about public sector recruitment of qualified manpower (including pay relativities and other factors).1.19    Incentives to Work.   It is important from an industrialViewpoint that the taxation system does not distort the labour market to the extent that the normal wage structure fails to provide an adequate incentive to work and to gain skills and promotion.   Yetthere is widespread feeling - at all levels - that the presenttaxation system has weakened the incentive to work throughout the economy.1.20    As far as the lower end of the labour market is concerned,a problem which, has received much attention recently is that of the relationship between social security and welfare benefits for thoseQut of work and earnings in work.   This problem is limited in size,and its effects have been exaggerated.   But situations do exist inV;bich the net income of those unemployed    or absent through sicknesscan, at least for a period, exceed their net earnings while in work,and in which, for others, the net additional reward from working isvery small.   This problem is caused not only by the level of benefits,kut also by features of the tax system (low threshholds, and refunds
f tax for those out of work).   As well as the disincentive effecton those not in work, the perception of this problem can bedemoralising for those in work. The Government is taking steps to red-aceany such disincentive to work by tax reductions and by improvements inchild benefits and similar measures when this is possible.1.21    A closely related , but separate, problem is that of the&quot;poverty trap&quot; which affects those in work, and which flows fromthe combination of current taxation levels and means-tested benefits.This does not in practice mean, as is widely supposed, that those affected derive no net benefit from normal pay increases, because theincome limits for means-tested benefits are regularly uprated andthus move up as pay moves up.   But it does mean that there is a widehand of low earnings over which net income increases little if at all.For example, for a married man with 2 young children claiming allthe available benefits, total net income does not increase at allbetween gross earnings of  30 and  4-5 a week, and increases by lessthan  5 between  4-5 and  60.   There is therefore little incentivein this income range for a worker to increase his earnings - forexample through working overtime, or through, gaining skills or promoting-tion, or through a change of job.1.22    There has been a long-term tendency for differentials in post-tax pay between skilled and less skilled work to be compressed.   Asfar as managerial pay is concerned, several surveys have shown thatmanagerial pay, in the UK, is in general substantially lower thanin other major industrial countries; though a large part of thissimply reflects the overall difference in GDP per head, it has undoubtedly made overseas employment and emigration increasinglyattractive to the more mobile and talented managers.   The D0I&apos;scontacts with both US and UK multinationals   confirm that they are having increasing difficulty in persuading UK nationals to returnto the UK after service abroad because of the weight of direct taxation and lower salaries common here.1.23    International comparisons of income taxation are neverstraightforward, partly because of the difficulty of establishingan acceptable basis of currency translation and partly because ofthe variation in the distribution of earnings.   Despite the insuranceprinciple which may underline them, employee&apos;s social securitycontributions are generally regarded by those who pay them as part
0*&quot; the  income tax  system,  and in other  countries  are used to finance  expenditure on items which in the UK are paid for out  ofgeneral taxation.     Although the UK  income tax has  a low thresholdand high onset  rate  compared with  other  countries,  the low rate of employees&apos;   social  security contributions means  that  a married manVlth two  children  earning half the  average    production workers&apos;   wageVlH be paying out roughly the  same  percentage  of his  income  in tax and insurance as his  counterparts  in other countries.     However,  ataverage  earnings  and above his  tax and  social  security deductionstogether make up  a larger percentage  of gross  pay  in the UK.     AtVe*&quot;age  earnings,  for  example,  he  surrenders  23$  of his  income  intax and  social  security payments,, at  a marginal  rate  of  3k%,  whilethe equivalent  tax payer  in France pays  only h%,  in Germany. 22%  andln the USA and Japan  about  15%  (including local  income tax where appropriate).     At  five times  average  earnings  he  surrenders  nearly50/ of his  income  in tax and  social  security payments,  at a marginal^ate of 75^3  while the  equivalent  tax payer  in France pays  only and in Germany,  the USA and Japan between  35  and  k1%   (includinglocal income tax where  appropriate).     At these levels  of earningsthe Netherlands  is  closest to  the UK with  about  the  same  average rate but a slightly lower marginal rate.     Only in Sweden  are^rginal  and average  deduction rates  higher than in the UK.Ihe long-term objective must be to restore a situation  invhich -  at  all levels  - the labour market  can operate  effectivelyand provide  adequate  incentives  to work,  while  continuing to  giveProtection to the poorer members  of  society.     The  inter-relation of social  security benefits  and tax  is,  however,  an  area of greatCoiQplexity,  where generalisations  can be  facile  and where solutionsttay be  difficult  to  find.As  stated in para .1.17 above the  Government  is  already taking steps  to  deal with these problems.     Moreover,  the Chancellor  of the^exchequer has  given a commitment,  as  far as  circumstances  permit,^0 deduce  the burden  of  income tax at  all levels,  and to  increasethe level  of personal tax allowances  to  the point where they standc&apos;kQVe tjje levels  of the main social  security benefits.     TheG oVernment  intends to give further consideration to the questioniaf the  interaction of the tax  and  social  security system^eates  disincentives  to work at  lower levels  of  earnings.
Mobility of Labour2.1      The Government remains committed to its efforts to ensurethrough regional policy that dobs can go to workers in areas of high unemployment.   But even in an economy with no regional imbalances,it would remain necessary to ensure that workers with particularskills can easily move to the particular vacant jobs requiring thoseskills.   Even with the present high levels of unemployment, manycases are being reported by SWTs of shortages of key skilled workers.The machinery exists in the Employment Service Agency for circulatingParticulars of vacancies and of available labour throughout thecountry and this machinery is at present being modernised using thelastest computerised techniques.2.2      Housing and Industrial Mobility,.   Housing policy can greatlyassist industrial regeneration by making it easier for people tomove house to new jobs.   This was recognised in the recent GreenPapers1^housing policy.   Many of its proposals will help; in particular&apos;ttider access to home ownership; more flexible allocations and transfer policies in the local authority sector (especially the ending of residential qualifications for access to waiting lists);further support for the growth of housing associations and new formsof tenure; and measures to sustain the supply of !quick access&apos;accommodation in the private rented sector.   Local authorities will&quot;be encouraged to think comprehensively about the needs of labourmobility in preparing the new local housing strategies each, year;aud central Government will be able to take their proposals intoaccount in allocating capital resources.   A pilot scheme is being set up to link local authority housing with vacancies for keyworkers so that these can be advertised by the ESA in other areas with an offer of local authority accommodation; and the RoyalCommission on Legal Services is examining the cost of conveyancingof owner-occupied houses.2.3      TTgmRfftrnbility of Pensions.   While there are no statutoryobstacles to voluntary transfer of pension rights, there are certainPractical difficulties which may, in some cases, impede occupationallabour mobility.   The Secretary of State for Social Services intends to invite the Occupational Pensions Board to study the question oft^ansferability as soon as practicable. _1Housing Policy:   A Consultative Document Cmnd 6851Scottish Housing:   A Consultative Document Cmnd 6852

If employees - and unions - feel more secure, they are mere likely toco-operate to increase productivity and efficiency.   However,   the Governmentwill take full account of the volume of measures carried by both conservative and.Labour Administrations in considering any freshProposals which come forward for further legislation in this field.   The Department0f Employment has also arranged for two pieces of research to be carried out onthe impact of recent measures on employers, in particular to establish whether^ere is validity in the view that these measures have made employers morereluctant to take on new labour.capital cost and availability of capitalSince last autumn, interest rates have fallen very substantially; by about10*0% at the short end and about 3% at the long end by     October .  The main questions relating to the cost and availability of capital are kept under review the Roll Committee, and the Wilson Committee is examining the whole area oflnstitutional arrangements for providing finance for industry; therefore thesere not discussed in this paper.
-2      The Government is, however, concerned that the banks should show a proper understanding of the needs and importance of industry,Oust as (as is discussed elsewhere in this paper) it is concerned that the civil service and education should show a proper understandingor* industry.   The Government therefore wishes to see an increasinginvolvement of the banks in the industrial strategy and welcomes theaddition   of bank representatives as members of SWPs.taxation5*1      Detailed questions on taxation (such as the future of the stockbelief scheme) are not appropriate to a discussion of the wider^plications of the industrial strategy.   However, it is appropriatehere to emphasise that the Government&apos;s long-term taxation objectivesinclude:i. maintaining stability and continuity of the corporatetax system, to strengthen business planning and confidence;ii. reducing the burden of direct personal taxation at all levels, and achieving a better balance between direct and indirect taxation;iii. reducing the complexity of the tax system (which atpresent places a heavy administrative burden on industry andon Government).Moreover, the Government considers it an important objective tocreate an environment which promotes innovation (eg by measures toassist small firms).   These objectives constitute an appropriatefiscal background to the industrial strategy.5*2      It is worth noting that by international standards the taxburden borne by the corporate sector is comparatively low.   Thereal burden of corporation tax proper is generally not heavy, largely because of the impact of stock relief; and, moreover, the social security contributions payable by the employer in respect of hisWorkforce are much lower than in most other European countries.   ThisContrasts with personal income taxation where the UK levies a highburden by international standards.
i.1   The Government has supported the Sandilands Committee recommen-dation that current cost accounting should become the basis for thePreparation of company accounts, as giving companies a better and     ^more realistic view of their transactions than historic cost accounting.At the same time the Government has emphasised the importance of ensuring that the new system is practicable, which means that itmust be kept simple to operate, especially for smaller companies andtheir accountants.   In balancing the requirements for precision andsimplicity, the Government will continue to encourage the accountingProfession to avoid proposals which place too great a burden oncompanies.6.2   There are also proposals for other aspects of company reportingin the Green Paper dust published by the Secretary of State for Trade,^his recognises that there may be a case for imposing less onerousrequirements on small firms, but again it will be necessary in reaching decisions to balance the case for a particular disclosure requirementagainst the extra work which companies will face in collecting anaPublishing the information.PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION?a     Infrastructure7&quot;1   Planning and.....Land.   A number of SWPs have drawn attention tothe dlnger that&quot; planning procedures may obstruct the industrialstrategy, either because too little priority is placed on the needfor industrial development or because of the slowness and complexityQf Planning procedures (which, it has been alleged, delay industrialdevelopment much more than is the case in other countries).   TheGovernment has taken the following steps:i.*    as described in the paper put to the Council in Julyby the Secretary of State for the Environment, it has askedlocal authorities now to give industry top priority in the handling of planning applications and in making land availablefor development and to be particularly sensitive to the needsof small firms in both urban and rural areas;
ii. as far as the Department of the Environment itself isconcerned, matters relating to industrial development,including appeals and building regulations jurisdiction,will now be given first priority.   While average times forthe handling of planning appeals by the Department havealmost halved in the last two years, the Government is determined to achieve an even greater improvement.   TheDepartment therefore proposes for the future to give priority to the handling of all industrial planning appeals.   It alsoaims to transfer to inspectors all industrial planning appealsrelating to buildings up to 1500 sq metres, as opposed to theexisting upper limit of 500 sq metres.   With these changes,the Department considers that it could work to a period of5 months as the normal maximum for the handling of mostindustrial planning appeals, with not more than about one casein five exceeding that figure.   That proportion cannot be eliminated because the handling of a planning appeal depends on co-operation by the local authorities and the applicant,and also on the amount of local opposition that may be generated.Highly contentious or large applications for industrial planning permission are often called in by the Secretary of State asthe most satisfactory way of handling them.   The times forsuch cases are not included in the references above and theywould normally exceed five months.   Special considerations apply also to mineral extraction cases.   Steps are being takenwithin DOE to speed up the handling of such cases but many ofthem are complex and will continue to present difficulties;iii. the Secretary of State for Scotland has published aconsultation paper on the general operation of the planningsystem in Scotland: this includes possible means of speedingup the handling of planning applications.   He also proposesdiscussions with the local authorities, STUC and CBI on theindustrial strategy which will include, among other things,consideration of the ways in which the planning system mightassist industry;iv. similar steps to those of DOE ajre being taken by theSecretary of State for Wales.
.5*2      The Government is considering whether research can beUndertaken to monitor the effects of the above measures.*^      Industrial Development Certificates (IDCs) and OfficeSgyelopment Permits (ODr,&apos;s),   While the Government is committed&quot;to retaining these instruments as an essential part of regional policy, it made relaxations in the IDC scheme in 1976, and hasnow announced relaxations in the ODP scheme (which also impingeson manufacturing industry).   It undertakes to operate both schemesln as flexible as possible a manner in the interests of theindustrial strategy.Building Regulations.   Industry also has a close interest in&quot;kne speedy handling of applications for building regulationsaPproval.   Work is at present being undertaken:i. to develop a more flexible and time-saving procedure for building regulation;ii. to examine the scope for rationalisation of the buildingregulations and other legislation relating to buildings,particularly in respect of measures against fire.Roads.   One of the principal objectives for future transport policy set out in the Governmenfs White Paper (Cmnd 6836) is toC0*tribute to economic growth and higher national prosperity by giving industry and other sectors of production an efficient&quot;transport service.   To this end the Government will give priorityWithin the national road programme to improvements on routes whichServe the main industrial areas and the ports.   Industrial traffic&quot;ill also benefit from the road schemes chosen to serve regional needsan&amp; &quot;those designed to take heavy traffic out of built up areas.   as a local Government is concerned, authorities have been asked by^ke Government to reflect the priority for industry in their traffic management policies and in their choice of road schemes.7 public Trap sport.   Adequate public transport services are essential if the labour force is to be properly matched with availableeinPloyment, and if shift working is to be feasible.   In its White Pap011 &quot;transport Policy, the Government re-affirms its belief that theraaintenance of an effective network of bus services is an importantaim of its transport policy and makes provision for a substantial and16
continuing commitment to financial support.   The White Paper rejectsany notion of imposing major cuts in the railway system, and setsQut the main tasks for the railways, of which the carriage of people to and from work in London and the major conurbations, and the carriage of bulk freight especially between sidings, are particularlymaterial to this paper. &apos;Production and Pistribujiion CostsPollution Policy.   The UK&apos;s geography and climate gives itau environment which can more easily absorb and disperse pollutionthan the environments of many continental countries.   In order toProtect this natural competitive advantage, the Government re-affirms^-ts determination to work for the retention of the existing UKQuality objectives approach&quot;, which is preferable in the circumstancesQf the UK on both economic and environmental grounds to uniformemission standards.*2      As far as existing UK practices are concerned, the Government^-oes not consider that these in general are imposing an unreasonableburden on industry.   However, there may have been cases where tooabrupt changes or inconsistent decisions have been to the detriment of industry.   The Government:i. &apos; has asked local authorities to cease imposing planningconditions in an attempt to deal with problems which are thesubject of controls under separate legislation;ii. will make greater efforts to keep export industries intouch with international moves towards higher environmentalstandards.Energy Policy.   General energy policy issues have recently&quot;been the subject of separate discussion in NEDC.   A Green Paper0n Energy Policy will be published later this year.*^      A matter of concern to a number of SWPs has been that of energy pricing policy.   In general, the Government considers thatthe prices to industry of electricity, coal, gas and oil do notCompare unfavourably with price levels in other European countries 5atl(^ that the objective of proper economic pricing is in the bestlonE-term interests of industry as well as the economy in general.
8.5      It is sometimes argued that, in order to hold down prices forthe domestic sector, there has in the past been a degree of cross-aabsddJsation within energy tariffs and prices against industrialconsumers.   In fact for a number of years both domestic andindustrial tarriffs were well below economic levels.   The move towards proper economic pricing has, however, been accompanied bya better general balance between industrial and domestic prices and tariffs.   The Government welcomes this move, and would not wish for the future to see discrimination against industrialconsumers.8.6      The real price of energy is, however, bound to rise over the longer term.   The return to industry from energy conservationProjects is therefore equally certain to be increasingly large.The Government hopes that the Council will use its influence to persuade industrialists of the benefits for them, as well as forthe nation, in undertaking investment in energy conservation.8-7      Transport Costs.   Two e.c. issues could have importantconsequences for transport costs:&quot;       i.     the new proposals for harmonization of maximum permittedlorry weights and dimensions (which, if agreed, would reducethe costs of road freight and facilitate exports of lorries);the introduction of e.c. rules on commercial drivers&apos; hour(the increase in costs will be severe unless we can achieve the staged programme of implementation for which we are negotiating).The Government will attach particular importance to the industrial-^Plications in its approach to these two issues.8 R&apos;s      The Government&apos;s intention to increase taxation on heavylorries is in line with the principle of covering full economic costsSowever, it will continue to give full consideration to the viewsof^-Udustry in deciding on the pace of increase in this taxation.
M       Water Charges.    Water authorities arc under a stautory obligation to set charge,, high enough to break even.    They arealso required to fix charges with regard to costs, and to avoidundue discrimination between different classes of consumers.    Thiseffectively precludes them from discriminating in favour ofindustry:    nor is it reasonable that they should, since they couldonly do so at the expense of the domestic consumers for whomwater services charges are already a sensitive issue in the context of counter-inflation policy.    Some industries havecomplained of particular difficulties arising from increases m^ade effluent charges, especially where charges had been keptartificially low in the past and are now being increased as aresult of the general move towards equalisation within regions(agreed in principle with the CBI).    These industries are considennjointly with the water industry ways and means of solving these problems.9- Research and Development9.1      Z^^^^ Poli^ initiatives have borne out theGovernments determination to encourage R&amp;D in industry.    Selectiveassistance, under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972, has includedProvision for product development assistance, and this is being^tended under the Process and Product Development Scheme announced on 18 July.    On a smaller scale, the Manufacturing Advisory Serviceannounced in April, to which  8 million has been allocated over  Years, will help smaller and medium sized firms in manufacturing^dustry, especially those engaged in metal working and assembly,to make better use of proven technologies.9-2       Through such schemes the Government aims to assist industryt0 carry through its own research and development.    Through theNational Research Development Corporation (NRDC) assistance isalready available both to industry and to private individuals for^search into and development of inventions.    The management of^e Governments own research and development also has an importantrole to play &apos;   In the research council sphere special efforts arebeing devoted to the development of research in areas likely to beof special value to industry.    For example, in science the resources*ovoted to &quot;big science&quot;  (high energy physics, astronomy and spaceScience) are being cut back by 25% to preserve scope for initiative in other fields (eg polymer engineering, marine technology andMineral exploration). igcr
9*3      The eight Requirements Boards which commission research workon &quot;behalf of the Department of Industry aim to increase the numberof contracts placed in industry or industry supported research associations, rather than &quot;in-house&quot;.   In aggregate the BoardsPlan to commission from industry 40% of the work over the next fewyears.   This can be compared to the following proportions overthe last 4 years:1973-74       1974-75       1975-76       1976-7712.7% 12.9% 17-2% 21.9%Some work will of course continue to be done by the Department&apos;s0wn Industrial Research Establishments. However, the Governmentrecognizes the importance of getting the fruits of this work out-ato industry for industry to develop as early as possible.9*4      Moreover, all Government departments which sponsor technicaldevelopments have been asked to review arrangements to ensure thatas much as possible of the work is done in industry rather than&quot;ili-house,lc9*5      The Advisory Council on Applied Research and Development(ACARD) has now been established under the Lord Privy Seal&apos;chairmanship.   Its work programme is specifically directed towardsthe industry-related aspects of R&amp;D.   It will, inter alia, be considering the Government&apos;s role as a commissioner of R&amp;D and how^UH industrial benefits can be gained from this.SALES*M    SiL.   The Government has now put forward a -etricrfxo&quot;ProgremmTTsTTalis for consultation, and recognises the rndust,xaiimportance of the implementation of metrication heing completed as rapidly as possible.*.2    Standardization.   The Government is urgently following up the^commendations addressed to it in the Warner Report, which willbe the subject of a separate report to the Council.
3    Consumer fi;&apos; t ctdou.    In general consumer protection measuresoperate at the point of sale and thus have no direct effect onmanufacturing industry.   Proposals on product liability, under whichTV--. defects m-Producers would be automatically liable for damage caused by/their products, may have implications for insurance cover needed bymanufacturers in certain sectors (notably pharmaceuticals, machine&quot;tools, motor cars), but at present there is insufficient evidence toQuantify the effect in relation to other costs.^*      Public PurchasingThe scope for further increases in the proportion of publicPurchases made from UK manufacturers is limited, given that nearly95% by value of current purchases are made from UK manufacturers(excluding raw materials where certain imports are inescapable and^-nternetional defence collaborative projects which are designed to^e self-balancing).   However, the Government:i. is looking for ways of reducing yet further the amountof public purchases which come from abroad;ii. will consider ways in which the UK content of purchases from UK suppliers can be maximised.*^*2    An area in which greater progress can be looked for is that0x&quot; the impact of standards and specifications on the exportPotential of products purchases by the public sector.   Attention.    s heen focused on problems here by the Warner and Brown Reports,as Well as by SWP reports.   The Government is determined to makesuhstantial progress here, and hopes that industry will take every0Pportunity to draw attention to the possibilities of concreteaction in specific areas.*3    The Warner Report noted a number of specific areas whoseexPort potential might thus be enhanced.   By way of a pilote2cercise, the Department of Industry proposes to examine in detailsupply of broadcasting equipment.   The Department will discussth purchasers and manufacturers whether there is scope fore3\Port efforts to be improved by action along the lines recommended111 the Warner Report.
12.       Competition Policy12.1     Competition policy has an important role to play, as part ofthe industrial strategy,, in improving the performance of Britishindustry.   The Government is reviewing the operation and effectiveness of competition policy in achieving this objective through the existing legislation and institutions.13.      Relations with Governmentl^ivJA service/industry mobility.   It is widely held that the-British practice of offering a full life career in the Civil Service,and of little mid-life recruitment, leads to a lack of mutual^understanding between the Service and industry, and therefore a failure to give enough weight to industry&apos;s interests and concerns&quot;hen policy is being formulated.   Recognising that there is a degree of truth in this, the Government and the CBI alike for morethan a decade have accepted interchange postings between the CivilService and industry as an aim of policy.   By continuous effort onDoth sides something has been achieved, but not on a large scale.^5.2    Between 1973 and 1975, for instance, some 35 civil servantskave undertaken exchange postings to industry and commerce, ands:uailarly some 70 people from the private sector have done spellsln the Service - mainly at middle management level.   On top ofthese figures, some 60 recruits via the direct entry PrincipalCo&amp;petition have joined the Service in the last 5 years in mid-lifeafter industrial and commercial experience.   Despite strong0Pposition from the Civil Service unions this line of recruitmentls being maintained even in present circumstances of manpower cuts.s benefits are cumulative, and nearly all of those recruited staylri the Service, so the total from this background continues to grow,further industrial and commercial experience has also been imported^ recruitment from outside for posts where specific prior experiencels necessary or highly desirable.13,2    wnevertheless, the Government considers that it is very^ Portant to achieve a much higher degree of interchange betweene Civil Service and industry, and to promote a much greater degreeBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT12.      Ca^ietitioji^I i^T
of mutual understanding on both, sides.   Although, there are very realdifficulties in arranging exchange postings, they represent the bestshort-term prospect of further improvement.    The Government thereforeproposes to achieve a sharp and substantial increase in the number ofcivil servants seconded to industry.   More secondments of businessmeninto the Civil Service would also be desirable (although, the flow ofsecondments need not lalance either locally or generally).    This is likelyto prove more difficult than secondments in the other direction becauseable businessmen run greater risks than civil servants of jeopardisingtheir careers if they leave them for crucial periods, and problems of pay and conflict of interest can also arise.    To attain these two objectivesthe Government intends to aim to at least double the number of civilservants seconded to industry by the end of the decade and to ensure that &apos;jby then the total number of exchanges in operation in both directions atany oie time will be approaching 200.    This will require the active co-operation of all departments, and hence of a very wide spread ofindustrial and commercial employers;    and the Government proposes to holdtalks with the CBI and leading firms to secure their assistance in achiev-ing the substantial increases which are needed.13.4-    There are attractions in making the secondments rather shorterthan the usual 2-3 years.    This can usefully increase the number of people who have had direct experience in commerce and industry, while also reduc-ing the degree of sacrifice the parent organisation has to make.    this change can be associated with linking the secondment to a specificProject, whichhas a number of advantages.    This approach has already beentried successfully on a small scale.    It could well be a significantcomponent in the further expansion of secondments.    The use of jointSeminars (which have already proved useful) will be extended.    The widerUse of training processes, within the Service or in co-operation withthe business school, is in hand.&quot;13.5    However, the Government considers that the question of civilservice/industry mobility requires further consideration in the longer term.   This may involve rethinking of issues which go much wider thanthe matter of secondments.13.6    Burdens on industry-    It is frequently alleged by industrialiststhat the CTWiulative burden of Government requirements - such as
CONFIDENTIALcollection of Information,&apos; the complexity of the tax system, planningdelays and legislative requirements - imposes unreasonable costs on industry, particularly on smaller firms, and damages    efficiency.    TheGovernment therefore proposes, as a first step, to arrange for a fact-finding exercise to be carried out to assess the total burden ofGovernment legislative and administrative requirements on somerepresentative firms.
