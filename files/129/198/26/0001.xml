Document is the property of her britannic majesty-s government cp(77) 11620 December 1977cabinetTHE PAY SCENEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. This is an appropriate moment to take stock of our pay policy in thecurrent round.    By taking firm action from August to October on proposalsfor excessive settlements, mainly in the private sector, we removed theimmediate prospect of a wage explosion.    As a result, with the help of theTrades Union Congress&apos; (tuc&apos;s) agreement on the 12 month rule and self-financing productivity deals, almost all Stage 2 settlements have now been satisfactorily concluded.    The 12 month rule is holding.    Since October, wehave successfully completed the critical negotiation with the local authoritymanuals, which is likely to set the pattern for many settlements in thepublic sector, and have faced the special cases of the police and firemen.The settlement with the local authority manuals will greatly reinforce theauthority of the policy for the present round.2. There is growing evidence that the Government1 s pay policy hasoverwhelming public support.    But there are some large and importantnegotiations ahead from February to April.    Moreover, we must begin tothink about the longer term.    In particular, some aspects of current negotiations may compel us to formulate an agreed policy for the public sector in the next round well before the end of the current round.THE SHAPE OF THE CURRENT ROUND3. The main features of the round so far are as follows:a.       There has been much less flexibility between settlements thanoriginally hoped.    Because very few groups have been prepared tosettle for an earnings increase significantly below 10 per cent theGovernment has been compelled to oppose settlements significantlyabove 10 per cent.    Nevertheless opportunities are being taken towiden differentials within settlements by giving unskilled workers alittle less than 10 per cent and the minority of skilled workers a fewpercentage points more.COPY NO811
b.       Productivity deals are adding perhaps 1 per cent or 2 per cent tothe average level of settlements.    They are providing a usefulflexibility in many cases.    Although they may not all be genuinelyself-financing, they are probably generating some genuine improve-ments in productivity.    It is proving very difficult for us to discover,evaluate and monitor all such deals although we must continue to do our best to do so.4. The prospects for the rest of the round include the following features:a. An appraisal by officials of the 50 or so main negotiations overthe next four months concludes that there is a real chance of settlingevery individual case at or around 10 per cent, provided that the linecan be held generally elsewhere, but that any major breach of theguidelines would have a disastrous domino effect.b. Forward commitments are a potential source of trouble;  theyhave been accepted explicitly for firemen and implicitly for the police.Officials are preparing a study of cases where forward commitmentsmay be demanded and will make recommendations on handling theproblem.    Such demands may arise from the recommendations of the review Boards for the Armed Forces, doctors and dentists and top salaries, as well as from claims by university teachers and from theanalogous pay research problem of the non-industrial Civil Service.It will be necessary to limit forward commitments to the absoluteminimum unless they are to create formidable difficulties for policyin the public sector as a whole during the next round.    This is perhaps the main factor which may compel us to formulat a comprehensivepolicy for the public sector in the next round by early summer nextyear.c. Wage drift may be somewhat less this round partly because ofthe greater flexibility and partly because in areas of the public sectorovertime is as likely to fall as to increase, and many private employers cannot afford to fiddle on a large scale.THE NEXT FEW months. In the immediate future we still risk serious trouble over oil tankerdrivers, and there could be others.    Following the settlement of localauthority manuals, we must get the same pattern adopted in the related casesof National Health Service ancillaries, water and gas manuals, and clinchthe deal with firemen without fuither concessions.    But two groups of futuresettlements stand out in importance:-a.       Power workers in the gas, electricity and coal industries couldquickly bring the economy to a halt.    It is particularly difficult to assess the prospects, timing and interrelationships of their negotia-tions.    Much will depend on the climate which is built up before anycrunch comes.2
b.       Public services:  A large proportion of white-collar public services is due to settle in April, with some very strong linkagesbetween different groups within the total.    These include most of the candidates for forward commitments.    Quite apart from any damage which could be done through failure to reach agreement in individualnegotiations, if we show weakness in managing these groups wewould risk reopening satisfactory settlements achieved in earliermonths.    By the same token, if we are successful in settlementswith earlier groups, particularly the power workers, we will find itmuch easier to settle with the white-collar public services.6. There are three areas of action to which the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) attachesparticular importance:a. Although public opinion is solidly behind the Government thereis still the impression in some quarters that the current roundrepresents another year of sacrifice.    In fact, living standards havebeen increasing since the summer and will continue to increasethroughout the round if settlements are within the guidelines, evenwithout further tax cuts in the spring Budget.    This fact should berammed home in speeches by Ministers and general government publicity.b. Contingency plans for dealing with industrial action have beenprepared, and are being implemented where appropriate (forexample adequate stocks are being built up at the right locations).There are however limitations on the ability of the Armed Forces to handle two or more contingencies at the same time.    This makes itparticularly important not to use the Armed Forces except where therisk to life or national interest plainly requires it.c. Ad hoc official groups are being set up to keep track of theprospects and developments on the power groups - and later thepublic services.    Ministers will be advised on steps which might betaken - o. should be avoided - before and during negotiations.AFTER PHASE THREE7. If we persevere in seeking to influence individual settlements thereis now a good chance that the current policy will not only avoid a wageexplosion but also achieve an earnings outturn compatible with single figureinflation in 1978.    But this will be at the cost of greater rigidity than wewould have wished and of at least a few damaging forward commitments.    Itis difficult to feel confident that we could return to full freedom of collective bargaining in the next round without risking an increase in wage costs which
would raise both prices and unemployment    Moreover there is a growingfeeling in the Labour movement itself that total freedom in collective bargaining is incompatible with both social justice and economic efficiency.8. There are special reasons for believing that we are moving into aperiod in which some sort of pay policy will be not only more necessary thanat most times in the past but also more feasible.9. The central problem of our economy for more than a generation hasbeen that, although our productivity has grown more slowly than that of our competitors, we have seen annual wage increases of the same order as theirs.So our inflation has risen faster than in other countries and we have been ableto maintain price competitiveness and full employment only by a series ofdevaluations which have further added to inflation and increased the pressure for excessive wage increases.    In the era of North Sea oil it will bemore difficult to devalue our currency to maintain price competitiveness.So unless we can keep wage increases close to the level of productivityincrease we shall face rising unemployment and a further erosion of our industrial base.10.        It is the aim of our industrial strategy to increase the trend ingrowthof productivity.    But we are likely also to need a policy which will help tokeep the increase in our wage costs close to whatever growth in productivitywe do achieve.    Otherwise we risk finding that North Sea oil simply producesrising living standards allied to rising unemployment, followed by a major political and economic crisis when the oil runs out, because we have lost theindustrial capacity to earn such high living standards without the oil.    Thisis why pay policy is likely to be more and not less necessary in the periodahead.11. On the other hand there is now a better understanding than ever beforeamong all sections of our people that high inflation is not only a major socialevil but is also incompatible with high employment.    Trade unionists are tired of being paid in confetti money.    The current dramatic fall in ourinflation rate is rightly seen as mainly due to moderation in pay settlements.So there is a better chance than ever before of getting support for a continuing policy to discourage excessive pay increases.12.        The need for such a policy in the public sector is inescapable and hasbeen recognised recently by the leaders of public sector unions likeMr David Basnett and Mr Geoffrey Drain.    Forward commitments already accepted in the public sector make this more necessary still.    But it wouldbe difficult to operate a pay policy successfully in the public sector if free-dom is exercised irresponsibly in the private sector.    In the private sector,however, and to a lesser degree in the public sector too the rigidity of paypolicy over the last three years has produced damaging distortions.    Theproblem is not only the excessive compression of existing differentials butalso the difficulty of changing differentials which are incompatible with
economic need.    For example, the widespread shortage of skilled labour at present seems due less to the absence of the necessary skills than to the unwillingness of those with the skills to accept jobs which pay them less thanthey can earn elsewhere.P13.        It is not too early for us to consider finding an answer to these problems.    The remaining seven months of the current pay round will not be too long.    We already know that if we are to get our inflation rate down tothat Of our international competitors and keep it there we shall have to achieve an earnings outturn in the next round which is not significantly higherthan our trend growth in productivity which is still well below 5 per cent.14.        It would be worth exploring with Mr Basnett and other leaders ofunions in the public sector how we could hope to achieve such an outturn inthe public sector as a whole, and how to approach demands for forwardcommitments in the light of this.15.        At the appropriate time we should also approach the TUC more generally about the role of pay policy in the strategy on which we fight thenext Election, and about the contribution they might be prepared to make.We should seek to persuade them, for example, to reaffirm the 12 month rulewhile making some provision for synchro-pay in areas like British Leylandwhere this is likely to conduce to better industrial relations and to accept theinevitability of some forward commitments without treating them as a generalbase for all new claims.16.        I put these ideas forward for discussion in a tentative spirit, since Iam unclear myself about how best to proceed.    But I am convinced by our experience over the last three years that a more rational approach to paypolicy is both necessary and possible in the longer run, and that we mustbegin to face the implications of this now.D W treasury Chambers20 December 19775
