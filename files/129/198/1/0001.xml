S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT20CP(77)91 COPY NO10 October 1977CABINETECONOMIC POLICY:  THE NEXT STEPSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. We have now gone a long way to consolidate the improvement in our financial position begun last winter.    This has been widely recognised both at home and overseas - for example, at the International Monetary Fund(IMF) meeting in Washington.    As a result, we are in a position to consider further measures to strengthen domestic demand, and to improve the outlook for employment.2. Our prospects hinge, however, on the continuing success of the fight against inflation. The uncertainties surrounding the present round of pay settlements have important implications both for the size and the shape ofthe measures to which we should commit ourselves at this stage.*-    THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT3- Economic activity has remained subdued thi s year and unemployment has continued to rise.    The main increase in demand has been throughexports and, to a lesser extent, industrial investment.    Public sectorspending on goods and services has probably fallen as planned and personal consumption has dropped sharply.    The balance of payments has improvedstrongly:  and the current account is probably now in balance or modestsurplus.4. Retail prices have slowed down.    The year on year rise may wellbe down to some 13 per cent in the final quarter of this year and should bedown into single figures during the first half of 1978.    As 1978 progresses,however, the outcome will depend increasingly on the level of pay settlements during the coming round.    The economic prospect which Ioutline below assumes that the increase in average national earnings is held to 10 per cent.    But thu whole prospect could worsen if earnings risesignificantly faster.    For example, if earnings rise by 15 per cent, retail prices would probably be accelerating back into double figures before theend of 1978.
5. From now on growth may pick up gradually as a recovery in realpersonal incomes and consumption increases consumer expenditure and production.    With exports and private sector investment continuing to rise,total output (GDP) could increase moderately fast (perhaps of the order of3  per cent) during 1978.    Thus, in the absence of any new policy measures,the economy may be growing at a rate just above what would be needed to stop the upward trend in unemployment.6. The balance of payments on current account is likely to go onimproving, mainly owing to North Sea oil, with a surplus vhich could be over 2 billion for 1978.7.        The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for 1977-78 is nowforecast at about  7 billion - that is,  1.7 billion below the figure to whichwe committed ourselves last December.    It is very tentatively put at about 7 billion also in 1978-79.8. In the first four months of 1977-78, the growth of domestic credithas been very slow, while the growth of sterling M3 has been at the bottom of the target range of 9-13 per cent.    The outlook for the remainder of thecurrent year is for the growth in  M3 to accelerate and to be towards the top end of the 9-13 per cent range for the year as a whole;  a similar rateof growth could be envisaged in 1978-79.    Confidence in domestic marketsis however closely related to the level of pay settlements and if these arein excess of the 10 per cent assumption, interest rates will be carried up,gilts will be more difficult to sell, and consequently  M3 might be at or above the 13 per cent upper limit to the target range.H-    ASSESSMENTDemand for Resources9-        There is now a clear case for early action to stimulate demand.We must aim at creating the conditions in which unemployment turns firmlydownwards.10-       At the same time, we must avoid the mistakes of our predecessorsin 1972-73.    Beyond a certain point, the injection of money into the economyat this stage would be more likely to recreate industrial bottlenecks, suckin imports and stimulate inflation, than to increase our own domestic output and bring down unemployment.    Inflation in Britain is still higher than theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) av*ra2e;there is uncertainty about the outcome of the current pay round;  and bothinvestment and consumers&apos; expenditure may already be on the upturn.So excessive stimulus could create real risks, particularly when we look forward to 1978-79.
Monetary Prospects11.        It must be our objective not to break the present virtuous circle inwhich, by keeping the money supply within the target range, we have helped to sustain the exchange rate, to bring down domestic interest rates, and toreduce expectations of inflation;  this in turn has strengthened confidence;and confidence in turn has made it easier for us to keep to our monetaryobjectives.12.       Because on present policies we may finish the year towards the topend of our target range for sterling M3, fiscal action on a large scale couldimply some increase in the level of interest rates.    This will dependcrucially not only on the size of the fiscal package, but also on its nature -the extent to which it concentrates on measures which are consistent withthe overall economic strategy to which the Government has pledged itself,and which therefore are likely to meet a favourable market response.    Themarket&apos;s response will depend to an important extent on whether theGovernment is seen to be maintaining the firm control of public expenditure which it established last year.HI.    SHAPE OF AN AUTUMN PACKAGE13-       All these considerations suggest that any package of measures should meet the following tests:-a. Both because we want the largest and quickest effect onunemployment and because we can count on significant headroom in1977-78, it should give a further significant stimulus in the current year; but, because the outlook for 1978-79 is more uncertain, itshould not pre-judge the size and shape of the 1978 Budget more than is essential.b. It should be seen to be consistent with the Governmentspublished targets for the monetary aggregates and with our IMFcommitments for the current year.c. It should be seen as a natural development of the economic strategy which I announced in the Budget and which has been endorsedat international meetings.d. It should be consistent with maintaining a sufficient surpluson the current account and enabling us to make a start on repayingour debt.!4.       The measures will also, of course, have to take account of thepresent position in Parliament and the pact with the Liberals.3
15.       On balance, I believe that measures costing up to  1 billion in thecurrent year (1977-78) can now be justified;  we need to leave some of ouroptions open for 1978-79, but we can, I think, now commit a further 1 billion in that year - or a total of  2 billion over the next 18 months.IV.    ACTION AFFECTING 1977-7816.       The options for significant action in the current year are, for practical reasons, very largely confined to cash transactions - either taxchanges or transfer payments - and even here the administrative constraintsare formidable.    There is little scope for varying the Government1 spurchases of real resources between now and next March.Indirect Taxes17.        A cut in indirect taxes would contradict our stated objective to shiftthe tax burden from direct to indirect taxatior..    But it would in the long runhave a similar demand effect to a cut in direct taxation and would Reduceinflation in the short run.    The standard rate of Value Added Tax (VATJcould be reduced from 8 per cent to (cay) 6 per cent, and the higher ratesof VAT from 12  per cent to (say) 10 per cent.    This would take effect from a current date in November and the demand effect would therefore be relatively small in the current financial year, since it is impossible tobackdate changes in indirect taxation.    Similarly, and also because of thelags in VAT collection, the cost in 1977-78 would be rather small - 115 million; but the cost in 1978-79 would be some  900 million.    Itwould reduce the year on year inflation rate by 1 per cent straightaway.18.       It would also be possible to reduce the specific duties, but this wouldaPPear particularly perverse at a time when their real value has alreadyfallen significantly in recent years and the arguments of energy conservation,transport and health policy point in the other direction.    Indeed, now thatwe are committed to the indexation of personal income tax allowances, thereis a strong case in principle for raising these duties annually m line with inflation.Income Taxl9.       It is not possible for the Inland Revenue to make administrativeroom for a cut in income tax in mid-year unless we exempt from tax inthe current financial year the November increase in National insurance pensions - at a cost of  40 million, giving a significant addition to the realincome of about Z\ million pensioners.    On this condition, the revenue would be able to implement this autumn an increase in the personalallowances for all taxpayers for the current financial year.    The obviouscourse is to introduce this autumn some or all of the increases in Phonalallowances (indexation in line with price inflation), which under the 1977Finance Act we are required to implement next April unless we can get the4
House of Commons positively to vote against them.    This would be an advance or &quot;on account&quot; relief.    On present estimates, full indexationrequires increases of around 12 per cent - that is  100 in the singleallowance,  160 in the married allowance and corresponding increases inthe other personal allowances.    This would take nearly 1 million peopleout of liability to tax.    If introduced in 1977-78 the cost would be 985 million.    There would be relatively little additional cost for 1978-79,over and abov? the indexation to which we are already committed under the1977 Finance Act.20.       The increases in allowances would be backdated to April so thai; theyapplied to the whole of the current tax year.    Thus they would entail lump sum tax rebates payable in November or December of up to  40 for a married man, and  25 for a single person, plus additional tax relief of alittle over  1 a week foi a married man thereafter.21.       Full indexation this autumn would represent a much more substantialstimulus to demand in the immediate future than the reduction in VAT orthe specific duties.    It could be worth nearly half of 1 per cent of GDP bythe first quarter of 1978, and it would thus have a quicker impact on theunemployment figures.    At the same time, it would represent a minimumadditional commitment for the 1978 Budget.    Thus, it would leave us withthe maximum flexibility to introduce further fiscal reliefs in the Budget ifeconomic circumstances permit.    By the same token, it would give areasonable assurance that we shall not have over committed ourselves, ifevents develop less favourably.    It would also give maximum help to thelower paid and enlarge the gap between income from work and income frombenefits.22.       If we decided to give less than the 12 per cent indexation of personalallowances at this stage - perhaps for the reasons discussed in paragraph 29below - the effects in paragraphs 19-21 above would, of course, be correspondingly smaller.    It would in that case be important to make clearthat we would rzise the level of allowances further in the Spring Budget soas to achieve then the full indexation prescribed in the Finance Act 1977.Public Expenditure23.       The Contingency Reserve for 1977-78 has now been run down by our previous decisions to about  190 million.    Depending on the form ofassistance, the Ford Erika project in South Wales is likely to require thisyear some  30 million from the Contingency Reserve; but this could riseto as much as  45 million.    I am sure that we should not exceed the contingency Reserve in only the second year of its operation as a controlfigure.24.       Within what remains there are a number of options.    For example,we could cancel the artificial administrative delay of 3 months m thepayment of regional development grants and agricultural capital grants
imposed as part of the J976 expenditure cuts.    This will have to be donesome time since complaints will build up if the delays are maintained.    Therelease of funds would benefit industry in a3sisted areas, and agriculture.The cost is once for all.    If it were done now, the cost would be around 100 million in 1977-78 and perhaps  25 million in 1978-79.25.       Another possibility might be to pay a  10 Christmas bonus to pensioners.    This would also cost about  100 million, and would injectsome quick spending power this year.    The weight of argument in normal circumstances would be against it.    While in theory it could be regarded asonce-for-all, it must lead to strong pressure to repeat it in future years.It was suggested earlier this year a3 something which might be done ifprices over the previous 12 months proved in the event to have risen bymore than the amount of the November uprating, but it now appears certainthat the November uprating will exceed the actual rise of prices.    The^\ million pensioners paying tax will get an unexpected bonus since theywill not now be taxed on their pension increase for the rest of this financialyear, while those on supplementary pension, the poorest, will againbenefit from our winter fuel scheme.    It would also require legislation and there must be some risk of amendments which if carried would increase the figure further.    On the other hand, if we decide to increasepersonal tax allowances, people in work will be receiving substantial^income tax rebates shortly before Christmas.    There is a case for givingat the same time some cash sum to the majority of pensioners who will not benefit from the income tax relief.26.       It is doubtful whether there are any other public expendituremeasures which would contribute significantly towards stimulating demand in 1977-78, without carrying through automatically into 1978-79, when theproblem will be very different.V.    MEASURES AFFECTING 1978-7927.       As I have said, it is important that we leave ourselves with themaximum flexibility in deciding the size and shape of our fiscal measures -increases in expenditure or reductions in taxation - for 1978-79oTaxation28.       The shape of the 1978 Budget will need to be considered in the lightof developments between now and next spring.    There may well be littleroom for major fiscal stimulus in any case, depending on the level of pay settlements and the growth of economic activity in the coming months.However, it will be veiy important, after the sacrifices of the last threeyears, that the Budget should be able to give some significant relief in the structure and burden of income tax for 1978-79.    In particular, April 1978will bring a big increase in superannuation contributions under the new scheme for &quot;Better Pensions&quot; and a further cut in child Tax Allowances to
accompany the increase in child benefits.    Moreover, the 12 per cent increase in personal tax allowances required by indexation will still be lessthan this year&apos;s 14 per cent increase in National Insurance benefits.    Therewill thus be powerful political and economic arguments for further reductions in income tax in April, in addition to the more general arguments which I summarise in paragraphs 35 to 40 below.29.       The svms at stake are very large.    For example, the increase in national Insurance contributions and loss of child tax allowances couldnext April cut some  1. 50 a week off the take home pay of a man with two children on average earnings.    To offset this in full could (on present estimates) cost between  1,750 million and  2000 million, depending on theform in which relief is given.    This is one reason why we might be wise togive less than the full 12 per cent increase in personal allowances at thisstage, so that something is left over to be paid in April.30.       Another possibility might then be to offset the cut in real take homepay next April by introducing a reduced rate band of income tax.    But againthis could be very expensive.    For example, a reduced rate band of  1, 000liable to tax at 25 per cent could cost  2,100 million.Public Expenditure31.       Providing we do not over-commit ourselves to massive further cutsin taxation next year, I consider that we can plan for some increase in public expenditure in 1978-79.    But we must beware of overcommittingourselves there too.    My proposal below would imply a central forecast for the PSBR of some  7f billion in 1978-79, before allowing for anyfurther action in the next Budget or for any consequential effect if we wereto choose the indirect tax option for action this autumn.    Every addition to public expenditure reduces the scope for tax reliefs in the Budget and increases the risk that if events develop unfavourably, a net tax increasethen may prove unavoidable.32-       My judgement is that we cannot afford to increase the planned totalof programmes and Contingency Reserve for 1978-79 by more than an absolutemaximum of  1 billion in terms of next year&apos;s prices, or some  850 million at 1977 Survey prices - or 2 per cent above the planned level of this year(1977-78).    Even this would risk dangerously limiting the scope for further action on direct taxation in the next Budget.    Of this increase, the measureswe have already announced have committed over  500 million in 1977 survey prices, of which the principal items were the uprating of child benefit andother social security benefits, the youth and other employment measures and construction work -n the inner cities.    The main element of theremainder should be further help for the construction industry, which inJuly we promised to consider.    This expenditure on construction will benefit a wide range of programmes;  and the balance, assisted by savings which Departments have identified, will enable us to meet many, though not
I regret all, other bids put forward by Departments.    Detailed proposalsfor the various programmes are set out in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper cp(77) 89.Small Firms33.       There is a good deal of pressure to do something for small firmsespecially on the tax side.    They are important to the economy as suppliersto large firms, as innovators and as employers providing more than a fifth of total employment.    They may play a valuable role in dealing with theproblems of the inner city areas.    At pr esent there is a widespread lack ofconfidence among them and, rightly or wrongly, much of the blame for thisis put on the weight of taxation.    Although I do not think we should bebemused by this pressure into thinking that there is a great deal wrongwith the pre sent tax regime, it is an area where we can usefully provide apsychological stimulus to activity.    In conjunction with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster, who is carrying out a special study ot their problemsgenerally, we are therefore considering a number of tax and other measureswhose benefit will be concentrated on email firms.    We could include thesewith the wider economic package but they would probably cost only  10 million in the current year and would not be expected to cost more than  70 millionnext year.VI.    1979-80 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS34.       Looking forward to the medium term, the prospect remains verymuch as I described it in my paper of 1 July (CP(77) 70).    In the optirmsiaccase, where earnings increase by no more than 10 per cent in 1977-78, itshould be possible to sustain a growth rate of about 4 per cent a year on average from 1978 to 1982.    This would be a significantly faster rate of growth than we have been able to sustain in the past.    However, we are unlikely to achieve this unless we improve our international competitivenessand raise the level of industrial investment.    These two conditions to aconsiderable extent go together.    Both would be at risk if inflation is notcontained.    Both would be helped by the successful implementation of our industrial strategy.35.       Our assessment last summer assumed that public expenditure wouldbe held to the Cmnd 6721 level in 1978-79 and to an annual growth of2 per cent thereafter - with any fiscal action to raise demand coming throughcuts in taxation.    The prospect for 1978-79 justifies us in raising the Pannedtotal of expenditure by  1 billion (at output prices) in that year and I would be content to see additions to the figures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 on the scale proposed in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper.    Over the medium term as a whole,however, there are still compelling reasons why we should give priority to reductions in taxation as a means of stimulating demand.8
36.       First, tax reductions can help us to continue the fight against inflation.    Reductions in income taxes increase real take home pay withoutadding to industrial costs, and help to reduce the pressure for increasedmoney incomes.    Reductions in taxation on industry reduce production costs.    Reductions in indirect taxes cut prices.37.       Second, the increase of public expenditure up to 1975-76 increased the tax burder to a degree which is widely felt to have become too heavy atall levels of income.38.       Third, tax cuts can help to expand the manufacturing and privateservice sectors of the economy, to which we must mainly look for future growth in employment.39.       Fourth, tax cuts are likely to give us more room to act againstunemployment, because they command much more confidence in financialmarkets than increases in public expenditure.40.       Fifth, the amount by which we will be able to stimulate demand inthese later years is extremely uncertain.    There may be much less room for manoeuvre than we expect at present.    Taxes can be more readilyadjusted than expenditure programmes.VII.    CONCLUSIONS41.       I ask my colleagues:a. to agree that a stimulus of up to  1 billion in 1977-78 is appropriate and to express their preference as between the optionsI have described in paragraphs 17-25.b. To agree that the public expenditure programmes for 1978-79in Cmnd 6721 should be increased by  1 billion (at the outturn pricesof that year).c. To agree the additions to public expenditure proposed bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, for 1979-80 and subsequent years.D W treasury Chambers10 October 1977
