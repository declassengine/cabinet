DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 107 COPY NO28 November 1977CABINETNATIONALISED INDUSTRIAL BOARD MEMBERS&apos; SALARIESNote by the Lord Privy seal. I attach a memorandum by my officials on this subject.2. As Minister responsible for these salaries I am in no doubt that thecontinued postponement of the increases recommended by the Top salaries review Body (TSRB) in their sixth report (TSRB 6) is causing great difficul-ties for the efficient manning of our nationalised industries at board level.The constant pressure on me from sponsor Ministers to bend or break the pay rules in seeking to recruit individuals of the requisite ability shows howfar behind the market the current rates have fallen.    I hope that mycolleagues who are responsible for the nationalised industries will them-selves expound the difficulties they are experiencing when this paper isconsidered.3. At the same time, I fully accept that at the present crucial stage ofthe Round 3 pay policy there are very strong arguments against any form ofspecial treatment for such comparatively highly-paid people whatever the justification.    And it is unlikely that the situation will be any morefavourable later in the round.4. But we must take our decisions on this problem in full awareness ofwhat we are doing.    If we decide that we can do nothing within option a. ofthe memorandum, then effectively we shall be burying the TSRB 6 which willbe overtaken by a new report next April.    This is therefore our lastopportunity of significantly closing the large gap between the current ratesand the market rates by taking advantage of the fact that the TSRB 6recommendations can be regarded as a pre-policy commitment which wouldnot therefore run foul of the guidelines.    If we do nothing the gap betweencurrent rates and those likely to emerge from the next TSRB report will bethat much larger and there will be no prospect of bridging it in the fore-seeable future.I1
5. We also need to realise that the alternative options b. and c. in thememorandum are simply ways of giving the Nationalised Industrial board members&apos; Salaries the guidelines increase which they are no doubt alreadycounting upon.    These options do not therefore really help with the problemof TSRB 6 and they will do little either to restore competitiveness orimprove morale.Civil Service Department28 November 1977
OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRY BOARD MEMBERS    (NIBMs)MEMORANDUM BY OFFICIALSls paper considers possible courses of action to deal with theof nationalised industry chairmen and board members (NIBMs),^ of the other public sector posts which are linked to it.^ttex A describes the present position and how it came about.ls annex also includes a table showing the salary rates in^ayment ( with the exception of those of Group C Board MembersWlth which no meaningful general comparison can be made) with^e&quot;fcaiis of the increase recommended by the Review Body.INC0MES POLICY CONSIDERATIONS2,The increases for NIBMs recommended by the Top Salary RevieBoarrl (TSRB) with effect from 1.1.75 (TSRB 6) are large and eventhey were staged on the basis adopted for the other groupsVered by the Report, would involve additions to current salariefor the generality of under  1000 to about  12000; with an exceptlo^aliy high increase of  17,000 for the Chairman of the Post0ffinACe and actual reductions in some rates.    However, the TSRB 6commendations pre-date the three rounds of incomes policy whichegan in 1975 and could therefore be treated as a pre-policyfitment, ie be implemented outside the current guidelines; andle NIBMs have been told this officially.    Obviously however any1 Payments, however they were justified, would be present at-0llaiiy harmful to the success of pay policy either now or laterurLe round.CONFIDENTIAL
PROBLEMS OF NON-IMPLEMENTATION3.       The out-of-date salaries hinder recruitment of the ablepeople necessary for the efficient running of these industries.Vacancies are hard to fill and standards cannot be sustained.It is increasingly necessary to resort to &apos; ad hoc1 terms - forexample to pay starting rates in the upper part of the pay range.This feeds the resentment of existing members and makes expensiveproblems for the future.4.       None of the other groups covered by the TSRB have beentotally denied their recommended 1.1.75 rates.    Members resenttheir treatment by comparison with that given to these other groups which they regard as discrimination.    Some NIBMs and many people 111the &quot;consequential&quot; groups earn less than the  13,000 which was allowed in full for other groups.    In some cases board membersalaries have been overtaken by the first, and even the second tierof officials below them.5.       If no action is taken Board members pensioned in or byanalogy with staff schemes who retire during non-implementationwill suffer the adverse effects on their pension levels until theydie.    It is possible to give pensions protection by promulgatingincreases based on TSRB 6 back to 1.1.75 while deferring actualpayment to a current date.    The promulgated rate then becomes &quot;thepensionable salary.6.       Special problems arise over the NHS consultants and BritishNuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) on which a separate paper is being circulated.    Although developments here are relevant they do notin practice materially affect the choice between the options onthe general issue.CONFIDENTIAL
THE OPTIONS7The three main possibilities are:a.     The TSRB 6 recommendations could be treated as a commitment predating the 3 rounds of incomes policy since1975*    On this basis part at least of these increases would be implemented at once without formal offence topay policy.    The remaining parts of the report, if any,would then be disregarded;    the report would be super-superseded by the recommendations from the next review (TSRB 10)from 1.4.78.     These new recommendations, would, if Ministersso decided, be implemented during the later part of thecurrent round, up to a limit consistent with the currentpay policy guidelines.There are several variants of this option, and these are described in Annex B.    This option offers the opportunityof going further in easing problems of recruitment etc.,than any of the others, depending on how close it gets to full implementation of the 1974 recommendations.    It enables the pension position of retired board members to be improved.Provided the increases are not more generous than those given to the other TSRB groups as Stage 1 of the TSRB 6recommendations, this option would not raise the questionof Stage 2 for these others.b.     Alternatively TSRB 6 could be partially implementedfrom any convenient date, probably 1 January 1978, withinthe current pay policy, ie only as far as the guidelinesallow.    Again several variants exist and some are listed in Annex C.    Variant C is designed to pay increases exactlyproportional to the salary structure designed by the TSRB,thus preserving the &quot;shape&quot; of their scheme.    Although in cash terms the increases would fall substantially short inmany cases of even the Stage I increase granted to otherCONFIDENTIAL
groups, option C of Annex C would enable 85$ of the TSRBrecommended salaries to be paid. Because implementationwould depend on the current guidelines, it is very unlikelythat any action on TSRB 10 could be taken before January1979 at the earliest. As with option a. above, the restof TSRB 6 would be superseded by TSRB 10.This option, like a., allows a degree of pensions pro-tection for the retired;    but since the increase fallswell short of even Stage 1 of TSRB 6 and any action onTSRB 10 would be postponed indefinitely, the pensions ofthose retiring would be reduced in line with the level of salaries.    Since this option confines any increase inRound 3 to the maximum allowed by the guidelines it is unlikely to create difficulties for pay policy.c.     The third main possibility is to defer any action until TSRB 10 is available.    Implementation of some partof that report, in the light of the guidelines, would leadto results very similar to those under b. above.    But thetime-scale would be different.    The first payment would bemade from 1.4.78, and there would be a presumption that further stages of TSRB 10 should wait for another 12 months*ie to April 1979-PENSIONS PROTECTION UNDER THE THREE OPTIONS8.       There are two ways of providing pensions protection (forthosealready retired) on the basis described in paragraph 5.    The actuapay increases agreed could be promulgated as from 1.1.75 (but *     ^payment deferred until a current date); or the TSRB 6 recommend^1in full could be promulgated with the payment of anything more uthe agreed increase (from a current date) deferred indefinitely&apos;first course would perhaps be more logical; the second more geneand comparable to the treatment accorded to the other TSRB group3CONFIDENTIAL
Both options.b. and c. might well be regarded by the NIBMsfrothing more than they could reasonably expect anyway under&apos;rent pay policy and therefore as in effect a final repudiationTSRB 6 with no better prospect of any improvement under TSRB 10.^*     A decision cannot be long delayed.    Apart from the intrinsicAgency of the problem,  1.1.78 is the date on which the NIBMs would^e due for a Round 3 increase under the 12 months rule.    Moreover,Sojnething will have to be said about the Government&apos;s intentions inthe White Paper replying to the NEDO Report on the Nationalised&quot;^dustries which specifically raised the pay question.
BACKGROUNDIn December 1974 the Review Body on Top Salaries (TSRB) madeits first substantive report (Report No 6) on the four groupswithin its remit (Higher Civil Service, Senior Officers of the armed forces, the Higher Judiciary and Nationalised Industry Chairmen and board Members (NIBMs)).     The recommended increases for NIBMs were intended to bring them into an appropriate relationship with theircounterparts in private industry as from 1 January 1975.2.    The average increase recommended by TSRB for NIBMs was 30$.However, because a fundamental reassessment of the work was carriedout individual increases varied widely.     For the first and secondtier boards, for example, they range from 15$ to 50$, and in thespecial case of the Post Office between 60-73$*     For some third tierboards there was a nil or very small increase and for an appreciableproportion of NIBMs neither the salary increase nor the new salarywas particularly high.3.   For the other groups covered by the TSRB recommendationsincreases ranged from 10-50$.4.    In his statement on 20 December 1974 the then Prime Ministerrecognised that the salary rates recommended by the Review Body wereaPpropriate on the basis they had followed.     He announced theacceptance of the recommendations for all groups other than NIBMs,subject to the staging of increases for levels above  13,000 (thesecond stage to be payable in 1976, though in fact it has not yet been paid).5.   Decisions on the recommendations for NIBMs were postponed pendingthe report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income andWealth (RCDIW).     Decisions on the consequentials of all the TSRBgroups many of whom earn less than  13*000 per annum were alsodeferred.1.
confidential.   No action was taken when the report of RCDIW was received and s0far Ministers have felt that the general pay climate precludes evenpartial implementation of the recommendations for NIBMs.7.   The issue has been considered on a number of occasions (inclu^CC(74)50th Meeting, EC(75)10th Meeting, EY(76)14th and16th Meetings).    In March 1977 (EY(77)7th Meeting of 21 March) itwas the general view that NIBMs should have a Stage I paymentsimilar to that granted to other groups covered by TSRB 6 recomn1611^tions, except that no single increase should exceed  5,000.8.   A target date for payment of 1 August 1977 was adopted, subjectto its acceptability in relation to developments in determination of the general policy meanwhile and to TUC views.     In the event a firm decision to make payments on that date was not taken.9.   Representations about the situation have come fromnany in oT&amp;equarters including sponsor Ministers, the Chairman of the review body and past members of public boards.       The issue has also bee0raised in Parliament.       In response, concern has been expressed about the present situation and it has been said that the Govern10611hopes to do something as soon as possible.10.     Sir Peter Menzies, when Chairman of the Nationalised Indus1&apos; JChairmen^ Group, submitted a lengthy memorandum to the Prime        ^at his invitation, in January 1977 to which no effectivesubstantiresponse has been possible.     His successor, Sir Denis Rooke isequally pressing in his views.11.     The Chancellor has since told Board Chairmen that it woul^not be possible to start the current round with a big increase,though he hoped that something could be done before the end of ^epay year.     He also drew their attention to the phased correcti011of anomalies which the general policy envisages.12. The TSRB 6 recommendations have not yet been accepted PuTheir prior acceptance in whole or in part is a pre-requisite 0
improvement on the present position.       The NIBMs would no doubtexpect at least the same staged treatment as was applied to theother groups.

It doesnot inolude the inorease of  208.80 paid to NIBMs from 1/1/77 under theaeoond phase of inoomes policy since this inorease will not be subsumedwhen TSRB report number 6 is implemented.
CONFIDENTIALfoain ways of partially implementing the recommendations in TSRB 65 as follows :-&apos;*       to accept the recommendations in full, and to treat NIBMse*actly like the other groups.    That would mean promulgating thefull recommended increases from 1 January 1975 but making theactual payments in stages, the first stage to be deferred to a^ate to be selected, with the second stage payable from the same&quot;late as other TSRB groups.    This would relieve the pensionProblem and it would minimise the problems arising from the nextTSRB review;to accept the recommendations and to implement them in fullf^om a current future date on a staged basis, the first stage to^e Payable from that date and the second stage when it is granted^0 other TSRB groups.    This would probably be acceptable to mostServing NIBMs and it would alleviate the problems over recruitment and retention.    It would not relieve the pension problem, and itCould leave some problems for the next review;3*       to accept the recommendations and to stage the increasesas in 2. above, but with the first stage effective from a currentfuture date and no commitment as to when the second stage is paid,^om the time that it was implemented this would represent a move^0 alleviate current problems and would still result in sizeablecurrent increases, but it would leave NIBMs with a feeling of dis-C:rimination against them as compared with other groups.    It wouldttot relieve the pensions issue, and it would leave more difficult problems for the next review.    This is the course most Ministersfavoured in March, though a majority preferred also;to impose a limit of  5,000 on any individual increase.s would have the effect of limiting some of the more spectacular
increases (eg in the Post Office) but generally would have thesame effect as in 3* above.5.        a further possible refinement on any of the above optionswould be to limit the initial payment to within an increase of10$.    This could be achieved by any of the methods described in annex B.    The essential difference would be that it would haveto be presented as an interim measure which would not precludea further increase in Round 3 from TSRM 10.    It would not lessen the incomes policy difficulties in the options, nor would itmake them more acceptable to NIBMs.    But it would give theappearance of doing something positive at an early date which did not of itself go further than the current guidelines.
ANNEX   C^ONALISED INDUSTRIES BOARD MEMBERS:    POSSIBLE TREATMENT UNDERiHE Wo POLICY^6 fl0Howing options illustrate three possible methods of applying6 ^0$ policy to Board members.    These are:- 22^A:       a 10$ increase all round.    This would actually give some NIBMs a better deal than they would have gotwith TSRB 6giving each NIBM an increase, from the 10$ kitty forthe whole group proportional to the original TSRB 6increases.    As these would represent an increase ofabout 30$ on existing salary levels (a very approximate10calculation),  this means that each would receive -jq or about 33$ of the TSRB 6 increases.bringing the absolute levels of salary as close aspossible to TSRB 6 within the constraint of a 10$kitty.    This would enable 85$ of the original TSRB 6salaries to be paid;    a few would act\ially receiveless than they do at present through this arrangement,notably the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the BritishWaterways Board (who are due for a salary decreaseunder TSRB 6)Ith  ^Special consideration would need to be given to the members ofV.0se tsboards who were recommended for a net salary cut in the Boyle
