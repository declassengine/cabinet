DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 96 COPY NO    8J.20 October 1977CABINETPAY policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Our pay policy has reached a critical stage at which we need to takestock and consider what lines of action we should follow over the next fewweeks.PROGRESS SO FAR2. From the starting point in July of widespread scepticism about our policy, general expectations of 20 per cent or more as the outcome, andthreatened or actual claims of inordinate increases, we have madesufficient progress to avoid the risk of an immediate and dramatic wageexplosion.    This is on the credit side, and it is backed by:increasing public acceptance that the Government is pursuing its policy with determination (threat of using discretionary powers andtheir actual use in the Mackie case, and resistance to the Air traffic control Assistants1 claim in the face of industrial action, are twoparticular features which have had considerable impact);as far as actual settlements are concerned, approximately nine out often are believed to have been broadly &quot;within the guidelines&quot;,although that phrase is interpreted as referring to the 10 per centearnings target published in Cmnd 6882 and not to the desirability of reaching settlements well into single figures;there have been no significant settlements so far which have clearlybreached the guidelines.3. But there is a debit side also:no really important settlements have yet been made at all, and thetotal of settlements so far is much smaller than at the same time in previous pay rounds;1
ten per cent has come to be regarded as a minimum level, withoutpaying too much attention to elements of drift which are notobviously identifiable;some trade unionists seem to be working to establish 15 per cent asa &quot;socially responsible&quot; alternative to the Government 10 per cent;no lesway has been created for settlement of any anomalies or special cases where there might be some justification for settle-ments considerably above any average.PROSPECTS4. The tone of the present round is already beginning to be set.    Thebest interpretation one can put on it is that a substantial number of settle-ments might be achieved at 10 per cent or very little above, not allowingfully for drift, with some settlements a few percentage points above that level and almost none below.     This would indicate at best an outcome forthe national average over the year as a whole in the 12-14 per cent range.5. Even this, however, would depend on containing actual settlements or their repercussions, in a variety of important cases and types of casescoming up over the next few weeks.    The main ones are probably thefollowing:i. Ford:  it is not yet clear whether the offer of just under 12 percent will stick, or what effect industrial action or the threat of itwill have.    What is clear is that there will be a widespreadtendency to interpret a settlement on the basis of the present offer asbeing 12 per cent plus, and that many other important negotiationswill take that as the standard.ii. Local Authority Manuals:  the employers are reckoning tosettle &quot;between 9. 99 per cent and 10 per cent&quot; on earnings.    Theyare conscious that this will make it difficult to settle within the samelimit for the Fire Service, and they would like to settle higher for thepolice.    It would in their view be difficult to justify for any other local authority group less than the manuals get.iii. Police:  the Police Federation is intensifying its campaign foran excessive pay increase for the police.    The Conservative party has made such an increase part of its policy.    In the course of discussions about a Round Two settlement the Trades Union Congress(TUC) was sounded unofficially about giving the police special treat-ment and advised strongly against, indicating that anything concededto the police would be demanded by others.    This is bound to be truetoo in the present situation, where any offer in excess of the 10 per2
cent guideline will be taken as a green light not only by other public sector groups such as the firemen but aluo by heavyweightindustrial unions who are already seeking to break the guideline.iv. Miners:  the proposed productivity scheme is due to go to balloton 26/27 October after a very small majority on the national executive.    The result is expected on 1 November (subject to any delay due to legal action now under consideration by the defeatedmembers of the Executive).    It remains to be seen whether It will be approved;  and even if it is, whether it will take the steam out of the pay claim for  135 a week as we have been promised.v. Vauxhall.  it is reported that they are proposing a reopenerclause triggered by any increase in prices exceeding 8 per cent - a figure which comes dangerously near to guaranteeing a reopening.vi. Road Haulage:  there is no sign of a reduction in the level ofthe proposed settlement which seems to involve at least 15 per centearnings increase.vii. Heating and Ventilation:  in the construction industry, in spiteof its poor level of activity, the proposed 20 per cent settlement could set a totally unacceptable standard.viii. Productivity Deals:  as was always to be feared, there are indications that such deals are being devised wherever there is anycolourable excuse for them without questioning if they are self-financing.ix. Special Cases:  the current mood of negotiation gives no hopethat special cases and anomalies can be dealt with by increases aboveother settlements without creating resentment.x. Low Pay:  in wages councils and elsewhere it is argued that special help should be given to the low-paid, which implies anotheraddition to the average, even if repercussions can be avoided.    (Anote at Annex A gives the case for and against setting a floor on wage increases for the very low paid. )6. If any significant number of these problems is left to develop on thelines currently indicated, the pattern of settlements is all too likely to creepgradually higher, and we shall end the year with national earnings increasingby something approaching, or even exceeding, 15 per cent.OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE INFLATION7. Developments over the next few weeks are likely to determine theposition we shall reach early next summer.    The alternatives can bestarkly illustrated.   Assuming no major change in other factors which
influence inflation, we can be confident that the year-on-year rate of inflation measured by the Retail Price Index will fall below 10 per centaround the late spring of 1978, almost irrespective of the immediateprospects on the pay front.    But we then have two possibilities: -a, If we are succeeding in running a relatively tight overall paypolicy, with prospects for the national earnings average rising overthe yar by not much more than 10 per cent, the climate cfexpectation - and the reality - will be that the rate of price inflationis likely to continue downwards.    This will obviously provide us withthe best possible basis on which to carry forward the attack oninflation subsequently and to encourage higher growth in the economy.b. If, however, the earnings increase is towards 15 per cent (andof course particularly if, as would be only too likely in thecircumstances postulated, financial confidence weakened, our international competitiveness was being undermined, and the exchange rate was going down) we could expect a renewed increase in the rateof inflation.RENEWING THE ATTACK ON INFLATION8. We need to consider what we can do ourselves as Government, andwhether we can now resume discussions with the TUC and probably also with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) for help in securing our objective.9, As regards our own action, we must show continued determinationon each and every case which comes before us, with particular regard tothose which threaten repercussions.    We need to make sure that our inter-nal procedures secure that significant public sector cases continue to be cleared interdepartmentally and if necessary considered by Ministersbefore offers are made.    More generally, as I have suggested to the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy, we should try to tighten the current application of policy, buildingon the degree of relative moderation achieved so far and the falling rate of price inflation.    For example, we should:i. re-emphasise the difference between settlements and earnings and reiterate publicly and frequently the need for individual pay settlements to be well within single figures;ii. in assessing individual settlements, take a more critical viewof the possibilities;ties of wage drift and seek maximum allowance for it;iii. where there is the chance of securing a below-average settle-ment, in both private and public sectors, this should be encouraged.4
10.        I would now add three further points for consideration:i. we should continue to use discretionary power to withholdfinancial benefits, and even possibly some other benefits, in casesarising during the next few weeks;  in suggesting this, I am fullyconscious of the difficulties of long-term use of a policy of this kind,and the need for extreme care in handling individual cases (a note at annex B summarises the conclusions on this of the Sub-Committee on pay Negotiations);ii. we should avoid making any concessions or accepting anyspecial cases during the next few critical weeks;iii. we should take particular care to demonstrate firmness inrelation to all public sector settlements - there are comparativelyfew in the coming weeks but our action on them will be taken asexemplary.11.        I think it is also for consideration whether the time has come to renew discussions with the TUC,    If we do so, we should certainly also talk with the CBI, although I regard that in present circumstances as being bothless difficult and less important.12.        There can be no doubt that we have a basis for a new approach to theTTJC.      &quot;We can put the following points to them:a. The declining rate of inflation has been clearly established:all commentators agree that we are on the road to single-figureinflation.b. We have decided and are about to announce a package of measures, to be implemented immediately, which will have considerable appeal to the TUC.    We are able to show that restraint in wage demands is not only compatible with, but positively helps, animprovement in the standard of living - if wage settlements creep up and bring rising inflation in the second half of 1978, then we will have little chance of bringing unemployment down and of winning the nextElection.CONCLUSION13.        I invite my colleagues:i.       To endorse the need for further effort to improve theprospects of success in the current pay round.5
ii. To consider the possible lines of action indicated in this paper and suggest others which may occur to them.D W treasury Chambers20 October 19776
THE APPLICATION OF PAY POLICY TO LOW PAID GROUPS&apos;  The Incidence of Low pay ---      -    - -Some 1.8 million full time adult employees are currently earning lessthan.  40 per week, about 1.5 million of them women.   It is not certainhow many of the 300,000 men are heads of households;    estimates suggestthat the number of such workers with families of two children may be up toabout 50,000;    among the women, also, some will be the main breadwinnerin a family group.    It is also-estimated that there are some 100,000families where the head is in employment and which are eligible for meanstested FIS.    The Supplementary Commission have recently pointed out, intheir evidence on low incomes to the Royal Commission on the Distributionof Income and Wealth, that low levels of&apos;pay are now constraining the scales of benefits which they would otherwise think appropriate lor thosewho are not in work.Spj^ial Provision for the Low Paid2.    Pay policies have generally made special provision for the low paid.   It can be argued that some progress has been made thereby, in^hat the lowest decile of the earnings distribution, now about  50.perWeek, is some 68 per cent of the median, when in 1970 it was only 65 percent.   But such progress is at best slow and the need to make furtherlmProvements points to a case for making special provision in the currentPty round as much as in 1975 and 1976.     It is true that the TUC did notPass a HUPE motion for a  50 minimum wage, but this was against a back-tvfound of a return to free collective bargaining in which negotiatorsCould press^ a special case for the low paid.J*    In the context of the present pay guidelines, the case for special provision rests mainly on the difficulty of defending a restriction to- per cent of the earnings of those who are paid  40 or less for a formal week.     This is particularly true for Wages Council rates, the^Oority of which ere around  30, and some well below.   Some independentSobers of important councils are known to feel strongly about this andmove towards recommendations and statutory orders which Government
This could lead to a seriouswould have no powers to alter.      inxfaconfrontation over pay policy..      .      n,w        to allow freedom for collective bargaining below a/w waw . or. x. no -npT cent limit to a xxmxo^ a modification of the present 10 per10 per cent whichever is the higher..5.These proposals are however open to doubt in two important respects.oui there is evidence that special increases at the lower end ofUe Pay range do not affect more than a small proportion of those who^ee(l help because of family poverty;    there is also evidence, contrary^  that adduced above, that special provision for minimum pay increases0es not in fact improve the earnings distribution in favour of the lowerPaid.6.    nUji the first point, it has bcr-n established that only a very small^Portion of the low paid belong to poor households.    The figures inuB3?aph 1 above show the relatively small number of families in realu who would be affected by special provisions covering nearly 2 millioners.   Moreover, the evidence also suggests that even such benefits1ght accrue in the short run are not in fact maintained.    While thexstics in paragraph 2 above suggest   some slight improvement for the^    * decile in the earning range, similar statistics for the lowest one.    Cent of the earnings distribution show that there has been novement at all over the years.    The lowest percentile of the earnings^distribution now bears the same relation to the median as it did in 1970,p     UJ-S suggests that such attempts as there have been to help the lowhave worked right through the earnings distribution, raising the^ ev l of earnings but meanwhile leaving an impression of an, eDl&apos;Pt by Government to compress differentials.    It was one of the aims^   *e guidelines put forward in   Cmnd 6882 to provide for earnings^.   ases in percentage terms, without any suggestion of compression atJtw.61 eru^ Q  the scale and special provision now intended to provide a^ pay increase for the low paid would run counter to this principle.confidential
Itwss therefore agreed that :(i)     while the Government could not rely on discretionaryPowers as the sole or main instrument to enforce the pay policyxt could not afford to abandon their use at this stage;-1-ANNEX      BUSE OF DISCRETIONARY FOWERS IN SUPPORT,PJMmg^Y^OLICYAt&apos;its discussion on Friday 14 October (EY(P)(77) 16th Meeting,item 1) the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations had before themSports by the Official Committee on Prices and Incomes (attachedto EY(p)(77)62) and by the Attorney General (EY(P)(77)65).*he Sub-Committee noted the political and legal difficulties anddangers inherent in the present unsatisfactory position, resultingfrom the use of measures which were not purpose-built to support the pay policy and from the lack of a precisely defined*Pay limit.   There was general agreement that the Government could*ot rely on the use of discretionary powers as the solo or maininstrument of pay policy.        and that     -they were not an^fective substitute for the support of the TUC and CBI.^ey were weaker than the sanctions available in Rounds 1 and 2and the price sanction was almost non-operative.   While it was true^at in some instances as in the Mackies case the Government coulda*gue that the pay policy was entirely consistent with theoriginal purposes of the instrument being used, no general systemQf legal sanctions could operate in the absence of a rigidPay formula and in these conditions the only available coursevas to handle each case carefully on its merits.
ii)     departments should he given&quot;fresh guidance on thepolicy to he adopted in threatening and using discretionarypowers over the coming months.    In particular they should avoid making threats which could not he substantiated; seek:&apos;   legal advice in all cases of doubt; and take great care in how they were applied making sure they had legal clearance.The Sub-Committee noted that the problems raised by the use ofdiscretionary powers and possible options open in the longer-term would be covered in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s-submission-sion to Cabinet on the future of pay policy.
