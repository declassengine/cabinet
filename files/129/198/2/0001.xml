DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 92 copy NO      81U October 1977CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  ACTION TO ASSIST THECONSTRUCTION industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentBACKGROUNDI. At our meeting on 14 July (CM(77) 25th Conclusions) we discussed the question of help for the construction industry.    We noted that theChancellor of the Exchequer would be announcing additional public expenditure of  100 million for this purpose in 1977-78 and agreed that therewas a strong case for further assistance in 1978-79.    Accordingly m his statement to Parliament on 15 July the Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthe Government were considering, in the course of the normal annual reviewof public expenditure, what further help could be given to the construction industry in the next financial year (Hansard cols 992-3).2- In CP(77) 71 I set out the problem facing the industry and stressed the overwhelming case for help.    Later information has confirmed how deep wasthe recession affecting the industry in the first half of the year.    Output was6 per cent lower than in the second half of 1976.     Employment has fallen lessthan might be expected, with the implication that many men are being kept onin the hope of an early recovery in demand.3- I expect such a recovery in the private sector, following the great improvement in financial markets.    But this will be barely sufficient to off-set the further decline in public sector work that is allowed for in present plans.    If those remain as they are, the industry&apos;s total output is likely todiffer little next year from this year.    This carries with it the prospect of75, 000 more unemployed by the end of 1978 and the possibility of severe damage to the capacity and efficiency of the industry.    Output per man hasalready fallen by 9 per cent since 1973.    Urgent action to bring about anearly recovery in demand is essential.    But we need to do that in the way thatwill best contribute to establishing a more stable pattern of demand in thefuture.    That requires action now in relation to programmes for this yearand the two following.
PROPOSALS FOR ACTION4. The present slump is partly due to greater-than-intended falls in expenditure this year:  experience suggests that cash limits tend to depressspending to a level some way below that of agreed programmes,particularly in the construction field, where there are difficulties in makingadjustments during the course of a year.    I would therefore urge mycolleagues - as I have been doing in relation to my own Departmentsprogrammes - to do their utmost to ensure that any shortfall on theirconstruction programmes is minimal, even to the extent of running some extra risk that cash limits on particular blocks may be exceeded, in exceptional circumstances.5. Departmental programmes now provide for expenditure on construc-tion of  4, 769 million in 1978-79 compared with  5,100 million in 1977-78.Merely to keep public sector construction demand in 1978-79 to this year&apos;slevel would therefore require an extra  330 million;  to return it to thelevel of last year would require  920 million.    A survey of the capacity of departments to mount additional construction programmes shows that theycould usefully spend about  780 million in 1978-79 in addition to the agreed programme as set out in Cmnd 6721, of which  174 million is included in theadditional proposals for expenditure detailed in Annex 2 of the 1977 public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) Report.    The attachment to thismemorandum sets out the detail.    There would be additional associatedexpenditure in 1978-79 of  15 million, and indirectly, expenditure on housingland and on loans for house purchase could amount to a further  45 million.The projects begun under any extra expenditure made available in 1978-79would entail further expea.dit.ure in the later years of the PESC period ofroughly the same order.6. In CP(77) 71 I proposed that public sector construction programmes should be increased by  400 million in 1978-79 and that the increase shouldbe maintained in subsequent years.    I was conscious that this would do littlemore than keep the 1978-79 programmes at their current level.    But theimprovement in the economic situation now provides us with greater scopeto make a positive contribution to helping the industry out of recession.My colleagues will be aware that the unions have been pressing for an extra 1,100 million.    At the same time we must be realistic about what we can expect to achieve in the next 18 months.    On balance I believe that apackage of not less than  600 million is needed in 1978-79 to demonstrate that we are taking the industry^ problems seriously.    (This would includethe additional proposals for construction expenditure in Annex 2 of the 1977PESC Report. )   It would add Z\ per cent to construction output and, allowing for a possible rise in private demand, would make the total demand in 1978about the same as in 1976.   It would be worth 50, 000 jobs, though the directfall in unemployment would be less than this.    It would be desirable to add asum of the same order to the programmes from 1979-80 to get back to an acceptable level and to continue with further additions in subsequent years:even to stabilise on the level I propose for next year would require theaddition of a minimum of  380 million in 1979-80.
7. The effect of such a package on the public sector borrowing requirement would be reduced by the net increase in Exchequer receipts from tax and national insurance payments and the abatement of unemploymentbenefit.    The net effect on the borrowing requirement of a package of 600 million would be  400 million in 1978-79.8. Detailed consideration will need to be given to the way in whichadditional expenditure on construction should be allocated.    We must try tosee that help is concentrated on the sectors in greatest need, and the need to alleviate unemployment must be the first priority.    Housing, whichcontributes about hal of public sector demand, should have a large share;and a significant element should be devoted to civil engineering which hasbeen particularly affected by cuts in public expenditure.    There are also theclaims of energy conservation to be considered and proposals now before theSecretary of State for Energy to allot about  50 million a year for thermalinsulation and heating controls in public sector buildings willmake a usefulcontribution.    Much of the work would be done by local authorities and weshall need to consult them carefully about this in relation to their overallexpenditure plans.    I hope that they will accept the package as going someway to redress the balance which past cuts have produced against capitalexpenditure.conclusions . Despite the help that we have already provided, the crisis in theconstruction industry will continue next year - unless we take vigorous and positive measures now.    Even my present proposals will not be enough toprevent a further rise in unemployment.    We have already undertaken toconsider what further help can be given and we have the capacity withinDepartmental programmes to make a contribution which will demonstrateour concern, and go some way to meeting criticism of our readiness to cutcapital spending.    But th- action we take must be seen to match the scale ofthe problem.    Moreover, because construction programmes take time tomount it would be wrong to settle for some lower figure now and wait until next year to see if it were enough.RECOMMENDATIONS10.I invite my colleaguefl:-a. To take vigorous action to ensure that 1977-78 programmes are fulfilled.b. To agreo that public sector construction programmes should beincreased by  600 million in 1978-79 and that the level thus     ^established should at least be maintained in the later years oPESC period.
