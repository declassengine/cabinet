Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government81CF(T7)110 copy no 6 December 1977cabinetTHE NEW PENSIONS scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services andthe Minister for Social Security1. It seems to us, after consultation with the Prime Minister, that itmay be helpful to Cabinet to have a note of the main features of the newpensions scheme which is to come into force next year.    The planning of thescheme was undertaken immediately after we took office in March 1974, andit was first put forward in the White Paper &quot;Better Pensions&quot; inSeptember of that year.    Legislation followed in the Social SecurityPensions Act 1975.    That Act received all-Party support in its passage through Parliament and brought to an end a 20-year wrangle over the futureof pensions.2. Contributors to the new scheme will qualify for a basic pension onthe lines of the present flat rate and also for earnings-related &quot;additionalpension&quot;.    This additional pension will build up to its full level in returnfor 20 years&apos; contributions after 1978:  a married man on average earningswill then have a total pension entitlement - basic and additional together - ofconsiderably more than half pay.    The scheme will cover invalidity andwidowhood as well as retirement; it will entitle a woman to the samepersonal pension as a man with the same earnings, and it will make special provision for those, men and women alike, who have to give up work becauseof responsibility at home.    It will be fully protected against inflation.    Andit will eventually give especial help to people with fluctuating earnings (thatis, in practice, to manual workers in particular) by basing their pensionson their best 20 years of earnings after 1978.3. The development of a state pension related to earnings will, ratherbelatedly, bring Britain into line with the European Economic Community (e.c.)generally and with other advanced industrialised countries:  by the end of thecentury our pensions will bear comparison with those payable anywhere inthe world.    However the scheme we are adopting is unique in that it makes provision for contracting out, and therefore does not divert resources intomaking duplicate provision for people who are already covered b/ goodoccupational schemes.    The partnership which has been forged between stateand private pensions is perhaps the main reason why informed opiniongenerally welcomes and supports the new scheme.1
4. The Annex to this paper i. explains the new pension arrangements in greater detail;ii. draws attention to certain issues on which there may be some public debate in the coming months - in particular the positionof existing pensioners;  and. sets out the steps which are being taken to publicise the new scheme before it takes effect in April.    In addition to Departmentalpublicity, 17 Labour Party regional conferences have been arranged between February and April to discuss the new scheme.    We shallundertake the bulk of these Party engagements between us;Barbara Castle and Eric Deakins will also be involved.    TheTrades Union Congress (TUC) who will have a large delegation atthe launching conference in January, will actively encourageconstituent unions to send members to the Labour Party Conferences.We regard this educational programme, both in the Party and thecountry, as being of extreme importance and of offering scope forreal political gain.    The publicity will emphasise that the schemerepresents the first major pension reform undertaken in this countrysince Beveridge, and is accordingly something of which theGovernment can be proud.    Any willingness on colleagues&apos; part to devote time in public speeches to giving the widest possiblepublicity to the new pensions scheme will be greatly welcome.D ES ODepartment of Health and Social Security6 December 19772
ANNEX:    THE NEW SCHEME IN DETAIL1.     In April 1978 people in employment will begin to contribute towards the Government&apos;s new earnings-related scheme, and will startto build up title to a pension in two parts, known as the basicand the additional pension.BASIC PENSION2.     The basic pension will be virtually the same as the presentflat-rate national insurance pension.   The April 1978 level( 17.50 a week for a single person and  28 for a married couple)will be that of the present standard rate of pension and, as aminimum, it will be up-rated each year in line with the movementof earnings or of prices, whichever has risen the faster.   Itwill be open to Government, as it is now, to raise the pension faster than the indices warrant or more frequently than annually, ifthis can be afforded.3.   There will however be two important changes in the rules of entitlement, both of particular interest to women.   First, the&quot;half-test&quot;, which is a special condition which a married womanhas to satisfy before she can qualify for a pension on her owncontributions, will be abolished.   Secondly a person whose absence from the employment field has been due to &quot;home responsiblity&quot;(broadly, responsbility for a child under the age of 16 or the need to care for a recipient of attendance allowance) will in future beable to qualify for a full pension from contributions in fewer yearsthan are required at present, although a minimum of 20 years&apos;contributions will still be needed.ADDITIONAL PENSIONh.   The new scheme&apos;s major innovation is its introduction of the earnings-related additional pension.   This has the followingfeatures:-(i)       It will be earned by the payment of contributions as anemployed person on earnings between the level of the basic pension and an upper limit (about 7 times the basic pension) beyond which no further contributionsare payable.    In 1978/79 this will mean earnings between 17.50 and  120 per   week.1
(ii) The pension will represent l/80th   of such earningsfor each year of contributions under the new scheme.Thus a person who contributes for oust one year before his retirement and who earns  75 a week will earnan additional pension of 72p per week (ie 1/80th of 75 minus    17.50) by his year*s contributions andthis will be payable in addition to his basic pension.The amount which will be earned by someone who contributesat the maximum level of earnings ( 120 a week or more)during 1978/79 will be  1.28.   Women will earn the samepensions as men with the same earnings.(iii) After 20 years of contributions additional pension will amount to i (20/80ths) of earnings above the basic levelin those years.   Thus, in todayfs money, the employeewho has contributed steadily on earnings of  75 a weekwill qualify for additional pension of  14.38 &quot;a week,giving him a total pension entitlement of  31.88 if singleor  42.38 if married.   (These amounts represent about42^6 - single - or 56 % - married - of his earnings.)The person who contributed on maximum earnings for 20 yeafswould qualify for additional pension of  25.60 a week on top of his basic pension.(iv) After the new scheme has operated for 20 years theformula for pension will remain at i of earnings butthe earnings taken into account will be those in thecontributor^ best 20 years. This aspect of the new scheme will particularly favour manual workers v/hosepeak earnings do not come immediately before retirementbut early in life.(v) Before pension is calculated, earnings will be revalued.Earnings in each year of working life will be raised in line with the increase which has taken place in earnings generally since that time.    Thus additionalpensions will be based on earnings but will also refleC ^the rise which has occurred in the general standard of
(vi) Once it is in payment additional pension will beincreased each year at least in line with prices.  From nextyear onwards price-protection will also be extended to the graduated pensions which many contributors earnedbetween 1961 and 1975.)(vii) The two-tier formula of basic plus additional pension will apply not only in retirement but also to the benefitspayable in the event of invalidity and widowhood.    Inthe case of a widow of working age it will be her latehusband*s earnings, not her own, which are taken intoaccount.(viii) A widow who has retired may be entitled to additionalpension on the basis of her own contributions as wellas her husband&apos;s. If so, she may draw both pensions,subject to the proviso that she would not receive morethan would be payable to a single person who had contributed to the scheme on maximum earnings since its inception.   Aman whose wife dies when both he and she are over pension age will also be entitled to draw the additionalpension for which they have both contributed, subject tothe same maximum.CONTRACTING OUTThere will be provision for  . contracting out of a part of thestate arrangements, but to do so an occupational scheme will haveto provide its members with pensions at least at the level of the^ew additional pension.    In such a case the scheme members will payable reduced contribution and will qualify only for the state basicPension.   After they have retired, however, the state will undertake^ke inflation-proofing of that part of their occupational pension which is being paid as a   substitute for the state additionalPension.THE SELF-EMPLOYED j^here is no provision^s yet, for the inclusion of the self-etoployed in the new scheme.   However, from 1978/79 onwardsrOWFSniPMTIAI
(   the amount they pay will be determined in the same way as thecontributions of employees who are contracted out of the additionalpension, and their contribution liability will therefore be reduced,broadly from 8% to 5% of their earnings, as from April.POTENTIAL PROBLEMS(i)   The demand for &quot;crediting-in&quot; existing pensioners7.   The 1974 White Paper &quot;Better Pensions&quot; acknowledged that a newearnings-related scheme would not normally operate retrospectivelyto cover those who had not contributed to it, but said that &quot;Withthe introduction of the new scheme, the position of existing pension&apos;ers will be &apos; further reviewed in the light of the development of the economy.&quot;   Since then the possibility has been explored of a systemwhereby existing pensioners would be credited-in to the new scheme by becoming entitled to an additional pension at a minimum level;the same minimum would be available to people   retiring after 1978whose contributions had earned them only a small additional pension ornone.   However, even a very modest scheme on these lines offering asupplement of  1 a week to the basic pension would incur very sub-stantial extra expenditure - more than  300 million in the first year for   which   no provision has been made.8.   In view of the cost, we cannot at this stage recommend crediting&quot;in as an option to be pursued.   But there could well be a strongcampaign - from the &quot;poverty lobby&quot;, representatives of pensioners and from our own supported - in favour of crediting-in or, atleast, urging us that some special measures should be undertaken to help existing pensioners in order to compensate them for theirexclusion from the new scheme.   The strength of such a campaign,and whether it will make some concession essential if damage isto be avoided to the whole concept of the new scheme, are matters which we cannot gauge before the publicity build-up for the schemebegins early in the new year.   However, decisions about possibleextra expenditure on existing pensioners, whether associated withthe November 1978 up-rating; or operating from April 1979 (whenthe first additional pensions become payable to new-scheme
contributors) need not be taken before the spring.   For thetime being, therefore, we suggest that questions about existingPensioners should be answered in part by reference to theGovernment&apos;s excellent record on pensions since 1974,and our success in protecting social security beneficiaries from the effects ofeconomic crisis and pubLic expenditure cuts, and partly by areiteration of our 1974 pledge that, when the new scheme is introduced, their position will be further reviewed.(ii)     Contribution Changes9.    From April   1978 employees who are contracted-out, the self-employed and the few voluntary contributors will all pay less thanthey do now for the same pension.    For employees fully within thestate scheme, however, there will be a contribution increase;    formen with families this will come at a time when a reduction inchild tax allowances, linked to the phasing in of the child benefitscheme, may also mean a reduction in take-home pay.    The national insurance increases can however be justified as a very reasonablePremium for the benefits they will   earn.    The new contribution levelwill be 6 % of earnings and this will involve employees in payingmore than at present.  But the additional pension accruing eachyear in return - l $of earnings above the lower limit of (in currentterms)  17.50 a week - will be much larger than the contributionincrease,*Q* There may be some additional criticism on behalf of those people who will reach pension age before April 1979, since they will earnno additional pension from their months of contributions to thenew scheme.    It is however inherent in the task of keeping thefrew arrangements reasonably comprehensible that benefits under them^ust accrue in whole tax years, so that the contributions paidxn the part-year before retirement earn no specific addition to pension rights.    This is already the position under the flat-ratena-tional insurance   scheme.5
(iii) Arrangements for contracting-out11. In spite of v/idespread publicity aimed at employers, it seems likely that delays on their part in applying to the occupational pensions Board for -contracting-out certificates may well lead to arush of such applications immediately before 6 April, and therefore to some administrative inconvenience and delays.    The occupational pensions Board are fully aware of this possibility, and Regulationshave been made to enable them to streamline their procedures inissuing contracting-out certificates on an interim basis.    FurtherRegulations will be made before Christmas allowing employers and employees to pay the lower (contracted-out) rate contributions for a few weeks from 6 April pending receipt of their contracting-out certificates.(iv) Complexity of the New Scheme12. The benefit formula of the new scheme is simpler than thatof the Crossman scheme and no more complex than those of earnings-related schemes abroad.    Nevertheless it is not easy to explainin the way that a flat-rate pension increase would be.   Any schemewhich aims to reconcile the differing social aims of relatingpensions to earnings, enabling past earnings to retain their value,benefiting low earners proportionately more than the higher-paid,and protecting pensions in payment against inflation is boundto be complicated, quite apart from the constraints imposed by a system of contracting-out and the need for the rules for thenew additional pension to be consistent with those which alreadygovern flat-rate entitlement.13. Once the new scheme has begun, therefore, it may often bedifficult for the individual pensioner to see how his particularbenefit is calculated in terms of basic pension, additional pensiorland graduated pension, especially if he has been contracted-out and if such features as an increase in his pension because ofdeferred retirement come into the reckoning.   Moreover, since thef f ipension will reflect his individual record of earnings, a local owill not normally be able to answer his detailed questions aboutwithout obtaining information which is held centrally on computer-
rTo date there has been some criticism of the quality of thegeneral advice being given about the new scheme by our local offices:   but the training of local staff has been under way for sometime and is being intensified.   They should therefore be able todeal adequately with public enquiries by the time that these arise in any numbers.PUBLICITY FOR THE NEW SCHEME14. The Governments immediate task is to give sufficient publicity to the new   scheme to make it clear to those who will pay highercontributions from next April that these are the passport to a verysignificant increase in benefit rights.   Previous pension schemes,from the graduated arrangements onwards, have not excited any markeddegree of public interest but we are determined that the latestreform should be recognised for the advance that it is.   As a first step, the Department of Health and Social Security is organisinga one-day conference to launch the scheme on 25 January 1978;   alarge audience of interested parties including MPs, TUC, CBI andmany other pensions interests will be invited.15. The   January conference will be the occasion at which we shallbring out a series of leaflets on new pensions, including a popularone-page summary of the scheme as well as detailed material about it.   The conference will be followed in February and March by an extensive Governmental advertising campaign aimed at bringing the salient features of the new scheme to the attention of the general public.   Speaking briefs and other material on the scheme will alsoJ^ejnade available to Government spokesmen and to MPs of all parties.16.   As already explained in the paper, we will also be undertaking17 Labour Party regional conferences.7
