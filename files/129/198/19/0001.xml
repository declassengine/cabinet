document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 109 copy no   815 December 1977cabinetMILK prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsINTRODUCTION1. As Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on European QuestionsI seek decisions by the Cabinet on the level of our domestic producer price for milk and certain related issues, on which the Committee has been unableto reach agreement.PRODUCER PRICE2. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has proposed aproducer price from 1 January to 31 March of 49. 2p per gallon comparedwith an average of 46. 5p for the period April-December 1977 and an actualprice of 47. 75p from September to December 1977.    He considers that suchan increase is needed for the January-March quarter when costs are attheir seasonal peak and production is low, and that this is the minimum price needed to stabilise the size of the national herd which is decliningcontrary to the Government1 s declared policy of expansion.    other ministers saw no justification for a producer price of more than 47. 4p whichthey thought would allow for adequate returns to producers while minimisingthe increase that would be needed in the retail price (paragraph 4 below).The Committee were however prepared to agree to a compromise price of48p if the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food could accept it.3. Given the Committee&apos;s decision on the retail price (paragraph 4 below)an increase in the producer price from 1 January involves an increase in thesubsidy payable to meet the Government&apos;s outstanding liability of 23 million to distributors.    A producer price of 48p involves a subsidyincrease of  13. 75 million.    A producer price of 49. 2p involves a subsidyincrease of  23 million .   The Committee saw no objection in principle to making whatever increase in the subsidy within those limits was needed to finance whatever producer price might be agreed.1
RETAIL PRICE4. The Committee agreed to increase the retail price from 11 jp to12^p per pint from 1 January in order to meet rising production anddistribution costs provided that it could be announced as applicable (barringexceptional and unforeseen developments) until the end of 1978.    It could thus be presented as an increase of less than 10 per cent and as being inaccordance with counter-inflation policy.    The Committee recognised thata price of 12-lp might be overtaken by rising costs in the autumn, butconsidered that any shortfall should be recouped from a further retail price increase in 1979.    Another way of delaying the need for a retail price increase in 1977 would be to increase the subsidy by the fall amount of 23 million referred to in paragraph 3 while keeping the producer pricebelow 49. 2p.    Depending on the level of the producer price between 48pand 49. 2p per gallon there would then be an additional sum of up to about 9 million available to meet rising costs (equivalent to the deferment ofa lp increase in the retail price for one month).5. It now appears that a categorical undertaking to hold the retail price for a year would be inconsistent with the Government&apos;s obligation to reviewit objectively and openly with the distributors in the spring and again in theautumn.    But it should be possible to announce our firm aim and intentionto hold the price for a year barring exceptional and unforeseendevelopments;  and to achieve this aim in practice.conclusions. Cabinet is inviteda. to decide the level of the producer price for milk for january-March 1978 having regard to the proposal of 49.2p putforward by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, thefigure of 47. 4p favoured by some other Ministers, and the compromise of 48p.b. To decide whether the subsidy should be increased to an extent corresponding to the level of the producer price, or to agreater extent, but subject to a limit of  23 million, for the sake of greater flexibility in the handling of the next retail price increase.c. To agree that the announcement of the retail price of 12^pshould be made along the lines suggested in paragraph 5.D A L OForeign and Commonwealth office December 19772
