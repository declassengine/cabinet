DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(77) 103 COPY NO8111 November 1977CABINETDRAFT WHITE PAPER ON &quot;THE CONDUCT OF COMPANYDIRECTORS&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. I attach a draft White Paper on the Conduct of Company Directors.The White Paper contains proposals to make insider dealing a criminal offence, and deals with a number of weaknesses in the law which have beendemonstrated in recent company investigations, particularly in connectionwith loans to directors and other cases where the private interests of directors may conflict with the interests of the company.    Also includedare a number of recommendations from the Bullock report relating to the responsibilities of directors, notably the requirement that they should haveregard to the interests of employees.2. The Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El)have agreed the content of the White Paper, and the Legislation Committee(LE) have authorised the drafting of the clauses necessary to implement the proposals in the White Paper, although it has not been decided whetherthe Companies Bill to be introduced early next year will contain any provisions other than those necessary to implement the european economic Community Second Directive on company law and to increasethe fees of the Registry of Business Names.3. It is widely known, from informal consultations and from anannouncement I made in the House of 28 July, that I have teen preparingproposals on the subjects covered in the White Paper.    If these matters are to be included in the 1978 Companiee Bill, then it is necessary to allowreasonable time for public discussion of the detailed proposals before theBill is pubHshed.    But if in the event it is decided that pressure of theParliamentary timetable prevents the implementation of these proposalsthis Session, it wiU be better to have published firm and detailed proposalsrather than to appear to have abandoned work in these important areas forcompany law reform.1
4. It was agreed at El that early publication of the White Paper would create a very strong expectation of early legislation.    I am prepared tomake it clear when the White Paper is published that there may be no timefor legislation on its proposals this Session.5. If my colleagues agree, I propose to publish the White Paper atthe end of November.E d department of Trade11 November 19772
DRAFT WHITE paper the CONDUCT OP COMPANY DIRECTORS1       The Government announced in a statement by the Secretaryof State for Trade to the House of Commons on 28 July 1977 thatit was preparing legislative proposals to make insider dealingin securities a criminal offence and to remedy weaknesses in thelaw which had been demonstrated by recent company investigations,notably in connection with loans to directors and the private interests of directors.    This White Paper describes the actionwhich the Government intends to take to improve and strengthen the law on these subjects.Duties of directors2       Consideration of all the topics in this paper must begin with the legal responsibilities and duties of company directors.Directors are appointed to act in the interests of the company and an important area of their legal responsibilities derives from trust law - the fiduciary duty to act in the interests ofthe company.   They are also under a duty to exercise care andskill in the discharge of their functions.   These duties arepart of common law and are not defined in statute.   TheGovernment believes that it is desirable to include a general statement of the duties of directors in statute law.3      For the statutory definition of fiduciary duty theGovernment will introduce a provision requiring a director to observe the utmost good faith towards his company in all ofhis actions and to act honestly in the exercise of the powersand in the discharge of the duties of his office.    It willalso be provided that a director shall not make use of any money or property belonging to his company to benefit himself;
nor of any information acquired by him or opportunity afforded to him by virtue of his position as a director of a company,if by doing so he gains an advantage for himself which mayconflict with the interests of the company.4       The standard of skill and care which the law expects of a company director in the performance of his duties derives fromcase law.^^    He is required to perform his duties with reasonablecare, exercising that degree of skill which may reasonably beexpected of a person of his knowledge and experience.&apos;  The lawapnears tothufe/draw   a distinction between the standard of skill and thestandard of care.    For the standard of care, an objective test isset, namely that to be expected of a reasonable man; the standardof skill, on the other hand, is a subjective test under which thelevel required depends upon the knowledge and experience possessed by each director.    The Government has decided that the presentrequirements of the law should be codified in legislation whichwill require a director to exercise that degree of care anddiligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise incomparable circumstances and the degree of skill which may reasonably be expected of a person of his knowledge and experience*5       The Government also believes that employees should be givenlegal recognition by company law.    The statutory definition ofthe duty of directors will require directors to take into account the interests of employees as well as of shareholders.    They willalso be required to send the annual report and accounts to allemployees as well as to shareholders.    This will be anadditional financial and administrative burden to companies,but the Government believes that employees as well as(1)    Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd /J925/&quot; Ch 4072
shareholders are entitled to the information in company reports and accounts and that these should be made available to bothon an equal footing.6      The Bullock Committee also recommended that there shouldbe &quot;one place where a director, and particularly the newemployee representative, can see a statement of the basic dutieshe owes to the company as a result of his membership of the(1 )board&quot;.    The Government agrees that it would be useful to bringtogether in one place a comprehensive statement of the variouslegal responsibilities of directors, but this would seem more appropriate to a handbook than to the statute itself.   TheGovernment intends to consult with the CBI and the TUC aboutthe preparation of such a handbook.7      The Bullock report also drew attention to the case of       (2)Parke v The Daily News    Limited in 1962, where the familycontrolling the company which purchased The Daily News wishedto distribute the whole of the purchase   price among the employees who would become redundant.   A shareholder of the daily News contested this proposed action and the Court foundthat there was no lawful basis for it.    It is not certain thatthe requirement which we propose to introduce that directorsshould take into account the interests of employees as well as ofshareholders would be held to extend to the actions of directors in the course of winding up a company, or to formeremployees.   The Government therefore, intends to make it lawfulfor directors to make provision for employees or formeremployees when closing down the whole or any part of thebusiness.(1)   Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Industrial Democracy(Cmnd 6706) Chapter 8 paragraph 36(2)    Supra cit Chapter 7 paragraphs 11 and 123
Loans to directors8     The definition of the fiduciary- duty of directors, proposedin paragraph 3, will broadly give statutory form to the existingcommon law that a director may not make use of his company&apos;smoney to further his private interests, and loans by companies to their directors are prohibited, with certain important excep-tions, by Section 190 of the Companies Act 1948.    nevertheless there have been a number of serious cases where directors have sought to circumvent the law in order to obtain large sums ofmoney from their companies, and inspectors in recent companyinvestigations have recommended that Section 190 should be strengthened.9     The Government propose to reform the law relating to loans todirectors in the following ways:- For public companies and private companies which belong toa group of which a public company is also a membera) to widen the scope of Section 190 to prohibit, subjectto certain exceptions, loans to directors1 families and to companies in which a director has an interest at well as loans to directors themselves; and to makebreach of these provisions a criminal offenceb) to introduce limitations on the scale and terms on whichloans to directors to be made when they are permitted under the specific exemptions:-- For all companies:-a) to ensure that there is greater disclosure of loans todirectors by amending Section 197 of the 1948 Act.The following paragraphs discuss these proposals in greater detail&apos;10     Section 190 provides that it shall not be lawful for a company to make a loan, or to enter into a guarantee or provideany security for a loan, to a person who is its director or aA
rector of its holding company.    In the case of public companies andxe companies that belong to a group of which a public company isI So aa member it is proposed to extend this prohibition to include ar&apos;s spouse, son or daughter, and to prohibit the making of a loancompany which a   director or his family controls or in which he orOfOf ^^&quot;^y h-as a major financial interest, defined as 20 per cent or moreI,       of the classes of capital or of the company&apos;s long or medium term^ebts.    Loans to trusts of which the director or any member of hislV is a trustee, other than a bare trustee, or a beneficiary, willlIBilarly be prohibited.e^e are at present three exceptions to the general prohibition on n ^ &quot;to directors: a subsidiary company may make a loan to its holding^ahy where the latter is its director:    a company may provide, subjectCertain safeguards, funds to a director to meet expenses incurreda    ne purposes of the company; and finally there is the &quot;bankingcion&quot; which provides that, in the case of a company whose ordinary^ess includes the lending of money, a loan may be made to a director&apos; such loan is in the ordinary course of the company1s business.^e(i abuses of the second and particularly the third exemption haveenrise to considerable concern.has been suggested that the meaning of &quot;in the ordinary course of&quot; should be defined more closely.    It is however difficult toe a definition which would be satisfactory in all circumstances.Slatnerefore propose instead to require that such loans must be on normalv^Kiercia]- terms as to interest rate, repayment terms, security and other-&apos; xriey are to be subject to an overall limit of  50,000 and are to be&apos;close  j,n        accounts; and to make a breach of the new provision subjectOr--^    lminal penalties.    It will however be permissible for a director toa low interest loan for house purchase from his company provided that.     xs done under a scheme which is available to employees of the company and1   ae same terms; the limit of  50,000 will nevertheless still apply and theivJ must be disclosed.Lh order not to obstruct legitimate inter-company lending,5
there will be an exemption to the provisions in paragraphs 10to 12 above for loans by one company to another within thesame group defined as a holding company and its subsidiaries.However where such loans would otherwise have been caught bythe rules on prohibition, limitation or disclosure details ofthe loans must be disclosed separately in the accounts of theLending Company.14     The new disclosure provisions to replace those in Section197 will cover all loans made to directors, including those totheir families and associated companies, and will require foreach loan:- a statement of the identity of the borrower, and thename of the director concerned if he is not the borrower- a statement of the terms of the loan,  including interestrate and security- a statement of the amount outstanding at the beginningand the end of the period, and the highest amountoutstanding during the period if this is a higher amount- a statement as to whether any interest due has not been paid, and whether any provision had been made in the accounts for non-recovery of the loan.This information will be part of the accounts and will be subjecto audit.15     There are other ways, besides the receipt of a loan, by
which a director may become indebted to his company, such astrade credit.    It is considered that where such indebtedness is significant it is a matter of legitimate concern to the shareholders, and it is intended that in future companies shouldbe required to show, separately from any loans, the amount .ofother indebtedness of each director to the company, or his familyor associated company, where such indebtedness exceeds  5,000.*t is also proposed to limit to  10,000 the advances which canbe made by a company to its director to cover expenses.directors&apos; conflicts of interest16    The general fiduciary duty of a director to his company alsoneeds to be strengthened by specific statutory provisionscovering transactions, other than loans, in which the directorsduty to his company conflicts or may conflict with his private interests or those of his family.    In general, it is not possibleto lay down in law what directors may or may not do in particular circumstances:   the variety of situations is too great.   Thereare,   however, two specific types of contract where thePossibility of conflict is so clear that the approval of the shareholders should be sought before the contract is valid:   oneconcerns long-term contracts of service, the other significantPurchases by the company of assets from or sales to, a director0r a company in which the director has an interest. The Stock^change   listing agreement already provides that, for listedCQmpanies, certain of these contracts must be authorised by the shareholders.   The Government propose that for all companiesdirectors1 service contracts for periods longer than 5 yearsshall not be valid unless approved by the company in generalfeting,    and intend to introduce a requirement that significantoontracts involving the transfer of assets between a companyahd a director, his family, or another company in which aErector has an interest, shall require the prior approval of
company in general meeting.17     For other transactions involving possible conflicts ofinterest it is proposed to provide for fuller disclosure of transactions in the annual accounts of companies, and tostrengthen the rights of shareholders to take legal actionwhere they consider that their interests have been harmed bythe actions of the directors.   The new disclosure provisionswill be along similar lines to those already in operation forlisted companies, which provide that details of contracts ofsignificance, defined as contracts involving in aggregate morethan 1 per cent of the company1s purchases or receipts, shall hedisclosed.    It is considered that this information should beprovided in the form of a note to the accounts, rather than inthe directors1 report, and will therefore be subject to audit.18     Hitherto, directors who have pursued their private interest at the expense of the company have had little to fear from the shareholders, even when the latter have the necessary informatiorl&apos;In private companies in particular, this may be considered as orieaspect of the need to improve the position of minority share-holders, and it is intended to introduce legislation to amendSection 210 of the 1948 Act to enable minority shareholders totake action more readily to protect their interests by providi^that they may petition the court on the grounds that the affair^3of the company are being conducted in a manner unfairlyprejudicial to their interests.    Such   amendment will of coursehelp to deal with a wider range of abuses than those involvingcontracts in which the directors have a personal interest.Non-executive directors19     Non-executive directors can perform a useful function in helping to resolve problems of conflicts of interest as well aSin other ways.    In recent years there has been growing interest8
ln- the role of non-executive directors on company boards.    TherePort of the Company Affairs Committee of the CBI &quot;the responsibilities of the British Public Company&quot; published in^973 (the   Watkinson Report) concluded that &quot;the inclusion on theboard of public companies of non-executive directors is highlyQesirable .... by virtue of the fact that unlike executiveErectors thay are not closely involved in the day-to-day affairs of the company and they are in a better position to see theCompany as a whole and to take a critical view of it&quot;.    Despite^is, only 35$ of companies in The Times 1000 1975/76 had more^han two non-executive directors.    Twenty five per cent had none.Non-executive directors can bring to the board a breadth of knowledge and experience which the company&apos;s own management maypossess.   Even more important, they can increase the element of independence and objectivity   in board decision-making.    Noteing involved in day-to-day management they are able to takea detached look at the way in which the company is being run and* its medium and long term policies.    They should providedependent supervision of the company1 s management.      In order^0 do this effectively, however, the non-executive directors need^ree access to management information and there need to bee*iough of them.    One or two non-executive directors on a boardWflich is 20 strong are unlikely to exercise real influence.In the United States and Canada a practice has developed intecent years whereby the boards of public companies appoint11 audit committee composed wholly or mainly of non-executiveSectors,   The duties of the audit committee are flexibleePending on the needs of the company, but the core functionsaj?e to review the financial statements and to review the audit^angements and the company1s internal financial controls.    Theaudit committee works closely with the auditors who are normallyVlted to attend its meetings.    It has been found in the United0-ces   and Canada that audit committees play a useful role inlengthening the influence of non-executive directors and the^sition of the auditors.   Public companies registered under the
Canadian Business Corporations Act 1973 are required to have anaudit committee and this will also be a requirement from1 July 1978 for companies listed on the New York Stock   Exchange.The time may come when it will be appropriate to legislate in thlSfield, but the Government believes initially at least it willbe better for companies,    investors and their representative bodies to work out schemes which can benefit from a degree of flexibility which the law could not provide.   It has been foundin North America that one of the conditions for the successful operation of audit committees is that the board should contain asufficient number of strong and independent non-executive direct     ^to serve on them.    This means that companies must be willing ^0 amembers of their senior management or directors to serve as non-executive directors on the boards of other companies, to thegeneral advantage of industry.   The Consultative Committee ofAccountancy Bodies, in a memorandum to the Secretary of Statefor Trade, has supported experiments with audit committees hyUK companies.    The Government welcomes this and also theconsideration which is currently being given to them by the confederation of British Industries and the Stock Exchange.10
5? TJ-iisider dealing is understood broadly to cover situations where arsoh buys or sells securities when he, but not the other party to thesaction, is in possession of confidential information which affectsVa-lue to be placed on those securities.   Furthermore the confidentialOrrnation in question will generally be in his possession because ofconnection which he has with the company whose securities are to bea^ in (eg he may be a director, employee or professional adviser ofG0mpany) or because someone in such a position has provided him.,    UJ-y or indirectly, with the information.    By seeking to make a profit111 such information, or to avoid a loss, the individual in questionI     e held to be taking an unfair advantage of the person with whom he ^ling.i]There are at present in this country no legal sanctions aimed,     xicaliy at discouraging insider dealing although, for example,the 1967 and the 1976 Companies Acts contain provisions requiring.     &quot;sure of dealings by directors and substantial shareholders.    InAOn, the Stock Exchange regulations and the City Code on Take-overs&quot;x h con^a^&quot;n Provisions against insider dealing and the Stockahge has recently announced details of Ma model code&quot; which it^    iCLs to introduce as part of its Listing Agreement; this lays downes to be observed by directors and employees wishing to deal inU ^ ComPany&apos;s securities.    The Government has looked carefully at the6s involved and has paid attention both to what is done in otherW       s an^ to the views expressed by various organisations in this coun-ta/   ^e question of what should be done about insider dealing has attracted-^   0nsiderable debate here and overseas and this has served to clarify.   issues and to identify the conflicting considerations which have to be^   Cefi.     That insider dealing is wrong is widely accepted and government has concluded that this should be underlined by^tory provisions which would make insider dealing in certain,)   ^&quot;stances a criminal offence.    It will not be possible to6 a perfect answer to the problem which will enable the11
immediate identification and conviction of every wrong doer butthe Government intends to establish as soon as possible thatinsider dealing is an offence and to create penalties which willbe sufficient in most cases to deter those who are tempted touse inside information for their own personal gain.    If the pro-visions proposed prove insufficient in the light of experience,the Government will not hesitate to modify and refine them.24     The Government believes that market transactions in quotedsecurities should be treated differently from other transactions.In the former, with the jobbing system and market structure, itwill not generally be practicable to identify a victim who has suffered as a result of insider dealing.    It is this that rulesout any adequate civil law remedy that would compensate the victim and it is for this reason that the only realistic deterrentis the creation of a criminal offence.    In other cases there willbe a direct contractual relationship between the parties and itis, therefore, possible to build on existing civil law remedieswith some strengthening of the law on fraud and misrepresentation(see para 30).    The Government is considering into which categorythe ARIEL system and the over-the-counter market should fall.25     The Governments principal proposal is that it shall be a criminal offence for an insider to deal on the market in quotedsecurities in certain circumstances where he has inside   informationWe intend, however, that this offence should not be one of absolute liability.    The prosecution will need to show that theinsider knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the inform-ation was not generally known and was price sensitive and thathe dealt nevertheless.   Also, it will be possible for a person tooffer as a defence that his purpose in dealing was not to make a profit or avoid a loss by the use of his inside   information.
n taking these proposals the Government has recognised that the creation. Itl5ider dealing as an offence must not be such as to inhibit dealings.^   are not under criticism.    It has particularly in mind that the directorsf ernPloyees of a company will not infrequently hold shares in the companyuch they work. By the very nature of their employment they will.^ sy be in possession of confidential information and they could beited from dealing perfectly innocently unless their special position^    &quot;Snased.    Thc difficulty is a real one,  but the Government believesdefence set out in the preceding paragraph will afford a suitable^   re of protection in relation to innocent dealings by directors and.  0yees.    While the Government welcomes the initiative taken by the StockCflah^e in producing the &quot;model code&quot; referred to in paragraph 23 above,-government does not consider that it would be practicable or desirablej ^rovide in legislation that compliance with the &quot;model code&quot; should of1 be a defence to the proposed criminal offence.    Furthermore,  in5su        nrnon&quot;t&apos;B view, &quot;the wide variety of possible factors to be considered it impossible to lay down, whether in legislation or in some statutory&apos; more specific guidance about the circumstances in which, under the-^lons set out above, it would be lawful to deal..    11 defining an insider it would be possible either to list in thei^ls^a&quot;tion specific classes of persons who together with defineds&apos;b Cla^es wo1^ld be treated as insiders (principally directors, employees,t s^antial shareholders and persons with a professional or business rela-H&amp;j       wiih the company) or to adopt a wider approach, as in the United^   s* that an insider is anyone who has inside information.    The principalh     aSe of the wider approach is that it might avoid some of the anoma-\       ^0 w-110 is an^ wil0 ^s no^ within the defined category of insider.^ Ver* it would be difficult toenforce in practice and could bring withinbition on dealing a much wider range of individuals who would be$   01116 doubt as to whether they were committing a criminal offence by to   QS or not.    Since this would be unsatisfactory, we think it best to^he approach of listing specific classes of persons.   However, we^ to adopt a wide definition of associate or &quot;tippee&quot;.13CONFIDENTIAL
28     As to tippee, the Government proposes that anyone who receivesinformation which he knows to be price sensitive and not generallyavailable and which he realises has come directly or indirectlyfrom an insider should fall within this category.   It is not pro-posed to restrict the definition of tippeesto those who are insome defined relationship with the insider.    The Government recog-recognises that this broad definition may inhibit some transactionsbut believes that its proposals for a defence against the criminalcharge will provide an adequate protection for the innocent.    if in a few cases a person is not clear whether he falls within the definition of an insider&apos;s tippee, the prudent course will be for him to refrain from dealing.    The alternative of setting out inthe legislation those who are in defined family or businessrelationships with the insider would necessarily introduce arbitrarydistinctions and could on occasion exclude from the crime personswho were knowingly behaving in an improper manner.29     It is not proposed that companies themselves should be capableof prosecution for insider dealing.    The provisions required tobring companies within the scope of the offence would be verycomplex and we do not think that by focussing solely on individual5we should be likely to miss any culpable person who should be brought within the net.   Also the main aim of the legislation will be toset out in the statute standards by which people can measure theirbehaviour.   However, we would propose to make it an offence for aninsider or a tippee to procure dealings by any other person and inthis case companies would be included in the definition of person.This provision is necessary to prevent evasion of the legislation by, for example, a person dealing through a company of which he isthe major shareholder.30 Where a market transaction is not involved and there are faceto face dealings between vendor and buyer the insider would be putunder an obligation, to be enforced by criminal sanctions, to revea^14
his status to the other party involved in the transaction.    Althoughthe latter probably has already sufficient grounds for a civilaction where this is not done, we intend to provide specificallythat default would give grounds for action to rescind the contractin question and recover any loss caused by the failure to disclose.31     Where insider dealing takes place in market transactions inquoted securities there are substantial problems in linking buyersand sellers which seem to rule out civil actions by those who claimto have made losses through buying or selling shares at a criticaltime.    Indeed one of the main arguments for creating the criminal offence of insider dealing is precisely that there is usually no effective civil remedy.   With the establishment of criminal sanctions criminal penalties will be the..natural way of makinginsiders pay for illicit gains.    In addition there would be nothing in the statute which would prevent civil remedies being sought inany suitable case under the present law.    The Courts have general power now under the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 1973 to order a convicted person to pay compensation, and this would apply toconvictions for insider dealing.    However such an order has to bemade in favour of an identified person, and in market transactionsit will not normally be possible to identify such a person.There may be some scope for the use of these powers in the morestraightforward cases, where the victim is identified and theextent of his loss is clear.    It is often argued, however, thatit would be wrong to allow the insider to retain the financialbenefit of his actions and that the company itself should beallowed to sue for &quot;disgorgement&quot;.    There will be cases in whichthe company will already have a right to recover profits obtainedfrom the misuse of information acquired by directors or employeesby virtue of their position or which has been entrusted to personsin confidence.    To extend the law so as to enable the company tosue for disgorgement where it has no right to do so at presentwould bring with it a windfall profit resulting from the criminalbehaviour of one of its employees but would mean that the insiderdid not keep any illicit gains.    The arguments for and against some
provision to ensure that an insider is deprived of such gainsare finely balanced and the Government has not yet reached a firm conclusion:    further discussion of this subject would be welcome.32     The preceding paragraphs set out the main principles onwhich the forthcoming legislation on insider dealing will bebased.    This legislation will also deal with a number of questionsof a more detailed nature, such as the position of trustees andthe arrangements within financial institutions for restrictingaccess to the confidential information held by certaindepartments.    These raise important and sometimes difficultissues, and will be the subject of further consideration and consultation.
