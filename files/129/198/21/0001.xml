^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 111 COPY NO      .815 December 1977CABINETTOP SALARIES - NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONSULTANTSAND OTHERSMemorandum by the Attorney general. This item was not reached in Cabinet on 1 December 1977, and itraises some complex legal points.    I think that it would be helpful to mycolleagues to record my views in writing.A. BRITISH NUCLEAR FUELS LIMITED DIRECTORS2. In CP(77) 107 and 108 the Lord Privy Seal suggests that the casesof the National Health Service Consultants and the British Nuclear FuelsLimited (BNFL) directors must be treated alike as the strength of the legal advice seems to be similar.    That is not my view.    In my opinion thereis a clear pre-pay policy contractual link between the BNFL directors&apos;salaries and the corresponding Civil Service grades.    This is not theposition (see below) in respect of the Consultants&apos; claim.    My advice isthat a claim by the BNFL directors would succeed in the courts.3. Leaving aside the legal position, my colleagues may also think thatthe political impact of upholding the claim of a very small number of nationalised industry board members to equality of treatment with theCivil Service is likely to be very different from the political impact of allowing a large number of National Health Service (NHS) Consultants toobtain large retrospective payments in respect of the second stage of the doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) recommendation, when, as Iunderstand it, no other &quot;top salary&quot; group has received the benefit of that stage.B. NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONSULTANTS4. In July 1975 the Consultants were awarded an increase to be stagedas to Stage 1 (retrospectively) from 1 April 1975, and as to Stage 2 from1 April 1976.    This was agreed by the Joint Negotiating Committee (JNC)and received the necessary statutory approval of the Secretary of State bycircular.CONFIDENTIAI
5. In February 1976 a circular (&quot;the second circular&quot;) provided asfollows and received the necessary statutory approval of the Secretary ofState: -&quot;Staged Increases7. Increases in remuneration which were due to be paid from1 April 1976 in accordance with the staging arrangements set out inparagraphs 3 and 15-17 of the Appendix to HSC(IS) 159 andparagraphs 8-10 of HSC(IS) 167 will not now be payable from that date.Payments Withheld8. Payments withheld in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7of this notice will not subsequently be paid retrospectively, but willbe credited in full for superannuation purposes. &quot;6. Circulars in similar terms were issued for Wales and Scotland.7. In August, 1977, the Solicitor-General, in my absence abroad,advised that there were two important areas of doubt -a. As to whether in law the Consultants retained any right tothe Stage 2 increase (having regard to the real posaibility that thesecond circular might be held by the courts to have deferred theConsultants1 rights other than for superannuation purposesindefinitely) or whether their right s were merely deferred in lawuntil Pay Policy permitted them to be paid;  and b. as to whether, if the second circular gave the Consultantsa claim in law to their increase under Stage 2 as soon as Pay Policypermitted, the Second White Paper permitted the whole of Stage increase to be paid from 1 April 1977, or only the  4 provided forin the Second White Paper.8. My advice, with which the Solicitor General agrees, is that the doubts on both these points are now so great that the Government is fullyentitled to resist the Consultants&apos; claim.    In the light of the information available since August I believe that there is a very substantially lowerchance of the Consultants succeeding than the Solicitor General and the lord advocate envisaged at that time.    We have still had no legal claim fromthe Consultants founded upon a right to the Stage 2 increase accruing since1 April 1977, notwithstanding that the Department of Health and social security have approved payment of the Second White Paper  4 increase.We may be confident that, if they had had even moderately strong legal advice in their favour, we should have heard something of it by now.2rnwcincMTiAi
9. If we rely on these very serious doubts as to their legal entitlementthe issue becomes purely one of policy as to how much to allow the consultants and when.    I think that we should be quite safe in adopting this line.    I do not think that we could be fairly criticised even if (which I regard as unlikely) any claim they thereafter make in the courts were to succeed.10.        Having regard to the views expressed above on the effect of thesecond circular, it remains to apply the Pay Policy to the Consultants&apos; case.They clearly have no claim until April 1978, 12 months after they receivedthe  4 increase under the Second White Paper.    But it is open to questionwhether they should be regarded as being then entitled to the full amountof the Stage 2 increases or whether any increase at that time should stillbe subject to the guidelines, i. e. confined to not more than 10 per cent.My colleagues may think that there are arguments in equity for giving them the full amount and that there is a clear distinction between the Consultantsand other &quot;top salaries&quot; groups in that the Consultants did at one stagehave a legal right to payment as from 1 April 1976, of which they have been deprived by executive act in the form of the second circular.    Payment on1 April 1978 would thus involve a 2-year deferment of a payment which allconcerned thought in February 1976 would be subject only to a 1-yeardeferment, i.e. until 1 April 1977.    This, however, is a matter of policyand equity rather than of law.S royal Courts of Justice5 December 19773rnwPinPMTiAi
