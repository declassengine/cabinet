XXV     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONEXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE FAY COMMITTEE388     we have now detailed the &quot;circumstances&quot; which our terms ofreference required us to inquire into, and we can look back and summariseWhat has happened.    Our inquiry has been twofold,  firstly into what theCrown Agents did (or did not do),  and secondly into the efforts,  largelyunsuccessful, of different organs of government to detect and check theCrown Agents&apos;  activities.239     In outline we can say that the losses have been due to incompetencerather than to misconduct.    The causes have been the actions (and inaction)of individuals, coupled with a defective system.    The system was defective^ (a) lack of accountability,  (b) absence of expert procedures,  CO absentof managerial supervision,   (d) bad accounting.    Outside agencies contribute to the failure to prevent the losses.390     What the Crown Agents did was between 1967 and 1974 inclusive tooonduct on their own account a substantial secondary banking activity in the course of conducting it to engage in investment and lending*hich was unwise both in character and in degree.    They embarked uponth-is course without seeking independent advice and we find that theyAssessed neither the skills nor the organisation necessary for such an enterprise.    Accountability was lacking.    It was unfortunate that theOration developed at a time when it was believed that those deployingfu*ds could hardly avoid making money, and there was thus engendered inthe officials concerned an undeserved degree of self-confidence.    WhenCrisis came they were totally unprepared, their lack of real banking^Perience was exposed and they allowed themselves to be locked intoSltuations engendering further losses.fur-391     We have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the desire to secure* reserve which was the main reason advanced for the origin of the own-acoount activities.    But there was another factor in this origin,  thefactor of realisation of the facts that the Crown Agents had large funds to deploy and that there were money-making opportunities open to thosenthlarge funds at their command.    They had had for many years ane^ryo &quot;bank&quot; in the shape of the principals deposits taken by the JointC^olidated Fund and the Joint Miscellaneous Fund, which they deployed111 safe investments.    Once the eyes of those concerned were opened tothe opportunities presented by the management of these and other funds,^ ...&quot; .,     . H     u........% ..     .   i   &quot; &quot;*     * ****226
they embraced the prospect with enthusiasm.    One of the remarkablefeatures of the story is the speed with which the enterprises developed.They started in the first quarter of 1967 and by 30 September 1968, when sir Stephen Luke retired, the Finvest operation had reached the order of 50m, and investment in equities,  secondary banks and property companies had started, together with investment in subsidiary companies and in australian property development.    Some of the wilder enterprises, suchas unsuccessful speculation in silver and in mining shares, had alreadybeen carried out.    Thereafter we have the impression that the mainspringof the own-account activities was not the securing of a reserve but the satisfaction of money-making for its own sake.392     There was thus a substantial secondary banking enterprise in being at the time when Sir Claude Hayes succeeded to the Chairmanship of theCrown Agents.    Mr Challis, who had played an important part in itsinception, had been chosen to head the Finance Directorate.    After SirStephen1s departure Mr Challis was virtually supreme in his field.    Hehad a newcomer as Chairman,  and Boards which he could dominate - theCrown Agents&apos; Board because none of his colleagues possessed the ability to challenge him, and the Four Millbank Investments&apos; Board because itsMajority were his subordinates.    Sir Claude told us that he had been assured by his predecessor &quot;that the one thing I need not worry aboutwas finance.    I was told that it was in perfectly good hands and that i could concentrate on other things&quot;.    At Crown Agents&apos; Board meetings, hesaid, two of the members, Mr Morris and the Managing Director of MillbankTechnical Services Ltd, Mr Roe, would argue with Mr Challis,  &quot;but nonethelesshis mind was so powerful that he won the arguments&quot;.    Mr Newman, theCrown Agents&apos; Managing Director, told us, &quot;we were not welcome if weraised questions&quot;.    Mr Challis would consult his Chairman insofar as hethought it necessary or desirable and, not surprisingly, was successfuliji eliciting his support.    Mr Newman said this of the FMI Board meetings:&quot;It was quite clear at those meetings that a lot went on between mr Hayes and Mr Challis - discussions outside the meetings - and wewere merely being informed ... what was going on.&quot;&quot;^hus the responsibility for the way in which the own-account activitiesdeveloped rests fairly and squarely on Mr Challis because he conductedchem, and on Sir Claude Hayes because he knew, or ought to have known,what was going on.
MR CHALLIS393     Mr Challis with his subordinates - and indeed with his equals andwith all the Crown Agents&apos; personnel save the Chairman - imposed his authority and brooked no interference,  as witness his treatment ofMr Nowers (para 121) and Mr Blundell (para 273) and his contemptuousminute repelling Mr Morris&apos;s criticisms (para 161).    Mr Challis wouldhave us believe that he did not influence the courses taken by the moneymarket managers, and said to us more than once that he had not everordered that a loan be granted.    \&apos;le do not believe him.    It may well bethat he did not direct the day to day operations of the managers;  therewas no reason why he should.    But we have no doubt that the major decisions were his and that,  for example,  the loans to Stern and the GCA CapitalCorporation were made at his behest.    It was upon Mr Challis that the lack of accountability worked its effects.    His subordinates were accountable to him, but he was in practice accountable to no-one.    In theory he wasaccountable to the Chairman, but the Chairman exerted no effective control over him, and joined forces with him to repel any accountabilityto external bodies.    Lack of discipline undermines morale, and we aresure that the absence of constraints upon Mr Challis played a part in producing and perpetuating the characteristics we discuss below.3s4     Much of the own-account activity was satisfactory and calls for &amp;ccomment.    But alongside the run-of-the-mill deposit operations therewore transacted the schemes we have dealt with.    And throughout we find that the characteristics of the Finance Directorate under Mr Challisincluded (i) unjustified risk-taking;  (ii) a lack of regulation andcontrol and an aversion from taking advice;   (iii) secretiveness;   (iv) a*ow standard of commercial ethics;  (v) a haphazard choice of associates.RISKS TAKEN395     Mr Challis has been described to us as adventurous.    The risks her&amp;n stemmed from two causes; the nature of the investment and the extentof the involvement in them.    We have been reminded by witnesses of thefact that the Crown Agents were not alone in suffering misfortune in1974; the crisis of confidence of that year caused the collapse of manyfringe banks, and the over-extended property companies inflicted lossesuPon the most cautious of the clearing banks as well as upon the CrownAgents.    It is true that the Crown Agents were not alone in that time in
Imprudent financing,  and probably many of the fringe banks that collapsedWill be found to have suffered from features similar to these exhibitedby the Crown Agents.    But the prudent banks, though they lent to theM* Sterns of the time, did so with a proper regard to security and insuch proportions as to ensure that losses could be accepted withoutaffecting their own solvency.    With the Crown Agents on the contrary itwas a case of too many eggs in too few baskets - particularly the basketsiabelled English and Continental, Australia and Stern.39(5     We were also pressed with the argument that some of the risksincurred were taken in order to enhance the service afforded to principalsTo a limited extent this is true.    A number of the associated companieskad among their objects the improvement of the facilities on offer to overseas governments.    Thus we accept the evidence that the investment^ Mr Abrahams&apos;s Television Recordings (para 31) included this motivation.But when this argument is used to explain investments such as that in overseas merchant banks it begins to lose credibility and indeed becomes0Jie of the armoury of propaganda weapons so often used by the CrownAgents in their dealings with Whitehall.    An extension of this argument3-s the assertion that all the financial operations were designed tosecure expertise to offer to principals.    Other propaganda weapons weretlie representation that the joint funds belonged to the principals(Para 126)  and the use made of the existence of the Equity Investment Advisorpanel (para ). 1.4-).Lack of management procedures397     One can understand the own-account operations starting in a small*ay and needing little by way of rules and regulations at the outset.But a time must come when a properly conducted business grapples withthe problem of management and control.    In relation to the Crown Agents&apos;^siness this would involve the monitoring of performance, the accuraterePorting of events, and the setting up of a regulatory framework.    when mr Challis became Director of Finance and when Sir Claude came fresh toth-e organisation, an opportunity was afforded for either or both to takeStock, to identify the problem and to take appropriate measures.    The0PPortunity was not taken.    Mr Challis was not good at detail.    Mr P Matthewshis colleague for a year at First National Finance Corporation,  foundis methods disappointing:&quot;He had a tremendous gift for dealing with a problem.    I thought he
had no gift at all for following it through and tying up the looseends.&quot;This seems to be the reason why there was such a lack of sound managementProcedures within the Finance Directorate.    There were the monthlySports to the Director showing the state of the money.book, and monthlysports of a general nature to the Board but there were no bankingrules - certainly no written banking rules; there were supposed to be^written rules, eg about the percentage of security which could bel*at, but they were vague and often honoured in the breach.    Above allthere was no systematic management accounting.    Thus it was that theCrown Agents fell into such errors as borrowing short and lending long,a*d lending on insufficient security and the like.    The dislike of management procedures probably explains the fading away of the office ofStroller (para 91) when it was set up in response to Urwick Orr&apos;sWvice.    And even when the Credit Committee was set up with such formalityafter the Vehicle h General losses, its scope was limited and its decisions*ere frequently disregarded (paras 247, 356).SECRETIVENESS3e&amp;     The secrecy in which the Finance Directorate conducted its affairsw&amp;s a manifestation of the ingrown spirit found within the Crown Agentsat the time in question.    It was a closed-in body, training up itsPersonnel from youth and rarely recruiting from outside.    We have commentedUPon the strange results of this policy at paras 42 and 43 above,^ongst other things it resulted in the ludicrous situation of thisCoaplex trading organisation having only one qualified accountant on its staff until November 1970.    The uncertainty in the I960&apos;a over theContinued existence of the office intensified this inward-looking attitude,as did the &quot;you are on your own&quot; theory^Cpara 12).    Under Sir ClaudeH*yeE communication at other than top level with the Ministry was discouraged(Para 3G7).    In the Finance Directorate the prevailing atmosphere of8ecrecy had the result that no one but Mr Challis could comprehend theState of affairs as a whole, and he at no time shared the completePlcture with the Chairman.    With secrecy went a rooted disinclination totake advice unless forced to.    The Urwick Orr report, commissioned by8l* Stephen Luke, was an exception, but after his time no advice wastftken upon management,  banking cr investment,  and Price Waterhouse wereb*QUght in to advise only when the accounting system was breaking down.
LOW ETHICAL STANDARDSThough they may have been uncertain of their exact status,  thestaff of the Crown Agents had no doubt that they were Crown servants.As such,  one would expect their conduct to conform with the high standardsconsistent with their positions in the public service,  as indeed SirClaude pointed out  (para 174).    But,  as we have seen,  there were fallings-off from these high standards.    Some were personal,  such as the taking of the Gramco shares (para 198) and of the gifts bestowed by Mr Stern(Para 262).    Others were commercial,  such as the secret underwritingcommission (para 73),  the support buying of shares  (para 139),  the elaboratedevice employed in window-dressing a balance sheet  (para 140),  theattitude to Exchange Control  (para 127)  and the Nation Life affair(Para 249).    In a class of its own,  in our view,  stands the bargainbetween I!r Challis and Mr Walker to avoid the payment of UK taxationboth by the Crown Agents and by Mr Walker and Mr Greene (para 233).M* Nowers spoke no less than the truth when he said (para 168) that theoffice had lost its sense of direction in the spiritual sense.HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATES4Q0     A feature emerging from the history we have explored is how fortuitous*as the Finance Directorate&apos;s choice of associates.    Mr Abrahams meetsMr Wheatley by chance,  and becomes the Crown Agents&apos; estate agent; heintroduces Mr Walker, who becomes their property consultant,  and hisfirm becomes their property solicitors; Mr Walker introduces Mr Caplan,*ho becomes their valuer.    No doubt the Crown Agents did not have to goQut to look for business opportunities; when the news got around thatth-ey had large funds for investment they did not lack for applicantseager to do business with them especially as they became known in theCity,  according to evidence given to us,  as &quot;an easy touch&quot;     But it isa strange organisation which allows a junior official,   as Mr Wheatleyv&apos;as at the time,  to recruit its professional advisors,  and to recruitthem not from nationally known firms but from young men making theircareers.    Let us say at once that we have no reason to suppose that inthe main the Crown Agents got other than proper advice from the gentlemen*e have named.    Mr Walker in particular, who bulks large in this story,,lQt only gave sound advice,  as to Australia and otherwise,  but alsosaved the Crown Agents from losses upon their uninstructed plunge intothe rea] pr0pcrty world (para 51).    But the solicitors, Davies, Arnoldand Cooper, were responsible for losing some security in the Stern case
by not registering charges in time (para 342)  and should not have borrowedfrom the Crown Agents without the latter being separately advised (para 275).THE LOSSES40l     The losses which we have listed above at paragraph 373 may beclassified as due to (i) unsecured lending to borrowers now unable to repay fully or at all;   (ii)  secured lending where the security has proved insufficient or defective;   (iii)  support lending in cases whererescue failed;   (iv) equity investments in associated companies whichhave failed;  (v) participation in property development and dealing.    the equity investments form a small proportion of the whole because theCrown Agents injected money into their associates by way of loans ratherthan by shareholding.    The lending is both in sterling and in other currencies.    Sterling lending was the province of the Sterling MoneyMarket Manager, the late Mr Wheatley, whom we did not see for thereasons mentioned in para 3.    Mr Wheatley seems often to have madeadvances upon what has proved to be insufficient security; some of theProperty valuations relied upon were unduly optimistic and is some casesari unduly high proportion of the valuation was advanced.    The non-sterling lending was the province of Mr Blundell, and it is satisfactory to be able to note that despite his unpromising background as a banker(para 43) Mr Blundell succeeded in avoiding major investment errors.The large non-sterling loans to Wilstar (Stern), GCA Capital Corporation,and Tulone were cases where he was required to lend against his betterJudgement (paras 246, 273, 350), and he can hRrdly be blamed for the!srael British Bank loss  (para 359).    Within his personal responsibilitycome the losses on Galico Investments, Great South West Corporation andRePublic Corporation.    The first named was a syndicate loan, within aindicate led by the Crown Agents&apos; banking partners, Continental Illinois,and the other two were small losses incurred early on in his time incharge of the section (para 160).    Mr Blundell comes well out of ourinvestigation.PROPERTY SPECULATION*02     As to financing property, a bank or finance house has broadly two0Ptions, one to lend at proper rates on ample security, the other tolfind with less security and less, or delayed, return on the loan, but aa
a quid pro quo to take &quot;a slice of the action&quot; by holding a stake in the equity     The former is a banking operation,  the latter an entrepreneurialoperation.    The former has little risk,  the latter produces high profits in boom time and large losses xn slumps     The &quot;adventurous&quot; Mr Challis-hose the latter course for major  investments.    It produced a  17mProfit on the first English and Continental operation and other lessersuras elsewhere,  and now has produced enormous losses4Q3     The sharing and the amount of the E&amp;C profits reaped by Mr Walkerand Mr Greene has been criticised by Sir Matthew Stevenson and others(Para 216).    But if an undertaking is predominantly financed by loans from one lender    that lender becomes locked in to the situation and inadverse conditions may have to find more money in the hope of preservinghis investment,  and in such conditions it is no more than a recognitionof the facts to give him a stake in the equity.    Moreover if it is onelender&apos;s money that enables a concern to make profits it is sensible forUle lender to have a share in these profits     What that share should benust be a matter for negotiation and bargaining     Partnerships betweenCaPitai and expertise are not unknown in the property world,  and we aresatisfied that it is not uncommon for the partnership to be on a 50-50basis     in E&amp;C Mr Walker and Mr Greene contributed their expertise notonly to policy decision making but also to the running of the companies.0rt the other hand at the outset their experience was limited and theyl!-aci yet to make their reputation      In the case of the other major partnershipVeOture, both Mr Fenstcn and Capital &amp; Counties were well-known and weree*Pected to enhance the enterprise by their reputation      It  has beenRested that the bargain with the Fens ton syndicate was disadvantageousT-he Crown Agents in that the syndicate did little except set the&quot;Nation up.    We are not disposed to find fault with the 50% share in either case.    What, in our opinion was jyong with these transactions wasthe going into them in the first place,  not  the proportions of  theSP!it-    In the Australian venture there was the added fault,  as we seeU&apos; of the crown Agents binding themselves to provide finance far intothe future.    A body like the Crown Agents,  it may be thought,  shouldavQid speculative ventures;  it is one thing to be involved in propertyas an income producing asset or to lend a proportion of a propertyCon&apos;-Panys needs against valid security, but it is another sort of transactiontogether to buy Bush House not for its revenue but to re-sell at aPrQfit. or to bind oneself by contract to furnish great sums for re-aeveloping urban sites in Australia for years ahead.to
THE CROWN AGENT404     sir Claude Hayes inherited the own-account dealings situation.    Hecould not be expected to oversee in detail the operations of the FinanceDirectorate,  and that directorate was one among many in the organisationhe headed.    But he had asserted at the outset that Finance was his personal concern (para 91 above), he had the opportunity through presidingat the Crown Agents and Four Millbank Investments Board meetings ofanassing information about the Directorate^ activities, and moreover as time went on warnings started coming in (paras 161-164) .    His minutes ofFebruary and May 1971 (paras 172-174) show his awareness of some of the directorate^ failings, and by August 1972 he was mentioning one ofMr Challis&apos;s major shortcomings to the Permanent Secretary - his readiness to do business inconsistent with the standing of the Crown Agents (para 317).Sir Claude would have known more if he had been more approachable to his subordinates, none of whom among our witnesses, save Mr Challis, foundhim other than forbidding.    In particular if Mr Nowers had had a Chairmanto whom he felt able to voice his apprehensions and who would have beenable to asses the weight of the complaints,  this history would have beenVery different (para 170).    This attitude of his was one of the reasons why internal warnings decreased a3 time went on; other reasons were the apparent success of the Finance Directorate^ operations and the apparentaPproval given by the Stevenson Committee to those operations      Sir Claude&apos;su^approachability was also partly responsible for the remarkable delay in grappling with the Stern crisis  (para 340).4Q5     An equally important feature of Sir Claude&apos;s outlook was his^termination to assert and maintain a position of independence for himself,  the Crowv Agent,  and for the Crown Agents&apos;  organisation in hischargc.    This led to a running battlfr*with the Ministry from the time inl9Q9 when they discovered Finvest down to the day in September 1974 whenhe departed.    As against government Mr Challis&apos;s actions were supportedand justified and the attempts of the Ministry to obtain information orto impose some constraints were treated as sinister attacks on theindependence of the Crown Agents&apos; office.    In a minute written on his last day in office and&apos;addressed to his successor, Sir Claude said:&quot;By 1S68 the Crown Agents were still alive and&apos; kicking and beginning to be profitable.    Treasury and CDM officials suddenly realisedthis and started a long process of getting direct control over theCrown Agents,  including their operations, their assets, their reserves and their property.&quot;234
Sir Claude s partisanship blinded him to the Ministry&apos;s real motives inmaking their  inquiries and led him into activly misinforming them upon such matters as the Crown Agents&apos;   involvement in the second E&amp;C set-up(para 302)     His antagonism,  coupled with his vigour and ingenuity infcigument,  played its part in protracting discussion and prolonging thestatus quo - and with it the own-account operations in their risky form.406     One special feature of Sir Claude&apos;s conduct was his failure toreplace Mr Challis when he left  (para 324),    This was because he thoughtit premature in view of the impending changes in structure.    It was aserious error      It led to the Crown Agents being wholly unprepared forthe change in the financial climate and wholly unequipped to deal with it     Had a new mind come to the direction of the Crown Agents&apos;  financesin November 1973 a great deal of money would have been saved.    And hadthe out-of-depth Mr Hewins felt able to approach his Chairman at the start of the troubles, many further millions also could have been saved.CORRUPTION407     We have had evidence that rumours of corruption in the FinanceDirectorate have persisted in the City for many years.    This is not surprising,  because the manner of the Crown Agents doing business wasoften such as to invite suspicion.    We have referred in paras 382-386above to the various allegations made at different times against thelate Mr Wheatley,  the Sterling Money Market Manager.    At the date of his death he was awaiting trial on criminal charges of corruption in regard&apos;-o matters with which we cannot deal in a published report for thereasons mentioned in para 3.    It is not for us to speculate whether mr Wheatley entered into some of the loss-making transactions of hissection for improper reasons.    We caW only report: that,  apart from thesubject-matter of the criminal charges, we have found no evidence ofcorruption,  nor has any witness come forward with any specific allegation:4Q8     We have however found,  in the case of Mr Stern&apos;s Christmas giftsfpara 262)  instances of the Crown Agents staff accepting favours whichmight be thought to place them under an obligation to a person with whom they had to deal  in their official capacity.    These gifts were in ourView unfortunate     The Crown Agents&apos;  staff handbook does not deal clearlywith the topic,  but it hardly needs a rule to expound the unwisdom of a
Crown servant accepting gifts or favours from persons with whom he i.sdoing business-    The recent Report of the Royal Commission on standards of Conduct in Public Life (Cmnri 6524) recognised that minor gifts andhospitality are part of the normal courtesies of life but regarded them as &quot;always potentially dangerous&quot;.    The Royal Commission approved the Do E rules forbidding inter alia the acceptance of gifts other thansimple tokens bearing the name of the organisation that gave them (Report.Cmnd 6524 paras 214,  217).    Mr Challis is especially blameworthy in thecase of the Stern gifts in that he should have set an example to his staff.    There is a conflict of evidence between him and Mr Hewins overwhether he knew of the gift to the latter; we accept Mr Hewin&apos;s account and think that when consulted Mr Challis should have ordered the immediatereturn of the gift to Mr Stern,  as well as returning his own.EXTERNAL CONTROL409   Turning to the second strand of our Inquiry - the question of external checks - it is satisfactory to note that at the outset thealarm mechanisms worked efficiently.    The inception of own-accountdealing was recognised by the Exchequer and Audit Department   la1969 as a departure which should be brought to the Treasury&apos;s attention(para 92);  in February 1970 the other auditor,  the Director General of overseas Audit Service, reported to the Ministry his misgivings overoperation of the JCF (para 102); and in May 1970 the Bank o.C England,having picked up items causing them concern, expressed that concern tothe Treasury (para 107).    The Treasury was the correct department to be approached by the Bank and the E&amp;AD,  but  it was the Ministry of overseas development which would have to come to grips with the situation.    TheMinistry was at once informed of the E&amp;AD&apos;s report, but unfortunatelyrtid not learn of the Bank&apos;s concern (para 109).    The Treasury did or.vJUTthsir own interest and lent impetus to an investigation of the siti410   An investigation rather than action was the keynote of the ensuingtransactions.    What clearly bedevilled the matter was the uncertaintyover the Crown Agents&apos;  status.    The Crown Agents had outlived their original function, and no one knew quite how the transformed organisationfitted into the constitutional framework.    If control of the CrownAgents was called for,  it was logical to ask whether the power to controlexisted and to what it extended.    This was initially a legal and constitut.Question, and, if answered favourably to control,  a second questionopened out, namely how far it was prudent or politic to exert control.
Avi examination of the problem at once threw up these questions,  andunfortunately they were allowed to dominate thinking and obscured the initial practical problem,   ie what to do about the own-account activities.With hindsight it can readily be seen that there was sn urgent need toascertain accurately what the Crown Agents were doing, to assess the validity of the reason given (the creation of the reserve),  to evaluate the risks being run,  and to restrain some if not all of the own-accountoperations,    Without hindsight two officials at the Ministry perceivedthis; we have quoted sufficient of Mr Smith&apos;s and Mr Burr&apos;s minutes to illustrate the accuracy of their appreciation of the situation (eg paras84-96, 104, 106, 298).    Unfortunately the Permanent Secretary disagreed:he saw no reason to interfere,  although he sanctioned inquiries into theCrown Agents&apos;  status (para 98).    Thus there was lost the first and bestopportunity of controlling or stopping the own-account actvities.  Byearly 1970 both the Ministry and the Treasury were thinking in terms of investigation of what the Crown Agents were and what they were doinggenerally, and when in April 1970 events prodded the Ministry into further action,  it was towards inquiry that the officials&apos; minds turned(para 104).4U     Once an inquiry was contemplated (1970) or decided upon (Januaryl97l) action was postponed;  it was further postponed until the StevensonCommittee reported (March 1972) and thereafter while its report wasbeing considered.    The more time passed, the more firmly establishedbecame the own-account operations and the more difficult it became tocontrol them.    These difficulties were enhanced by the approval conferredb.v the Stevenson report;  the fact that this approval was conditional on^-structuring the Crown Agents so as to diminish the risks  (para 210)las&apos;; its urgency under Sir Claude&apos;s reassurances  (para 303).    Not untilAugust 1973 was action taken in the shape of the statement of principles^en imposed (para 304).    But even then nothing happened.    No doubt theMinistry expected the Crown Agents to take action at once to observe thePrinciples in the conduct of their affairs, eg imparting of information,*eforn of the quality of investment business.    In fact Sir Claude Hayesdid little about them.    They were left to be put into practice by then*w companies mentioned in the principles,  and the process of setting upthose companies had hardly started when the government changed in March19?4 and further time became needed for the formulation of a new policy.
412     Once the decision had been taken to investigate first and actafterwards - a logical enough sequence - it is difficult to see how anychain of events other than those which took place could have been broughtabout.    What however is plain is that the process could have been accelerated.We have the feeling that the setting up of investigative machinery andthe consideration of the constitutional status of the Crown Agents weresubjects more congenial to Government than the taking of financial control decisions.    But while condemning the delay from October 1969,when the Ministry was first alerted,  to August 1973, when the principleswere laid down, and to October 1974, when management changed, we recognisethat the Stevenson findings were bound to set matters back, that SirClaude Hayes&apos;s vigorous and disingenuous defensive campaign was bound toProtract matters, and that the Ministry were never able to obtain a fullpicture of the own-account scene, owing to the delay in the accounts andthe way in which the Crown Agents furnished information which was sparseand sometimes misleading.    In particular it is plain that a reason forthe Ministry1s failure to act on financial control at a critical point*0 time (end 1972) was their belief that the need for outside controlhad passed with Sir Claude Hayes declaration that the Crown Agentsintended to close down on further venture investment after collectingthe P0SSFUND profit (para 303) .    It was open to Sir Claude to use his authority to impose this new investment policy on his finance directorate.he had done so many of the losses that we have recorded would nothave been incurred. As our narrative has shown he did not do so andrisk investment went ahead but was not disclosed to the Ministry.^-3     In spite of repeated experiences of misinformation, or actionpromised and not taken,  the Ministry maintained, almost to the end ofhis tenure of office, their belief that Sir Claude Hayes was to beci*usted to carry out his undertakings to the Ministry.    Although exasperatedhis intransigence,  the Ministry treated Sir Claude remarkably gently,as witness their anxiety to secure his agreement to the form of inquiry(para 190), their handling of the natter of the Gramco shares (para 183),their prolonging hia term of office to secure his pension rights (para 365),and their patience with his opposition generally.414 v/e think attention should be drawn to the handling of the crisisQf 1974, The Crown Agents&apos; optimistic statements (paras 338, 345) had for long concealed the parlous state of their finances, but at last on*3 May 1974 Mr Hewins&apos;s rough balance sheet was disclosed and it became
t,    - ...   7apparent to the Ministry,  the Treasury and the Bank of England that theCrown Agents were insolvent;  yet the only action taken was the preparationof the statement of government guarantee,  to be released if there was a&quot;run on the bank&quot;  (para 346) .    The organisation which had brought about this lamentable state of affairs was allowed to run on under the samemanagement until Sir Claude retired.    His retiring date had just been extended from 30 June 1974 to 30    September 1974.    What could and shouldhave been done has been discussed at para 364.    In the end the own-account activities v/ere not examined and disciplined until the expiry ofthe Chairman&apos;s term of office.THE ROLE OF THE AUDITORS415     The Crown Agents&apos;  accounts,  as audited and reported on by theExchequer and Audit Department, ought to have served, inter alia (a) asan annual public record of the own-account activities;  (b) as a managementtool for the use of the Crown Agents in the performance of those activities and (c) as a means of providing the Treasury,  the Ministry and the Bankof England with information and the opportunity to take any appropriate measures of control or otherwise.    For various reasons the accountsfailed to perform those functions.416     In October 1969 when the E &amp; AD identified the size and nature ofthe Finvest operation, and reported thereon to the Treasury and theMinistry, they passed to the proper quarter the question of what authority the Crown Agents had for own-account operations.    We note that it mighthuve been possible for the E &amp; AD to make this report a year earlierwhen first told about Finvest (para 92) but we doubt whether this wouldhave materially altered the course of events.417     When in October 1971 the Treasury directed that the accountsshould be so prepared &quot;as to conform to the standards of disclosurerequired by the Companies Acts where these are appropriate&quot; (para 117) ,they v/ere recognising that the accounts were those of a large and complextrading organisation.    We think that in some respects the accounts,  asaudited by the E &amp; AD fell short of those standards.    The principalshortcoming was as regards delay.    We have mentioned the inordinatedelays at paras 280-291,    The statutory requirement that the E &amp; AD8nould make their examination &quot;with as little delay as possible&quot; was lost sight of, and it was plain to us that no one in the Crown Agents,
and few outcide,  felt a need for the accounts or an obligation to furnishthem In good shape and in good time (paras 281-285).    When at lengtheach year&apos;s accounts came out they were next to useless as an informatoryrecord because go seriously out of date.    Some of the delay may havebeen due to inadequate audit staff allocated to the Crown Agents  (para283) .    More important in our view was the apparent. Lack of concern overthe delay on the part of the E &amp; AD higher directing staff,  and thefailure to report it as a departure from the accounting standards prescribed by the Treasury.41S     As to other audit shortcomings, our narrative has shown situationswhere the audit process might have, but did not, expose imprudence,irregularity, or even deception on the part of the Finance Directoratein the conduct of the own-account business.    Examples are the absence of provision for losses, actual or potential (para 290) and the concealmentof massive contingent liabilities incurred by the issue of comfortletters (paras 148-149).    But the most significant impression that wegained of the part played by the E &amp; AD in the rise and fall of theCrown Agents as bankers and investors was that they never recaptured thespirit of alertness and perceptive inquiry so clearly shown in Mr Long&apos;sreport on Finvcst to the Treasury in October 1969.    We were told thatthe Treasury valued the E &amp; AD audit especially because of the detailedPrivate report mr.de when needed.    One of the great might-have-beens ofour inquiry is the remedial action on the part of the government thatwould surely have followed if the Treasury had asked for,  and the E &amp; ADRad used their audit scrutiny to supply, further information on theQuantity and quality of own-account operations as these developed after19G9.4l9     Finally, we must notice the apparent indifference of the E &amp; AD tot5le failures of the Crown Agents&apos;  internal accounting system.    the published accounts may have lost their relevance through delay, but atleast they were eventually completed and certified.    It is not too muchto say that internal accounts for effective management purposes were^on-existent.    Conditions may have been different in other branches ofthe Crown Agents which we have not examined: our scrutiny of the FinanceDirectorate has shown that in this field, higher management, from the senior Crown Agent down,   felt no need of such accounts,  indeed preferred to be without thorn.    The Crown Agent and his Finance Directorate mustanswer for the consequences in terms of failure to control the financial
Ues in the apparent omission by the E &amp; AD to perform for the CrownAgents the recognised auditor1s function of advising management ofdefects and weaknesses of financial system,  a matter they might also have included in their reports to the Treasury.TKE ROLE OF THE TREASURY420     we have drawn attention above to opportunities that were missed bythe Treasury to use their responsibility for the Crown Agents&apos; accountsto inform themselves and the Ministry about the state of the CrownAgents&apos; own-account finances     We appreciate that the Treasury took theview that it was for the Ministry,  as the Department of State responsiblefor the Crown Agents,  to deal with the latter over the organisation oftheir affairs     Nevertheless we think that the Treasury,  as custodian ofthe public purse, might have been expected to press harder for government action to control the Crown   Agents,  including action to reform their internal management,  and to have been less acquiescent in the policy ofconfining action to the revision of the Crcwn Agents&apos; constitution      Itis ironical to observe that while the Ministry were to the end labouringUnder misapprehensions over the nature and extent of the own-accountbaling, government did not utilise its auditing arm to secure accurate information     Not until Mr Cuckney commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand inOctober 1974 was any accountancy investigation carried out&apos;file ROLE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND421     The Bank of England is the national central bank-    Although not agovernment department it is publicly owned      It possesses the practicals!;iils and contacts enabling it to detect flaws in the financial world*ad to provide assistance in remedying them,    These attributes arePoking in a government department such as the Ministry 01,  indeed,  the^easury     We appreciate that the Bank is independent of government, butlt is government s major contact with the City,  and we think it wouldnot have been unreasonable for the Bank to have played a greater part intftis affair than it did.    It was astute to detect signs of trouble andlts initial warnings were correctly passed to the Treasury     But aftertflat it plaved a minor role      It would have preferred a different type0f inquiry from the one mounted (para 189) and in consequence playedlittle part on the Stevenson Comtnittee&apos;s deliberations, whereas fuller
information from it might well have modified that Committee&apos; s views(paras 218-9).    Thereafter the Dank, although frequently consulted(paras 342, 346,  363) remained on the sidelines  (para 310).

IN CONCLUSION422     The sums granted out of public funds to the Crown Agents willeither be lost to the taxpayer, or if repaid out of the future profits of the Crown Agents will be a clog on their competitive position     Theseunfortunate results flow from (i)  an unwise decision to operate asfinanciers on own-account,   (io)  the folly and euphoria with which someof the operations were conducted,  compounded by lack of expertise andneglect, of accounting systems and professional safeguard controls and(iii) the failure of government to inform itself of the developments, to appreciate the risks and to grasp the need for quick action     against this sombre finding it  is satisfactory to be able to note that no criticismhas been made to us of the Finance Directorate^ handling of principals&apos;Portfolios and that,  judging by their continued success in their traditionalProcurement role;  the Crown Agents    orthodox activities have not suffered from the publicity accorded to the subject matter of our inquiry.4s4     in conclusion we wish to reiterate that we have received complete^-operation from the present staff of the Crown Agents and from theVarious government departments with which we have dealt,    Our researchh*s been conducted with great competence by a team of accountants put a tour disposal by Whinney Murray &amp; Co and led by Mr Michael Taylor-JonesAQA and Mr George Elwes ACA     Mr Taylor-Jones has also been our painstaking6at* efficient Secretary and has earned our especial gratitude by hisindustry and skill ,E S FAYEDMUND C0MPT0NP GODFREYTAYLOR-JONESsecretary10August 1977
ANNEX 3Extract, from the report of the Stevenson Committee
CHAPTER 2ii.....      . iI2.1    The Crown Agents carry on a large and multifarious business includingprocurement, advisory and personnel cervices, fund management, baiiking and   &apos;ancillary investment (3.1 to 3.3)-   They employ over 1 ,700 people, assets cf over ijOOm and they manage principals&apos; investments of over  300m (3-2, 3-1h).   Theirgross earnings (mostly overseas) amount to about  5m in a year (3.2).    The overallresult over the four or five years to 1970/71 is that profits on financialactivities have been used to offset losses on other activities (3.2). \&quot;I2.2    The Crown Agents confine their services almost entirely to overseas *governments and public bodies.   Over 90% of their non-financial business and 70$ of !their financial business derives from independent countries.   The Crown Agents carryon business as agents for their principals overseas; and acting themselves asprincipals they provide services for overseas clients.   An important new clementfover recent years is the growth of activities otherwise than as agents, particularly!:IMl money markets, banking and ancillary investment (3.1; 3-3)- r&apos;i(2.3    The Crown Agents office is not a Government Department and the officials are   jCrown, and not Civil, Servants, although their terms of employment are linked tothose of the home Civil Service (3-6, 3-1b).    The Crown Agents have no formalconstitution nor are they incorporated.   They are individuals appointed by theSecretary of State (3.7).   They are responsible to each principal for thatprincipals business: but there is no collectivity of principals to whom they answer;for the totality of their business including business done otherwise than on an agency basis (3.11). .j Ij2.1;    When the Crown Agents acted mainly on behalf of Dependencies the Secretary ofState for the Colonies exercised close supervision over them.   Such supervisionjstemmed from his appointment of the Crown Agents and his responsibility for theColonies.   Such supervision and direction withered away as the Crown Agents services,&quot;ere increasingly provided to independent countries (3.8). j2.5    By virtue of his appointment of the Crown Agents, the Minister has certain powers of direction over them.   These have not been exercised in modern times.They are not properly applicable anyway to matters within the Crown Agentstanking and agency relationships with independent governments.   There areArrangements for informal consultation between the Crown Agents and the Minister,
^ reCard to natters which the Crown Agents consider likely to be of public or political concern and thus involve the Minister.   Those informal arrangements-arc not wholly satisfactory, and in practice the accountability of the Crown Agent:to the Minister is vague and the Minister&apos;s responsibility to Parliament forthe Crown Agents affairs is similarly indefinite (3-9 to 3-12).2-6    The usual apparatus of governance raid accountability which is found in thePublic - and to a lesser extent in the private-sector is missing.   The CrownACents are unincorporated;- they have no terms of reference such as are prescribed by statutes or other instruments of incorporation; and they have no prescribedlimits for activities or borrowing; they have neither shareholders nor the usualkind of board of directors.   The Minister (and his Department) are not by themselves well placed to make good these deficiencies (3.13).2-?    By reason of their status the Crown Agents at present enjoy Crown immunity from taxation, although they pay SET and the limited companies in which they are^tcrested are liable to corporation taxes etc in the usual way.   The CrownConnection improves their standing with clients overseas and in the UK.   a disadvantage is that in the last resort HMG would probably be liable at least inrespect of liabilities arising out of the Crown Agents activities otherwise thanRs agents, in so far as these could not be met out of the Crown Agents funds.   Kosuch call on Exchequer funds has ever arisen; its avoidance depends on the continuing viability of the Crown Agents and the adequacy of their reserves (3.15 &apos;3.19). .      .^ROCUREMEIT AND ALLIED SERVICES : CHAPTER U2&apos;8    In 1970 procurement orders placed by Crown Agents amounted to over  90m.^e volume of this business has grown moderately over the. past decade; but not as rapidly as UK exports generally, and the proportion of non-UK procurement has riserslenificantly with increasing international competition and the pressure ofPrincipals for purchases in the best market.   Even so the Crown Agents provide^eilities for about \% of UK exports (U.2 to U.6).-^ Overseas earnings of the Crown Agents procurement business (including stamps jatlti currency business) amount to between  2m and  3m a year - a useful contribution&apos;to UK invisible income. But these activities incurred a net loss of  h8U,000 j(general  37h,000, stamps and currency  110,000) in 1970, following similar losses *in 1960 and 1969 (U.7, U.26).  -
2.10 The Crown Agents have a standard list of agency charges for orders of varyingsizes.   The scale of charges is revised at infrequent intervals.   The last review was in 1?68 and another is taking place in 197?.   Infrequency of review of charges in periods when the Grown Agents own costs rise exceptionally fact is a source of difficulty (h.0 to h.10).2.11   The Crown Agents ricks as agent3 in procurement and allied services are limited to claims for gross negligence, against which they have normal insurancecover (h.39). \2.12  V.fe conclude that the Crown Agents arc providing through their agency procure-went work an efficient and valuable service to their principals: they are alsohelpful to UK suppliers and they make a useful contribution to .UK visible andinvisible exports: without them some of the benefits would be jeopardised (J4J1O).2.13   In order to prevent uneconomic expansion of activities and complaints of1unfair trading, we recommend that: these procurement activities should be required   jfully to pay their way, including appropriate contributions to overheads, reserves   \iand UK taxes.    The management may have to make more frequent or more substantial.jincreases in charges, revise charging policy to bring about a closer relationshipjbetween full costs and charges for individual orders, or secure further economies in operation - eg through the contraction of the geographical area of theirprocurement (U.Jj1, lj.li2).IBnginee rin g In s pen hi on and En %in gring -Advisory services .1b   The Crown Agents provide both in the UK and overseas inspection services tor   ;goods whether or not they have procured them.   They provide engineering advisory      jservices sometimes in collaboration and sometimes in competition with the private sector (h.lh to h.2$). j2.15   The gross earnings from these services is growing (over  700,000 in 1970) and!they are clearly valued by principals - especially the inspection services.   Butthey are quite small in relation to the gross overseas earnings of Britishconsultants generally -  30:n to  35m a year.   The services have been run at a net loss (although we understand that the loss in 1971 will be small).   The risks here&amp;re similar to those in the procurement business generally and the Crown Agentshave normal insurance cover (ii.. 1li to l\.2$)*V&apos;c conclude that- there is no sufficient ground for curtailing these services   j&apos;&apos;&apos;hich though small are important to overseas principals especially the smallerDependencies.   As in the case of procurement activities we recommend that: these
cervices should be require;&apos;, fully to pay their way: and in order to preserve theappearance as well a:; the fact of impartiality, they should be formally separatedfron purchasing activities, eg in a separate United company ([4.25).Hillhnnk Technical Services Ltd (MTS)2.17   This 100  subsidiary of the Crown Agents was formed in 1967 with a capital of C1m ( 800,000 uncalled) and is in operational and staff terms closely co-ordinalwith the Crown Agents.    It is a mere banting concern - placing orders as a principalwith suppliers and organising complete packages, which it sells as a principal to     icustomers under a contract designed to earn an overall profit.   The package.&apos;; soorganised are mainly defence equipment but they also include civilian items likeagricultural machinery (u-30 to h.3U).2.16 Turnover which fluctuates greatly from year to year was over  10m in 1 969 and - lim in 1970; it seems likely to grow significantly over the years ahead. It made ja*modest profit ( 30,000) in 1970 (JU.31, U.3U).2.19   jfc conclude that: this company is filling a gap in UK arrangements forcertain exports: the relationship between the Crown Agents on &apos; the Ministry ofDefence is useful to both: mts is substantially protected against risks throughinsurance with the Export Credits Guarantee Department, through cover from MOD in    Irespect of that Departmcnt&apos;3 element in any package,&quot; and through provisions in contracts with suppliers and customers: the Crown Agents are alive to theUndcsirability of shouldering risks in large contracts beyond the cover which they   jcan obtain.   Subject to this point we have no comment on the Crown Agents asscssmcnthat the reserve backing against risks should be of the order of  1m (U.35j Ji.36).Marine Insurance&quot; \. :!2.20  This business, which makes a small profit, is carried on by the Crown Agentspartly as agents and partly otherwise than as agents.   Crown Agents insure only1Goods they procure.   They re-insure 1$% of the risks and hold a special reserveagainst excess claims (U.37, U.30).Personnel services : chapter $ &apos;*2.21   These include recruitment and engagement of expatriates on behalf of overseas governments and public bodies, the arrangement of passages, and the making ofcertain payments such as pensions (5.1).
2.22   This is a substantial business in terms of numbers recruited and of transactions.    Gross earnings amount, to rather less than  700,000 a year; butraggregate losses, after charging a-due proportion of overheads, have been incurred over recent years ( .2). . .iVfo conclude that: in this field the Crown Agents are pcrforning a necessary and valuable function for which they are well fitted and to which there is no obvious satisfactory alternative: there would be advantages in concentrating as rauc:of this work as practicable in a single organisation like the Crown Agents \-(arrangements have already been made for certain transfers of work from 0DA to the fCrown Agents and other&apos;transfers are under consideration): these Crown Agentsactivities could be usefully increased and this should make for economy, efficiency.1and better financial results.   As in the case of procurement activities we recommonthat personnel services should be required fully to pay their way (5-3 to 5-7* ,5.11).FINANCIAL AND DIVESTMENT ACTIVITIES : CHAPTER 62.2lt   In terms of capital employed, and of profits earned, but not of numbers cfstaff, these are the largest activities of the Crown Agents.   Managed funds(including  200m in banldng deposits) amount to over C1,000n.   The banking business:deploys assets of over  liOOm.   The operational links between the financialactivities and the procurement activities are not very close although there is aiwide area of overlap between clients for both.   These financial activities earnsubstantial profits which are used to offset losses incurred on most other CrownAgents activities (6.1, 6.2).Fund Managementi2.25   The aggregate managed funds of about  1,000m consist of over 1,000 separate &apos;funds of varying sizes.    Over 10% of the managed funds come from independent countries and the bulk of the balance comes from Hong Kong.   The funds consist of  jcurrency reserves, general reserves, and special funds (eg pension funds),- of overseas principals.   Over 10% of the invested funds are in British government securities (6.3 to 6.6).   -i.2.26   The funds are managed in accordance with the particular or generalinstructions of the principals, who receive regular reports and copies of theCrovm Agents1 Annual Fteport and Accounts.   The Crown Agents maintain the usualinternal apparatus for fund management including research unit, investmentmanagers etc.   There is also on advisory panel of outsiders but it has very jrestricted terms of reference (6.7 to 6.9). )
?&apos;27 The Crown Agents charges for fund management arc very low, and profitscorrespondingly nodest.   The risks involved are limited to those of professionalnegligence against which Crown Agents have normal insurance covor.   The CrownAgents consider that a general reserve of  1m should be adequate to cover claims   .beyond this.   We accept that this is reasonable (6.10 to 6.13).^ We concludi; that this is on economical service, which gives general satisfaction to the principals, but the performance of the funds might be improved*f Crown Agents were able through suitable salaries- to recruit and retain moreexperienced investment managers (6.12).gjking -&apos;-29 Banking funds of about iJjOOm consist broadly of  200m on current accounts,^100m on deposit accounts and  100in which Crown Agents got from the money market,inking - including income and proceeds from invested banking funds - makes ther;3Jor contribution to the profits of financial activities as a whole (6.15).^30 The Crown Agents banking services are rendered mostly to persons who arePrincipals on the procurement side of the Crown Agents business.   On the bankingthe legal relationship is that of bank to depositor; and the profits orlosses on banking (and ancillary investment) are on the Crown Agents account.   Thiswsition is not altered by the existence of the Joint Consolidated Fund and theMnt Miscellaneous Fund which ore administrative and not iegal entities (6.16,. . &apos; i2.31  The Crown Agents employ their banking funds mainly in the money market; they   j^&quot;0 invest in marketable securities and in advances to companies and overseasThey maintain a liquidity ratio of 2%% of current accounts and they&quot;^ch appropriately 70&quot;&apos; of other maturing liabilities.   The liquidity ratio of% is higher than that prescribed for banking institutions in the UK but reflects^special nature of the Crown Agents banking business.   V7o conclude that thewown Agents liquidity ratios and matching arrangements are reasonably prudential(6-19, 6.20).2 -tReserves and risks. Crown Agents judge that a suitable reserve against losser;Voul(i be about  Urn, being about 20% of their unsecured lending in the money market, j^ ^0 not question this specific judgement but we look at the reserve position as a &apos;vhrjle in Chapter 8 (6.21 to 6.23).
2-33   Sterling balances jvtk[ foroirn currency n^rosiis,   Over the years 1962 to .1971the Crown Agents have held 23% to 2b% of the total sterling reserves of overseas countries and organisations.   At 31 December 70 the amount so held - in the bankingand managed funds - was  71Om.   They also accept foreign deposits for overseasclients (6.2)4 to 6.26).2.3h  We conclude that: the Crown Agents offer very competitive rates of interest-on deposits by clients: their ability to do so derives in part from the aggregationof funds which they utilise profitably and it owes something also to freedom from taxation: with increasingly competitive conditions in the banking world the CrownAgents may have to increase their efforts if they arc to maintain the volume ofprofitable business (6.27, 6.20).Ancillary Investment -2.35  The Crown Agents total investment experience in 1970 was unfortunate.   Oninvestments of some  3^&apos;m, depreciation and losses amounted to about  )4.6m.   Itworld be wrong to attribute tco much weight to results at one particular date; andthere has been a substantial recovery in 1971.   V.&apos;e conclude that the investmentperformance has not been outstandingly good but that over the years the Crown%&apos;nts&apos; management has on the whole been competent and conscientious although lienave come specific criticisms (6.29, 6.1jlj, 6.us).2.36   The Crown Agents invest a fraction of banking funds in &quot;hard-core1 investment:which are not readily realizable.   They have a working rule to limit such investment;to 20% of their deposits and money market borrowing, other than those in JCF andJHF ie the current account business.   This seems to us a sensible enough rule; but   jon occasions they have been operating at or above their self-imposed limit (6.31 to I6.33). . &apos;   ; !207   In July 1971 the Crotm Agents had invested a total of over  him in english and Continental Property Co Ltd (a Crovai Agents sub-subsidiary) and the FirstNational Finance Corporation&quot;Ltd.   A more conservative management might haveWarded such concentration as excessive even although most of the investments wereshort-term and secured.   This position was somewhat corrected by 31 December 71.^ven so we conclude that there was some risk here (6.3k).2 08 English and Continental Property Co Ltd. The biggest single item- among thefrovn Agents investments (shares and loans) has been the investment in their sub-&quot;^sidiary English and Continental Property Co Ltd.   At 31 December 71 E &amp; 0
indebted;jess had increased to fiiom of which Crown Agents were creditors for  13nsecured by a floating charge; there were other loans secured by fixed charges (f,1Qi)jand other borrowings unsecured of  23n.   At the peak the Crown Agents lendings totheir sub-subsidiary amounted to  23m (6.36).i2.39 ViC commissioned -3 rice 1,&apos;atcrhouse and Company to report on the history anddevelopment of E &amp; C and the Crown Agents involvement in it.   Their report will be   fIforwarded to the Minister but we do not think it necessary to delay our Report i.on that account (6.37).        . \2.1(0  Our conclusions are as follows.   This Crown Agents venture grew more quicklysad substantially than originally envisaged.   We do not think that the process of-informal consultation enabled the Minister to be fully seized of this.   We think tliathe Crown Agents took rather too great a share of the risks in relation to therewards; and that at the peak this investment involved an excessive proportion of Crown Agents resources in a single concern.   The size of the Crown Agents stake inE&amp;C has now been substantially reduced.   Although Crown Agents advances weresecured by a floating charge on the assets (professionally valued) they might inthe event of misfortune have found themselves under pressure not to exercise suchlights in front of unsecured lenders to their own subsidiary company (6.30).2.1(1 Assogjatrd companies. The Crown Agents have also invested in and made advance ,to a number of associated companies - some of which have but a slight connection witjjservices to Cro:;n Agents clients. In one or two cases their associates were perhaps&apos;,jhot of a quality and standing which matched that of the Crown Agents. Moreover the fjproliferation of trading and dominant investments tends to create managementproblems and there are in them greater ricks as well as the prospect of greaterrewards (6j4i to6.U3).2.h2   Wc conclude that:, too great a burden for investment policy and majorinvestment decisions has to be shouldered by the Finance Director under present arrangements: and that a normal board, consisting largely of suitable independent(ie non-executive) directors could be of assistance in minimising lapses and losses (6.I16).Concluding CommentaryjOnr general conclusion is that; subject to the withdrawal of taxationPrivileges and to appropriate organisational and status changes, the Crown Agentsfinancial activities as a whole should continue: they offer an economical and
advantageous service to overseas clients: they play a responsible part in theBonoy  market, the gilt-edged market, and in the handling of large sterling balances and sterling investments: disruption could cause damage and loss to theCrov.-n Agents and their clients as veil as to the UK (6.2j7 to 6.53).the dependencies : chapter 7&apos;   / -The Dependencies1 share of the Crown Agents total business is now small -about   8,* of non-financial and ?$-30% of financial business, the bulk of which isfor  Hong Kong.   The Dependencies (other than Hong Kong) can Vie only a minor factor in determining the future shape and functions of the Crown Agents as a whole (7-6).The Crown Agents business is essential to many Dependencies and especially the smaller ones.   This is true of all the services provided by the Crown AgentsVith the possible exception of financial business which could be provided, if   not so cheaply, by   other institutions in the City (7.7 to 7.11).2.^6   V.Te have not had a comprehensive view of the importance the Dependenciesattach to the Crown connection. &apos; We are told that the smaller Dependencies would prefer the continuance of the present relationship but we have heard somedissentient voices.     V,re believe the important thing in the minds of clients isthe quality and price of the services and the ethos of the providing body (7.12).2.JU7   We conclude   that there   should be a duty on any successor body - as on thefrown Agents (7.5) - to provide services to the Dependencies, subject to itsStaining a reasonable proportion of the total business of the Dependency, and^hat&apos;the continuance   of the Crown connection would not be essential for thedischarge of this   duty (7.13).Miscellaneous j chapter 8i$ serves?&apos;J/8   Apart from minor specific reserves the 1970 balance sheet shows major^serves approximately as follows:Investment reserve:  3-hm   -   specificPensions etc reserve:  6.7m   -   specificReserve:  Um      -   general   (8.1 to 8.3)
2,\i9  The investment reserve of  3 Jim was created out of the excess arising onproperty revaluation and was to cover the difference between cost end market valuoat that date.   With the recovery in the Stock Market in 1971 some of this reservehas since become free (6.2). &apos; .2.50  The general reserve at 31 December 70 stood at about fiim as compared with about  1 Jim at 31 December 67.   The increase over the intervening years was due mainly to substantial revaluation of property and similar adjustments.   We areinformed that there were hidden reserves of  lim -  ^m at 31 December 70; theseconsisted, of the excess at that date of the value of owned and occupied premisesover the then balance sheet figure.   On this basis general reserves at31 December 70 amounted in total to  8m -  9m (0,3 to 8.7).2.^1   In the context of our Enquiry Crown Agents estimate of the desirable minimumlevel of general reserves varied between  17m and  20m in all.    The figure and itsdetailed make-up is very much a matter of judgement and we do not quarrel withthese considered estimates which the Crown Agents have put to us (0.8 to 8.11). -v    v . . I2&apos;^2   V.&apos;e conclude that: in the years up to 1970 and at 31 December 70 the \igeneral reserves were substantially below the desirable level: the Crown connection jand Crown status with its implied warranty have helped to offset the insufficiency   ;of reserve strength and have enabled the Crown Agents to enjoy a credit ratingwhich they would not have enjoyed on the strength of their balance sheet positionalone (8.12)./Pension Scheme and Reserve &apos;     . 112.53  A separate account is kept for the pension scheme and its liabilities arerevalued regularly by the Government Actuary.   The assets earmarked to the schemeQre managed by an office committee including staff representatives, chaired bythe Crown Agents (8.114, 8.1 $). . \2.51*   In 1960 the Crown Agents executed a Declaration of Trust whereby the CrownAgents stand possessed of the Office Reserve Fund with discretion to crystallisethe trust by alienating the necessary assets to secure the discharge of pensionlabilities.   A note about the existence of the trust is included in the notes toNte 1970 Crown Agents accounts (8.16).
2.55  V7e conclude that: the present position is unsatisfactory in that the trustextends to the v:hole Office Reserve Fund and this extension might weaken the .confidence of clients in the Crown Agents financial strength: an awkward situation%ht arise if in tine of difficulty the Crown Agents were to crystallise the trusV alienating assets to the pension scheme thus putting them beyond the reach cfOther claimants. &quot;We recommend that the situation of the pension scheme be clarified (8.17).AccountsThere has in 1970 been some consolidation of the Crown Agents accounts and*Uy consolidated accounts are being produced for 1971-   We are impressed by themjuoxity of the various company structures through which the Crown Agents conduc*o*e of their activities.   Wo conclude that: it is desirable that there should be* Single auditor experienced in the commercial and banking sphere for all the main&amp;own Agents activities: and that ^constitution on the lines we recommend wouldfrovide an opportunity for further consolidation of audit and accounts (8.18 to$ kgy LevelsThe Crown Agents activities consist predominantly of business and notMinistration in the governmental sense and top officials an the Crown Agents*ttco bear greater personal.responsibility than counterparts in the Civil ServicePresent responsibilities of&quot;the Director of Finance would in commercial circle***and a salary of perhaps twice as much as his present salary.   We thin!: there i* significant degree&apos;of underpayment in the Finance Directorate which extends down119 far as the investment managers, and this affects the Crcwn Agents ability to**HU and retain suitable staff.   There may be implications here for other top^sts in the organisation (8.21 to 8.2U).The Inland Revenue has hitherto treated the Crown Agents in effect as the0v,*n and thus entitled to Crown immunity from taxation; although limited companie^ m - -&quot;Qlch the Crown Agents have interests are liable to tax in the ordinary way.   Wreceived representations that the tax privileges allowed to the Crown Agents^Ve them an unfair advantage over their private sector competitors.   This applies^particularly to the Crown Agents financial and banking activities which have grown
rapidly over the last few years and arc the main cource of profits,   ^r^opjr;^!on the groundo of taxation principalc and fair competition the crowdy.n ir.munit;from taxation should bo eliminated: this could bo done through the various models-discussed in Chapter 9 (G.25 to 0,27)- glationshi n botr-en Crown .V*onta?

Y delude that these courses are impracticable or undesirable.   Severe contraction   j0* liquidation would be highly disturbing and damaging to the interests of oversea:,Entries and the TJX (9.10 to 9.15).
t2.63  We develop and examine some no-.: model structures, involving differentdegrees of HMG involvement.   We do not doubt that under present arrangements the -    Minister has certain powers of direction over Crown Agents, though they have, for practical reasons not,been exercised in modern times.   In view of the indopendenco   -;ofrcost of the clients, the necessity of observing the integrity of princlpal/agenfc jand banking relationships, and the nature of the business,vwg conclude thatarrangements which minimise -the involvement of IMG and Parliament would be thetooot appropriate (9.17). &apos; j2.6h  V,Te examine in our report four models all of which would incorporate Crown   -i&apos;Agents activities, eliminate Crown immunity, and reduce all or some of the other       J!defects and risks in the present arrangements.   In essence these models arc:Model 1   A Nationalized Corporation (9.19 to 9.2U) jiModel ?.   A private sector body with minority governmental interest(9.25 to 9.3?) 1Model 3   A limited company with HMG (or HMG and Dependencies) as a majorityshareholder and independent countries as minority shareholders(9.36 to 9-)i3)Model h   A limited company with shares owned by HMG (9.hh to 9 .$\). \-.2.6$  \Jc do not seek to summarise all the characteristics of these models but we        1iftoto these points.   Model 1 would have the advantage of clarity but would make HMG   ;.fully responsible for the business and would almost certainly be unacceptable tothe independent countries (9.2U).   Model 2 would remedy all the defects in thepresent situation; but its feasibility would depend entirely on private participaticjwhich seems unlikely (9-3h, 9-35).   Both Models 2 and 3 envisage shareholdingparticipation by overseas countries which we regard as important but may bedifficult to realize (9.29, 9.30, 9-33).   Model I4 would involve HMG more closely thaifiouj it is in effect an informal version of a nationalized body; but it could be use as a stage to Models 3 or 2 (9. 1).Conclusions and recommendations.66   Choice among the models would depend significantly on the results of-consultations with overseas clients of Cro;m Agents and their reactions.   Ourknpressicn is that the Crown connection in the Crown Agents activities is not of       jP^ine importance (9oh)   but this needs to be tested in concrete discussions with     ILII
VCrscas clients.   Another factor.is the need for legislation.   As far as we can&apos; te all models - with the possible exception of Model Ji - would requireRelation (9.55)-   V.Te cannot evaluate these factors at this stage. - V,re would0&quot;ard Model 1 at best as a solution of last resort (?.2lt).   On intrinsic merits- ^ggcpinmond the other models in the following order:Model 2 / &apos;Model 3Model h-/-    Ji U      \ Hi
