JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 98COPY NO21 October 1977CABINETPAY policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer refers in paragraph 5x. and annex A of his paper (CP(77) 96) to the case for some modification of thegeneral limit on the level of settlements for the low paid.2. This case was set out more fully in the paper attached to my minute of 30 September to the Prime Minister which was circulated to my cabinet colleagues.    My proposal is that we should not seek to limit any increase to less than  4 for a normal week.3. This would be more than 10 per cent for die 1.8 million full-timeadult employees currently earning less than  40 for a normal week, up to13 per cent for those earning  30.    29 per cent earn leso than this.More details of the distribution are given in the Annex to this paper.4. If fully taken up, which is unfortunately doubtful, this would of itself add only 0. 1 per cent to the national wage and salary bill additionallyto the current policy.    I do not believe this very modest flexibility for the relatively small numbers of workers at these very low levels would have any significant repercussions.    It is of a quite different order from the  2. 50minimum attached to the 5 per cent Stage 2 limit which benefited the muchmore substantial proportion of the labour force who were then earning lessthan  50 a week, and by far more than 5 per cent.5. Moreover in reality we have very little choice in the matter.    over half those concerned are covered by Wages Councils.    The independent members of the most important Councils have already indicated to me in the strongest terms that they propose to support workers&apos; representatives&apos;claims exceeding 10 per cent for those on these levels of earnings, which they regard as quite consistent with the Governments national earnings objectives.6. Unless I am able to dissuade them from their cause, which is I thinkvery unlikely, the Councils will accordingly confirm statutory orders, whichI have no power to delay or override, in contravention of the government&apos;s policy.    My colleagues have already agreed that in such circumstances there could be no question of applying sanctions to the employers affected.
7. In my judgment the repercussions of such clear breaches would bemore damaging than a well-defined concession on the lines proposed inparagraph 2 above.A BDepartment of Employment21 October 19772
