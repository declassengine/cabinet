DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 11720 December 1977A NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT programme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. This paper argues that it should now be our objective to re-examinewith the Trades Union Congress (TUC) a wide range of policies that go beyond the 12 month rule and pay.    If the Government has to rely on thecontrol of pay as its central policy, it will be consistently weakened in the run-up to the Election.THE background. The Government faces two threats to its support.    One arises from continuing unemployment and public sector pay restraints, the other fromthe risk that the Government may progressively lose its ability to hold the loyalty of the unions and their members without confrontation.3. The greatest weakness facing both the Government and trade union leaders is that now, after two-and-a-half years of wage restraint, cuts in living standards, cuts in public expenditure and high unemployment cannot be quickly reversed.    The prolonged world slump, industrial closures, lack of investment, and continuing cutbacks in public services have combined toremove the credibility of our pledge of a phased return to full employment.Those who have accepted real cuts in living standards are now faced with further wage res&apos;raint, plus long dole queues and public services understrain.    A long slump of this magnitude damages the social fabric and cannot in the end be accepted by trade unions and the Labour movement.PAY PROBLEMS4. The risk of confrontation over pay is growing because our commit-ment last July to &quot;an orderly return to collective bargaining&quot; and a policybased on &quot;good sense and realism&quot; has become transformed into a rigid10 per cent policy in the public sector and an ineffective attempt to usesanctions to prevent higher settlements in the private sector.    As private sector earnings move ahead, workers in the public sector feel that they arebeing discriminated against.    In seeking to hold the line against firemen or1COPY NO    . .81CABINET
other groups in the public sector we are faced with a choice of evils.    If weenforce the ceiling strictly, we do so at the cost of alienating those wholooked to a Labour Government to defend them;  the tactics for winning each10 per cent battle force us to mobilise public opinion against successivegroups of public employees which must embitter those against whom we arein conflict.    But if we seek to win by gentler persuasion, public opinionmay side with the workers concerned, against the Government.5. If we were to slip into a head-on clash with a powerful section ofworkers we could find ourselves saddled with the &quot;Who Governs Britain?&quot;dilemma which brought Heath down.    Since the Labour Government&apos;sstrongest point with the public was - and remains - our claim that we couldwork with the unions and their members, a collapse of that approach would prove to be our downfall and pave the way for electoral defeat and a conservative Government.THE NEED FOR A NEW programme. It must be our prime objective to restore our relationship with theLabour movement by re-examining, with the TUC, a wide range of present policies that go far beyond pay.    The new context for these policies is the run-up to an Election and the opportunities provided for the 1980s by north sea oil.7. The new programme must help us and trade union leaders to resolve the outstanding problems over public sector pay.    It must providereal hope for national recovery.    And it must provide a new orientationtowards international problems so that we can gain acceptance for measureswe need to take.THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT8. We must press extremely hard for constructive and definitiveinternational measures to deal with the slump, if for no other reason than tojustify continuing or new defensive measures that we may have to takeunilaterally if the international context does not improve.    In particular weshould urge:-a. Trade guidelines with an element of restraint on imports from japan, Germany and any other industrial country with a chronicsurplus.b. Acceptance by the European Economic Community that Britain,Italy and the three candidate members have long-term industrialproblems which require special measures.2
c. Large and repeated issues of Special Drawing Rights to easedebt problems until the world recession abates.d. Funds for commodity stabilisation, bringing world prices for food and raw materials to levels which are sustainable in the longterm.THE MAINTENANCE OF LIVING STANDARDS9. To assist living standards, we should pledge to the TUC that we shall continue to use tax measures to help with the short-term pay problem andhold down basic elements in the cost of living by:-a. refusing to accept increase a in food prices under the common agricultural Policy;b. freezing mortgage payments and public sector rents;  andc. freezing fuel prices.10.        In addition to this we should discuss proposals tc resolve the impasseon public sector pay.    One approach would be to offer a fund worth 3 percent of public sector pay (about  700 million) on top of the 10 per cent guide-line, to compensate for the comparative inflexibility of public sector paybargaining.    Another would be to accept indexation for public sector pay ifprices rise about 10 per cent in the current pay round.    A third would be to look again at low pay generally as constituting a special category.A PROGRAMME FOP. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT11.        A National Development Fund should be established into which oilrevenue? would be channelled together with a fixed proportion of pensionfunds and other financial resources - to be underwritten by the Governmenton a financially &quot;no better, no woree&quot; basis.    This fund should beavailable for the following purposes:a. The National Enterprise Board, the Scottish DevelopmentAgency, the Welsh Development Agency and the Industry Act.b. Investment in manufacturing industry by public enterprises.c. Support for small businesses.d. Expanded public service expenditure in health, housing,education and welfare, which will create jobs.3
12.        Major companies should be told that all discretionary government assistance will in future only be available through planning agreements which will become virtually obligatory - as with North Sea ParticipationAgreements which were pushed through without statutory backing.    small businesses should qualify for special assistance on the presentation of plansdiscuseed with and acceptable to their workforce in the form of a joint declaration.    Industrial democracy should be accelerated through planning agreements and joint declarations for smaller businesses.13.        A National Development Commission should be set up to supervise the formulation and execution of policy on the same basis as the EnergyCommission.    A Minister of State should be appointed to co-ordinate thework for each English Region, covering both industrial expansion and public services, as already happens in Scotland and Wales under the DevelopmentAgencie s.14.        These proposals for a National Development Programme should first be discussed with the TUC informally then at the TUC-Labour PartyLiaison Committee and finally published as a White Paper.    This should thenform the basis for future Government policy on industry, public services andemployment.THE CAMPAIGN FOR SUPPORT15.        We have to seek public support on the basis of policies whichmeasure up to the problems which confront the electorate as workers,families and as a nation.     The proposals outlined above therefore includefour essential elements.i. An approach to resolution of the impasse on public sector pay.ii. A continuing programme to assist living standards by taxmeasures and action on basic items in the cost of living.iii. A programme for recovery of industry, public services andemployment.iv. A new orientation to international problems.16.        On the basis of a programme of this kind we could consolidate our relationship with trade unions and campaign with confidence for public support.A W BDepartment of Energy20 December 19774
