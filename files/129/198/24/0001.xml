DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77)114 COPY NO     8112 December 1977CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHITE paper memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In accordance with the Cabinet Conclusions of 20 October(CM(77) 32nd Conclusions), I am circulating herewith a draft of Volume I ofthe Public Expenditure White Paper.    If we can clear the draft at our meeting on 15 December, that will enable us to publish on Thursday12 January, shortly after the House reassembles on 9 January.    I am circulating Volume II separately with the suggestion that it should be clearedin correspondence.2. The main purpose of the White Paper is to present publicly the public expenditure programmes as revised by the decisions we took in October.Account is taken of some later developments, including the new agreementnow concluded with the banks on refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit and estimating changes on social security and agricultural support.    the contingency reserve /igures for 1979-80 and the tw* subsequent years havebeen raised to  1, 500 million,   1, 750 million and  2, 000 million respectively (all figures at 1977 survey prices).3. The section on the economic context (paragraphs 48-59) contains a table of illustrative economic projections on the lines of those given in theChancellor of the Exchequer^ paper discussed at Cabinet in July (CP(77) 70).The text emphasises that the projections are no more than illustrations ofone possible evolution of resource use over the years ahead, on one particular assumption about the growth of total output.4. The draft also includes a table of revenue projections (Table 9).The figures in the table are subject to final checking.    The expenditure committee and others have been pressing for a fuller account of the general economic background to the expenditure plans, and in particular for revenue projections (which were provided in the 1969 White Paper(Cmnd 4234).    We have told the Committee that we will provide revenueprojections.
5. Subject to any further minor revisions or drafting changes which maybe necessary, I invite my colleagues to approve the attached draft ofVolume I of the White Paper for publication.J treasury Chambers12 December 19772

THE GOVERNMENTS EXPENDITURE PLANS,1978-79 TO 1981-82PART 1This White Paper presents the Governments latest plans for public expendi-ture. Volume I gives a general account of the plans and their economic andfiscal context, Volume II details of individual expenditure programmes and supporting material.2. The improvement in the country&apos;s financial situation, to which the cutsin public expenditure plans which preceded last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd 6721)made an important contribution, enables the Government now to plan forresumed and continuing expansion of many programmes financed by public expenditure. Along with other measures to improve the outlook for employment and to bring the growth of output on to its intended path, the Chancellorof the Exchequer announced on 26 October 1977 the Governments decisionto add  1 billionQ to the plans for 1978-79. That decision is reflected in thepresent White Paper.3. Renewed expansion in expenditure plans must be governed by theGovernments broad economic objectives of containing inflation, reducingunemployment and promoting industrial efficiency. In addition, the Govern-ment now aim at a greater degree of stability than has been achieved in recentyears, so that expenditure programmes can be managed with confidence thatthey will not be subjected to the disruption of sudden cuts.4. Both for this reason, and in order to leave room for manoeuvre on tax-ation, it is necessary that the planned growth rate for total public expenditure should be within the prospective growth rate of national income. The present plans are constituted to this end. As always those for the later years areprovisional. The Government want to improve and in many cases expandthe provision of public services, and will do so as circumstances permit; butthey do not intend to set up plans which go beyond what the economy can safely be assumed capable of sustaining.5. The Government intend to maintain and develop the procedures ofexpenditure control, including the new features introduced in recent years,such as the system of cash limits and strict observance of the announced controlfigure for the contingency reserve, and the arrangements for monitoring expendi-ture in the course of the year as described in Cmnd 6721. The latter is animportant management tool which, as experience grows in its use, shouldpromote a closer match between plans and outturn.1 All figures in this White Paper are at 1977 survey prices unless otherwise stated. Theyhave each been rounded to the nearest  1 million and do not therefore necessarily sum tothe totals.
Summary of the plans6. The planning figures for public expenditure until 1981-82 are shown intable 1, together with the Cmnd 6721 planning figures for the current year.The tables at the end of this volume give more details.Public expenditure plansTABLE 1  million at 1977 survey prices	1977-78 as in Cmnd 6721	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82Expenditure on programmes: Central government.........

These corporations do not include the nationalised industries.   A list is given in part 6.7. The figures for the year immediately ahead, 1978-79, are firm plans.These provide the basis of Estimates, cash limits and rate support grant. Thefigures for the succeeding years are increasingly provisional: they will be reviewed in successive annual surveys.8. The planned total of public expenditure programmes and the contingency reserve for 1978-79, adjusted to include the total net borrowing requirement ofthe nationalised industries (see paragraph 9 below), is approximately  1 billionhigher, at 1977 survey prices, than the provisional plans for that year published in Cmnd 6721.9. Public expenditure, as defined in these White Papers, includes financeprovided by the Government to the nationalised industries, whether by loans,public dividend capital or grants. The amount provided by the Government is greatly affected by the net amounts which the industries borrow from, orrepay to, overseas lenders or the market. As the Select Committee on
Expenditure have pointed out, such borrowing, or repayments, can distortthe year-to-year path of government lending to the industries, and hence ofpublic expenditure as a whole: over the next few years the industries are dueto repay substantial amounts borrowed from overseas lenders in the mid-1970s,and to replace this by borrowing from the National Loans Fund. One way ofdiscounting this is to adjust the planned total of programmes and the contingency reserve to include the total net borrowing requirement of the nationalised industries (not just what the Government lends to them). Line 10of table 1 gives figures for the total adjusted in this way.10. This adjusted total rises by about 2\ per cent in 1978-79, compared withthe Cmnd 6721 plans for the current year (1977-78)0. The rate of growth inthe two succeeding years 1979-80 and 1980-81 is of the order of 2 per cent a year. The present figure for 1981-82 is under 1 per cent, but the plans in the later years are increasingly provisional and subject to revision in subsequentsurveys; this applies especially to the final year. The precise figures are:1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82+2.270       -hl.8%       +2.15S       -f-0.8%Expenditure in 1976-7711. At outturn prices, total public expenditure in 1976-77 was  55Jbillion. This was nearly 11 per cent more than the outturn price figure for1975-76, but in volume terms (constant prices) the total of programmesexcluding debt interest was less than in 1975-76, by nearly 3$ per cent. This fallowed much to a reduction in net government lending to nationalised industries,as the industries borrowed heavily in foreign currency. In total public expendi-ture including debt interest the fall was somewhat less than in programmesalone, because payments of debt interest increased. Table 2 gives the figures.12. The outturn of programmes in 1976-77 was less in volume terms thanthe Cmnd 6721 plans for that year, by about 3J per cent, or 12\ billion at 1977survey prices.13. One major difference between plans and outturn was in programme 5,government lending to nationalised industries. This is a particularly difficultprogramme to forecast. The 1976-77 outturn figure of  330 million was notonly much lower than in the previous year (see paragraph 11 above) but alsowell below the 1976-77 provision of  917 million in Cmnd 6721: overseasborrowing by the industries was greater than assumed in Cmnd 6721, which provided only for such overseas borrowing as had already been undertakenwhen the figures were prepared. In addition, both the trading results and thecapital expenditure of the nationalised industries turned out differently fromthe assumptions used in Cmnd 6721.1 The increase compared with the latest estimates for 1977-78 is much greater, but this isnot a valid comparison: the latest estimates for 1977-78 provide for some underspending but no such provision is made in the plans for 1978-79, although under-spending is likely to occur in that year also.  See further paragraphs 21-22.
14. The aggregate outturn in 1976-77 in volume terms on all programmesother than the nationalised industries was about 3 per cent below the planningfigure in Cmnd 6721. In some programmes, notably education, health and social security, the difference was slight, but outturn was below the plan inevery programme. Details are in tables 14 and 16 and in Part 2.15. Many factors contributed to this difference. The more extensive useof cash limits was itself probably one, as many programme managers wereespecially careful to run no risk of exceeding their limits. On the central govern-ment programmes covered by cash limits, expenditure (at outturn prices) wasabout 2 per cent or  600 million below those limits. In volume terms the difference was somewhat greater, since prices rose faster than had been allowed for whenthe cash limits were set. Another factor was that expenditure on new measuresto promote employment turned out less than the original estimate. other factors included over-provision for refinance of export credit, unavoidabledelays in obtaining some defence equipment, and delays in road building as aresult of weather conditions in the second half of the year.16. The volume of local authority current expenditure was marginallybelow that envisaged just before the year began for England and Wales, andmarginally above for Scotland. The overrun expected last autumn, and builtinto the Cmnd 6721 figures, did not occur.Public Expenditure, 1974-75 to 1977-78TABLE 2   million at 1977 survey prices	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78 estimated expenditure on programmes: Central government        .........

Table 2 summarises the estimate of outturn in 1977-78 used in this white Paper, alongside the latest estimates for the past three years. For 1977-78the volume of expenditure on programmes is now put at about 95  per cent
of the Cmnd 6721 provision for programmes and contingency reserve. Inaddition, the expected net outturn of debt interest is significantly below thefigures in Cmnd 6721.18. A considerable part of the difference of 4\ per cent between the outturnfor programmes now expected and the earlier plans is attributable to two majoritems: government lending to nationalised industries, which is again expectedto be substantially lower than planned initially, and refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit, which, partly owing to the new arrangements with the banks, is expected to show net repayments to the government this year. Apartfrom these two items, the outturn is now estimated at over 97 per cent of theCmnd 6721 plans.19. The changes from Cmnd 6721 reflect many causes. For example, loweri interest rates have reduced the scale of housing subsidies, some delay is still being experienced in defence works and procurement programmes and, insome cases, firmer estimates of expenditure in 1976-77 have led to revised estimates for the current year.20. The value of central government expenditure covered by cash limitsin the first half of the financial year was about 3J per cent below what depart-ments had expected at the beginning of the year. For the year as a whole theestimates given in this White Paper reflect the belief of departments that thevolume of their expenditure over the full year will be somewhat nearer the initial plans. For local authority current expenditure the figures now givenare consistent with those available at the time of the negotiation of the rate support grant for 1978-79.21. Some continuing divergence between planning figures and outturn is tobe expected in future years. Any system of control which applies limits to pro-grammes will normally result in out turns being somewhat less than plannedlevels. The likelihood of such shortfall is taken into account in the forecasts forthe economy and the public sector borrowing requirement which inform theGovernments consideration of public expenditure, and hence in the decisions on the planned level of expenditure.(1)22. How completely plans will be achieved in any one year is hard to predict,particularly in the light of recent experience. There is a general tendency toover-estimate the extent to which expenditure can be increased rapidly in the short run. But increasing familiarity with the new control and informationsystems should promote a closer match between estimates and outturn.Expenditure plans, 1978-79 and afterCentral government23. The main services provided by the central government (includingtransfer payments) account for over 70 per cent of total programmes. Figuresfor these services are summarised in table 3.1 An allowance for shortfall is made below in the table 9 projections of expenditure and revenue.
Central government expenditure programmesTABLE 3  million at 1977 survey prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80			estimated		Defence............	6,445	6,361	6,255	6,289	6,494National health service ...	5,981	6,051	6,132	6,255	6,350Social security   .........	12,309	12,717	13,226	14,063	14,174Other expenditure.......	15,545	14,115	12,513	15,053	14,964Total         .........	40,280	39,245	38,126	41,660	41,98224. About 40 per cent of public expenditure by the central government,excluding debt interest, is on goods and services, the largest elements beingdefence and the national health service. The remainder consists of transfer payments including social security benefits, housing subsidies and industrialsupport and net lending, which includes loans to nationalised industries.Nationalised industries25. The table 3 figures for public expenditure by the central governmentinclude provision for government lending to the nationalised industries.Estimates of this lending are shown in table 4, along with estimates of the total net borrowing requirement of the industries, which are included in the adjustedplanning total in table 1. The differences between the two sets of figures reflect the industries&apos; net borrowing from, or repayments to, the market and overseas,and in particular the major programme of foreign currency and market debtrepayments which the industries are expected to make between 1978-79 and1980-81. The precise timing of this programme is uncertain. If repayments weremade sooner than assumed in table 4, that would affect the figures for netgovernment lending, but total net borrowing by the industries would not beaffected to any great extent.Nationalised industries&apos; borrowingTABLE 4  million at 1977 survey prices	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	estimated					Net government lending   ......	330	420	1,350	1,550	1,350	1,100Total net borrowing (other than						short-term)       .........	1,764	950	1,050	950	1,150	85026. The estimates for total net borrowing show the industries&apos; requirements for loans from all sources and for public dividend capital. They depend onassumptions about the level of investment by the industries, their markets,pricing policies and productivity. They may need to be revised further whenthe Government has completed the process of setting financial targets for eachof the industries, and in the light of the current consideration of the problems ofthe British Steel Corporation.
27. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the fall in the industries&apos; overall netborrowing requirement after 1976-77 marks an improvement in the financialposition of most of them. After the deficits caused by price restraint in theearly 1970s most of the industries are now profitable again as a result of the progressive return to economic pricing. They are therefore able to make asubstantial contribution to the financing of their own investment which isexpected to amount to about  3J billion in 1977-78 and in 1978-79. It is partof the Governments medium term expenditure strategy that this improvementin the industries&apos; financial position should be maintained.28. Volume II contains a commentary on each of the nationalised industryprogrammes and presents figures for the industries&apos; capital investment programmes and their financing.Local authorities29. Local authorities are responsible for more than one-quarter of public expenditure. They are responsible for the greater part of expenditure on education (which accounts for more than half of their current expenditure),on housing (which accounts for a similar proportion of their capital spending),and on other environmental services. They employ more than one in ten of theworking population.30. The Government does not have the same direct control over expenditure by local authorities as over its own spending. Part 1 of Cmnd 6721 explained the means of influence open to the Government and the extent to which theGovernments ability to regulate this expenditure within a reasonable marginis dependent on the co-operation of local government. Green Papers on LocalGovernment Finance (Cmnd 6811 and 6813) were published in May 1977following the report of the Layfield Committee. These emphasised the need todevelop, on a partnership basis between central and local government, theduties and responsibilities involved in the provision of local public services.They proposed financial arrangements designed to give a substantial degreeof local autonomy while safeguarding the central governments economicresponsibilities and policy interests. This was intended to provide a satisfactorylong-term basis for ensuring that total local authority expenditure was main-tained at a level which the country can afford. Discussions are continuing withthe local authority associations about these proposals.31. Over the past three years, current expenditure by local authorities hashad to be reined back. A year ago it was still feared that the adjustment was notbeing achieved as quickly as the Government had hoped, and that an absolutereduction in the volume of expenditure might be required in 1978-79. In theevent, a rate of growth which had reached nearly 10 per cent in the one year1974-75 has been succeeded by an increase of only about half that amountover the whole of the following three-year period.32. General recognition of the requirements of the economic situation, andrestrictions on the availability of government finance, have no doubt con-tributed to the speed with which this necessary adjustment has been achieved.But it also illustrates the increasingly close co-operation between central and
local government in the planning and control of public expenditure, throughthe Consultative Councils on Local Government Finance in England andWales and in discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.Public expenditure by local authorities (Great Britain)TABLE 5  million at 1977 survey prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78 estimated	1978-79	1979-80Current expenditure:					Environmental service so   ......	1,382	1,431	1,466	1,445	1,483Law, order and protective services ...	1,321	1,378	1,393	1,416	1,432Education and libraries, science and					arts...............	6,351	6,384	6,438	6,535	6,568Health and personal social services	987	1,012	1,044	1,072	1,096Other programmes.........	1,664	1,541	1,502	1,495	1,513Total       ............	11,705	11,746	11,843	11,962	12,090Capital expenditure    .........	4,815	3,945	3,083	3,282	3,376Total       ............	16,520	15,691	14,926	15,244	15,4671 Programme 8 &quot;other environmental services&quot;33. It is no longer necessary for the total volume of current expenditure tobe cut in 1978-79. After taking account of demographic factors and of the continuing revenue effects of capital projects, there will be little scope for improvements in the level of service provision, and continued restraint in local authority spending plans will be necessary. However, as the figures intable 5 show, the rate support grant settlements for 1978-79 provide for someresumption of growth in the total of current expenditure.34. Similarly, the plans in Cmnd 6721 for the capital expenditure of localauthorities also provided for a reduction in 1978-79 compared with the current year. Now it is possible to look ahead to a small increase. The figures shown intable 5 reflect the special measures to assist the construction industry announced during 1977.35. The Government will be discussing the implications of the plans inthis White Paper for the years after 1978-79 with the local authority associa-tions in the Consultative Councils and the Convention in the normal courseof the next public expenditure survey.36. The definition of local authority current expenditure for White Paperpurposes differs in certain respects from &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; which is theaggregate on which the level of government grants to local authorities is basedeach year following the rate support grant discussions. For 1978-79 the per-centage of aggregate Exchequer grant has been fixed at the same level as for1977-78, that is 61 per cent for England and Wales and 68-  per cent for Scotland.Table 6 shows how relevant expenditure has been financed since 1975-76 asbetween central and local sources of revenue and how the Government expectsit will be financed next year. A reconciliation between local authority current expenditure in public expenditure survey terms and &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; isgiven in Volume II of this White Paper.
Financing of local authority relevant expenditure (Great Britain)TABLE 6  million at outturn prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79			estimated	Total expenditureC1)............	11,230	12,610	13,990	15,120Government grants   ............	7,420	8,260	8,610	9,280Local rates, including rate rebate grants and				changes in local balances.........	3,810	4,350	5,380	5,8401 Includes a small element of expenditure met from rates which is not relevant for grantpurposes.Contingency reserve37. The planning totals for the years ahead include substantial contingencyreserves to cover unforeseen items and items which cannot be properly quantifiedat this stage. The scale of provision is shown in table I, line 6. The size of the contingency reserve for the later years is reviewed along with the spendingprogrammes in each successive annual survey.38. As explained in Cmnd 6721, any addition to a programme decided upon during the year is charged against the contingency reserve if it cannotbe offset by an appropriate saving in the programme concerned or other programmes. The arrangements for approving claims on the contingency reserve, and for monitoring these claims, form an important part of theGovernments procedures for control of public expenditure.Debt interest39. The figures for total public expenditure shown in table 1 include debt interest, but debt interest payments are not included in the planning totals dis-cussed in paragraphs 7-10 above. In Cmnd 6721 a new concept of debt interest payments was introduced, including only those payments which have to be financed from taxation or further government borrowing. Payments met frominterest receipts on money lent, or for which provision is made from tradingsurpluses or rents, are excluded.40. On this basis the estimate for 1977-78 is  1,850 million comparedwith the 1976-77 figure of  1,700 million (both at 1977 survey prices). Theestimates for this year and next are substantially below those in Cmnd 6721,which were  2,650 million and   million respectively, on a comparablebasis. The reductions are due mainly to lower borrowing and interest ratesthan were assumed when the Cmnd 6721 estimates were made. Volume II ofthis White Paper gives a fuller explanation.Analysis by economic category41. Tables 10 and 12 show that the economic analysis of public expenditure is not expected to change much over the planning period. Current expenditureon goods and services, which now accounts for nearly half the total, continuesto rise slowly.
42. Public expenditure on fixed investment increases over the planningperiod but remains relatively low compared with the years up to 1975-76.Most of it is construction work, and the extra spending on constructionannounced during 1977 means that a steady level of direct public spending onconstruction in the next four years is now planned, at rather over  4$ billiona year. In addition, government grants and lending help to finance otherconstruction work, for example by the nationalised industries and housing associations. If construction expenditure by those bodies is included, the totalplanned level of public spending on construction rises to some  6$ billion in1978-79 and some  6f billion in 1981-82. Fuller details are being publishedseparately and will appear in the next issue of &quot;Housing and ConstructionStatistics&quot;.43. Transfer payments increase in total over the planning period, withsome changes in composition. Payments to individuals, notably of pensionsand other social security benefits, continue to rise, while subsidies tend to fall.There are marked changes in net lending, including the increased governmentlending to nationalised industries and the reduced government refinancing offixed rate export and shipbuilding credit mentioned earlier.Public expenditure and gross domestic product (GDP)44. In the first half of this decade public expenditure continued to grow atmuch the same rate as in the previous decade, while national disposable incomegrew very little, partly because of the slow growth in output and partly becauseof the deterioration in the terms of trade. The ratio of total public expenditure to GDPC) increased from 38 per cent in 1971-72 to 46$ per cent in 1975-76,and fell to 44$ per cent in 1976-77.45. This ratio is not a wholly satisfactory indicator of the importance ofthe public sector in the economy as a whole. Total public expenditure includestransfers and loans to the private sector, which require government taxation orborrowing but finance private, not public, consumption and investment.Moreover, the total is affected by changes in the extent to which the national-ised industries rely on the Government to meet their external financing needs.46. For some purposes a more useful ratio is that for general government^)expenditure on goods and services. This ratio rose from 22$ per cent of GDP in1971-72 to 27 per cent in 1975-76, and fell to 26 per cent in 1976-77. On eitherbasis there was a sharp increase up to 1975-76 followed by some fall last year.Table 7 gives a run of figures.1 To calculate these ratios total public expenditure is taken at current prices (or, for future years, in cost terms) and increased by an estimate of the value of government capitalassets consumed during the year to make the figures comparable with the figures of GDP. Thelatter are measured at market prices (inclusive of indirect taxes and net subsidies) because this is the valuation basis of the public expenditure figures. The provision for capital con-sumption was included in the figures for government consumption and GDP this year for thefirst time in place of the former concept of notional or imputed rent on buildings owned and occupied by the Government.a Central government and local authorities.

On present expenditure plans and the illustrative assumptions on GDPgrowth made in paragraph 6, the ratios would tend downwards over the planningperiod-especially the general government goods and services ratio. Thegrowth of transfer payments in the total is likely to keep the ratio of total public expenditure to GDP well above what it was in the early 1970s.The economic context48. In all industrialised countries the period since the oil price increases in late 1973 has been marked by high levels of unemployment and by rates of inflation which have remained high by previous standards. The persistence of inflation and, in many cases, the external financing problems created by the oilproducers&apos; surpluses have inhibited actions by governments to stimulate activity.Except in the United States, recovery from the recession has been hesitant andinsufficient to stem the tide of rising unemployment. World trade has beendepressed.49. In spite of this, considerable progress was made in 1977 in carrying through the adaptation of the UK economy, and in particular in removing thefinancial imbalances that had proved so disruptive in 1976. The current accountof the balance of payments moved into surplus, helped by the increasing flow of North Sea oil and an improvement in the terms of trade but also by a strongrise in the volume of exports. The rate of inflation decelerated. Confidencereturned to the financial markets and was reflected both in lower interest ratesand the strength of sterling.50. In contrast to the financial indicators the real economy was sluggish.It became both feasible and desirable to give a stimulus to activity. In october the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced measures estimated to raise therate of growth by about 1 per cent in 1978, to 31 per cent. He emphasised thatattainment of this faster growth rate would depend on an average earningsrise in the current pay round consistent with the Government^ guidelines,that is, not more than 10 per cent. Any faster rise in earnings would reducegrowth by its adverse effects on confidence, interest rates and competitiveness.51. The uncertainty over the future rate of inflation poses the major questionmark over the medium-term prospects for the economy. A second uncertainty,partly linked with inflation, concerns the growth of productivity, and hence of
the economy&apos;s productive potential. Over the 25 years or so up to the beginningof the recent recession the trend rate of growth of gross domestic product was2f per cent a year. Over the past four years output has been virtually flat, andthere has been almost no growth in recorded productivity. It is impossible tosay how much of this absence of growth of productivity is cyclical and so will be made good as output recovers and how much it reflects a downwardshift in the underlying growth of productivity. There are some grounds forthinking that the large changes in energy prices in 1973 and the low levels of investment in recent years may affect the future growth of productivity. Thisis an uncertain assumption, but, even allowing for the faster growth of labour supply and the contribution made by the rising output of North Sea oil, in thelight of the available evidence it would be imprudent to count on a faster growth of productive potential than 3 per cent a year.52. The economy, however, has excess capacity, which should permit for aperiod a rate of growth above that of productive potential. The extent of thisslack, and the pace at which it can be taken up, are not easy to determine. Theunemployed capacity both labour and plant is unevenly distributed, andthere are physical constraints on the pace at which manufacturing output cangrow without leading to over-heating in some sectors and a sharp worsening ofthe trade balance. It is essential to aim at a rate of growth that can be sustainedover a number of years.53. That rate of growth will be largely determined by developments in threeareas inflation, productivity and the growth of the world economy. On the last of these, concerted efforts are needed to raise demand and bring down unemploy-ment in the industrialised countries; but the persisting problems of inflation andthe OPEC surplus make it unlikely that action taken in the near future willbe sufficient to return world trade to the growth rate seen on average in the decade before the oil price rise.54. In this situation it is more than ever important for British industry toimprove its competitiveness both by containing costs and by raising productivity.Only in this way can both high employment and an external current accountsurplus sufficient for our needs be achieved.55. Provided inflation is contained and there is some recovery in world trade, the economy should be able to grow at above its past trend rate. Buton present prospects a marked improvement in industrial performance wouldbe necessary to sustain a growth rate above 31 per cent over the next few years.The aim must be to achieve such an improvement; but it cannot be assumed in advance as a basis for planning public expenditure. A growth rate of 31 percent would be better than has been achieved on average since the war. But withthe current degree of unemployment and the bonus of North Sea oil it would bedisappointing if this were the limit. It should bring down unemployment, butthe reduction would be gradual. Even growth of 31 per cent, however, cannotbe taken for granted unless inflation is controlled.56. Table 8 provides an illustrative projection of a pattern of demand thatmight be associated with a growth of 3  per cent in GDP and a growth of
about 2 per cent in the volume of public expenditure on goods and services.Table 8 sets this out in a rather longer perspective, covering the decade beforethe oil price rise and the years of recession and adjustment after it. The changesshown for 1977-82 are not forecasts: they are simply intended to illustrate one possible pattern of expenditure that would be consistent with the assumedgrowth of output.Gross domestic output and expenditure table 8 (average annual % changes at 1970 prices)	1964-73	1973-77	1977-82	1973-82Consumers&apos; expenditure^)   .........

Table 8 brings out the contrast between the trends in the years before1973 and developments in the past four years. Between 1973 and 1977 there wasno change in output and real national disposable income fell by 2&quot;3 per cent,reflecting the adverse movement in the terms of trade. Whereas public and personal consumption had been growing more or less in line in the earlier period,they diverged after 1973: personal consumption actually fell between 1973 and1977 while public authorities consumption rose at an average annual rate of2-J per cent. The fall in real take-home pay was even sharper than the fall in consumption, which was moderated by substantial increases in social security benefits. Total public expenditure, in cost terms, rose at an average rate of00 per cent a year between 1973-74 and 1977-78. Investment, public and private,fell during the period. But there was a substantial improvement in the balance ofpayments from a current account deficit of almost  1 billion in 1973 (and 3-5 billion in 1974) to a surplus in 1977.58. Along with a satisfactory balance of payments, the first claim on higher output must be investment. A rise in the proportion of national incomedevoted to industrial investment is essential both for underpinning the faster growth rate assumed and more generally for increasing industrial efficiency and providing more employment.59. After meeting these needs for industrial investment a 3$ per centgrowth of output would provide more resources for public and private con-sumption and other investment than has been available in the past. On theillustrative projections above, a growth of 2 per cent a year in public expenditureon goods and services and the rise in transfer payments in the public expenditureplans would permit personal consumption to grow by around 3f per cent ayear. This would be considerably above the past trend, but would still leave
the average increase in personal consumption in the years 1973-82 at under  per cent, compared with an average increase in public authorities&apos; consumptionof 2\ per cent over the same period.Revenue projections and general government balance60. Table 9 gives projections of the revenue and expenditure, and of thefinancial balance and borrowing requirement, of general government for thefirst three years of the survey period. The projections relate to the borrowing requirement of general government (ie central and local government) ratherthan the more familiar concept of the public sector borrowing requirement,which also includes borrowing by nationalised industries and other public corporations from sources outside government. The definition of public expenditure in these White Papers is now close to that of general government expenditure. The figures in the table are on the basis used by the central statistical Office for general government receipts and expenditure, as published in &quot;Financial Statistics&quot;.General Government accountTABLE 9   billion at 1976-77 prices	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80Receipts 1 Taxes on income and expenditure...... 2 Capital taxes        ...      ...      ...... 3 National insurance contributions^) 4 Other receipts       ............ 5 Interest receipts     ............	36-8 0-9 8-8 3-1 2-4	36-2 0-8 8-4 2-9 2-6	38-2 0-7 80 30 2-6	40-4 0-7 8-3 30 2-4Total receipts      ............	520	50-9	52-5	54-8Expenditure				1 Expenditure on goods and services 2 Grants and subsidies(2)     ......... 3 Contingency reserve        ......... 4 Shortfall(3)............... 5 Interest payments............	32-5 19-3 5-7	30-2 19-5 5-8	30-4 20-9 0-7 -10 5-9	31-3 20-9 1-4 -10 5-6Total expenditure............	57-5	55-5	56-9	58-5Financial balance       ............	-5-5	-4-6	-4-4	-3-net lending and miscellaneous capital receipts, etc    ..................	-1.8	-0-9	-10	-1-general government borrowing requirement^)	-7-3	-5-5	-5-4	-4-31 Includes national health service and redundancy and maternity fund contributions.2 Includes increase in book value of stocks.3 See paragraph 63.4 Minus sign indicates a borrowing requirement.61. The projections for 1977-78 and 1978-79 are consistent with the fore-casts for the public sector borrowing requirement published on 26 October.For 1979-80, they are based on the assumption that GDP will continue to
grow at 3J per cent and that private sector expenditure will be sufficient toproduce a level of demand consistent with that growth rate. The figures for1979-80 are thus not forecasts, but illustrations of what might be consistent with one assumption concerning the growth of GDP.62. The figures of revenue for 1977-78 and 1978-79 are based on theexisting tax rates and the levels of personal allowances announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 26 October 1977. The projections for 1979-80assume existing tax rates and an increase in personal allowances in line with the forecast rise in retail prices during 1978, following the provisions of the 1977Finance Act.63. The figures for public expenditure are based on current programmes,but a number of adjustments have been necessary to make the series consistent with the national accounts concepts used by the CSO. As the table shows thebalance of receipts and expenditure, it is necessary also to make some allowance for the likelihood that, for the reasons explained in paragraphs 21-22 above,the outturn of expenditure programmes as a whole will fall somewhat belowthe planned level. Past experience shows that this kind of underspending variesconsiderably and cannot be closely predicted for any particular year. For1977-78, the expenditure figures in this White Paper have already been reviseddownwards on this account. For 1978-79 and 1979-80, the allowancerepresents only a very broad judgment about the possible outcome, havingregard to the experience of the previous two years, but assuming some improve-ment in the match between outturn and plans as a result of greater familiaritywith the new control and monitoring systems.64. As with the forecast published on 26 October the projections assumegrowth of average earnings at 10 per cent a year and an effective exchange rateindex of 62 . Both expenditure and revenue are expressed at 1976-77 prices.65. Forecasts of borrowing requirements are subject to a wide margin of error. The borrowing requirement is the difference between two large flows,and proportionately small changes in either can be large in relation to the borrowing requirement itself.66. The projections show total tax revenue (at 1976-77 prices) decliningin the current year, reflecting the changes in tax rates and allowances during1977, but thereafter increasing faster than GDP. An important element in thisrise is the growing volume of tax and royalty revenues arising from North Seaoil. These account for approximately  1-4 billion of the  4-1 billion projectedrise in tax revenue between 1977-78 and 1979-80. The fall in the real valueof social security contributions between 1976-77 and 1977-78 is largelyaccounted for by the movement of real earnings. For future years it has been assumed that the annual receipts and outgoings of the National insurance fund are roughly in balance.
67. Total general government receipts are projected to rise by about per cent between 1977-78 and 1979-80, and total expenditure by 5 per cent.Thus, at unchanged tax rates, the general government borrowing require-ment, at 1976-77 prices, is projected to fall through the period from about 5-5 billion in 1977-78 to about  4-5 billion in 1979-80.Conclusion68. An overall growth of public expenditure along the lines detailed inthis White Paper should permit a sustained improvement in standards, whileallowing at the same time a substantial growth in personal consumption afterfour years of no growth. The illustrative figure of 3  per cent annual growth of gross domestic product used in the projections above is, it must be emphasised,not a prediction. If industrial performance improves it should be possible to sustain a faster growth than this. But, equally, a growth of 3  per cent cannotbe counted upon if inflation is not contained. There is now, thanks to north sea oil and the adjustments carried out to the economy in the past year, anopportunity to move to a higher rate of growth than has been achieved formany years. But it is only an opportunity. To make it a reality is the majortask now facing government, management and unions, and the nation as awhole.

The changesfor these years in this White Paper need to be read with this in mind.8 Increased expenditure on market regulation under the common agricultural policy, partly offset by reductions in net e.c. contributions.3 Includes employment package announced on 3 March.1 Excludes refinancing of home shipbuilding lending and fixed rate export credits for which comparableestimates were not published in Cmnd 6721.6 No comparable estimates published in Cmnd 6721.* These changes are mainly due to changed forecasts of the need for housing subsidy (see part 2, chapter 7,paragraph 5).7 See footnote a to table 14.
