CONFIDENTIAL ,3^^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 112 COPY no 6 December 1977CABINET81PAY OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRY BOARD MEMBERSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. At last Thursday&apos;s meeting (CM(77) 38th Conclusions) I was askedto report on a scheme to pay a 5 per cent increase to board members andconsequentials, either on the kitty principle, or as a flat rate, with a few exceptions of up to 10 per cent to deal with cases of particular hardship.I have not been able in the time available to make a thorough examinationof hard cases with colleagues, though the bids we have received are listedat Annex B.2. Annex A analyses the various arrangements which could be adopted to give effect to a general b per cent increase on the lines we discussed.There are no obvious special factors other than pay levels which wouldprovide a consistent and generally acceptable means for distributing theincrease.    Of the various options I would myself favour that described inparagraphs 4 and 5 of the Annex, preferably using the  13, 000 level todetermine who should have the higher increases.3. But before we finally decide upon the increases to be given, I think we should pause to consider other aspects of the matter.    Since the increases would not be in respect of a pre-policy commitment under the 1.1. 75recommendations (Top Salaries Review Body, sixth report (TSRB 6)), orconstitute an interim payment with the balance to be made later, it must clearly be regarded as the Round 3 settlement for board members andconsequentiale which establishes their pay levels for the following 12 months.4. It would be possible to relate payment to TSRB 6 and to make it on1 January 1978.    The 1.4.78 recommendations for board members(TSRB 10) would then remain to be considered for a settlement date at least9 months later.    This would leave board members with an increased feeling of injustice if the Government&apos;s decision was confined to them alone and wasnot presented as part of a coherent policy for the Review Body groups as awhole.1
5. Moreover a decision to implement 5 per cent in January ar, aRound 3 settlement would be seen by the TSRB as in effect the rejection oftheir 1974 recommendations without any prospect that their April 1978rec. vnmendations will be treated differently.    They might well resign inconsequence.    This in turn would threaten the existence of the other twoReview Bodies (covering the Armed Forces and Doctors and Dentists).6. More generally, our decision would be seen as an act of explicitdiscrimination against the public sector - directed moreover against thegroup which has the best claim for preferential treatment.    It would beassumed that the other TSRB groups would be similarly treated, and theCivil Service unions and the Doctors would be likely to see this as the writingon the well for them.7. Many of these difficulties could be avoided by awaiting TSRB 10.This would mean that nothing could be done before April for board members.But once TSRB 10 comes out we shall be able to consider board membersat the same time as other TSRB groups;  and the TSRB report along withthe other Review Body reports.    Individual Round 3 settlements could thenbe developed consistently with one another.    I think this course should be seriously considered.    If on reflection we adopt it, an early announcementwill be necessary.8. Any decision not to allow TSRB 6 to be treated as a pre-policycommitment makes it difficult to do anything on pensions.    If we maintain that increases should be restricted to 5 per cent in Round 3, whether werelate these to TSRB 6 or TSRB 10, we cannot credibly maintain that thereis any intention of implementing TSRB 6.    Retrospective promulgation ofthe full recommended rates would then be difficult to square with InlandRevenue1 s rules.    It is therefore difficult not to conclude thet any deviceto protect pensions is basically inconsistent with our decision on salaries and that there is no acceptable way of providing protection.PCivil Service Department6 December 19772
CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX AWAYS OF DISTRIBUTING AN OVERALL 5 PER CENT PAY INCREASEEQUAL CASH increase.     This would achieve a bias in percentage terms towards thelower paid members of the Group.   But it would also cause severecompression of both relativities between boards and internaldifferentials within boards.   The percentage increases at the lowest salaries would be close to 10 per cent, but those at thehigher salaries would be very low.The approximate cash increase would be  550.    The percentage increases would range from about 9 per cent at the bottom to 2 percent at the top, with an average of 5 per cent.PROPORTIONAL INCREASES ON EXISTING OR RECOMMENDED RATES3.     Proportional increases within the overall 5 per cent pay billfigure would in cash terms favour the higher paid:i. A 5 per cent flat rate increase would produce cashincreases ranging from  300 at the bottom to  1,500 at the top.    It would preserve existing relativities anddifferentials. -ii. Increases based on a proportion of the TSRBrecommended increases (ie;    approximately ^th of these) wouldreflect relativities within the existing structure.    Thepercentage increases range from 1$ per cent to 16 per cent.The cash increases would range from about  150 at the bottomto  2,750 at the top.iii. Increases within a 5 per cent kitty distributed to achieve the highest common proportion of the TSRB recommendedrates (approximately 81 per cent of these) would reflect therelativities of the recommended structure, but the actual-
percentage increases would range as high as about 39 percent at the top, and there would be some cases where currentsalaries are already more than 81 per cent of thoserecommended.FLAT RATE OF 5 PER CENT WITH EXCEPTIONAL ADDITIONS UP TO10 PER CENT FOR HARD CASES4.     This solution would go beyond an overall 5 per cent increase.The problem would be to define the hard cases.    When TSRB6increases were postponed an exercise was conducted to establishwhether some lower paid individuals might be allowed&apos; through.This exercise showed that it was not possible to discern anyspecial features which would justify special treatment but whichwould not involve repercussions on others within the group.   the list at Annex B shows the current departmental bids.    There is no clear criteria other than salary level.    This solution wouldrequire the fixing of arbitrary limits below which higherpercentage increases would be allowed.    For example, if a 10 percent increase were allowed to those at or below  6,000, thiswould raise the average percentage increase to 5.02 per cent;   at 8,000 the figure would be 5.4 per cent;   at  10,000 it would be5.8 per cent and at  13,000 (the limit to which TSRB6 was paidin full to other groups) it would be 7 per cent.5.     There are considerable advantages in this system.    It wouldbe relatively easy to administer and it follows current practiceof dealing with pay in percentage rather than cash terms.    Itwould be especially advantageous if the salary point for the10 per cent increase were to be fixed at  13,000 as this was thelevel to which the &quot;TSRB 6 recommendations were allowed in fullfor other groups.    The disadvantages are that increases might haveCONFIDENTIAL
to be tapered at the change over point to avoid anomalies, andthat the arbitrary nature of the dividing line could lead to substantial distortion in relativities within and between boardsat this point,MIXED CASH AND PERCENTAGE INCREASE6.     The basis here would be a fixed cash amount plus a percentage increase which would produce a 5 per cent increase at the meansalary for the group.    This cash and percentage increase wouldthen be applied at all salary levels.    This would provide a balance in individual percentage increases in favour of the lowerpaid in the group.   The percentage increases would then be lessfor the higher rates and more for the lower rates, but theactual cash increases would of course rise with salary.7.     The mean salary would be determined so as to ensure thatthe overall increase in the pay bill was at the accepted figure.This could be 5 per cent, or it could be higher if the positionin paragraph 4 above was to be reflected, ie that the overallincrease including hard cases should be more than 5 per cent.The balance of advantage to higher and lower paid groups would bedetermined by the proportion of cash to percentage increase.   Butas an illustrative example, if the mean salary was approximately 11,000 a cash sum of  275 plus 2-j? per cent of salary would give 550 - a 5 per cent increase.   At  30,000 the increase would be 1,025 - a 3.4 per cent increase, whereas at  6,000 it would be 425 - a 7 per cent increase.    A 10 per cent increase would occurwell below the salary of any member of the group.This system would have the advantage that once the cashand percentage increases are determined they will operate evenlyovt    the salary range.   There is no sharp change point.   As with
the arbitrary level below which higher percentage increases would be allowed (paragraph 4) this system would provide higherpercentage increases for the lower paid in the range, but itwould do so within rather than in addition to the agreed overallpercentage increase.    In neither case would the higher increasesbe specifically related to &quot;hard&quot; cases.   The most serious disadvantage is that it introduces the concept of cash paymentsinto a policy designed to provide for percentage adjustments.
