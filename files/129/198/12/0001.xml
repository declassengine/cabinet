DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 1027 November 1977CABINETCROWN AGENTS: THE FAY report memorandum by the Lord chancellor. The Committee under Judge E S Fay which was appointed in April 1975to enquire into the causes of the financial problems of Crown Agents has now reported.    (A summary has been circulated with CP(77) 101).    A group ofMinisters under my chairmanship has considered the Government&apos;s reaction to the Report.2 . The Fay Report is a thorough and well-balanced study which revealsa deplorable state of affairs in the past.    Their main criticism is directed at the investment operations undertaken on their own account by the CrownAgents but there are also criticisms of Government Departments, theExchequer and Audit Department and the Bank of England.PUBLICATION OF THE FAY REPORT AND THE GOVERNMENTS REPLY3. Publication of the Fay Report to which the Government are committedwill attract much publicity and criticism of Government under both Labourand Conservative Administrations, although the main responsibility forinaction must rest with the latter.    We think it is essential that a white paper giving the Government&apos;s comments on the Fay Report should bepublished at the same time as the Report itself.    A draft is annexed.    Itstates unequivocally that the Government accept the conclusions of the FayCommittee (paragraph 1) and then deals with the steps which have alreadybeen taken to reorganise the Crown Agents (paragraphs 5 to 10 and 21) to define clearly their relationship with the Minister (paragraphs 16 to 19 and22) and to disengage them from their property and secondary bankingactivities (paragraphs 20, 23, 25 and 26).STEVENSON report.        It is proposed to publish as an Annex to the White Paper the Reportin April 1972 of a Committee under Sir Matthew Stevenson which examined the status, functions and financial operations of the Crown Agents.    (Asummary has been circulated with CP(77) 101).    The then Minister1COPY NO81
(Mr Richard Wood) told the House of Commons on 8 November 1971 thatit would not be appropriate to publish the Report of the Committee sincemost of the work of the Crown Agents was for independent Governments.It is possible that some witnesses may have had this statement in mind in giving their evidence.    However with minor editing which has now been done the Report can be published without prejudice to the principals of the CrownAgents and without risk of breach of confidence.    The Fay Report quotesfrom it at length and comments that an edited version could have been published with beneficial results.    The Chairman and two of the three other members of the Stevenson Committee have said that Ihey think thatthe references to it in Fay make it desirable to publish the StevensonReport.    Mr Richard Wood has been consulted and considers that it is right in the circumstances to publish.ACTION AGAINST CULPABLE INDIVIDUALS5. Criminal proceedings have been started against two of the peopleinvolved in the Crown Agents affair - Mr Bernard Wheatley, the formersterling money market manager of Crown Agents who has since died andMr Sidney Finley, a financier whose companies had dealings with CrownAgents.    Civil proceedings for recovery of moneys are being taken in three cases and the possibility of taking them in other cases is under examination.    In addition the Ministerial group thought that there shouldbe an enquiry by an independent Committee with the terms of reference inparagraph 14 of the draft White Paper to establish the gravity of any neglectof duty by people in the public services and to assist those concerned in deciding whether disciplinary action should be taken.    The ministerial group thought that this enquiry should cover the Bank of England and theExchequer and Audit Department as well as the Crown Agents and government Departments:  for this it will be necessary to secure theco-operation of the Governor and before the enquiry is announced it willalso be advisable to consult the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committeeand the Comptroller and Auditor General.    This procedure would follow the precedents of Crichel Down in which Sir Andrew Clark&apos;s Inquiry(Cmnd 9176) was followed by the Woods Committee Report (Cmnd 9220,July 1954) and the Bossard case, in which the Security Commission&apos;s report was followed by the Wilson Smith Inquiry (Cmnd 2773, September 1965).It is quite likely that this enquiry will result in little or no disciplinary action becaune those who appear most culpable have left the public serviceand their pensions cannot be forfeited or abated unless they are convicted of a criminal offence in connection with their job.    While a minority of usthought that in the circumstances the setting up of a disciplinary committeewould be futile, the majority felt that public opinion would not be reassuredif no further inquiry were conducted.2
LEGISLATION ON CROWN AGENTS6. At their meeting on 11 October (CM(&apos;?7) 30th Conclusions, Minute 1)Cabinet asked the Ministerial group to consider the degree of urgency whichshould be attached to legislation to give the Crown Agents corporate legalstatus.    The group took the view that with the action already taken to reorganise the Crown Agents and to define their relations with theGovernment, legislation was not essential immediately for constitutionalor administrative reasons.    Parliament could probably be satisfied thatthe necessary remedial action had been taken and the Crown Agents&apos; housealready put in order.    Further consideration might however have to begiven to the timing of legislation in the light of Parliamentary and public reaction to the Fay Report.CONCLUSIONS7. I invite the Cabinet -1. To agree to -a. publication of the annexed White Paper at the sametime as the Fay Report is published;b. publication of the Stevenson Report as an annex tothe White Paper;c. the establishment of an external enquiry into theextent of neglect of duty on the part of individuals in thepublic services.2. To take note that the Ministerial group considered that immediate legislation to give the Crown Agents corporate legalstatus was not essential but that this question might have to bere considered in the light of Parliamentary and public reactions to the Fay Report.E-lord Chancellor&apos;s office November 19773
CROWN AGENTS: FAY REPORTDraft White PaperIntroduction1.     The Report of the Committee of Inquiry on the CrownAgents is being published today as..........    It is published in full.    The Government and the Crown Agentsaccept the Report as a fair and searching investigation into the facts; and accept the Report&apos;s conclusion thatthere were serious shortcomings on the part of the CrownAgents and that Departments and other outside agenciescontributed to the failure to prevent losses.    The Ministerfor Overseas Development, to whom the Report is addressed,has conveyed her thanks to Judge E.S. Fay, Q.C., SirEdmund Compton, G.C.B., K.B.E., and Mr. P. Godfrey, F.C.A.,for their thorough and exhaustive work on a most difficult and complex subject.2.     The terms of reference of the Committee of Inquiry,which was appointed on 23 April &apos;1975, were:-To enquire into the circumstances which led to theCrown Agents requesting financial assistance fromthe Government.It will be recalled that in December 1974 the CrownAgents received from the Government a recoverable grantof  85 million.   However, the Committee was not specificallyasked to consider those aspects which bear directly uponthe exercise of proper control over public bodies, althoughits Report touches upon some of these.3.     The Government therefore wishes to provide certain additional information, and believes it will be of
assistance to Parliament to set out in sequence theParliamentary consideration of these matters.    This is done in Annex I which contains all the major Ministerialstatements about the Crown Agents since November 1971.The Government also wishes to state its policy in relationto the Crown Agents, and to reaffirm its confidence in,and support for the present Board of the Crown agents and for their work.4.     In view of the relevance of the report of theStevenson Committee to the history of subsequent events,the Government has decided that it also should now bepublished.    It is printed in a separate volume (Houseof Commons return Number 000) as Annex V.The Future of the Crown Agents5.     Before making its comments on the clear failuresof the past, the Government wishes to place on recordits view of the future of the Crown Agents.    The FayReport explores and elucidates a phase in the conduct ofthe Crown Agents&apos; affairs which ended, and ended decisively,three years ago.    It is, in effect, an essential accountof conduct and events which are now a question of historicalconcern rather than present anxieties, although their financial consequences are still with us.6.     The Crown Agents are now performing their invaluableservices on behalf of their Principals, who include 67Commonwealth Governments, Associated States and Dependencies152 Commonwealth public bodies; and 57 non-commonwealth governments and agencies, in the secure confidence thatthe Government stands behind them during a period, whichwill inevitably last for some time, of gradual disengage-ment from the ill-advised and disastrous speculativeinvolvements of 1967 to 1974.   Since December 1974, theCrown Agents have been undertaking an orderly and phased
withdrawal from property and secondary banking.    TheGovernment&apos;s assurance means that the position of alldepositors is fully safeguarded.7.     The Government wishes to make clear beyond doubtits unequivocal and firm support for the Crown Agents.It has created a service to developing countries whichat the same time provides a channel for traditional andnew supplies of goods and services to the wide and expanding market of the third world.    Its origins layat the heart of nineteenth century colonialism, when itsrole (from 1833 onwards) was to procure goods from britain for the colonies.    In the last 20 years, it has builtand transformed the past into a confident and greatlyappreciated relationship with the countries and publicagencies of developing countries all over the world. TheCrown Agents serve them; and in doing so, they are acrucial element in Britain&apos;s relationship with countires overseas.8.     The Crown Agents functions will be the traditionalservices of procurement, recruitment, technical advice and management.    The exact pattern of such future develop-ment cannot, of course, be predicted, for it will bedetermined by the degree of expansion of the Crown Agents&apos;own relationship with their overseas Principals, and bytheir response to new needs for goods and services asthey emerge and are identified.   The Government believes that all concerned can be confident that the Crown Agentshave ahead of them a future of promise and achievement.9.     The Government is reinforced in this belief by itsawareness of the capabilities of the present chairman and his Board,   The seriousness of the situation whichwe and they faced in the autumn of 1974 was not one whichthey could have expected, in the absence of up-to-datefinancial information.    That so much that was wrong hasbeen and is being put right, and that activity on behalfA
(s\JN2 AJJJliMTJ-HJLof overseas Principals has increased in the last threeyears is a tribute to them, and particularly to theChairman, Mr. John Cuckney.10.    The Government will introduce as soon as possible a Bill to incorporate the Crown Agents: a commitmentmade to Parliament in October 1975.   This will not affectthe Crown Agents&apos; relationship with their overseasPrincipals.   But it will clearly define the relationship between the Crown Agents and Ministers which was obscureafter the rapid move to independence of the colonial territories in the early 1960s; and will provide for theproper exercise of public accountability.   Meanwhile theGovernment has taken the administrative action detailedbelow, designed to secure these objectives pendinglegislation.11.    It is manifest from the Inquiries of the Committeethat during the period from 1967 to 1974 the conduct ofthe affairs of the Crown Agents, and, in particular, the actions of certain of its staff, lacked competence andgood judgment.   As the Committee explain in paragraph 3of the Introduction, they have made a separate report on matters relating to the late Mr. Bernard Wheatley, theCrown Agents&apos; former sterling money market manager, andMr. Sidney Finley.   That Supplementary Report is not being published, because these matters are subjudice, but hasbeen referred by the Minister of Overseas Development tothe Director of Public Prosecutions.   With the possible exception of matters covered in that Report, the Committeefound no evidence of corruption among the Crown Agents&apos;staff.   As regards exchange control, investigations bythe proper authorities are proceeding.   The Committee&apos;sreport on the Crown Agents&apos; acquisition of shares in theFirst National Finance Corporation Limited in 1969 to 1970(paragraph 73) was referred to the Director of public prosecutions, who found no grounds for proceedings againstthe individuals in question.   However, it is clear that
the own-account activities of the Crown Agents did notaccord with the proper standards of &quot;behaviour of public bodies.    It is to be noted that the other activities were properly conducted.12.    It is evident that during this period, there was alack of clarity concerning the constitutional relationship between Ministers and the Crown Agents, and that theinformation made available to Ministers was incomplete.It is recognised by all concerned that for much of theperiod between 1967 and 1974 the growth of the CrownAgents&apos; own-account business, and the pattern of itsinvestments, as outlined in the Report, was inadequatelymonitored and scrutinised.    The Government accepts thatthis represented a failure to apply the normal principlesof public accountability.13.   The Government believes that its efforts to explore the causes of this failure; its decision to lay all thefacts before Parliament; and its efforts and success In response-establishing the Crown Agents on a sound footing, willbe regarded as firm evidence of its determination thatthe conduct of public affairs shall be honourable, andshall be seen to be do.14.   The Government has decided to set up a Committeeof Inquiry with the following terms of reference: &quot;Toexamine the facts and assess the nature and gravity ofany neglect of duty on the part of those employed in theCrown Agents, the Ministry of Overseas Development, theTreasury, the Bank of England and the Exchequer and AuditDepartment, so as to assist in deciding whether appropriate action is required&quot;.    This follows the precedent of theCommittee which reported in July 1954 on persons involvedin the Crichel Down inquiry (Cmnd. 9220) and the Boardof Inquiry which reported in September 1965 following the report of the Security Commission on the Bossard andAllen cases (Cmnd. 2773).
15.   At the same time, it is important to emphasise that the traditional activities of the Crown Agents in providing services to their overseas Principals have continued, and are continuing successfully.   As the FayCommittee has pointed out, what went wrong was a partonly of the Crown Agents1 financial activities, and thoseactivities themselves formed only a part of the CrownAgents&apos; total business.   Judging by the continued successof their traditional role, the Crown Agents&apos; orthodoxactivities have not suffered from the publicity accorded to their own-account business, and in 1975 and 1976 the traditional agency services produced gross income of  11million and  17 million respectively.    These services had for nearly 150 years past been the reason for the CrownAgents&apos; existence; they will now be the basis for a continuing future.The Constitutional Position16.   The Committee of Inquiry outlines the progress ofefforts to establish the constitutional relationship between the Crown Agents and Governments from February1970 onwards.   This was not an easy matter.   The CrownAgents, from 1833 onwards, were an agency under the direct control of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.   Theysupplied the goods and services required by the Colonies.Their role was not questioned or examined until a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons investigated and reportedin 1909, following which it appears that their rolecontinued as before, under the firm control of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.17.   The constitutional relationship was well understoodand worked satisfactorily until the process of decoloni-sation occurred.   The Crown Agents then began to undertakeprocurement of goods and services for independent governments and their parastatal agencies.   Their formal responsibilitycontinued to be to the Secretary of State for the Colonies/?
until 1961 when it passed to the Secretary for technical co-operation, and from him to the Minister of overseas development in 1964.    It will be of interest to Parliamentto note that during the 64 years from 1909 to 1973* only18 PQs touching upon aspects of the Crown Agents1 workwere tabled and answered.18.   The enquiries into the constitutional relationship which were initiated in 1970 were necessary.   The exerciseof effective control, and public accountability, cannotbe divorced from a clear definition of Ministerialresponsibilities and powers.    It is an important element in the history of the relationship that no such cleardefinition existed between about 1960 and 1974.19.   The Government&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 6445) on &quot;TheFuture of the Crown Agents&quot;, promised in October 1975and published in April 1976, outlined proposals for legislation to give the Crown Agents a corporate legalstatus, to define their functions, and to define the powersof the Minister.   The Government believes it to be essential that the constitutional relationship shall be clarified, defined, and given legal status.   legislation will ensure a continuing basis for the traditional role of the Crown Agents in providing procurement, recruitment,technical, advisory and financial management services totheir overseas Principals.The Present Financial Position20.   All new own-account investment of the kind described in the Committee&apos;s Report has ceased.    Since December1974 the Crown Agents have undertaken an orderly andphased withdrawal from property and secondary banking.In February 1975, the Minister of Overseas Development(Mrs. Hart), after consultation with the Board of theGjrown Agents, set out in a directive the main principles\^hich were to govern that withdrawal and the Crown Agents&apos;
future investment and lending policy.   This directiveis reproduced in Annex II.    Special accounting arrangements have been agreed to ensure that the Crown Agents accountseparately for those investments from which they aredisengaging, and proper accounting provisions have beenmade against bad and doubtful investments on past own-account activities.21.   Since October 1974 the Crown Agents have had a properBoard structure including independent part-time members appointed by the Minister and directly responsible toher.   A complete internal reporting system has beenestablished, with clearly defined levels of authorisationand control.    In this connection, the Crown Agents&apos;management accounting and financial information system has been completely reorganised and professionally qualifiedpeople have been appointed from outside the organisation to bring in the necessary expertise.   The accounts arenow published in accordance with Ministerial directionagreed with the Treasury governing their timing and theirform so as to give the fullest measure of disclosure.New legal advisers and independent valuers have been engaged.    In particular, the Crown Agents have soughtindependent professional advice on the management of theirdisinvestment programme.   A special London AdvisoryCommittee has been set up to advise the Board on theCrown Agents&apos; Australian interests, and includes twoproperty consultants and a representative of MorganGrenfell and Co. Limited.22.   Close working relations have now been established between the Crown Agents and the. Ministry of overseas development.   The Ministry and the Treasury have been kept fully in touch with the Crown Agents&apos; position and policies relating to financial matters, and progress inrealising their own-account investments.    The Bank ofEngland has been consulted in appropriate cases.   arrangements have been agreed under which the Chairman makes regular
reports to the Minister on matters of special interest,and the Ministry and Treasury receive comprehensivemanagement accounts every quarter.   These arrangements are recorded in a set of guidelines issued in July 1977,which are reproduced at Annex III.23.    The withdrawal from property and secondary bankingactivities must necessarily take time.   Much progress has been made, as is shown in the account given of individual investments in Annex IV.   But some of theconcerns in which the Crown Agents have invested moneyhave gone into liquidation, and the Crown Agents have hadto await settlement of their claims along with those ofother creditors.    In other cases, the problem has been to strike the right balance between disengaging quicklyon the one hand, and recovering as much as possible oftheir investment, thus minimising the final loss to the taxpayer, on the other.   This has been particularly important in regard to the Crown Agents&apos; Australianinvestments.   A broad strategy for the management of theAustralian operations has been agreed with the Minister.She is also consulted about other major decisions ondisengagement.24.   The traditional relationship between the Crown agents and their overseas Principals is in no way brought intoquestion by the own-account operations of the past.    Itis essential that the customary standards of confidentialityshould continue to be strictly observed in respect of transactions undertaken as agents on behalf of overseasPrincipals.25.   The Crown Agents now have complete control over their property investments in Australia, from which alengthy period of disengagement appears to offer the best prospect of reducing any demand on public funds.    Theyare no longer involved with their former partners in theEnglish and Continental Group.   They are in the process
of disengaging from their merchant banking investmentsin the Caribbean.   Following the bankruptcy of the SternGroup, they are participating in a Scheme of Arrangementapproved by the Court with an independent Administrator,as the most effective way of recovering as much as possible of their investment.   Civil proceedings have been institutedto recover some of the moneys lost and the possibilityof further such action is being considered.26.   The Crown Agents1 Accounts for 1976 show that asat 31 December 1976, the deficit on the own-accountinvestments in property and secondary banking (the realisation Account)- was in total some  212 million.   The -ultimate loss will not be known with certainty until thecomplete disengagement of the Crown Agents from the property and secondary banking activities of the past have beencompleted; this process may take some years.   But it isalready clear that the final deficit may well be inexcess of  200 million.    Should the need arise, theGovernment&apos;s undertaking that it stands behind the CrownAgents will be fulfilled by putting proposals to parliament for further financial assistance.   Given the experienceof the recent past the Government believes it wise toreassert its commitment to the Crown Agents, to give itspresent quantitative assessment of that commitment, andto undertake to inform Parliament if the degree of thatcommitment requires revision.27.   There has been a most severe failure of publicaccountability.   The causes of this are made clear bythe Report of the Committee of Inquiry, and are supplemented by the additional information presented here.28.   The Crown Agents are now on a different and betterfooting.   Their constitutional position and theirrelationship with Ministers have already been clarifiedand will be established by legislation.   Accountabilityis now established, and the disasters of their own-account
UUJMFlUiiJMTXALactivities of the past are being gradually remedied,at the cost of Government financial support.   The CrownAgents&apos; senior staff most criticised by the Report areno longer v/ith the Organisation.29.   The Government places firmly on record its confidence in the Board of the Crown Agents and in its traditionalactivities now and in the future on behalf of itsoverseas Principals.    It stands behind the Crown Agents.
On 8 NoVeaber 1971 the IB-Hilrtir for Overseas Development (Mr Richard Wood), in reply to* question from Mrs Judith Hart, announced the appointment of a Committee under sir Ifetthew Stevenson to consider the need for any changes in the status, functions andfinancial operations of the Crown Agents.   The full text is given below.CROWN AGENTS &quot; t &apos; &quot;The following Question stood upon theOrder Paper:56. Mrs. Haht: To ask the Secretary ofState for Foreign and commonwealth affairs whether he lias considered theposition of the Crown Agents and theirrelationship with Her Majesty&apos;s Govem-mcnt; and if he will make a statement about personal dealings in shares byCrown Agents.The Minister for Overseas Dcvclop-mcnt (Mr. Richard Wood): With pcrmis-sion, Mr. Speaker, I should now like to answer Question No. 56, and I apologisefor the length of the answer.The right hon. Lady the Member forLanark (Mrs. Hart), when Minister of overseas Development, asked for a dc-departmental paper on the position of theCrown Agents. Wiien I received it, Idecided, with tho agreement cf rny rightlion. Friend the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary, to appoint a Commit-tcc to consider the need for any changesin the status, functions and financialoperations of the Crown Agents. TheCommittee began work in the late surn-mcr. Its Chairman is Sir MatthewSlf-venson. With permission, I will pub-lish in the Official Report the names of its members and its terms of reference.It would not be appropriate l\o publish a report, since most of the work of theCrown Agents is now for independentGovernments; but I will make a further statement to the House after I have con-sidered the Committee&apos;s advice.I have also examined carefully ques-tions which have been raised about the personal dealings in shares by the twoCrown Agents, with the fullest co-opcra-tion of them both. Mr. Kayes was a director in his official capacity of a merchant bank, the directors andmanagers of which were asked to pur-chase a small number of shares of a newissue sponsored by the bank. He did soafter discussion with the then permanent secretary of the Ministry of overseas development, while giving instructions that the disposal of the shares should beat no gain or loss to himself. I am satis-ned that this purchase was not incon-listcnt with his office.&apos; Mr. Morris is a director in his officialcapacity of Sterling Industrial Securities,in which the Crown Agents have a financial stake. In the summer of 1970he told his chairman, Mr. Hayes, of hiswish to purchase some shares in this company with the gratuity he would receive on retirement in September, 1970.Meanwhile my Department, who had no knowledge of the proposed share trans-action, agiccd to the chairrnarfs request that Mr. Morris should remain in tem-porary employment as a Crown Agent to period after his retirement from pen-sionahlc service. Mr. Morris acquiredshares in the company in October, 1970.Last February Mr. Morris becamechairman of, and also purchased shares in, a private company which includesSterling Industrial Securities among itsbankers.Looking back on this whole sequence of events, and taking account in parlicu-lar of Mr. Morris\s retention as a CrownAgent for longer than was originally con-templatcd, J consider that the CrownAgents should have recognised that these arrangements might not be wholly com-patiblc with Mr. Morris&apos;s continuingemployment as a Crown Agent. I have discussed this with Mr. Morris, who is coming to the end of a long and dcvoiedcareer in public service, and, in rccogni-tion of this difficult situation, he has undertaken to dispose of the shares with-out profit to himself.Mrs. Hart: I thank the Minister forthat statement and recognise that itneeded to be as long as it has been.May I, first, say that we shall want to study this very carcfuliy, in particularsome of the implications of what he has said? Second, may I say that we areglad that the question of Mr. Morris&apos;sshareholding has now been cleared up,but that this clearly indicates how ini-portant it is to get the constitutionalrelationship between Government and theCrown Agents right?Why is he so determined not to pub-Iish the report of the inquiry when it is complete? I must tell the right hon.Gentleman thai we shall press him onthis, I should find it quite wrong if areport on such an important constitu-tional matter were not to be made avail-able to Parliament. Second, why has ittaken so long to make this statement?As the right hon. Gcnticman said. I askedfor the oflicial departmental look at this in (he spring of 1970, yet it is only now in the summer-that he has set up theCommittee.
Lastly, will the Committee, whosenames he is about to publish, include representatives of Commonwealth Gov-ernmcnts or of the Commonwealth Secre-tariat, recognising the key role that theCrown Agents play in the economic rela-tionship between trade in Britain and commonwealth countries?Mr. Wood: On the first of the right on. Lady&apos;s points, on publication, I have- taken the view that the relationship be-tween the principals, most or many ofwhom arc independent Governments, andthe Crown Agents themselves on theother side, is of immense importance, andthat it would therefore be unwise andwrong to publish a report which could possibly badly affect that relationship.That is why I announced the decision that I have.As for delay, I suppose, that perhapswe have all been rather slow in gettinground to this. The Crown Agents havenow existed since 1S33 therefore, for about 140 years. The Labour Party, theConservative Parly and the Liberal Partyperhaps could have acted a little earlier in considering what should be the properrelationship between the Crown Agents,in new circumstances, and the Govcrn-ment. Bui in comparison with those 140years, the period between the right hon., Lady*s initiation of this examination andthe report of the Stevenson CommitteeWill probably be a liule less than twoyears, and therefore rather insignificantbeside the length of life ot Ihe CrownAgents over the centuries.As for the members, I will publishtheir names, as I have said, in theOfficial Report. This is a small com-mittec, which does not contain the mem-*membership which the right hon. Lady sug-gested, but it will, I hope, satisfy theHouse of Commons that these mattersWill be very carefully looked into.Mr. Dalyell: For what reason did theDepartment not have knowledge of thelhare transactions?Mr. Wood: Because they were not&apos; reported to them.Mr. Arthur Lewis: Could the Ministertell us whether this arose as a result ofthe scandal which was revealed by the sunday Times and Private Eycl If so,will the right lion. Gentleman pay a tribute to the Sunday Times and PrivateEye for starting this scandal? After all.Private Eye is very rarely praised in this house, and it might make a change to doso.Mr. Wood : If the lion. Gentleman will show me the reports which appeared inthe Sunday Times and Private Eye, 1 willsec whether they deserve a tribute.Mr. George Cunningham: Will theright hon. Gentleman bear in mind that,despite this regrettable incident, theCrown Agents have a very high rcputa-tion throughout all aid donors in theworld for providing facilities in dcvclop-ing countries which no other donor canequal?Will the report, if it is not to be pub-lishcd, at least be given to the overseasprincipals which use the Crown Agentsso that they can be sure that things havenow been put right inside the Agency?Mr. Wood : I am glad that the lion.Gentleman made the first point. I should like to have made it myself. I thinkthat the confidence of the principals in theactivities of the Crown Agents is shown by the amount of business that they place with the Crown Agents.As I explained to the right lion. Lady,I have taken the view that the report should not be published. As the report isabout the desirable relationships for thefuture between the Crown Agents, on theone hand, and Her Majesty&apos;s Govcm-1 mcnt, on the other hand, I have naturallykept the various principals fully in the picture so that they will know what is happening, and I am certain that theexistence of the Committee will not im-pair the relationship between the CrownAgents and their principals.. Mrs. Hart: May I press the right hon.Gentleman a shade further on the qucs- :tion of publication. As he will appre- ,associate, my concern was that the constitu-tional relationship in this case between a minister and the Crown Agents whom heappointed but who had no other responsi-bility whatever, either financial or other-wise, to government seemed unsatisfac-tory.  To the extent that the inquiry is2 D 20/OVER
directly concerned with tliis constitutionalrelationship, I believe thai this i.s a matter which it would be perfectly proper tomake public knowledge. We do nothave other constitutional relationships between Ministers and inside bodies or public bodies which arc not known fully to Parliament.Mr. Wood : The right hon. Lady willunderstand that the committee will haveto consider in some detail the relationship between the Crown Agents and the prin-cipals as well as the relationship betweenthe Crown Agents and Her Majcsly&apos;sGovernment. That is why I promised tomake a further statement to the HouseWhen I receive the Committee^ advice inthe light of what the Committee thinksshould be the future relationship betweenthe Crown Agents and Her majesty&apos;sGovernment. However, I do not thinkit right to publish the report. I do notthink the report could be nearly as useful if I did not make that statement.Following is the information :The Committees terms of reference are toconsider whcihcr there is a need for any-changes in the status, functions and financialoperations of the Crown Agents, including pnr-ticularly Ajicir relationship to Her Majcsty*sGovernment, having regard to:Developments which have taken place inrecent years in the nature of their functions and in the constitutional status of theirprincipals;and to the United Kingdom&apos;s own interestsincluding the needs of the remaining depen-dencics ;and to make recommendations on the nature ofany such change. The Chairman is Sir MatthewStevenson, K.C.B., C.M.G., and other membersSir Glyn Jones. G.C.M.G., M.B.E.     &apos;Mr. M. J. Vcrey.Sir Charles Whishaw. &apos;    &apos;
- 4 -&apos; CONFIDENTIALMrs. Hart: Amongst the investmentsubsidiaries of the Crown Agents havebeen a 51 per cent, controlling interest inthe English and Continental PropertyCompany and substantial interests in metropolitan Properties Limited, andmany of the property. companies theyhave invested in during the last few years have certainly - been speculative. Theright hon. Gentleman says that the trusteearrangements arc proposed to hold good,and the question is whether he proposes that those arrangements will or will not exclude properly dealings. [Hon. Mr.m-BERs: &quot;Oh.&quot;] I think hon. Membersopposite are a little less informed about this matter than are some of my hon.Friends.What matters here is whether the right on. Gentleman is prepared to say to iheCrown Agents that these new arrange-ments on the trustee analogy shouldexclude investments in speculativeproperly developments. This is the point about which the Opposition arc rightlyconcerned. The right hon. Gentlemanhas said that the Crown Agents willfinally be answerable to him, but he is,of course. nnwiTnWc&apos;&apos; to this House.Whnl  la lo I&quot;&apos; III&quot; l&apos;-lnli&quot;iiich!ii In iiv-ithis answerahilily and llieir answcrahitilyto him, because the situation is pro-foundly unsatisfactory? Finally, what isto be the position about the personalshareholdings of nominee directors?Mr. Wood : J hope I can remember allthe right lion. Lady&apos;s questions. The.question of answerabilily is dealt with inthe fact that the Crown Agents arcAppointed by the Secretary of Slale or bymyself and therefore they are answerable-to us in the final analysis.I am sorry, but I cannot remember theright hon. Lady&apos;s next question.Mrs. Hart: How is the right hon.Gentleman to be answerable to Parlia-mcnl for I hem?Mr. Wood: I am answerable to Purlin-ment. That is obvious at the moment,when I am being asked so many, ques-tions.Mr.. Cunningham: The first time in three years.Mr. Wood: It is not the first time in three years. I have been bombarded byquestions and I have done my best togive as full answers as possible. Thatdeals with the question on answerability.Perhaps the right hon. Lady will rc-, mind mc of her other questions. I am afraid that I did not write them down.Mrs. Hart: There were two other qucs-tions. The first was whether trustee share-holdings should exclude speculativeproperty investment, and the other con-cerncd the position of personal sharehold-ings of nominee directors.Mr. Wood : On the question of trusteeshareholdings, i said that the policy should be carried out&quot;. . . in nccord with (tic trustee analogy anilshould be fully consistent with their name andstanding.&quot;I think the right lion. Lady would be wrong to get this matter entirely out ofperspective. The percentage of the CrownAgents&apos; investment at the present timein property is 1 per cent, and Ihcrc-force-Mn Cunningham : How much money?Mr. Wood : Not very much. As I wassaying, the right hon. Lady is ovcr-csli-maling the problem.I made a fairly full statement aboutthe personal holdings of the CrownAgents in the investment companies con-cerncd on a previous occasion, and 1 donot Ihiuk I can add to what I said then.
Cfbwri Agents1 (Slcvciison Report)1 36. Sir Bernard Braine asked theSecretary of State for Foreign and Com-monwealtii Affairs if lie has received thereport of the committee, under the chair-manship of Sir Matthew Sievenson, whichhas been inquiring info tlie status and functions of the Crown Agents ; and ifhe will make a statement.38. Mrs. Hurt asked the Secretary of. State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs if he has now received the Steven-son Report on the Crown Agents ; andIt he will reconsider his decision on its publication, in view of the public impor-tance of the relationship between HerMajcsty*s Government and tho CrownAgents.Mr. Wood t I havo received the coni-mittee&apos;s advice and with permission i will circulate a statement in the OfficialRbport. Briefly, the committee foundthat the interests of the Crown Agents&apos;principals and others concerned would best be served by the continuation of thei whole range of services which the CrownI Agents provide.   1 welcome these find-ings. which reinforce my confidence in: the Crown Agents&apos; work for their over-seas principals.   I also accept the com-, millce&apos;s   recommendations   that   thereshould be a clearly defined status, slruc-, lure and responsibility for the CrownAgents and that they should bear appro-priate liability to taxation.   I am con-sidering how these conclusions can best be given effect and I will later make afurther statement.  1 would like to recordmy gratitude to the committee for itsadvice. Since most of the Crown Agents&apos;work is for independent Governments, itwould not be right to publish the report.Sir Bernard Braine: Will my right hon.Friend assure the House that the changeshe has in mind are in the best jnterests&apos;of the overseas principals? Secondly,bearing in mind the very long and valu-able service that the Crown Agents have.giveri their Commonwealth principalsover very many years, will my right hon.Friend confirm the impression that a good many of us have had for a long time that the Crown Agents are continuing toserve their principals with skill andJjlletfiily&apos;/Mr. Wood : I have every confidence in the integrity of the Crown Agents, andI agree with my lion. Friend about thevalue of the work they do for their over-seas principals. In my opinion the valueof that work will be enhanced by changes of the kind I have it in mind to make.Mrs. Harl : Is the right hon. Gentlemanaware that when I spoke to him on the telephone last week and he told me I hathis reply might be too long to giveorally, I had no idea that in additionto refusing to publish the report hewould issue a statement of the resultsof the report only in a Written Answer?This is quite disgraceful and it astonishesmo. May I put this point to the right on. Gentleman? Is he aware that inthe light of recent discoveries aboutrelationships between civil servants and governments and between Ministers and governments following the Poulsou in-vestigations, it is irresponsible and in-conccivablc that a full report should notbe published, though not necessarily con-taining the evidence given by other couu-trics? One can understand that that wouldnot be possible. But is it not irrcspon-siblc on behalf of the Government notto publish the findings of this reportsince they relate to the relationship bc-tween employees of the Government andthe Government itself?Mr. Wood : Perhaps I might begin by setting the right lion. Lady&apos;s fears atrest about the longer statement that Imean to issue. I assure her that it will contain no surprises. I have summarisedit adequately in my shorter answer. as for what she terms the irresponsibilityof not publishing the report, 1 think itwould be utterly irresponsible to publish a report which I undertook at the time that I set up the committee would notbe published, for reasons that the right on. Lady knows. What is more, know-ing what the right lion. Lady does aboutthe relationship between the CrownAgents and their principals, I am certainthat if she were standing at this DispatchBox she would take the same view.^ 24 July 1972, the Minister for Overseas Development (Mr Richard Wood) gave thej loving reply to questions from Sir Bernard Braine and Mrs Judith Hart.   He alsoculated a written statement reporting on the advice given him by the StevensonCommittee.
Mr CunninghamDocs the right hon. Gentleman intend to say nothing about the fact that CrownAgents&apos; money has gone into the notoriousproperty empire of John Chalk andTimothy Gwyn-Joncs? Will he recognisethat there is a scandal which is waiting toblow? Unless we investigate the matterfully with sufficient openness but withconfidentiality to reflect the circumstances, &apos;the traditional work of the Crown Agents,which is of enormous value throughoutthe world, will incvitably.be prejudiced.iMr. Wood : The purpose of the CrownAgents indulging in the activities to which 1the hon. Gentleman refers is largely tobuild up the reserves of the CrownAgents, which are largely to the benefit !. of the principals themselves, and the *principals have shown their con-fidcncc in this policy. I understand thatthe hon. Gentleman has a Question to put to me next week about the appointmentof Mr. Challis. but. having made this statement today, I should tell the hon.Gentleman that the Chairman of theCrown Agents, when the appointment was mooted, considered Mr..Challis in theway in which a civil servant would beconsidered. He consulted me, and I con-sultcd others. I therefore share the .responsibility for it. I had no reason to object to this appointment because Ibelieved that it was in lino with the rulesthat apply to the Civil Service.Mr. Ilordcrn: Is my right hon. Friendsatisfied that lie has the consent and approval of the Crown Agents&apos; principalsto these proposals? Would he agree that nothing should be done that could impair the close confidence which die CrownAgents&quot; principals of various&apos; Common-Wealth countries have in the operation ofthe Crown Agents&apos; themselves? Would he also accept that Ihc commonwealth countries arc perfectly capable of deciding who should look after their own affairs?I Mr. Wood: I am entirely in agreement! with my hon. Friend. I believe that the assent of lhc: principals to these arrange-. mcnls is of immense importance, and thatis the reason why I look ihe opportunityto tell them what was happening. I believethat my statement will do nothing to damage the confidence that exists betweenthe principals and the Crown Agents.Mr. Dalyell: In relation to the trusteeanalogy, may I confirm that the Minister&quot;used the phrase &quot; if the companies sodecide&quot;? Docs this mean that speculativeinvestment can go on without his department being told?&apos; Mr. Wood: It means purely that the trustee analogy will not he wholly rcsliic-live, that Ihe Crown Agents can makeinvestments, if they so choose, outside the trustee analogy,, and would be guided in doing so not only by the executives of theCrown Agents&apos; stall themselves but by thenon-cxcculivcs. who would be appointedafter consultation will) me.Mr. Skinner: Would the right hon.Gentleman go even further and issue an instruction to the Crown Agents to stopany investment in these slum propertyspeculations?Mr. Wood : No, Sir.Mr. Costain: Docs my right hon.Friend sec any different relationship between the Crown Agents and MilibankServices?Mr. Wood:  No, Sir.   There is no connection.Mr. Frccson: The Minister gave ascandalous answer to my hon. Friend the member for Bolsovcr (Mr. Skinner), whoasked whether any instruction would begiven by the right lion. Gentleman to theCrown Agents to cease investments inslum property. Is the right hon. Gcntlc-man aware that (here is critical concern about activities in this direction? Is he further aware that in such a matter thereis a balance of responsibility and con-fidence between the principals overseas and this House and this country? Surelyany decision he lakes should reflect thatas well?  Will he think again about hisanswer lo my hon. Friend?Mr. Wood t J said, &quot; No &quot; lo tfutl ijiies-tion because the Crown Agents haveneither made nor contemplated making such investments.Mr. George Cunningham:  Nonsense.Mr. Wood; I will elucidate. I think the hon. Member for Islington, Soulh-Wcst (Mr. George Cunningham), with  his great interest in this matter, has in mindcertain investments made in the FiiMNational Finance Corporation. This ina company in which die Crown Agentshave a limited financial interest. TheCrown Agents have not made investmentsin slum property. There were investmentsmade by the First National Finance Cor-poralion. .. I have no doubt, and never have had any doubt, about the inlcgriiyof the Crown Agents. We can all have our judgment of their judgment. the hon. Gentleman has his judgment about their judgment. The principals also have their judgment about the Crown Agents&apos;judgment and have expressed their con-fidcricc clearly./over
24 JULY 1972161.. Mrs. Hart: As one who initiated, thisreport towards the end of the periodof the Labour Government, I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that I should &apos;:not take the view he is now taking.   I accept that evidence given by other coun-Iries should remain confidential but I-do not see why that should preclude-publication of the conclusions of SirMatthew Stevenson and his colleagues,and I do not see why the House&apos;and &quot;the public should be kept in the darkabout the reasons why they have come-  . to the conclusions they have.- Mr. Wood: When the committee was set up, with the concurrence of my right .hon. Friend, so that the whole relation-ship between Her Majcsty&apos;s Government.and the Crown Agents could be cx-amined which, incidentally, impinges onthe Crown Agents&apos; relationship with theprincipals-1 undertook that the rqrort ...     &apos;-\       ,. would not be published.

Her Majcsly&apos;s Government and the remainingBritish dependencies, arc best served by the continuation of this full range of services.&apos;1 welcome these findings, which reinforce myconfidence in the Crown Agents&apos; work for their&apos; overseas principals.The committee, however, commented  on; the constitutional position of the CrownAgents, and the Governments undefined re-tidual responsibility for them. The commit-tee recommended that there should be aclearly defined status, structure and rcspon-. tibility for the Crown Agents, and made somesuggestions for consideration. The CrownAgents, but not their subsidiary companies,have Crown exemption from taxation. Thecommittee recommended that they should bearan appropriate liability to it. 1 accept these recommendations and am considering how best; they may be given effect.   I will later make&apos; a further statement.The main overseas principals have been told&apos; of these conclusions, which 1 believe will fur-&apos; other  Mrengthcn the Crown Agents in their special relationship of trust with overseas Gov-emments, built up by their long-established.activities on behalf of all their principals.. 1 will get in touch with the main oversea!principals again as plant develop.. I am extremely grateful to Sir MatthewSlevcn*on and the members of his committeefor their thorough work and wiso advice. -i Since most of the Crown Agents&apos; work isfor independent Governments, it would not,as I made clear in my statement last November,&quot; be right to publish the report.
* 21 November 1973 tb* Minister for Overseas Development (Mr Richard Wood) made a^other statement announcing the Governments agreement to the establishment of^sidiary companies to deal with financial services, and guidelines for investmentPolicy. ^CROWN AGENTSThe Minister for Overseas Devclop-mcnl (Mr. Richard Wood): With yourpermission, Mr. Speaker, and that of theHouse. I would like to make a further statement on the Crown Agents. In my statement last year. I said that I wel-comcd the findings of Sir MatthewStcvcnson&apos;s Committee, that the interestsof the Crown Agents&apos; principals andothers would best be served by the con-tinualion of the whole range of services which the Crown Agents provide. I also accepted recommendations that the status,structure and rcsponsibilityfor the CrownAgents should be clearly defined, andthat they should bear an appropriateliability to taxation.The Crown Agents originally came intoItcinp primarily In provide certainlliuiiu inl mill i*ii11 11n-,inoviitvi inlliitnin fur countries which were thendependent. The range of their services,conducted on a non-profit making basis and contributing to the development ofthe countries concerned, has been pro-grcssivcly made available to a large num-bcr of countries, most of them nowindependent. The scope of their activitieshas also been extended to cover a wide range of technical and financial services.The Crown Agents have adapted their organisation and structure over the years in order to meet these widening require-commitments . and in particular have establishedcertain of their services on the basis offully-owned subsidiary companies staffedby Crown Agents&apos; personnel. In the lightof the Stevenson Report, I have agreed,that this process should be extended bythe establishment of further wholly-ownedsubsidiary companies to deal with the specialised financial services of the CrownAgents. The boards of management ofthose companies will include non-executive directors appointed after con-4 K 30sullation with me, as well as executivedirectors drawn from the Crown Agents&apos;staff. The Crown Agents intend that the investment policy pursued by these coin-panics should be generally in accord withthe trustee analogy and should be luiiyconsistent with their name and standing.These subsidiary companies will be sub-jectto taxation in the normal way. andarrangements are also being made tobring any profits which may be made bythe headquarters&apos; organisation itselfwithin the scope of normal taxation.The Crown Agents will, as in the past,be appointed by the Secretary of State, orby myself acting on his bchaif, lor thopurpose of carrying out the various ser-viccs on behalf of the overseas principals.Thrv will thus remain answerable tin illyIn Mini.Ic in. bill  il  i&apos;i llt&apos;illir-1   my  iul&apos; nlion in ir my desire to disturb tin-,traditional practice under which theoperations of the Crown Agents on behalfof their overseas principals have been dis-charged on a basis of non-intervention by ministers.In the future, as in the past, the scale and scope of the Crown Agents&apos; opera-tions will depend on the confidence whichoverseas governments and authoritiesrepose in the organisation. That confi-dence is fully reflected in the present scale of operations, and I am particularly anxious that the arrangements I have mentioned, which arc designed to produce a more readily comprehensible structure and to define the various functions more clearly, should in no way disturb that con-ftdence. I have made this clear to themain overseas principals when I told them the outline of the new arrangements.Finally, I should once again like totake this opportunity of thanking SirMatthew Stevenson and his Committeefor its report, and of sincerely endorsingthe tributes which it paid to the work ofthe Crown Agents.Mrs. Hart: I thank the right hon. Gcn-tlcman for his statement. As he knows,we have wailed for it for a long time.First. F endorse what he said about thoconfidence which principals may con-linui&apos; lo have in I lie work of the CrownAjynlN.

1JJUJMX1AL.Ivlrs Harttlial some of the equities had rather unfor-(unatc results last year. It seems from his statement that he is proposing not lochange basically the relationship between himself and the Crown Agents. The right on. Gentleman will continue to appointbut, as he knows, one of the great prob-kins-this was my opinion when I was his predecessor in ollice is that thepower to appoint Crown Agents has no corresponding responsibility on the partof Ihe Crown Agents to report to Govcrn-ment. Will there be any change in that respect?The right hon. Gentleman said that theCrown Agciits will remain answerablefinally. In what way will they be answer-able? Will they report to him? Will thereport be published? Will it be availableto hon: Members? Will it be subjected to parliamentary questioning?-The right hon. Gcnlleman says thatin the new extended financial operations of the Crown Agenls there will be non-executive directors appointed after con-sultalion with him. What precisely willbe their non-executive functions? lie says that the companies will have to act. willbe expected to act or will be intended lonet in accord with Ihe trustee analogy.Will he loll us precisely what he means?Does he mean that lliey are not to haveequity shares or equity shares of a speculation-lalive character? 1 low docs he proposeto prevent that happening? Will they nolonger invest in property companies?Depending on the right hon. Gcntle-man&apos;s answers, it may well be that we shallwish to explore the matter in greaterdepth.Mr. Wood: The suggestion which Ihave made to the Chairman of the CrownAgents is that he should be willing-andhe agrees to discuss with me any im-portant developments or changes in thepolicy of Crown Agents.The function of non-executive directorswill be similar to the functions of suchdirectors of oilier companies of all kinds-namely, to give advice and to help in thefaking of decisions by the companies withwhich they arc connected.The investment policy pursued by thecompanies should be carried out in accord-with the trustee analogy and should bofully consistent with the Crown Agent&apos;s Name and standing. That means that theywill be guided largely by the trustee 1analogy but not prevented from makinginvestment outside (hat analogy if thocompanies so decide.4Sir Bernard ISrainc : Is my right hon.Friend aware that his statement will be welcomed by all who recognise the im-porlance of the Crown Agents&apos; work,who have been concerned about criticalcomment which has recently appeared inthe Press? So that we may get themailer into perspective, will he confirm that the success of the Crown Agents&apos;investment policy on behalf of the gov-ernmcnts of many developed countries has contributed to those governmentsplacing additional funds and additionalorders with Great Britain? .Mr. Wood : I entirely agree with myhon. Friend. The confidence that isshown by the principals in the CrownAgents is unmistakcable.

I do not believe thatthat would be in the interests of the relationship between the Crown agents and the principals. To an extent that must be a confidential relationship. Itwould be wrong for such mailers lo be.discussed in Parliament because thisrelationship between the Crown agents and the principals would be gravelyundermined.     \Mr. George Cunningham: Will theright hon.

CONFIDENTIAL
to 31 July 1974 tho Minister of Overseas Development (Mrs Judith Hart) announced herintention to appoint a Board of Crown Agents and to give them directions about theinduct of their own-account business.Crown AgentsMr. George Cunningham asked theMinister of Overseas Development if shewill make a statement on the future rolestructure of the Crown Agents.Mrs. Hart: The House will recall thatin 1970 I instituted inquiries into theconstitutional relationship of the Crownj Agents. The right hon. Member forjBridlington (Mr. Wood) took the matterIfurther and appointed the Stevenson Cbm-committee. In the light of my own further study, I would like to tell the House what i now propose.As background, I emphasise that theCrown Agents have a long history of effi-cient and comprehensive services to coun-tries overseas in the fields of procurement,inspection, engineering, finance and a variety of personnel services. During the nineteenth century and for most of this one they acted essentially for the Colonieswho were, of course, within the respon-sibility of the Secretary of State. In thelast 15-20 years they have acted mainly for independent countries, mostly mem-bers of the Commonwealth, and also forthe remaining dependent territories. Fora historical perspective I recommend the1909 Report of the House of CommonsCommittee chaired by Colonel Secly, the^Parliamentary Under-Secretaiy of State(Cd. 4473).The services they provide are excel-lent, and are very much appreciated bytheir overseas principals. They have an efficient znA dedicated staff. It is impor-tant that their telationship of confidencewith their overseas principals remainsundisturbed, and that the customary?tpndard* of commercial confidentiality!will continue 10 be observed in their&apos;transactions. This was the right hon.Gentleman&apos;s conclusion, and it is minealso.Procurement this year is running at therate of about  160 million annually. De-posits from principals are about  300 mil-lion and funds managed on their behalfare valued at about  850 million. Thesefigures give some indication of the scale of the work of Crown Agents. In recentyears, as is, I think, well known, theyhave extended their financial operations on their own account with the objective of building up their reserves. Some ofthese, particularly those concerned withproperty, have become the subject ofpublic comment. Given the ultimate&apos;responsibility of the Crown Agents toGovernment, I have therefore decidedto make changes in their structure whichwill not however affect their relationshipI with overseas principals.!   Sir Claude Hayes, who is now and has&quot;&apos; for some time been the sole Crown Agent,has carried an extremely heavy burden.He would normally have retired earlierthis year and I am grateful to him forj his willingness to continue in office for aTittle while longer in order to ease thei transition to the new arrangements I now propose.I am appointing a Board of CrownAgents which will have a full-time chair-man and will include up to seven part-time members. I shall announce namesshortly.Tne board will be required to transmitto me an annual report and accountswhich I propose to make available to Par-I liament. The board will be responsible! to me for the organisation and general administration of the Crown Agents&apos; busi-ness and I reserve the right to give themdirectives from time to time.I shall of course continue the pracUceof non-intervention in the activities of theCrown Agenti cn behalf of their overseasprincipals. In such matters they willcontinue to act strictly according to theinstructions of their principals.In their own account business I shalldirect that the board pays due regardat all times to the best stand?rds of bank-ing prudence and dues not engage intransactions which might embarrass HerM?.jesty&apos;s Government or conflict withthe interests of its ove-seas principals. Itshould not engage directly in the propertymarket, other than in respect of propertyfor its own occupation, any extension inthe property field being subject to myprior approval. Of course, I do not intend that existing obligations should becalled in question or interfered with.As the House will appreciate, this isnot an easy area in which to achieve thebest balance between commercial activi-ties, respon-bility to overseas principal,arid responsibility to the Minister whoappoints the Crown Agents. But I believethat the new structure and guidelines Ihave outlined will allow the CrownAgents to operate effectively on theirown account with a full sense of socialresponsibility and without in any way dis-disturbing the confidence placed in them by countries overseas, which is so wellmerited.       ^
 85 mill&quot;! subject to parliamentary authority, to provide a recoverable grant of Crown AGENTSThe Minister of Overseas Development(Mrs. Judith Hart): With permission, I wish to make a statement about the finan-cial position of the Crown Agents.The House will recall that on 1st July announced my arrangements for the re-structuring of the Crown Agents. There isnow a Board of Crown Agents, includingup to seven part-time members with afull-time chairman. After discussion withthe new chairman I agreed as an interim measure to appoint only three part-timeCrown Agents in view of the immediate and pressing- problems facing him. while continuing the practice of non-inlcrvcn-tion in the activities of the Crown AgentsOn behalf of their overseas principals, 1reserve the right to give the board dircc-tives, and indeed have already done so inrelation to their own account business.The new chairman of the CrownAgents, John Cuckncy, who took up his appointment on 1st October, appointedCoopers and Lybrand as consulting ac-countants to review the present financialposition and the future financial rcquirc-ments of the Crown Agents and their sub-sidiary companies. Morgan Grcnfcll and company Limited have since been ap-pointcd to advise on general bankingmatters.The chairman, supported by the three^members newly appointed to his board,has now reported to me that a decline inmarket value of some of the assets of theCrown Agents has led to an immediate problem of reserves and liquidity. He hasmade a formal request to the Governmentfor financial assistance.The requirement is related to the rcalis-tic writing down of assets values in the accounts, and to the need to ensure finan-cial backing appropriate to operations in-volving some  600 million, excludingfunds of some  200 million managed forprincipals.The Government have agreed to pro-vide  85 million, subject to parliamentaryauthority, which will be recoverable, by&quot;direction, from future earnings or apprc-ciation of assets. Standby facilities havebeen arranged by the Bank of England.These arrangements will demonstratebeyond all doubt that the Governmentstand behind the Crown Agents so thatthe position of all depositors is fully safe-guarded ; that the confidence of their overseas principals is fully maintained ;and that the important services provided to the principals are continued. In the iijhlof the history of the relationship between government and the Crown Agenis inthe last four years, involving, as it has, my own initiations of inquiries in 197-:), Ail-lowed by the Stevenson Report to my pre-predecessor, the right hon. Member forlington (Mr. Wood), which was m-Ifshcd, and the inquiries made by a SelectCommittee of this Mouse, hon. members will clearly want to know how the circum-stanccs necessitating this financial supporthave arisen. I have asked the Chairmanof the Crown Agents to send mc a fui! re-port on this, and I shall keep the Houseinformed. Thereafter I shall considerwhether any further action is necessary.I have also asked to be informed ;.idetail of outstanding longer-term cor.;-commitments of the Crown Agents, includingcertain properly investments in Australia,and of any suggestions which the new board may have for the organisation and management of its financial business inthe future. J have reserved the rr.!u 10direct that monies now being advancedshall be repaid from Crown Agents&apos; rc-sources in the course of any reconstruction -of the business.The House will, I know, appreciate thatthe present Chairman, John Cuckney. andthe three members of his board, JohnGoble, John Gordon and Leslie Kirklcy,have had only a very short time to assess the position and report to the Govern-mcnt. On taking office they were con-fronted with most difficult circumstances,as the House will clearly understand.This situation, which I am sorry 10report to the House, is one which we are seeking to correct. I am immensely gnuc-ful to them and would like to lake liiisopportunity to tell the House that 1 ha\ecomplete confidence in them. Their primeconcern, as it is mine, and, I am sure,that of the House, too, will be thai 1i.0Crown Agenis, with their long history or&quot;service and capability, arc able to con-tinue to provide for their overseas princi-pals the full range of their services.VGViifcmlA K^ceaber 1974 th. minister of overseas development (mrs judith birt) told the01 xne crown agents&apos; financial difficulties and announced the governmentsxon.^ &amp;r?*^&quot;illion.

As toi whether it is a loan or a grant, the positionis that the money will be advanced tothe Crown Agents but, given thc rccon-ttructton of the business Unit thcy^would contemplate carrying out, there are clearly; possibilities that much of it can beI recoverable as their assets increase in value or as they make certain changes.Therefore, the position is a little flexible,but we hope that there will be the posst-bility*of recovering some of the money.Nevertheless, it is not precisely a loan.rbut a grant which we hope will berecoverable. [Hon. Members: Oh.&quot;]Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen oppositemust understand that a situation whichhas been in the making for at least four or five years is not so easily recoverableby a single stroke of the pen on one day. That is the arrangement wc havemade, and I think that the right hon. and, learned Gentleman will agree that on theWhole it is thc best arrangement to boarrived at.- Thc question whether there will be a debate is a matter lor the House. Ishall be reporting furlltcr. and it will bo1 necessary io consider what kind otinquiry should lake place. I hope that.the House will have a little patience about this because the overseas principals are involved and. they, tt*o, will need to boconsulted about the form it should lake.Tlicre Is no doubt that tho House willbe more fully informed and will have afull opportunity to consider thc position which has arisen. CONFIMr. George Cunningham:   Will thcMinister agree that these enormous clifli-cullies are exactly the difficulties which many of us have been predicting for along time in thc light of thc odd con-Stitulional relationship between the CrownAgents and the Government?   This ischaracterised by at least one hon. Mem-bcr on thc Opposition benches for attackas a phoney campaign.   Will my right, hon. Friend say roughly how much of, thc loss sustained on thc investment sideof thc Crown Agents&apos; business is atli ibut-ablc to the fall in the value of shares of1 First National Finance Corporation, one- of whose present deputy chairmen was,. immediately before  he  look  up  that position. Financial Director of the Crown, Agents?. Finally, will my right hon. Friend say, whcthcrtthc Government of thc day every gave to thc Crown Agents approval lo go. into this business of investment by com-. parison with their traditional buying andselling,r6Ic, which 1 am sure continues tor have thc full support of everyone in the. House?Mrs. Hart: My hon. Friend and T. as&apos; I know one or two other hon. Membersappreciate, have had a continuing and&apos; deep concern about the position of theCrown Agents and their involvement par-&apos; ticularly in the money market and thcproperty market.     That may not be1 known to some hon. Members, but it is; so, and the Select Committee on Overseasi Development gave some consideration to, these matters.I cannot give my hon. Friend a preciseanswer as to the involvement of a par-ticular company. I can tell him that oneof thc factors involved, which is not un-expected, is that the Crown Agents hadconsiderableinvestments in property. Thedecline in properly values over thc last. year has intensified the problems thatmight concern any organisation that puta great deal of money into property, andthis is a matter which is dealt with inthc report which I have had from theChairman of the Crown Agents. Thcfurther report which I shall hope to make available lo the (louse, al least in sum-ma ry, will show that clearly.As to thc member of the Stall of theCrown Agents lo whom my hon. Friendreferred, that is a matter which is pcr-haps belter not discussed in the House atthc moment, as my hon. Friend willi appreciate. If Ihere is an inquiry, what-. ever form it takes, it might well be a proper subject for thc inquiry./OVERENTIAL
Mr. Pardoc: Is the right hon. Ladyaware that the House will be somewhatmystified, in that the Government appearto have agreed to provide  85 million but1 have only now asked for a full reportinto the circumstances which make this financial support necessary? Docs notthe Minister think that it might have beenbelter to have asked for the full report. first and to have provided the finance. thereafter?Although many will- welcome the factthat the Government stand behind theCrown Agculs, is the right hon. Ladyaware that if this kind of nonsense goesi on the world wHr^wmil t to know whol stands behind the Government?&apos; i&apos;    Mrs. HartiT am&apos; afraid that the hon.. Gentleman1 isV^pfciWrhelr short of hisown standarcKjhijre; He might be well advised to do a little research into thereports of the proceedings of the house in Hansard over the hist four years.  It&apos; is all there.I was the first to express serious con-. cern early in 1970 when I was Minister, of Overseas Development  That led toj my asking my Department for a paper onI the constitutional relationship between thei Crown Agents and the Government, which Was somewhat obscure.    That, led myI predecessor the right hon. Member forj Bridlington (Mr. Wood) to ask for theI Stevenson Inquiry which, reported, butthat report despite pressure from the then. Opposition, was not published.  That ledj to the Select committee before&apos;s inquiries which, &apos;i as soon as I came back into Office in&apos; March, led to my initiating changes inthe structure which in turn led to thetevelation of wftat has been going on.&apos; The hon. Member, for Cornwall, North(Mr. Pardoe) would do better to do some&apos;: research. !Sir G. dc Frcilas:. Will my right hon.! Friend recognise that many of us who, have followed lor some time the affairs of the Select Committee and the CrownAgents were highly critical in the past?However that may be, there arc many of&apos; us now who give full support to thepresent Crown Agents and their chair-man?Mrs. Hart: I am grateful to my right on. Friend. I must be absolutely frankWith the House. This is an unfortunatereport- to have to make to the House.It follows a scries of events and a historyof some years.- I think thai we arc nowtfoirtg the right thing, and I am certainthat the Governments duty is to give fullbacking to the Crown Agents because oftheir importance and value and because, the name of Britain is involvcftONFIDESir Bernard Braine : Docs the rig&apos;H lion.Lady accept that there arc some Opposi-tion Member.1; I was, after all. Chairmanof the Select Committee that inquiredinto this mailer who were anxious aboutthe financial activities of the CrownAgents precisely because they cut acrossa superb, unique record of service to theCrown Agents&apos; principals in the Common-wealth and to the British economy? IVery much welcome, although with somesadness, the statement which the rightlion. Lady has made today. May I ask whether al any stage any of the principalshave been critical of the conduct of theCrown Agents inlthc carrying out of their normal business?Mrs. Ilarl: The answer to the last partof the question fe &quot; No &quot;. What emergesis that the matter is not as simple asthc* right hon. Gentleman might suppose.&apos; The answer is &quot; No &quot;. The overseasprincipals still have every confidence inthe Crown Agents, and I should like to&apos; reinforce what the right hon. Gentlemansaid. What we are talking about todayis the consequence of operations in I homoney market and the properly market which left undisturbed the completeeilkrency and good faith of the operations of the Crown Agents in procurement andin service, which are the real bases oltheir operations.
Oa 23 April 1975 tk* Minister of Overseas Development (Mrs Judith Hart) made a further report to the House about the Crown Agents1 financial position, and announced herdecision to set up a Committee of Inquiry under Judge S S Fay QCCROWN AGENTSThe Minister of Overseas Development(Mrs. Judith Hart): With permission, I*&apos;sh to make a further statement aboutCrown Agents.. The House will recall that just before11 rose for the Christmas Recess I plained the immediate problems of the&quot;town Agents&apos; reserves and liquiditywhicli had been reported to me by thoChairman and board, and announcedS Governments agreement to provide&quot;&quot;ntcdjatc support of  85 million and the^cement of the Batik of England toProvide standby facilities.So far the Crown&quot; Agents have foundj!0 need to draw upon cither the  85 mil-Nor the standby-facility at the Bank of&quot;JjjSland to meet liquidity problems. Wei^U all hope that this will continue toJjj Hie case. But the support of the Gov-Nent stands firm and ready. Theurn-grant is there to cover prudent writingdown of assets as necessary, and to pre-vide a capital base.I would also like the House to know ofthe confidence I have in Mr. John Cuck-contingency, the new Chairman of the CrownAgents, and in his board. In the most difficult circumstances, they are overcom-ing the problems they faced on appoint-I mcnt with considerable success. Since! December, overseas principals have&apos; increased the scojx: and scale of their business with the Crown Agents. Con-iidence has increased, and it is right thatthis should be so, for die steady andgradual withdiawal from property invest-ments and secondary banking, accordingto my directive, is restoring a fundamentalfinancial soundness in their operations.I have now made further appointments to the btord. I have appointed Mr. HarryHoi!, Mr. James Jack and, with effect from 1st July, Mrs. Hester Boothroyd tojoin Mr. Leslie Kirkley and Mr. JohnGordon as members of the board. Ihave also appointed Mr. John Goblc, atpresent a member of the board, as deputy chairman.      &apos; 11 promised to keep the House informed.I can now make an interim report-notyet a final one, for reasons I shall make clear. In doing so. I know the house will understand and appreciate that itconcerns not the present but the past.The chairman has provided me withhis board&apos;s views on the circumstances which led to the need for financial sup-port, which have been assisted by the investigations carried out by Coopers andLybrand, the consulting accountants.These are not yet complete. They havehad to work on a very large number of transactions made over a long period oftime.The principal factors which the boardconsiders to have contributed to the prob-lems are: first, the operation of a sub-stantial banking business without an ade-quate capital base ; second, over-depen-dence on the property and secondarybanking sectors, and commitment of anunduly large proportion of the totalbanking resources to a small number ofborrowers: third, inadequate controlsand procedures for approving and moni-toring loans to subsidiary and associated companies, for security for advances, andfor the delegation of authority; fourth,
M7y Crown /incuts 23 A.&quot;.w.[Mrs. Harl.] - COlack of outside commercial banking cx-perience among senior stall&quot;. These delectsof the past arc rapidly being remedied.The Government have reached two major conclusions in the matter. We bc-Jieve it important and necessary, and theboard of the Crown Agents recommendsto arrange for an independent inquiry into past events and the circumstancesgiving rise lo the need for government support. Accordingly. I have decided loset up a committee&apos;of &quot;inquiry with thefollowing terms of reference:&quot;To inquire into the circumstances which led&quot;* , the Crown Agents requesting financialassistance from the Government.&quot;The inquiry will be conducted by JudgeFay, silting with Sir Edmund Compton*nd an accountant. There will, of course,be complete protection of the confidentialinterests of the overseas principals.I, We also propose to give further con-aeration lo the relationship between theCrown Agents and the Government. Isnail present a While Paper to the houses.1 a later stage-1 hope during this Scs-Bipn-with my detailed proposals, along*&apos;th the necessary background informa-tion about past custom and practice.Now that I have presented those twoniajor conclusions,&apos; 1 know that hon.Members will wish to join with me in expressing their confidence and supportJn the present chairman and his board,and in congratulating them on their very feat success in the last few months.Mr. Wood: Docs the right hon. Ladyrecall chiding me, in that gentle way shenas. with delay in these matters? Doesfne recognise that she started theseinvestigations in the 1960s and they n6w!0ok like going into the late 1970s if.indeed, she is still responsible for con-ducting them?T In the statement in which the right hon.f-ady has announced the selling up of the inquiry, lias she not to a large extent pre-Judgcd the findings of the inquiry?finally, what powers is the committee of inquiry to have? Amongst other things,W,H Sir Claude Hayes and others closely^?ncerned have full freedom to state their* views in accordance with the recommen-tohons of the Salmon Committee?&apos; Mrs. Hart: I confess that I am a little^rprised at the right hon. Gcntleman&apos;s22 N 4i&apos;Ji&apos;: Ciown Audits i-t$0kW^PNTfiHir^0&apos;&apos;00&apos;- because he has grcaT Knowledge of tins mailer, that Ihad asked for a study lo be made of theconstitutional relationship between theCrown Agenis and Ihe Government in thelast few months of 1970 when 1 was inmy present post, in which the right hon.Gentleman succeeded me. He is rightto say that I cliided him from time totime in the House, as did one or two ofmy hon. Friends. We then had theStevenson Report, which the right lion.Gentleman refused, to publish. I thinkit is fair to say that this Governmenthave done their best to come lo gripswith a situation in which that was greatlyneeded.As for the right hon. Genlleman*second point, the inquiry will be con-ducted by Judge Fay, Sir EdmundComplon and an accountant yet lo benamed. 1 am sorry that I cannot givethe name of ihe accountant today. Wehave no reason lo suppose thai any information requested will not bo forth-corning. I am certain, though this is amatter for the inquiry itself, that it will wish to have discussions with all thosewho have been involved in Crown Agents&apos;matters over the past few years.Mr. George Cunningham: Will myright hon. Friend accept congratulationson the speedy clean-up job she has doneover the past 10 months or so? Will sheanswer these questions? First, whilethe inquiry is being conducted, and indeedfrom now on, can we be sure that theannual reports produced by the CrownAgents will give very full information about the holdings they have, whether directly or indirectly, and ihe companieswilh which they have commercialassociation?Secondly, am I right in assuming thatif the Crown Agents draw upon any partof the  85 million standby cover theywill be answerable to the Public accounts committee but that Uiey will not beanswerable to the Public accounts committee otherwise?Mrs. Hart: I Confirm that what&apos;myhon. Friend said in the last part of his question is indeed so. I hope and believethat it will not prove necessary&apos; to drawon the  85 million. Indeed, it is very&apos;gratifying to be able to say that thishas not needed to be drawn on up to
now. I hops thai that situation will con-tiuuc. However, should there be drawv.ings, this would be a matter in which iffcaccounting officer of my department would hold responsibility and it wouldbe a matter for the Public accounts committee.On my hon. Fricnd&apos;s first point, hewill know that as from now I think Ihave given this information before, and certainly the Crown Agents have-the annual report of the CrownAgents is now, as distinct frompast practice, to be submitted to me sothat I may make it available to Parlia-mcnt, and the accounts will similarly bemade available to&apos; Parliament. Theaudited accounts for the last possible year.  1972 arc already in the Library. 1think my hon. Friend will find that they give the kind of information that is needed, but I am certain that if thisproves not to be the case the CrownAgents or myself would be very rcspon-sivc to any discussion about what fur-Ihcr information they might include.I Mr. llordern: May I echo theconfidence in Mr. Cuckney and the effortsthat he has so far Made:? With respectto the inquiry whiiih is about to takeplace, may we take it that the findingsin the Coopers and Lybrand report arctemporary findings and arc liable to thefullest possible justification by the fulljudicial inquiry which is to take placelater?On that point, will the right lion. Ladynot only allow that inquiry to make thefullest inquiries into all the matters whichhave occurred in the past but allow SirClaude Hayes, in giving his evidence, tosee the findings which that judicial inquirymay make, unlike the practice in the pastin Department of Trade investigations,and allow him to comment on any lincl-ings that the inquiry makes before thosefindings are published?Mrs. Hart: Obviously, the detailedconduct of the inquiry must be a matter for Judge Fay, who will be leading it,and for the other members of the inquiry.Il never has been the practice in the pastfor a Government, having set up an inquiry, lo regulate the precise way inwhich the inquiry is to be conducted, but&apos;1 am certain that the inquiry will wish togive every opportunity to all concernedfully to be acquainted with the whole22 N 6j situation and to say whatever llicy wantMr. Skinner: Will my right hon.Friend agree that one of the importantreasons why it has been her duty lo tell the House, not only on this occasion buton others, too, of the scandalous invest-commitments  and so on within the area of theCrown Agents is that the Crown Agentswanted the highest rate of return, andthat usually in this system of ours the&apos;highest rate of return can involve invest&apos;ments within the murky and seamy sideof life ; and the net result was that, like a good many other people who got theirfingers burned, they poured their moneyinto property speculation and. indeed, intoslum speculation?Will my right hon. Friend in futureinsist that investments are of a kind whichwill not leave her as a Minister to haveto come to the House, as the previousMinister did. in order to try lo explainaway how these investments have beenmade?Will my right hon. Friend also sec toit that the committee of inquiry willestablish quite clearly how., much moneyhas been lost as&apos; a result of all theseinvestments in these areas of secondarybanking, with a particular reference tothe amount of money that was lost as aresult of the investment in the ill-fatedStonchouse venture? All these matters should be investigated by the committeeof inquiry.Mri. Winifred Ewiug: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it not the case that today at Question Time, when Soul-tish Questions were answered, questionswhich were much shorter in duration thanthe one which we have just heard wereinterrupted by your good self as beingtoo long? Can you explain why it isthat the hon. Member who has just askeda supplementary question seems lo beallowed to ask as long a question as helikes?Mr. Speaker: I will try to make theposition clear. At Question Time theobject is to get as many Questionsanswered as possible. Long supplemen-tary questions cut out other Members&apos;supplementary questions and Questions.After statements, the considerations arenot quite the same.  It is a mailer for
i&apos;io3Crown Atji uls23l&apos;oiice[Mr. Speaker.]Jfydi^reiion. aULwugli I admit I do r&amp;ONFMBNFiOMZ INSTRUMENTSwren liavc  to  complain  of excessiveorevjty on the part of the hon. MemberWr Bolsovcr (Mr. Skinner).Perhaps the right hon. Lady will nowanswer the hon. Gentleman^ question.E. Mrs. Hart: My hon. Friend is right pointing to thc fact, which I outlined in niy earlier statement in December, thatJt Was the over-investment in propertycompanies and secondary banking, inwhich there had been a considerabledecline in the value of assets, which led10 tlie immediate crisis of liquidity inme Crown Agents. I have given a posi-five directive that this is now to diminish.a&quot;d the Crown Agents are now verysensibly withdrawing in a phased way-because; it is correct to phase it from both secondary banking and properties,pincc October over  59 million has beenilhdrawn from property and secondaryanking by the Crown Agents.L,On the second point about LondonCapital, I think I made it clear a monthQr two ago that this is a matter for thecommercial judgment of the CrownA8ents and that they are acting entirely in accordance with their best and mostprudent judgment in this matter. It isnot strictly a matter in which I would regard it as proper for me to intervene.Mr. Sfanbrook: Does not the experienceQf Hie Crown Agents confirm the follyof any Government or quusi-GovcrmnciUInstitution using its assets to operate infields in which it lias neither qualifica-hoiis nor suitability?Mrs. Hart: What emerges clearly-a,nd I hope we have now corrected &apos;th 3Situation-is that if we have a valuableGovernment institution, which the CrownAgents is-it has the most tremendousramifications and involvement and an excellent reputation for its procurementpolicies and all its other activities onbehalf 6f many overseas investments and overseas public corporations it is of thegreatest importance that we have people who are best able to make the right kindof. judgments in the operations in whichtuey are involved. I think my ownAppointments since July have created aboard with the expertise and judgmentt0 enable these matters to be correctlyadministered from now on.V 22 n 6Ordered,That the clrafTTVccrcation (Northern Ireland)Order 1975 be refefved to a Standing Com-mittcc on Statutory instruments.Ordered,That thc draft trouble Taxation Relief(Taxes on Income) (Indonesia) Order 1975 bereferred to a Standing Committee on statutory instruments. /Ordered,      IThat the Input Tax (Exceptions) (No. 1)Order 1975 (S.I/ 1975, No. 624) be refcto a Standing Committee on Statutory In:commitments .

? 16 October 1?75 the Minister for Overseas Development (Mr Reg Prentice) announced the Governments intention to publish a White Paper setting out their proposals for producing legislation to incorporate the Crown Agents.ICROWN AGENTS   &quot;The Minister for Overseas Development(Mr. Reg Prentice): Witli permission. I wish to make a further statement aboutthe financial position of the Crown Agentsfind other matters relating to that organisation. .   -My predecessor announced in Deccm-bcr 1974 that the Government had n&quot;l\v *jto provide a recoverable grant of t%million to thc Crown Agents to cover thcWriting down of asset values in their 1974 ]accounts as then foreseen and to providefinancial backing appropriate lo their operations, and that standby facilities hadnlso been arranged with thc Bank of:l-nglnnd.I have now received the auditedaccounts for 1973 and 1974 and have placed conies in thc Libraries of bothHouses, The balance sheet as at 31stDecember 1974 shows that thc Govern-Went grant of  85 million was not enoughHI the event to avoid a technical stateof insolvency, with liabilities exceeding-jjsscts at that date by some  15 million.This was because a greater degree ofWriting down of asset values and pro-vision for losses were found necessary forthe period covered by the accounts.1 should emphasise that the CrownAgents have no immediate liquidityProblems. They have still not needed todraw on the  85 million grant or ondie standby facility. I am also reassured u&quot;y the thorough and energetic actionwhich has already been taken by Ihe new board of thc Crown Agents, under itsChairman. Mr. Cuckncy. to clear up thei Problems of thc past end lay the ground-Work of a more soundly based future forthe organisation. 1 should like to pay% own tribute to their efforts.Nevertheless,   without   Governmenthacking the Crown Agenls would atPresent be in a difficult position, which .could affect the confidence of depositorsand others.   1 have therefore thought itdesirable formally to reaffirm the assur- \^uee given by my predecessor in Decem-ber 1974, that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern- &apos;^ent stand behind the Crown Agents. &apos;.Hon. Members will find Ihe terms of myAssurance to thc Chairman in his cover-,n5 report on thc 1974 accounts, and II emphasise now to thc House that the\! Government wish lo see the Crown Agentscontinue in being fo* thc sake of thoValuable services which they arc able torender both to their many overseas prin- jcjpals in the developing world and toHer Majcsty&apos;8 Government in theirNations with overseas countries.        \_r.QMLike my predecessor I am. however,concerned that thc future activities of theCrown Agenls, and their relations with ministers, should be on a more closely\&apos;devinpil btt$*S Tlic Government have been.raucMbouuht to thc future status,., -structure and functions of Ihc Crown (j i Agents. Wc have decided that the rightsolution will be to introduce legislation which would confer independent legal.,, personality on thc Crown Agents by in-j , corporal ing them, define their functionsj for the future and provide that specified. powers of direction should rest with;I&apos; Ministers.! -. This would create a well understood jI i relationship of a kind which exists be-]i Iwccn a number of bodies in the public,11 ::sector and the Ministers responsible fort,i - them.  It would clarify the rcsponsibili-; &quot;tics of thc Government in exercising thc&apos; - broad oversight over tho activities of theCrown Agents that has been shown to!be desirable by all that has happened;While leaving it lo the Board to run theirown day-to-day affairs. It would not dis-^turb thc traditional relationship betweentI them and their principals.I&apos;. !;    My predecessor lold the House in April Ithat she hoped to publish a While Paper!I &quot;during the present session giving the Gov-1- i governments thinking on these mailers.   Ij&apos; shall not quite be able to meet thai target,j but I hope to publish a While paper i shortly to set out our present view of thcI provisions which will or may be required,&apos; in the legislation to incorporate theI&apos; Crown Agents.IMeanwhile, I should inform thc Houseof a further complication arising fromthe past activities of thc Crown Agentsj -which will have to be dealt with separately -j-ately and in advance of this legislation.I was informed in August by the Chair-. man that certain loans made by the CrownAgents either directly  or  through  anominee, company might be challengedas unenforceable, on the grounds that, thc Crown Agents were neither licensed: moneylenders under the terms of theMoneylenders Acts nor a bank for thepurposes of those Acts.   The Crown: Agents are advised that if this matter:&apos;werc brought before thc courts, they&quot;Would have a good defence particularly on the basis (hut they and their si nil arc; &quot;exempt from Ihe operation of these and! as Crown servants.   However, if lherewere a challenge in. the courts tho mailer&quot;might lake a long time to resolve. Mean-t  . while thc Crown Agents&apos; financial position. /might be seriously worsened by the with-1 ,-holding of loan repayments and interestI ,,(1110) a nil In other ways.pncM-riAi/U7,
This would increase the-potential call.on the Exchequer for financial support for the Crown Agents to a degree whichWe should find quite unacceptable inthe circumstances. It would mean lhat&apos;a heavy additional liability would fall ondie public purse, and that oilier creditorsof those property and other companies to which the Crown Agents had madeloans would be in a position to benefit by taking advantage of an uncertainty inthe application of legislation. I think itis essential to put this anomalous situationfight. The Government will thcrcforointroduce a Bill, for consideration as early as possible in the next Session, to put the matter beyond doubt.Mr. Maudiing: These arc serious anddisturbing figures, and no doubt at theappropriate lime wc shall wish lo dis-cuss how the Crown Agents, with theirfireat traditions, got into this situation,Dut I imagine that wc shall have to await the report of the Fay Committee, which&apos;&apos;l have all the facts before it.The Crown Agents arc a considerableasset to this country and provide very valuable services lo their principalsoverseas. The Minister can therefore lake11 from me that we support him in his desire to give all the help he can to thenew chairman and the new Board.-With regard lo the legislation, will hojj*e note that wc shall look carefully atjjjo actual proposals, bearing in mindll,at the main need of legislation at thisslnge is to ensure the confidence of the overseas principals in the Crown Agents?.V.**r..prcnlice: I thank the right hon.^ciyibcr for his statement.     He has^minded the House that the events of*ccnt years, which have given rise tojsrcat concern, are being-considered byj .lclEo Fay and colleagues working with&apos;   They will. I think, take a few&quot;Ore months lo complete their work, but&quot;viously then there will be an occasionor a wider discussion of what has hap-in the past&quot;Mad 1 rc8ard to *he future. I am veryII **-that the Opposition agree with usVat1 luC Crown Agents perform a very&apos;&apos;uable service which should continue\d that we should give them the appro-Pria,e supportMr. David Steel: I, too, welcome thoCPS that the Minister has mentionedtJ!s afternoon. Will he confirm that, ifuls. Nvcrc a private company, it would.y&quot;solvent, and will he give an under-l .ln8 to the House that tho inquiryj ln6 made into its operations and.Wncei will be made public and pub-M,cd- lo the House? ...   -mr.. Prcnlicc: The answer to (he latter point is. &quot; Yes &quot;. I think the answer tothe former point would also be, &quot; Yes &quot;.It will not have escaped the attention ofthe House lhat a great many privateenterprise companies if &quot;enterprise&quot; isthe appropriate word-got their lingerspretty severely burned in the propertymarket, and.-in secondary banking and activities of that kind.Mrs. Ilarl: May I welcome very muchmy right hon. Fricnd&apos;s statement, andparticularly the policy that is to be pur--sued in terms of the future incorporation-of the Crown Agents. I am quite certain&quot;that lhat is the right course to pursue. --;. May I also say lhat 1 very much hope:lhat the Fay Committee of inquiry will-go very deeply into the causes of the:misadvenlures, of lite past, which were,-as he said, largely concerned with adven-Uur^s iivthq properly and secondary bank-ing secior.May I also say to him thai I totallyshare his own confidence in the future.of the Crown Agents and in all the tre-(mendous and very difficult work that:the new Board and the new chairmanJiave carried out since they were appointed a year ago.Mr. Prentice: I am grateful to myright hon. Friend for the way in which she has put those points. I think that,on relation to this whole rather tangled*story, a tribute should be paid lo her,first, for. the work she did from theOpposition Front Bench in probing into these matters and persistently questioningthe Government of the day, and secondly,for the prompt action she look on assuming-ing office, and particularly the directionsshe gave to the Crown Agcnls, which have provided a framework within which theyarc now working, and which they are fully implementing.&apos;Mr. Tapsell: Arising out of the lastpart of the right hon. Gentleman&apos;s staic-mcnt, will he give an assurance that the- legislation, the introduction of which ho:is contemplating, will not bo rclrospcc-rtive to the.extent that it weakens Ihofprcseiit legal position of one of the parliesito.the possible legal controversy to which-he referred?. Mr. Prentice: The House will be gladI &quot;to know that we have in mind a veryi short Bill which will clarify the position about which there is some doubt.

; Mr. George Cunningham: Will the minister accept that sonic of us have&quot;almost exhausted our capacity for sur-prise at the successive manifestations ofincompetence which have been shown inTunning the Crown Agents, and that thisshows how unwise it was for the House.of Commons Select Committee on Ovcr-jseas Development just over a year ago to.,terminate its investigation of the Crown&quot;Agents, which might have revealed this-latest exampje of incompetence a bitisooncr than it has been rcvcalcd7 . -&apos; Are we to understand that there willbe two Bills, one the declaratory Bill onthe point he has just mentioned and.the ,&quot;other on.the relationship of the. Crown ,Agents to Government and Parliament?-If there are to be two Bills, will thesecond Bill be produced in the immcdi-ately forthcoming session as -well as thofirst?1 Secondly, may we be told what is Hie state of play on the papers which were &apos;referred to the Director of Public Proseeu-tions in respect of some of the, staff, and how many of the staff of tpc Crown iAgents have cither been..dismissed or are &apos;.currently suspended ; pending finvestiga-lions? &apos; ...Mr. Prentice r My hon. Friend alsoplayed an active part in helping to draw attention to all the things that had gone:wrong in the past, and I pay-tribute lohim for that. But I think he was wrong in saying that I had revealed some furtherexample of incompetence. 1 have drawn attention to a legal doubt which has arisenand which might be damaging, unless itWere corrected, to tho finances of thoI Crown Agents. - . ..: ; ..- I; think that the story of recent months has been a success story. The CrownAgents arc disengaging as fast as they prudently can from the wrong type of investment in which they were engagedin the past. Their current activities aresucceeding.&apos;and their overseas principals.i including 120 different governments anda number of other organisations, showcontinuing confidence in then&apos;).As to my hon.  Friend&apos;s questioni whether there will be two Bills, I envisage; a very short Bill on the narrow legal point that 1 mentioned. I also envisage a white paper, very shortly, which will itself leadto, further legislation, though not quite.. as quickly probably not in the nexti session.. &apos;  -       &apos;. With regard to his point about theDirector of Public Prosecutions, I have nothing to add to the reply that my hon., Friend the Parliamentary Secretary gavehi January. This mutter is still.with theDirector of Public Prosecutions.. It is- taking a long-time. It is not a matter over which I have any control. &apos;     &apos; .. I do not have a figure for the number or staff dismissed, but 1 will look into itand give my hou. Friend any information that J.,can..    . ,.mr., Peter Rccs : The Minister has made it clear that the financial position of theCrown Agents depends to a certain extent on the delicate question whether theyacted as bankers or as moneylenders incertain transactions. However, he was somewhat ambiguous in his reply to myhon. Friend the Member for Horncastlc(Mr. Tapsell). May we have an explicitassurance that the legislation which theright hon. Gcr-tleman contemplates willnot retrospectively affect bodies and individuals, persons and partnerships whohave been involved in transactions withthe Crown Agents and who may evencurrently be in litigation with them? Someof those . involved are themselves in financial difficulties. I understand thatone company is in the hands of liquidation-tors. It would be grossly unfair if thesematters were clarified retrospectively in a sense unfavourable to those other parties.&apos; Mr. Prentice : I am sure that the house would consider it unfair if the CrownAgents were unable through a legal lech-nicality to recover money owing to them.That is what wc seek lo clarify and toensure by this short piece of legislation;which I propose to introduce.Mr. Skinner i Is not the truth of thiswhole affair that a large sum of money was available for investment and was; invested mainly in slum property empires,i just like the investments of many private&apos;;Companies, some of which have  been! referred to already?  The fact is that theiCrown Agents got their fingers burned-as a result of those investments because!of the escalation of property values and- the subsequent falling-olf in values. Arc,wc to take it that this liny group of people,Who have squandered someone clsc&apos;smoney and subsequently have had to uselarge amounts of the British taxpayers&apos;money to try to remain solvent, apparently:withoul success, will be dealt with inaccordance with so-called British justice?Will my right hon. Friend assure us thatif there are to be bankruptcy procccd-ings against these people, as there ought:to be, they will be dealt with in the&apos; same way as the 11 people at Clay Crossabout whom my right hon. Friend knows&apos;so much having their cars and furniture[ taken away because they acted not inaccordance with  wanting to line theirpockets and someone else&apos;s but in accord-;ance with, high moral principles?. Mr. Prentice: There is a tremendoustemptation to debate Clay Cross with, my hon. Friend but, unfortunately, thatwould be out of order. Perhaps wc might continue that argument somewhere else.. The events which we all deplore arc under&quot;investigation by Judge Fay and two oilier-distinguished people.   1 shall await their report, and that report will be made&quot;known to the House. Then wc can debatethese matters.   I do not think that ,-mytof these proceedings arc helped by the, cheap  smcers   which   are   typical   of. remarks by my hon. Friend the MemberjiJW3u\l[SivM(Mr. Skinner).
ft&apos; &apos;I  Mr. Cosiain: Is the Minister awarothat the Public  Accounts Committeeendeavoured to look into these matters inpast years but was prevented from doing so because the accounts were not auditedby the Comptroller and Auditor-General?Will the new  arrangements  put  thej accounts under the authority of the Comp-j (roller and Auditor-General so that thei Public Accounts Committee may dealwith these matters, or will they be matters&apos;for the nationalised industries&apos; accounts?I Mr. Prentice: The accounts which have(been placed in the Library today have acommentary by the Comptroller aridAuditor-General. Therefore they couldbe studied by the Public Accounts Com-mittcc if it saw fit.Mr. Lcc: My right lion. Friend has! ninde a low-key statement, but is not thisI n profoundly   unsatisfactory   slate  ofaffairs? Will he reconsider the point is made by my hon. Friend the Member forIslington, South and Fjjnsbuty (Mr.J Cunningham)? Docs not. this call for ai.public inquiry under the Public Tribunalsi Act? Will my right hot).. Fripnd also; say how much additional- money will bei required in the interim, since the sub-,; vention provided by his predecessor, as\ he said, clearly  proved  inadequate?finally, may 1 congratulate my right hon.Friend on the fact that his stridentaversion to nationalisation is not whollyj inflexible? \I   Mr. Prentice: It is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, of course. My hon. Friend! described my statement as &quot;low key&quot;,j The simple reason is that it is a. sequel&apos; to two statements to the House by my,: predecessor which dealt with the matteri far more fundamentally. As to whether there should be a study by a tribunal,i there is a study being carried out byJudge Fay  helped  by  Sir  EdmundCompton and an accountant, Mr. Peter; Godfrey-\1  Mr. Lee: But it is not a public inquiry.Mr. Prentice: This is taking place in private. That was thought right, and itWas not challenged in the House when itWas first announced. But there will be a. public statement about it in due course.As for the amount of additional moneythat wilt be needed, the significant point: is that the  85 million of standby facili-&apos; tics at the bank has not been used. WhatWc arc saying is that there will bo con-tinued Government backing.    Whetherthe money will be used and to what extent it, will be needed, we cannot fore-tell. That depends on many imponder-&apos;able factors in the future.   Certainly I. shall keep the House informed of any&quot;ifinificant developments,.&apos;,    .,,.Mr. Michael Marshall: Although wcwelcome in general the proposal aboutthe future stale of lite Crown Agents intheir incorporated form, subject to anystudy of the While Paper, may I ask the 1right hon. Gentleman to be more clear--cut about allowing freedom in day-to-day management and perhaps, in that context,stress what he omitted to say in his slale-ment that, in addition to serving their (overseas principals and the government themselves, the Crown Agents arc serving (as a form of direct and invisible exports,which arc of value to the country?   I,hope that that side of their activities willbe strengthened and encouraged in thefuture.Mr. Prentice: The operations of thoCrown Agents are of great value to thecountry in many ways that we cannotmeasure, because their activities createopportunities which lead indirectly tofurther investment, exports and so on.The work which they do in trainingpeople overseas is of help and of indirectbenefit to this country, too.As for the details of the division ofpowers bclween Hie Minister and thoCrown Agents when Ihcy arc incor-poratcd. I ask the hon. Gentleman loawait the While Paper. We are stillconsidering that. But wc envisage some-thing broadly comparable with thorelationship which exists already betweenmany Ministers and Ihe nationalised industries. I am sure that Ihe Housowould not want a Minister in this house to answer for day-to-day decisions. Onedifficulty at the moment is that the situa-lion is so unclear in the constitutionalsense nnd needs clarification by new arrangements of this kind.Mrs. Hart: I am grateful, Mr. Speaker,for being allowed to intervene a second time. Will my right hon. Friend confirmto a number of my hon. Friends, first,that the problem about holding a public inquiry, which was considered very care-fully at Ihc lime, is that a great dealof the evidence which has to he givento the Fay Committee has to come fromcompanies and banks, is highly confidential -tial and would not have been forlhcom-ing at a public inquiry? Will my right on. Friend assure them also that thoseagainst whom it is possible that chargesmight be made arc under study by thoDirector of Public Prosecutions? Willhe assure them, further, that all hough agreat deal of Government money linnbeen required to sustain confidence inthe Crown Agents nnd to provide stand-by credits, it has not been spent orneeded lo be spent&apos;/Mr. IVmlliv i I think Hint I can givoan allirinalivo answer lo all three of myright hon.

j* 29 November 1976 tha Minister ffcP^&amp;ftfe^ Wilopment (Mr Reg Prentice), in replyo a question froa Mr Frank B^oley, announced that token provision had been made in t]&quot; nter Supplementary BrtinatMi to cover the liability on Her Majesty1 s CJovernmentrising troti the technical insolvency of the Crown Agents.rCrown AgentsMr. Hooley asked the Minister for overseas Development what provision hehas made for the contingent liability ofpublic funds arising out of his assurances of support for the Crown Agents ; and ifhe will make a statementMr. Prentice: Token provision hasbeen made in the Winter supplementary estimates to cover the liability on her majesty&apos;s Government arising from thetechnical insolvency of the Crown Agents.My predecessor made a statement in theHouse on 18th December 1974 announ-influencing the Governments support for theCrown Agents, and I reaffirmed this assur-ance of support on 16th October 1975.The Crown Agents have not so far needed to seek additional financial support from her Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Sup-plementiry Estimates provision is neces-sary now only as a formal indication ofthe continuing contingent liability. Thisoverall liability takes account of certaincontingent liabilities on the Crown Agentsarising from contracts for the supply ofBritish goods and services, includingdefence eamoment, undertaken by one oftheir wholly-owned subsidiaries, MillbankTechnical Services Limited, to which Ihave given my specific agreement.-r-
y 1977 the Minister for Overseas Development (Mrs Judith Hart), in reply to an from Mr Der^s Skinner, made the following announcement about the managementCrown Agents1 property investments in Australia.OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENTCrown Agents1 Mr. Skinner asked the Minister of.Overseas Development if she will makea statement on the present position with; regard to the Crown Agents&apos; investmentI in Australian property.j Mrs. Hart : My predecessors and I have discussed with the Crown Agents howmy directive in 1975 that ihey should carry out an orderly phased withdrawal from thc secondary banking and propertyfields should be applied to their mvest-ments in the Abbey Capital Property: Group in Australia. It was clear that theCrown Agents could not be certain of implementing any strategy to this end asminority shareholders in the group, eventhough they had put up almost all thedevelopment finance. They were, there-fore, authorised to negotiate with theother interests involved with a view to securing full control of the group. Theyhave now succeeded in obtaining this at a reasonable cost. They have alsobeen able to strengthen their manage-ment arrangements for thc group, bothia Ausiraiia and in London.I have made it clear to the CrownAgents that I shall wish for continuingconsultations about the ctrategy tc oefollowed in conducting the affairs of thegroup, which must take account of trends in the Australian market. I intend to review with the Crown Agents their policy for the group at regular intervals in thelight of market trends, and have asked the Crown Agents for six-monthly reports.Meanwhile, the Crown Agents have tomeet or refinance certain existing obliga-tions in Australia. For this purpose Ihave agreed that they should borrow upto US $220 million from a consortium ofUnited Kingdom banks, of which US$210 million is to be used in Australiaand US $10 million for commitments else-where. An agreement to this end hasbeen concluded with rry approval. Iwould stress that this does not mean an expansion of the Crown Agents&apos; iii^restsin Australia, but is required solely tomeet existing commitments.
ANNEX JLCROWN AGENTS : INVESTMENT AND LENDING POLICYReferences to the Crown Agents in this paper include their subsidiary companies.2-     The Crown Agents will make any investment of resources belongingto or under the control of their overseas Principals in respect of whichthey have explicit instructions from those Principals, to whom they will beanswerable for those investments.3-     Where they are investing resources belonging to or under the controlof their overseas Principals but are exercising their own discretion as tothe investments made, or where they are offering advice as to investmentsto be made under 2. above, the Crown Agents, with a view to protectingtheir own good name and the position of Ministers from whom they hold their appointment, will take care to avoid transactions which might belikely to embarrass HMG.4-     In all their investment and lending operations in connection with their0^n account funds the Crown Agents will be guided by the best standards ofo&amp;nking prudence and the normal requirements of the Bank of England andby * similar regard for their own good name and for the position of MinistersThey wm equally conduct their operations so as to avoid conflict with, or damage to, the interests of their overseas Principals.5- In general the financial and banking operations of the Crown Agentsar*e to be directed towards maintaining their reserves at a level suitablyrekted to the overall requirements of their business and to the adequateCaPitalisation cf their subsidiaries.1.
6-     When lending money to other institutions or persons the Crown AgentswiU do their best, insofar as possible, to acquaint themselves with thefull activities of the borrowers and the use to which such money is to be putand will seek to ensure that any loans which they make are employed inaccordance with the general considerations in paragraph 4. of this paper.7 mThe Crown Agents will not on their own account take a controllinglnterest in companies, other than those established as wholly-owned8ubsidiaries to deal with existing business already being undertaken,without prior discussion with the Minister.  Any proposed investment ofor more in the equity of a quoted company will be subject to prior approval by the Minister.The Crown Agents shall not engage directly in the property market,0*her than in respect of property for their own occupation or on thee*plicit instructions of an overseas Principal.  Any extension of their own account activities into this field will be subject to prior approval by theMinister.The Crown Agents will carry out an orderly phased withdrawal from^e 8phere of secondary banking activities.^&apos;   In all transactions, whether on their own account or for Principals,^e Crown Agents will, of course, be subject where relevant to the*change Control regulations of the Bank of England.2F

The Crown Agents haveUready recovered a total of  5.8m (most of which comes from the successful sale of&apos;hj English and Continental Homes site at Warmley, Avon).
