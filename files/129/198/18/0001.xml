I attach a memorandum by officials on this problem.2. I agree with the conclusion that the Government cannot voluntarilypay Stage 2 of any of the increases recommended by the various ReviewBodies (option ii. in paragraph 8) without creating considerablepresentational difficulties for pay policy.3. If this is accepted the aim must be to concede Stage 2 only in those cases where we are legally obliged to do so.    The most difficult case is thatof the consultants.    Whether we should let them test their case in the courts(option iii. ) or concede it at the outset (option i. ) depends very much on our judgement of the legal position.    In general however I would favour the strongest possible resistance to these claims.    But if the consultantsmanage to get Stage 2 and any others follow it will be increasingly difficultto hold the line, even where the legal entitlement is comparatively weak.PCivil Service Department28 November 1977
REVIEW BODY ON TOP SALARIES SIXTH REPORTSTAGED payments memorandum by officials.    Ministers decided (before the introduction of the pay policy)&quot;to stage the implementation of increases in salary due to certaingroups of higher paid staff who were the subject of recommen-Sations by the various Review Bodies (TSRB, DDRB).   In all cases,the payment of the second stage was deferred under the terms ofthe pay policy.   This paper considers the implications for thesestaged payments of the Law Officers&apos; opinion about the contractualright of NHS Consultants to the payment of their second stage, atleast from 1 April 1977.   It also considers the implications for nationalised Industries Board Members (NIBMs) for whom no paymentstave yet been authorised, and for the salaries of Members ofParliament. overage2*    The groups involved are the Higher Civil Service, the higher judiciary, Senior Members of the Armed Forces, the nationalised industries Board Members all covered by Report No 6 of the review body on Top Salaries, NHS Consultants covered by Report No 5 ofthe Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration;   those who^ve their salaries adjusted consequential upon salary adjustmentsfor these main groups, and Members of Parliament covered byRePort No 7 of the Review Body on Top Salaries.   The presentPosition of each of these groups is set out at Annex A.3*    Two of the groups whose salary adjustments are consequentialuPon revisions of the pay of NIBMs are the directors of British^clear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) and of the Radio Chemical Centre (TRC).These present separate but related problems.   The IPCS, who^Present them, claim that the BNFL directors have a contractual^ght from their terms of appointment to continue a link withCiv&quot;il Service salaries which they enjoyed as officials beforeB^L was formed in 1971.   The Attorney General has advised thatthere is a strong probability that the IPCS would be successful111 the legal action which they are threatening.   The circumstances0f the directors of TRC are identical.   If conceded, or determined
by the Courts ia favour of the IPCS. this claim would giveimmediate entitlement to what the Higher Civil Service hasreceived from 1 January 1975. and would place these directors inthe same position as civil servants in respect of second stage-payments, except that their contracts are clearly known to be legally enforceable.Incomes Policy considerations .     This policy requires that the cost of any start made to correct serious anomalies which have arisen during the period of strict pay guidelines should be offset against the 10$ earningslimit for settlements.   Increases in excess of the guidelinesarising from statutory obligations can be paid, and it is also recognised that powers to restrict awards which have contractualforce is now limited to breaches in the 12 months&apos; rule.5.     In this case we are dealing with the recommendations for settlement dates before the onset of the pay policy, and with -pre-policy commitments announced by the Prime Minister.on20 December 1974 (TSRB) and by the Secretary of State for social services on 18 April 1975 (Consultants) which were postponedunder the provisions of the Remuneration, Charges and GrantsAct 1975.   If they cannot be postponed further under the powersvested in the Secretary of State for Employment under this Act,incomes policy considerations do not strictly speaking apply &quot;bothem.6.     Nevertheless, whatever the technical and legal positions,it is obvious that large cash payments to well paid people in *^epublic sector and outside Round 3 could create a substantialpresentational problem.   The complex merits of such paymentscould not be readily explained.   This difficulty would be much reduced if it were possible to present these increases as thecorrection of an anomaly within the current guidelines.   But tbiswould mean treating the cases as anomalies arising during theperiod of strict pay guidelines (which they are not) and pre-empting money which should be available for pay increases due i11the present round.   It would not be likely to be acceptable to
8.The available options therefore seem to be:i.       to concede that the Consultants must be paid their second stage in full from 1 April 1977.   This would be inconformity with the Law Officers&apos; view that contractualrights established before 11 July 1975 cannot, under theSecretary of State for Employment*s powers underSection 1(5) of the Remuneration, Charges and GrantsAct 1975, be held up beyond the normal settlement date inthe year beginning 1 August 1976.    It would inevitably mean that any other groups who could show that their contractualposition was as good as the Consultants would also have tobe paid;    for example, Judges should they decide to removetheir waiver, and perhaps also any consequentials of theCivil Service in fringe bodies who have legally enforceablecontracts who were told initially that the second stage pay-ment was due from 1 January 1976 and subsequently that itwas postponed under pay policy.   There would also be strong pressure for the Government to act similarly for other the groups concerned, especially to those who believe they have a legal right to the money so far withheld.   It would effectivelyPostpone any solution of the overall problems, and it would not provide an effective answer if the issue came to court. he Options7.     As will be seen from Annex A, consideration of the optionsfor dealing with the NHS Consultants in the light of the LawOfficers&apos; opinion brings into play a series of complex inter-relationships.   Action over the opinion as to the contractualright of the Consultants cannot be long delayed as the health departments need to respond to the specific enquiries they havereceived, to advise the health authorities on their position, and&quot;to be ready to answer questions likely to be posed shortly by the doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body.    In determining the options,the relationship with present pay policy has to be considered,ar*d it also has to be borne in mind that as far as contractualrights are concerned, these relate to the rights of the individualw*which are not extinguished by arrangements which may have beenaocepted by their representatives.
groups, eg the Civil Service and the Armed Forces whose contrac-tual position is less clear.   This in turn could affect theGovernments position on NIBMs who have no contractual right to payment but a better case on merits, and it could result in increased pressure on MPs* pay.ii. to accept that the outstanding commitment to paymentof the second stage increases need not be further postponedin Round 3 of the pay policy, and to select a date for pay-ment accordingly.   This could be any date after 1 August 1977but probably most conveniently the first settlement datethereafter, ie 1 April 1978 for the Consultants.   This wouldmean ignoring the Law Officers1 advice that a contractualobligation exists from 1 April 1977 to the Consultants.    Itwould not therefore eliminate the risk of legal action by individuals, and it would leave the problem of how toexplain the position.   Moreover, since this decision would notrest on the need to act to meet the contractual obligationthere would be no way of distinguishing between the variousgroups.   This in turn would increase the pressure from NIBMsand possibly from MPs.iii. to leave the Consultants no option but to test their case at law by suing the health authority.   The authority might win, in which case the position would remain unchanged.The probability according to the best legal advice obtainableis, however, that they would lose.    If they did the positionwould be no better than at i. above, except to the extent that the time taken to settle the case might move the effectto a less sensitive time in terms of pay policy.    It wouldbe rather worse than ii. because it would publicly expose the weakness of the Round 2 position.   The internal reper-cussions of the legal decision would remain.   Moreover, theSecretary of State for Social services endeavours toimprove relations with the medical world might well beirreparably damaged.   There is also a distinct possibility that before the matter reached the courts the BMA and theDDRB would themselves expose the weakness of theGovernment&apos;s stance.
conclusion.     Considerations of pay policy seem to rule out the&quot;voluntary&quot; implementation of State 2 payments outside the round 3 guidelines whatever its technical status as a pre-policycommitment.   Quite apart from the adverse effect which such-Large cash increases would have, there would then be no justi-fication for withholding full implementation of the TSRB recommen-^ations for all the other groups as well, including NIBMs andtheir consequentials who would have to get Stage 1 as well.   Evenlri the context of legal vulnerability this is not really a viable0Ption as it would be likely to create the maximum embarrassment to pay policy,^0.   But if Stage 2 has to be conceded to the Consultants oniegal grounds, the Government will have to decide whether to concede Stage 2 to the other groups for reasons of equity;    orAether pay policy considerations must restrict the concession^0 those groups who can also establish a legal right to it.    but before that situation is reached it will be necessary to decide whether in view of the Law Officers&apos; opinion the Government hasno alternative but to give the Consultants&apos; Stage 2 from1 April 1977 as a legal entitlement without testing the practiceln the Courts;    or whether there is sufficient element of doubt^0 justify leaving it to the Consultants to sue the health authorities.   The Government will also wish to bear in mind in^his context that the position over civil servants legal rightsls by no means clear, and that if it is decided to proceed only after action in the courts, the Civil Service unions mightPursue their case in this way too (as the IPCS are already known^0 be contemplating),1 -1&apos;*   The position on the two special cases of BNPL and TRC isS:i-niilar in its legal aspects to that of the Consultants, though&apos; * relates to an entitlement, via the Civil Service position, to^tage I payment from 1 January 1975*   The decision on this againspends on whether the Law Officers&apos; opinion leaves no alternativeu&quot;k to grant payment of Stage I, or whether there is sufficient^doubt to leave the IPCS to sue in the courts0   The strength of^e legal view appears to be similar to that for the ConsultantsSo the two should move in step.
NHS CONSULTANTSNHS Consultants are in contract with statutory Health Authorities(which are the agents of the Secretaries of State for social services for the administration of the National Health Service);which were directed, early in 1976, that in pursuance of the payPolicy, the staged payments which were due to be paid from1 April 1976 were not to be payable from that date.     They areentitled to further advice as to what to do, and in particular to know if they are to face a continuing risk of being sued.2.     The Law Officers1 opinion is that the NHS Consultants havea contractual right to the payment of their second stage, andthat while this right would probably be held to have been lawfullyPostponed under the first round of pay policy if a determination to that effect were made by the Secretary of State for EmploymentUnder section 1(5) of the Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act3-975, there is a substantial risk that legal action to securePayment from 1 April 1977 under the second round of the policy^ould be successful even in the face of a purported determinationt^at it may be further postponed.3-     The opinion indicates that in the view of the Law officers the Health Authorities would be in breach of contract if they didnot make these payments from 1 April 1977, and that Consultants,if they were to sue, would stand a very good chance of success.This raises the issue whether, in the face of a threat to sue,the Government should allow the legal action to take its course,0r should in the light of the legal advice they have obtainedaQcept that payment must be made.     It also raises the questionot how to deal with direct questions about the statutory basisnon-payment which have now been put by the BMA and andividual Scottish Consultant.     The Health Departments have so far avoided a direct answer, saying that the matter of stagedPayments is under consideration, but they cannot put off anahs3Wer for very much longer and would be in an insupportablepoeihion if they were to expose the extent of their presentCONFIDENTIAL
knowledge and nevertheless were to force the issue to thecourts.     The Departments had previously heard that the BMAwere considering litigation, and the present enquiries suggestthat this consideration continues.     At the least health authorities would have to be advised that they might be sued,and this advice could not be given confidentially.4.     Further, the DDRB have, on a number of occasions,expressed the view that the staged payments should be made, but have accepted that this was not possible because of incomes policy.     They have asked the Department to provide themwith evidence on the effect of incomes policy on the wish that the doctors and dentists have expressed to them thatthey should immediately reconsider medical and dental salaries.It is highly likely that they will seek an explanation from theDepartments of the legal basis for continuing to withhold pay-ment, and will publish the answer.     The Departments take theview that they would have if challenged directly on this point to answer the DDRB on the basis of the advice that the LawOfficers have given.THE HIGHER JUDICIARY5.     The Higher Judiciary has a statutory right to payment ofthe second stage from 26 July 1976.     The position is at presenprotected by voluntary waivers the terms of which (in England)are:&quot;Notwithstanding that the salary legally payable to mewith effect from 26 July 1976 in respect of the judicialoffice I now hold is [ X] a year, I wish to be paid the salary payable with effect from 26 July 1975 in respect ofthat office and in respect of any judicial office I mayhereafter hold until such time as there is an increase inany of the salaries mentioned in the statement by thePrime Minister on 20 December 1974;    and I abandon any claim for payment of money withheld from me in accordancewith this wish.&quot;(The terms of the waiver, though not the essential substance)differs in Scotland).confidential
formally the Judges&apos; waivers are already spent through thePayment of the supplement of  208.80 earlier this year to allthe TSRB groups, including those specifically mentioned in thestatement.     The Judges have not sought, on the strength ofthis, to assert their statutory right to Stage 2 increases; hutclearly they might consider doing so if the Consultants were toreceive such increases while they and the other TSRB groupscontinued to be denied them.     In any event they would certainlyno longer regard themselves as bound by the waivers.THE HIGHER CIVIL service.     Although it is generally believed that civil servants do nothave enforceable contracts of service, the position is in factmore complex.     It is safe to say that this question has never been tested in the courts, but beyond this there is a body ofacademic opinion which favours the view that there is a contract of employment between the Crown and a civil servant but that it contains an implied term that the Crown may dismiss at will.The Privy Council case of Kodeeswaran v Attorney General of ceylon is also relevant as indicating that a civil servant mightsuccessfully sue for pay accrued.     There can therefore he no certainty about the outcome if a legal test case were to be counted in respect of a civil servant&apos;s right to the second stagePayments of the TSRB6 recommendations.     These were promulgatedin the Civil Service Pay and Conditions of Service Code whichcarries the force of an instruction under Article 5 of the CivilService Order in Council 1969 and is mandatory on Departments.As with the Consultants, the subsequent postponements of thePayments have to be viewed in this light.&amp;     Since senior civil servants are in precisely the same position as Consultants in relation to the second stage payment,it would be invidious to treat them differently.     If they were,9nd Consultants were settled out of court, this would be bound to^e seen as the Government giving way to the most vocal and powerfulSroup, and any suggestion that the settlement arose from a differentContractual position might simply lead to a test case by civilservants which could have wider undesirable implications.
THE ARMED FORCES8.     It is unlikely that a contractual right exists for senior officers of the Armed Forces, but in other respects their position is similar to that of the Civil Service.     But thereis an added complication in this area that the senior officersfeel very strongly about the position of the pay for lowerranks and would find themselves in a difficult position if theywere asked to accept second stage payments while the payproblems which exist below (subject to current considerationby AFPRB) are outstanding.     Any discrimination against senior officers of the Armed Forces would nevertheless be greatlyresented by the Forces generally.NATIONALISED INDUSTRY BOARD MEMBERS (NIBMs)9.     Although any decisions to implement the Review Body&apos;srecommendations would almost certainly lead to a contractualright to payment, the present situation is that the Governmenthas not yet accepted those recommendations and has thereforetaken no steps to implement them.     No contractual right to payment therefore exists.10.    This does not mean, however, that NIBMs can be ignored.Even though some board members are on much higher salaries,it is hardly feasible that second stage payments could be madeto other groups before anything is done for NIBMs.     Moreover,to the extent that the position on second stages is beingconsidered for other groups,this is itself a relevantconsideration for what might then be done for the NIBMs&apos;group and the two issues cannot easily be separately considered.MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT11.    Following the recommendation in Report No 7 of the top salaries Review Body, Members of Parliament, by Resolutions ofthe House, have a &quot;rate for the job&quot; of  8,000 plus the Round increase of  208, though the amount actually in payment isrestricted at most to  6,270.     (This rate includes the Rounds1 and 2 increases).     No undertakings have been given as to howand when the full rate will be brought into payment.     If,
however, Stage 2 payments are made elsewhere, whether to meetcontractual rights or otherwise, this could have implications for the position on MPs1 pay.CONSEQUENTIAL^12.   Any groups whose salaries are indirectly related to theRecommendations of the Review Bodies will have to follow whatis decided for the main groups.     Judicial and Board Memberconsequentials are at present help up pending a decision onboard members1 pay.     No contractual right to payment can&quot;therefore exist for them.     &quot;Non-Boyle&quot; consequentials of theHigher Civil Service will have received the first stage payment and will have the expectation of the second stage when it is received by the main group.     But a number of these consequentials*ie in the fringe body area where there is a strong probability that contractual rights will exist.     Such people will be in&quot;the same position in law as the Consultants, and any action they might be disposed to take would repercuss on the CivilService.     There is also a strong probability that action wouldbe contemplated, certainly if the Consultants were to take action.     The IPCS is already minded that way in the case of the-e directors of British Nuclear Fuels Limited where they claimt;iere is a contractual entitlement to Higher Civil Serviceincreases and are challenging a decision to apply the same treatment as for NIBMs.9 November 1977CONFIDENTIAL
