CONFIDENTIALJAPAN AND THE GENERAL agreement on TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign. AffairsC.P.(55) 34 copy NO,    O ^11th June8 1955CABINETThe Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade will shortly be asked to vote by postal ballot on a draft decisionagreeing to the accession of Japan to the General agreemen to    We haveto decide how to vote.    Apparently the ballot is not secrete2,       Annexed is a paper which sets out the arguments for and againstoThe conclusion is that, &quot;on an objective appraisal, the balance ofadvantage lies clearly in favour of voting for Japanfs accession, &quot;3,        The latest date for postal voting is 11th August,    But if we decide to vote &quot;yes&quot; there is great advantage in announcing our decision without delays - Trade and payments negotiations with Japan are due to begin in June and we shall want to obtain substantial concessions fromthe Japanese,    We are much more likely to get these concessions if wecan let the Japanese know before the negotiations start that we will vote for them.   An early announcement might also influence other countries and thus lessen the risk of Japanls being black-balled,4,       A favourable vote is of great importance for future relationsbetween the United Kingdom and Japan.    It is a step which I am told thatwe can take without real damage to our commercial interests,    i therefore recommend -(a) that we should decide to vote in favour,and(b) that after informing Commonwealth Governments,we should let it be known at once that we intend to do solo!50 Of course, there will be a row in Parliament and among certain sections of industry.    But I think we ought to risk it.HeMe-Foreign Office,&apos; S.W..1,10th June, 1955.
\C\0JAPAN AND THE GENERAL. agreement on TARIFFS AND TRADEIn Cmd. 9449 Her Majesty&apos;s Government, announcing their decision to invoke Article XXXV of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) against Japan if she accedes to the Agreement,give no indication how the United Kingdom will vote on the Japaneseapplication to accede,,2.       The Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UnitedStates and Dutch officials have all enquired whether the United kingdom will in fact vote in favour of the Japanese application.    The dutch government in particular are apparently considering whether the BeneluxGovernments should, while invoking Article XXXV, at the same timevote for Japan&apos;s admission to the G.A.T.T.3.        We have accordingly been instructed to consider the arguments for and against a vote in favour of Japanese accession.Political considerations .       The Japanese application requires a 2/3rd majority of the contracting Parties and the decision is likely to be close.    If the UnitedKingdom votes against and the application fails the Japanese will certainlyhold us responsible since they will assume that we have organised theopposition.    If we let it be known that we shall vote in favour enoughcountries will probably follow our lead to ensure that the applicationsucceeds.5.       Entry into G.A.T0T. is a major objective of Japanese foreignpolicy and failure would be a very serious set-back.    In the face of soviet political overtures and Chinese offers of closer trade relationsJapanese attachment to the West is none too firmly based.   A rebuffby the West at a time when Japan is trying to regain a position of respect in the world might well cause such disillusionment that 3&quot;apan would reviseher attitude towards the free world and turn increasingly towards theCommunist mainland.6.       A vote in favour of Japanese accession would cost the UnitedKingdom little in view of the protection afforded us by our invocation ofArticle XXXV.    The Japanese would find it hard to understand whyI-Ier Majesty&apos;s Government refused to give such a vote.    If the Japaneseapplication were rejected, the effect of our negative vote on Anglos-Japanese relations could well be disastrous.    Conversely, if a vote infavour helped to secure Japanese accession the effect of our applyingArticle XXXV would to some extent be mitigated.70        There is no inconsistency between invoking Article XXXV and voting for Japanese accession.    The statement of last April (Cmd. 9449)assumes that Japan will be admitted to GcA.T0T.   In this statement her majesty&apos;s Government said that they are sympathetic to Japanls desire to accede to the Agreement and that their policy will be directed towardsthe development of trade relations in such a way as to enable the UnitedKingdom in due course to accept the full obligations of the provisions oftlie General Agreement to their trade with Japan.    Moreover, although
Her Majesty^ Government do not themselves feel able at this stage toaccept G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan it does not follow that they should seek to hinder other Governments, who are not faced with the same difficulties, from doing so.Commercial Considerations8.       By invoking Article XXXV we should have ensured that theG.A.T.T. would not prevent us from taking any action we wish to take toprotect our trade.    The question remaining is whether, if Japan acceded tothe G.A.T.T., other countries would be:(a) prevented from taking action which they otherwise wouldtake against Japanese trade and thus from indirectlyhelping our trade,    and(b) compelled to take action injurious to our trade becausethey wished to protect their own trade against Japan,9,       It is feared in many quarters that competition in world marketsfrom low-cost Japanese exports will in course of time be greatlyintensified and lead to pressure from domestic interests in the importing countries for increased protection.    The argument is that, once japan is in G.A.T.T. , countries would be prevented under the G*A.T,T. rulesfrom discriminating against her.    If protective measures were taken,they would have to be non-discriminatory and applied not only to Japaneseimports but to imports from all other countries as well.    Thus a tariffincrease, although aimed at Japan, would also hit the United Kingdomexporter,10.      On the other hand, a country which felt the need to protect any ofits industries against Japanese imports would certainly seek and could probably devise tariff definitions which, without overt  discrimination against Japan, would in fact limit Japanese imports much more than importsfrom elsewhere.11.      The problem is in any case likely to arise only in respect ofcertain G.A.T.T. countries: .\ -(a) A number of countries, such as Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, the Central African Federation and Benelux,will almost certainly invoke Article XXXV as we have done,,Japanese accession to G.A.T.T would not, therefore,affect their freedom to discriminate against Japaneseimports.(b) Other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Indiaand Pakistan, would be most unlikely in any circumstances to wish to discriminate against Japana    If they seekprotection against Japanese imports they are likely to doso by means of a general tariff increase whether or notJapan is in G.A.T0T.(c) Finally there are countries who do not intend to safeguardtheir freedom of action by invoking Article XXXV but might in future conditions wish to discriminate against JapannIt is only in these countries that our position might beworsened by Japan&apos;s accession to G.A.T.T.   The scope for such a situation is clearly limited and the probability of its arising small,
12.      The conclusion is that Japanese competition may lead to some increase in world tariffs, but this could happen even if Japan is not inG.A.T.T.   The extra risk of it happening if Japan accedes to G.A.T.T. isnot so great as to be unacceptable.13.      On the other hand there may be some incidental commercialadvantages to be gained for our exporters if Japan accedes to the G.A.T.T.even though we invoke Article XXXV against her.    For instance the newG.A,T.T. contains provisions aimed at restricting and eventually abolishingexport subsidies.    Since Japan maintains a number of indirect export subsidies and may well wish to enlarge them, our exporters might be helped if she acceded to the G.A.T.T. and were, therefore,compelled toundertake these obligations.Conclusions14.      There are very substantial political considerations in favourof voting for Japanese accession to the G.A.T.T., while at the same timeinvoking Article XXXV so as to preserve our own freedom of action.It is clear that the commercial considerations have not the same weightand do not all point the same way - although we must expect a stronginstinctive reaction from certain sections of industry.    On an objectiveappraisal, therefore, - he balance of advantage lies clearly in favour of voting for Japan&apos;s accession.15.     A vote for Japanese accession would, however, be bound to attract criticism in the press and elsewhere from those who regard any action favourable to Japan as ipso facto against the interests of theUnited Kingdom.
