THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1955SECRET Copy No.  g ?CP. (55) 1429th April, 1955CABINETRATING AND VALUATION IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i ask the authority of my colleagues to announce at the opening of the new session, if we are returned to office, that we accept in principle the Report of theSorn Committee on Rating and Valuation in Scotland; that we will introduce aBill to implement its main recommendations; and that, in the meantime, we will undertake a further review of the Exchequer Equalisation Grant arrangements.The first intimation of our intention to legislate would no doubt be made inThe Queen&apos;s Speech, but I should propose to follow up the brief reference thatmight be made in the Speech by a Parliamentary statement at the first opportunity,and a draft of a suggested question and answer is appended. I shall be glad tohave authority also to put in hand the preparation of the necessary Bill with aview to its introduction as soon as possible.2. The Sorn Committee recommended that the system of owners&apos; rates inScotland should be abolished; that the rents payable under leases existing at thedate of abolition should be reduced by the amount of owners&apos; rates then payable(thus leaving landlord and tenant, initially, with the same net income and burdenas at present); and that a new basis of rateable value broadly the same asthe English should be introduced. They recommended also certain changes in themachinery of valuation and a large number of minor amendments of the valuationlaw. Their proposals, as a whole, are far-reaching and controversial.3. The Report was made unanimously by a Committee with a judicialchairman and a representative membership of differing political views. Its recom-mendations are supported by two of the three Associations of local authoritiesand by the majority of the other interests whom I have consulted. They are opposed by the Scottish Trades Union Congress, by the Scottish national farmers&apos; Union, and on one point by the crofters and by Sutherland and Rossand Cromarty County Councils. The Association of Counties and Cities have been unable to reach an agreed view. The Town Council of Glasgow oppose theReport; Edinburgh have given qualified support to some of the recommendations;Dundee and Aberdeen have expressed no view. The main grounds of oppositionare that the proposals may put a heavier burden on tenants; that they mayencourage private enterprise housebuilding in competition with local authorities;and that (by making agricultural dwelling-houses rateable) they may discourageowners from improving them. The crofters, and those who support them, dislikethe idea of paying rates which they at present escape.4. I have no doubt that responsible opinion supports the Committee&apos;sproposals and that the main opposition to them will be political. They will berepresented as shifting a burden from the owner to the tenant. But the systemof owners&apos; rates is outmoded. It disguises the true rent of property. Further,as the rent, which includes an element of owners&apos; rates, is also (except in the caseof agricultural and industrial subjects) the rateable value, we have the muchcriticised payment of &quot; rates on rates.&quot; In general the system has few merits,and in the case of house property its effects have been disastrous. Since the firstwar, hardly anyone has built houses to let because, with rising owners&apos; rates, they47987
saw no prospect of an economic return. The return on controlled property has,for the same reason, been whittled away to such an extent that owners have been unable to keep it in repair. The indefensibly low level of many local authority rentshas been disguised by the inclusion in the gross rent of the owners&apos; rates. Ifsuch rates are abolished everyone will know where he stands; the need for a betterstandard of rent for both local authority and privately-owned houses will become apparent; and private enterprise may be encouraged to make -a more effective contribution to house building.5. It is true that all future increases in rates will fall on the occupier; thatrateable values may not fall by the full amount of the current owners&apos; rates; andthat, with rent increases, the burden on the tenant would be considerably greater.But that is really because the landlord hitherto has in many cases been unable topass on increases in owner&apos;s rates and so has had an unjustifiably low return; or because local authorities have fixed rents of which the real inadequacy has beendisguised. Any increase in controlled rents would necessitate legislation; and thereis a case for bringing such legislation into force about the same time as the legislationgiving effect to the Sorn Committee&apos;s recommendations. It would not, however, bedesirable to proceed with it until the Bill dealing with the Sorn Committee&apos;s recom-mendations had become law; and the matter is one on which I shall be submittingseparate proposals in due course after I have had an opportunity of discussing theposition with the Minister of Housing and Local Government.6. I ought to point out that the changed method of valuation will reduce thepresent rateable value and so increase the present poundage of rates. In some areas the Sorn Committee estimate that the one may be halved and the other doubled.I am not satisfied that the change will be quite so dramatic, but it will be very great.This may give rise to a criticism that it is wrong, at a time of rising costs, to narrowthe basis of rateable value. This leads me to suggest that we should freeze theexisting rateable values, and so maintain (subject to increases due to increased expenditure) the present rate poundages during the interim period whenrevaluation is being carried out. The Committee proposed that during that periodcurrent values should be reduced by the amount of the current owner&apos;s rates andby a further sum in respect of repairs, &amp;c. The result of this might be thatvaluations would come down by 50 per cent, at the beginning of the interim period and then rise again on revaluation. If they are frozen, pending revaluation, therewill be only one change, and the result of it will be a valuation independentlyestimated to be the real rent a landlord would get in a free market. This criterionseems reasonably easy to defend.7. I think that on merits the agricultural proposals should also be accepted.At present agricultural land and the houses on it are valued together at one-eighthof their gross value, irrespective of the relative values of the houses and the land.The Committee propose that, as in England, the land should be wholly derated andthe houses valued on the same basis as other houses. This seems fair.8. There will be opposition also from the burghs to the proposals that infuture the valuation area should be the county and that the process of valuationshould be supervised by the Secretary of State (who would meet half the cost) andan advisory committee. The alternative which the Treasury prefer would be toadopt the English system of valuation by the Inland Revenue. But that would be equally unpopular, and while I do not much like the Commitfee&apos;s scheme I shouldbe disposed to give it a trial. If it fails to secure the uniformity of valuation whichis desirable and which is its justification, the position can be reconsidered. I proposeto discuss this further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and if necessary we can make a further submission.9. There remains the difficult question of equalisation grant. Under theLocal Government Act, 1948, this was calculated by using the average rateable value per head of weighted population in England and Wales and increasing it by25 per cent, to reflect the higher levels of valuation in Scotland. An investigationcarried out in 1952-53 convinced us that the 25 per cent, was inadequate, but wecould find no means of determining what the true addition should be. The LocalGovernment (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act, 1954, accordingly providedthat for an interim period the total Scottish grant should be eleven-eightieths ofthat for England and Wales. The Sorn Committee now say in effect that if weadopt the English system of valuation the levels of value in the two countries
will be comparable and the grant should therefore be calculated on a Great Britainbasis. I have discussed this claim, which the local authorities are likely to press,with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and we agree that, for reasons with whichI need not trouble the Committee, it cannot be admitted as a basis on which todetermine the grant at least during the interim period; it can be reconsidered when we know what the results of revaluation on the new principles are.10. But we cannot do nothing. I am committed to a further review of the epresent arrangements and I am being strongly pressed to undertake it. I thinkthat I must do so. With the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Ishould propose to aim at an interim solution under which the Scottish grant would be the same proportion of expenditure as would have to be met fromthe equalisation grant, to leave Scotland with the same rate burden per head as england and Wales (outside London) on the assumption that the gross expenditureper head of weighted population is the same in both countries. Such a solutionwill not be easy to achieve or explain but I think it is not unfair.J. S.Scottish Office, S.W. I,28th April, 1955.appendix draft Parliamentary Question and AnswerQ. To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he is now in aposition to make a statement about the Sorn Report on Rating and Valuationin Scotland.A. Yes, Sir. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given most carefulconsideration to the far-reaching recommendations made in the Report andhave consulted the local authority and other interests affected by them. As aresult, they have decided, as indicated in the Gracious Speech, to accept theReport in principle and it is their intention to introduce a Bill to implement its main proposals as soon as possible. These include the abolition of owners&apos; rates,with a consequential reduction of the rents payable under current leases, theadoption of a new basis of rateable value, and certain changes in the machineryof valuation.  The Bill will necessarily take some time to prepare.As regards the time-table for the proposed changes, the intention is to providefor the discontinuance of owners&apos; rates on the 16th May following the passingof the Bill. Thereafter a period of five years would, as the Committee propose,be required for a.complete revaluation of all property on the new basis. TheCommittee contemplated that during that period the rateable values of property which had not been revalued would be determined by making an arithmeticaladjustment in those existing at the beginning of it. The Government are not satisfied, however, that these interim arrangements are necessarily the best that canbe made- and they propose to give this matter further consideration.As regards the equalisation grant, the Government are prepared, in the lightof the Report, to review the method of determining the grant at once inconsultation with the Associations of local authorities. I must make it clear,however, that the Government could not at present consider a claim thatimplementation of the Sorn Report would result in comparable levels of rateable value in Scotland and in England and Wales. When, however, the new methodsof valuation recommended by the Sorn Committee are in full operation, theywould be prepared to examine the basis of the grant again from this and other points of view.
