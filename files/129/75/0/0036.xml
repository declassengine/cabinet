The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of:......:...-......:.........TOP SECRET Copy No.. .4.3..C.P.(55) 3614th June, 1955CABINETPALESTINE settlement memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to have my views on the financial considerations which arise in connection with the very important proposals outlined in the Foreign Sees etary&apos;s memorandum, C.P.(55) 35.2. The main financial proposals for which the Foreign Secretaryseeks the authority of the Cabinet are in connection with the proposedcompensation to be paid by the Government of Israel to Arab refugees.It will be recalled that this has been fixed at  100 millions, of which 50 millions is to be made available to Israel by gift or loan from theUnited States Government and, say,  5 millions by gift or loan from theFrench or other Governments, and that  -Her Majesty&apos;s Government should lend a sum ofthe order of  15 millions to the Governmentof Israel;in order to assist the Government of Israel in finding the  30 millions remaining, permissionshould be given for the sale of Israeli Governmentbonds, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere inthe Sterling Area in the expectation that in thisway the Government of Israel might raise about 15 millions.3, If these proposals were carried out the effect would be toplace on the United Kingdom economy a burden of about  30 millionsspread over a period of about ten years.    The question is not only whetherthe advantages to be secured from the proposed settlement are commens-urate with an additional burden of the size, but also whether we can afford it - that is to say, whether it is consistent with our declared policyof working consistently for the strengthening of sterling and our externalpayments position,4, I shall shortly be bringing before my colleagues estimates of our balance of payments position over the coming twelve months.Without anticipating thes e it can be said now that so far from achieving the overall surplus of  300 millions on Current Account in our balanceof payments which we have said that we need over the average of the years to meet our obligations for the development of the Sterling Area and tomaintain our position in the world, it looks as though we may fail to secure(a).(b)
any surjjlus at all in the present year.    It will take very considerableefforts to restore the position.    Looking ahead, there is no particularreason to suppose things will become easier for us, and there are many directions in which new burdens and obligations must be accepted.    Fore-most among these is the  80 millions a year which is the estimated costof maintaining our Forces in Germany.    Although the financial assistanceto Israel now in question is a relatively small sum, we cannot consider this proposal in isolation.    It is the cumulative effect of a series of commitments such as these, each of them no doubt justified on their individual merits, which may easily in the aggregate place too great astrain upon our balance of payments and our economic resources.5. So much for the general background against which thequestions raised by the Foreign Secretary must be decided.    The twopropositions themselves raise a number of specific points:-(a) The proposed loan by Ker Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave to be made, as is admitted in C. (55) 96, on very doubtful security - indeed in my view we should bedeceiving ourselves if we expected much of it ever to be repaid.    Nevertheless, I can see that it isimportant from the presentational point of viewthat it should be described as a loan - so that theArabs at any rate may think that it is to come fromthe resources of Israel in the long run.    such considerations may also suggest that the rate ofinterest should be on normal lines.(b) The proposal that the Government of Israel should beallowed to sell bonds here, raises a number of points of special difficulty.    In the first place it will clearly be essential to avoid anything which might beconstrued as a commitment on our part that any given amount will be forthcoming from this source,since if in fact it did not prove possible for theGovernment of Israel to raise as much as they expected, they would be tempted to turn to us forthe balance.    At the same time it would probablybe necessary to put a limit on the amount to beraised in this way so as to avoid an open-endedcommitment..   Even so, the proposal is bound tohave repercussions on our policy towards the overseas use of our capital resources.    We have sofar consistently followed a policy of preserving ourlimited supply of long-term capital for thedevelopment of the Commonwealth, and the demands for capital for this purpose have always been asmuch as, if not more than, we could manage.    Inparticular, the Colonial Secretary is facing theposition that a number of Colonies will have difficulty in obtaining as much as they had hopedfrom the London capital market.    In thesecircumstances we have had to refuse access to themarket to a number of would-be borrowers from outside the Commonwealth, including the Norwegianswhose economic development it would be most advantageous to us to assist if we could.    So far
the disappointed applicants from the Cori-imonwealthand elsewhere have accepted our arguments that weare doing as much as we can possibly afford;  itwould clearly be difficult to justify to them the provisionof special facilities for Israel.6. Against this background, whatever may be decided aboutthe Government-to-Government loan, I would suggest that we should consider whether the proposed facilities for the sale of Israeli bondsshould not be omitted from the proposals, at any rate at the outset, andthat our representatives should merely say that we expect the israeli government to produce  30 millions from its own resources.    It maywell be that the Israelis would feel able to produce this sum, or at least a larger part of it than the Foreign Secretary at present expects.    Atany rate I think we should throw upon them the onus of showing that theycannot do so without additional special facilities.7. In addition to these major issues there are a number of points which have already been the subject of discussion between theForeign Office and the Treasury, and subsequently with the Americans,and on which further work will be required.    These ares-(a)  The total figure of  100 millions has in itself novery firm basis and it is impossible to say at thisstage that it will in fact be acceptable to both parties.    The Arabs will naturally want more, butwe can rely on the Israelis to demand that theamount should be less.    It is the firm intentionof both parties to the present Anglo-Americandiscussions that  100 millions should be themaximum, but great skill in negotiation will berequired to hold the amount to that figure.There would be grave danger of serious inflation inthe Arab countries concerned if a sum of the size of  100 millions were disbursed there in un-controlled fashion, even over a period.    Thedistribution of large numbers of relatively smallsums to uneducated individuals, not used to handlingmoney, could easily lead to the ultimatebeneficiaries being thieves, cheats and speculators.The price of land and other forms of investmentcould rise to astronomical figures:  leaving theoriginal recipients of the benefits with a ranklingsense of grievance that they had received no realcompensation for what they had lost.The assessment of the individual amounts ofcompensation in such a way as broadly to satisfy the claimants and lead to an effective lessening of tension in the area, are matters of extreme difficulty.Possible methods are under examination but it isclear that we must firmly insist on the ArabGovernment taking full responsibility for the resultsof whatever system is eventually decided upon, andfor meeting the complaints of the individual  dual claimantswho feel themselves aggrieved.(b)\(c)j
(d) Apart from the claims of individual refugees tolost property there are a number of inter-governmental and inter-municipal claims whichwill no doubt be put forward on both sides duringthe course of negotiations.    It is the intention thatthese should be regarded as cancelling each otherout, but no doubt there will be hard bargaining whichmight, unless we are very careful, alter the wholepicture considerably.(e) United Nations Relief and Works Agency (U.N.R.W.A.)will have a large part to play in distributing thecompensation and seeing that it is used to the best advantage in resettling the refugees.    This will mean that the organisation will have to continue to exist for at least ten years, whereas its presentagreed lease of life is for another five years.   we know from the fact of American participation in theproposals for a settlement that the United StatesGovernment, who contribute about 70 per cent of u.N.R.W(A^s funds, would be prepared to continue their support of U.N.R.W.A. for the required j)period.In the case of other contributors, we need to do all we can, at the appropriate time, to get them tocontinue their support of the Agency after five yearsand for as long as necessary;  and, in the context, of a general settlement, they may well be disposed to do so.    The question of the cost to U.N.R.W.A.of the functions it will undertake in connection withthe compensation also requires further examination.8. Finally, as the Foreign Secretary admits, there is a very real danger that once we embark on these negotiations we will be pressed to accept further financial commitments.    It is clear that our verydesire to bring about a settlement will place a powerful weapon in tilehands of the Arab countries which they will no doubt seek to use to extract from ourselves and from the United States Government themaximum possible financial assistance in other directions.    As far asthe United Kingdom is concerned, this is particularly true of Jordan, towhich we are already giving assistance for the Arab Legion and for development totalling about  11 millions a year.    It is not possible to assess this danger in financial terms, but everything possible must clearly be done to guard against it in the course of negotiation.    We must also, of course, be on our guard against the possibility that we becomecommitted financially before we are certain that a settlement will in fact be reached.    It must be clear throughout that our financial help will be forthcoming in return for a settlement but not otherwise.9. To sum up, if the Foreign Secretary feels that it is anessential part of his proposals that we should be willing to incur thefinancial obligations discussed above, I am prepared reluctantly to agree,despite the misgivings which I cannot but feel about the cumulative effectof this and other similar commitments upon our external economic position.    In any event, however, I suggest that for the reasons given inparagraphs 4 and 5 above, we should consider whether the proposed loan from Her Majesty&apos;s Government should not be for a smaller amount and weshould at least in the first instance avoid proposing to the Israelis anyspecial facilities for raising money here.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.13th June, 1955.
