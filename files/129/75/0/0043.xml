(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 43 &apos; &apos; COPY NO. 5 916th June, 1955CABINETCOMPULSORY PURCHASE ORDERPROCEDUREMemorandum by the Prime minister should like to bring to the notice of my colleagues the case of a compulsory Purchase Order which has caused me some disquiet and has aroused public comment.    The facts are briefly as follows.2.        In 1949 a Mr. Wilson bought a paddock adjoining his house atOxshott.    Since 1947 the Surrey County Council had been trying to find landfor a school in that area and there had been talk of using the paddock forthat purpose.    Mr. Wilson believed, when he bought the paddock (though he had insufficient warrant for doing so), that the project of building a school on the paddock had been abandoned.    It had not;  and, in 1954, theCouncil made a Compulsory Purchase Order.    Mr. Wilson objected andthe usual procedure of an enquiry by an inspector followed.    At theenquiry it appeared that another site was more suitable for the school andthe inspector reported against the Compulsory Purchase Order.3.        When the case was considered by the Minister of Education, itappeared that the alternative site was not after all available because theCommissioners of Crown Lands, who were it owners, were at that timemorally committed to selling it to the Esher Urban District Council for housing.    Therefore, in view of the urgent need for a school in the district,the Minister confirmed the Compulsory Purchase Order.    Mr, Wilsonmade further representations which were considered by the Minister, butit was decided that the order should stand,4,        Mr. Wilson then wrote to me appealing against the decision andI asked the Minister of Education and the Lord Chancellor to look into itfurther.    The main point that has caused us disquiet was the fact that thefull facts of the availability of the alternative site were not brought out atthe enquiry but only, as it were, behind closed doors when the Ministerconsidered the inspectors report.    It seems that this was inevitable,but it could be held to have prevented Mr. Wilson from fully arguinghis case at the enquiry.    Nevertheless, I have reached the conclusion thatthe order ought not to be disturbed in this case and I am having Mr, Wilsonso informed.

5.        The affair does, however, emphasize the need for urgency in getting under v/ay the enquiry promised in The Queen&apos;s Speech to considerpractice and procedure in relation to administrative tribunals and quasi&quot;judicial enquiries, including those concerning land.A.E.10, Downing Street, S.
