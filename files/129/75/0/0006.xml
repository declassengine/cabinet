Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1955SECRETCP. (55) 620th April, 1955CABINETSECONDARY education memorandum by the Minister of EducationAs the 114- examination is likely to be an election issue, my colleagues maylike to know how the argument stands.2. There are just over 2 million boys and girls of secondary school age in schools maintained by Local Education Authorities or otherwise assisted from public funds. This number will rise to 2-7 millions by 1961.3. The 1944 Act provided that these children should receive, without thepayment of fees, an education suited to their ability and aptitude. This was takento mean that there should be three types of secondary school-grammar, (for about20 per cent.), technical (for about 5 per cent.), and modern (for about 75 per cent.).4. The selection of the school to which a child goes is determined by an examination at 11 -h. It was hoped that the modern schools would attain &quot; parity of esteem &quot; with the grammar schools, and that as a result the disappointment andjealousy felt by parents when their children failed to qualify for a grammar schoolwould disappear. But this has not yet happened, and the resentment appears to be growing.5. Mr. James Griffiths has said that the next Labour Government will abolish the exam altogether by doing away with the three kinds of secondary school andsubstituting comprehensive schools, each of which will take all the children from a determined area. .6. If a comprehensive school is to provide an education comparable with thethree separate secondary schools it must contain some 2,000 pupils, since thegrammar school element must be at least 400 strong to provide a satisfactory sixthform. It may be possible to hand-pick the staff for one or two such schools. Thisis what the L.C.C. are doing at Kidbrooke. But in my opinion Kidbrooke is an exception that will prove the rule that the difficulties of organisation are too greatto be overcome.7. I have told Local Education Authorities that I will approve a comprehensive school only when no existing good school is to be swallowed up inthe process, and that I will not agree to a complete network of comprehensiveschools in any area. My predecessor approved 10 new comprehensive schools, andI have added 2.8. Although the comprehensive school is certainly not the right answer, wecannot leave the 11 examination where it is. The anxieties and jealousies are too easy to play on. If we copied the United States of America we should trebleour Universities, and send to them, via much enlarged grammar schools, a farhigher proportion of the population than goes to &quot;them to-day. But the standards of our Universities and grammar schools could not be diluted in this way withoutchanging their whole character. Our policy must be to construct an alternativeroute to high qualifications and well-paid jobs via secondary modern and technicalschools and technical colleges, and to encourage more transfers at 15 or 16 to andfrom grammar schools.Copy No. 6 047936
9. Circumstances help us. We have to build something like   million newsecondary school places, and can, therefore, influence the pattern of schools withoutdisturbing what exists. Furthermore, the public, aware of the increasing demand* for technicians and skilled workers of all kinds, is taking kindly to the:offer bysecondary modern schools of special courses with a clear vocational interest,, Iam encouraging Local Education Authorities to distribute these courses over as many secondary schools as possible. This has the great advantage that eachschool will be able to offer something special that cannot be had elsewhere in thearea. Where this is already happening, Local Education Authorities are findingthat complaints from parents about the selection procedure are strikingly reduced.10. To sum up: the feelings aroused by the 114- exam, both justified andunjustified, force a move either towards selection for nobody or towards selectionfor everybody. Selection for nobody means comprehensive schools with grammarschools abolished and parents&apos; choice practically ruled out. The Socialists support this policy on the principle of fair shares for all. Selection for everybody meansdeveloping in each secondary school some special attraction and giving parents the widest possible choice.11. I hope that my colleagues will think that selection for everybody is theright policy. It appeared at the Scarborough Conference of the National Unionof Teachers, which I addressed last week, that a big majority of the teachers isnow against comprehensives and in favour of building up secondary moderns.D.
