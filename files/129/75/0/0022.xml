0, O(T^IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 22 COPY NO.31st May, 1955CABINETKENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 13th January, 1955, the Cabinet approved proposals put forward by the Governor of Kenya for the offer of new surrender terms to the remain-ing Mau Mau terrorists (C.C.(55) 4th Conclusions).    Under these terms nosurrendered terrorist would be prosecuted for crimes committed before thedate of the offer but would be detained indefinitely, the length of detentiondepending on the circumstances of each case.    The offer was to remain open for at least 3 months.    Meanwhile, military operations have continued,particularly in the forest areas of Mount Kenya and the Aberdares, tostrengthen the inducement to surrender.    Betv/een 18th January and13th May, 505 terrorists (including some gang leaders and &quot;hard core&quot;elements) have surrendered under the new offer, an average of 31 surrendersa week compared with an average of 11 a week during 1954.2.        Under pressure from the security forces not only did the rate of surrender rise but it also became evident from intex^rogation that many otherterrorists were anxious to surrender but were deterred by doubts regardingthe sincerity of the Governments intentions and fear of their own leaders,some of whom were taking extreme measures to reinforce discipline.    Inefforts to exploit this situation the Government of Kenya took steps in greatsecrecy through a number of surrendered terrorists to establish contact with leaders in the forests who might be induced to bring in their foHowers.Following correspondence between the Governor and General Erskine andStanley Mathenge (the most prominent terrorist leader after Dedan Kimathi)arrangements were made for a meeting in Nairobi on 4th May with a group of the immediate subordinates of these two leaders.    At the request of the-terrorists, Mr. Mathu and Mr. Gikonyo (the two Kikuyu members of theLegislative Council) and another well-known African were present at themeeting as observers.    At this meeting terrorist representatives gave theimpression that large numbers were anxious to surrender and that theymight well be ready to offer an immediate token surrender to test the sincerity of the Government.    Facilities were given for them to report backto the forest and make further contacts with Mau&apos; Mau leaders before fixing a date for final talks;  at the same time the Government representativesdemanded a token surrender at an agreed place of at least 50 terroristsby 18th May.3.        The reply was disappointing and uncompromising.    The terroristsstated that there could be no surrender until the Kenya Government abandoned the powers it has taken to deal with the emergency.    It was decided to give them a last chance and a letter was sent completely rejecting their demandsbut calling for a further contact by 17th Miay.    On that date three terrorists,\-1-
including a leading General, appeared and promised to do their best to meetthe Governments demands and on 18th May the Chief Commissioner forNative Affairs and General Heyman (the Comrnander-in-Chiefs Chief ofStaff) met a further group of terrorists1 representatives at the forest edge.As a result of this contact the Government representatives were convincedthat the terrorists should be given a further 48 hours, that is up to noon20th May, to make token surrenders and send in representatives to resumetalks on a wholesale surrender.4.       The terrorists failed to appear on 20th May and troops who werelined up on the forest edge in readiness went in to the attack in accordancewith the plan which had been prepared against this eventuality.5.       Hope of a mass surrender of terrorists under the current offermust therefore be abandoned.    It was always the intention that the surrenderoffer should not remain open indefinitely but only so long as it continued tobring satisfactory results.    The Council of Ministers in Kenya have now decided that the time has come to announce that the offer will remain open for only six more weeks.    At the same time they propose to reinforce the attraction of the surrender offer by announcing that those terrorists who donot take advantage of it during the remaining period will be subjected toseverer disabilities.    For this purpose the Governor of Kenya has proposedto me that provisions for the forfeiture of the land of terrorists should beextended.    Under the existing Forfeiture of Land Ordinance of 1953terrorists who have been convicted and sentenced and known terrorists whoare still at large may be deprived of the land which they hold in the native reserves.    Under the Ordinance it is necessary for individual ForfeitureOrders to be made and the land affected to be defined at the time of publication of the Order; the Order then becomes effective after a limited period during which the terrorists concerned have an opportunity to surrender and make representations against the Order.    Under my directionthis sanction has been used only in a limited number of cases of notoriousleaders.    The Governor has proposed to me that the present Ordinanceshould be amended in order to provide for the making of Orders relatingto persons listed in a schedule to each Order which would deprive them ofthe capacity to hold or acquire land and further would deprive them of the capacity to sue in African Courts or to apply for and obtain any licenceor permit.    The object of this extension is to make it administrativelysimpler to declare land forfeit (since the particular piece of land affectedneed not be specified at the time of the Order) and to impose disabilitieson those terrorists who have no interest or right in land.    There would beno limitation to the number of those in respect of whom Orders would bemade.6.        I have informed the Governor that I am not disposed to agree to theextension of this sanction beyond the forfeiture of land, since his original proposal is so wide as to amount in fact to a declaration of outlawry, wouldbe in serious conflict with the obligations we have undertaken in applying to Kenya the European Convention of Human Rights and would be difficult todefend before Parliament.    I have also been in correspondence with theGovernor on the two following points:-(a)    whether it would not be sufficient to deprive namedterrorists of their existing interests and rights in landrather than to impose upon them a general disqualifica-tion from the capacity to hold or acquire land, whichmight be held to amount to the denial of a civil rightrather than the sequestration of property (this would limit the scope of the proposed measure to simplifyingand speeding up the procedure by which land is declaredforfeit under the existing ordinance); and
(b)    whether, if the Governor&apos;s proposal that he should begiven powers to impose a general disqualificationfrom the capacity to hold land is accepted, a tribunal should be established to hear any objections which maybe lodged within a defined and limited period by those affected by draft Orders (who would surrender for thepurpose).7.        On point (a) above, the Governor has represented strongly thatto rely only on the forfeiture of existing land rights would leave untoucheda very considerable number of obdurate terrorists who are young men whohave not yet acquired any private right-holdings.    If the new sanction isto be effective, it must also make it impossible for such persons to hope to acquire land in the future.    I, therefore, intend to agree that the revised ordinance should provide for the disqualification of individualsfrom the capacity to hold or acquire land.    On point (b) above the governor has agreed to make provision for the establishment of an Advisory Comm.-ittee, having a chairman with judicial qualifications, to consider and advise the Governor in regard to objections lodged by those affected by disqual-ification orders.    This provision should go some way, at any rate, to meetcriticisms which may be made of the arbitrary character of the legislation.8,        I seek the agreement of my colleagues to authorise the governor of Kenya:(a)to announce at the earliest possible date that thecurrent surrender offer will remain in force for only six more weeks;(b)to present to the Legislative Council a bill to extend the provision for the forfeiture of land of thoseterrorists who do not surrender; this bill to provide(i)for disqualification from the capacity to hold land, and\(ii)for the establishment of an advisory Committee to hearobjections.A.T.L-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.31st May, 1955.
