3 hSECRETC.P.(55) 23 COPY NO.31st May, 1955CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME;  1955/56 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Cabinet, at their meeting on 26th April(C.M.(55) 6th Conclusions, Minute 3), recorded two conclusions about next session&apos;s legislative programme.    First, they agreed that, if our government remained in office after the Election, the session should be planned to last until the summer of 1956.    Secondly, they invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and myself to take whatever action was possibleto have prepared material for The Queen&apos;s Speech and Bills for intro-duction.    Material for The Queen&apos;s Speech has been collected in the normal way under the supervision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a draft speech, prepared by The Queen&apos;s Speech Committee, is expected to beready for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration on Thursday, 2nd June.    As regardslegislation for the next session, a meeting of the Future legislation committee was held on 5th May, at which the Chancellor of the exchequer was present.    At that meeting the Committee agreed that the mainingredients of the programme for the first session of the new parliament were likely to consist of the measures set out in the list of Bills in the annex to this memorandum.    It must be emphasised that this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and that the many lesser measures which departments have proposed in response to the customary request forDepartmental suggestions for legislation in the next session will need to beconsidered by the Future Legislation Committee at an early date.2.        I have the following comments to make on the list of Bills in the annex to this memorandum:-(a) Some of the Bills in the list will clearly have to be passed beforeParliament adjourns for the summer recess.    Examples are GermanConventions, Rating and Valuation and Potato Marketing.    They are under-lined in the list.(b) It is now contemplated that Copyright should be dealt with in thenext session in a single comprehensive measure, which would obviate theneed to re-introduce the separate Copyright and Television ExhibitingRights Bill.(c) It will be seen that the Future Legislation Committee took the viewthat legislation in the first session of the new Parliament to carry out therecommendations in the Gowers Report on Health, Welfare and Safety in non--Industrial Employment (Cmd. 7764) should be confined to Bills inrespect of agriculture and forestry, and possibly railway workers - leaving the major measure in respect of shops, offices, etc. until a second or later session.
4*5(d) As regards legislation on Representation of the People, theCommittee recognised that alteration of the law governing re-distributionof Parliamentary constituencies might not in itself be a matter of sufficient urgency to justify legislation in the first session.    On theother hand, they agreed that, if our Government remained in officeafter the Election but found themselves without an effective workingmajority, there would be a strong case for early legislation to providefor the preparation and publication of registers of Parliamentaryelectors twice instead of once yearly.    They further agreed that, if any legislation on this subject had to be introduced in the first session, itwould be convenient if it could cover both aspects of the matter.Having regard to the majority now secured by the government as a result of the Election, the Cabinet may take the view that legislation on Representation of the People need not be undertaken in the first session, although this seems to be a subject on which early action isdesirable.    Under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Act, 1949, a further review of constituencies is required to take placein time to enable the Commissioners to present their report not lessthan three nor more than seven years from the date of the presentation of the Commissioners&apos; last report, which was in November, 1954.    Onthe occasion of the last review, the interval of time between the giving of notice of the Commissioners&apos; intention to conduct a review and the presentation of their report was about sixteen months.    Theoretically,therefore, it would be open to the Commissioners, if they considered this right, to give notice of their intention to carry out a further reviewduring the course of 1956.(e) Attention should be drawn to two items of legislation whichare specifically referred to in the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech at present under consideration by The Queenrs Speech Committee but which werenot considered by the Future Legislation Committee and are, therefore,not included in the list in the Annex to this memorandum.    These are:-Slum Clearance and Urban CongestionWelfare Foods3,        The main purpose of this memorandum is to provide the back-ground against which the Cabinet ought to consider the proposedreferences to projected legislation in The Queen&apos;s Speech,    At the sametime, I seek Cabinet approval for the immediate introduction, either in the House of Commons or in the House of Lords, as may be foundmost convenient, of the nine Bills introduced but not passed in the last session (Item 1 in the Annex),H.C.Gwydyr House, S.
