(THIS -DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)secret.P0(55) i/ COPY NO.26th April, 1955CABINETINDUSTRIAL DISPUTES; RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation circulate for the information of my colleagues a roughassessment on the basis of the information at present available of the likely position on the railways, on the assumption that men belongingto the National Union of Railwaymen (N0U0R0) and the Transport SalariedStaffs do not come out on strike,,2.        The proportion of footplate staff belonging to the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen taking the railways as awhole is about 75 per cent, and the proportions in the various regionsare*very approximate iy:-Scotland 55 per centLondon Midland 60-75 per centEastern and North Eastern 60&quot;75 per centY/e stern 80-85 per centSouthern 80&quot; 85 per cent3.        As regards London Transport Execxitive, some 40 per cent of their railway train staff are members of the Society., but officiallythe Executive are not at present involved in the dispute, and it is hopedthat their services will not be affected.4.        The general impression among officers of the Commission isthat members of the Society would probably answer the caLI to strike but with little enthusiasm, and there might be a drift back to work fairlyquickly.    The N.UBR0 seem unlikely to support the strike but it is possiblethat some of their members may come out in some localities.5.        For the first day or two, until it is known exactly what staff are available, it may be impossible to do more than improvise a fewservices, but the movement of milk and fish will be given special priority, and the movement of, so far as possible, coal and of emptycoal wagons will be arranged in consultation with the National Coal Board06.       The Commission do not propose to apply any restriction on theacceptance of traffic prior to the events except that livestock will cease to be accepted 48 hours before the strike is due to commence,Immediately the strike takes effect there will be a general restriction on the acceptance of traffic except under prior arrangement,,-1-
A^7.        The general intention with regard to British Road services is that they should adopt a &quot;business as usual&quot; attitude and should, asfar as possible, keep away from railway premises,,    The Commission^inland waterways would accept all traffic allocated to them,,    The aim ofthe London Transport Executive and of the Commission&apos;s provincialbus companies would be to maintain normal services.J*o-A oB o*** &apos;C0Ministry of Transport and Civil aviation.tion, VVC 1,25th April, 1955.
