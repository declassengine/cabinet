Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1955.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 9CP. (55) 418th April, 1955CABINETCOMMON land memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodThere is still a good deal of pressure for something to be done about commonland. This is coming from members of both Houses; from the National Farmers&apos;Union and the Country Landowners&apos; Association, who want the land put to betteruse; and from the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society,who want greater access for the public and more opportunity for the commonersto keep the land in better condition, but also recognise that some part could beput to better use in the public interest.2. In view of this I have reviewed the whole question, bearing in mind the opinions expressed by the Cabinet at its meeting on 18th December, 1952(C.C. (52) 106th Conclusions, Item 5).3. The law relating to the 2 million acres or so of common land in Englandand Wales is so complex and antiquated that it is virtually impossible either tomaintain the land in a condition in which it may be effectively enjoyed by thecommoners or by the general public, or, in appropriate cases, to use the land forsome other desirable purpose. I attach a short note giving some additionalbackground information.4. For these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the law of commons should be reviewed and that this can best be done by an independent Committee.The terms of reference I have in mind are:  &quot; To make recommendations as to what changes, if any, are desirable inthe law relating to commons, in order to enable commoners to derive greaterbenefit, or the public to derive greater enjoyment; and also to considerwhether, in cases where little or no use is at present made of common landby either commoners or the public, the law should be altered in order to enablethe land to be used for some desirable purpose, and if so in what way itshould be altered.&quot;Before an announcement is made I would propose to show the suggested termsof reference to the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society,the National Farmers&apos; Union, and the Country Landowners&apos; Association, all ofwhom have been pressing very strongly for an inquiry,5. The Home Affairs Committee considered this proposal on 11th March(HA. (55) 7th Meeting, Item 1) and there was a substantial measure of agreement among my colleagues in favour of it It was generally recognised that theCommittee should be a strong one: indeed it was suggested that a RoyalCommission might have some advantages since it wOuld be less likely than acommittee to be suspected of bias towards diverting more common land forcultivation. For the Chairman we should need someone well versed in the lawand of high standing. The members would have to represent the viewpoint ofcommoners, agriculture, amenity and local authorities.47923
APPENDIXThere are some 2 million acres of common land in England and Wales. Thisvaries from commons in urban areas like Wimbledon Common (which do notaccount for a large acreage) to remote commons such as those on the hills of wales and on the moors in Devonshire and Cornwall (which probably account for about\% million acres).2. Common land is a survival of the old manorial system of land tenure. Itis land over which persons, other than the owner of the soil, have certain rights such as rights of grazing, cutting bracken or turf, lopping wood, &amp;c.3. Urban commons provide recreational facilities for the surroundingpopulation. But the public have no legal right of access to rural commons unlessthe owner has made a special deed. The great bulk of common land in rural areasserves little purpose as public open space. In the case of most commons, thecommon rights are barely exercised.4. 20,000 acres of common land were requisitioned and cultivated during thewar and for the most part this land yielded very good crops. Part of the area hasnow been released; no legal means of maintaining it in a reasonable condition is available, and much of it is already reverting to scrub. It is of course the remarkable contrast between the results obtained while these commons were underrequisition and their mostly derelict condition in normal times that has been partly responsible for the demand that something should be done about the problem ofcommon land generally.5. The law of commons is antiquated and complicated. It makes it verydifficult for the land to be improved, even for the benefit of the commonersthemselves. For example, the land cannot be ploughed or fenced, and the propercontrol of grazing is made virtually impossible. The procedure for regulatingcommons for the benefit of the general public is cumbersome and not fully effective.6. The law also makes it very difficult for common land to be used for someother purpose such as afforestation, housing, &amp;c, even if the common is waste land and could be used in such a way without significant diminution of the rights and privileges of either commoners or public. It is difficult to defend the taking of goodfarm land for housing or other development when large areas of common landremain unused and often derelict.7. Amendments to the present law relating to commons could enablecommoners to make more effective use of their rights by allowing them to employmodern agricultural techniques to improve the land and maintain it in good heart.They could also, within limits, enable development (e.g., by partial afforestation),to take place without detriment to commoners&apos; rights. Such action would alsooften improve the value of the common as public open space. Many commons&apos;are to-day so thickly covered with gorse and scrub that they can be of little moreuse to the general public for amenity purposes than to the commoners for grazing.6. On the other hand, the view was also expressed that an inquiry of this nature might stir up controversy owing to the latent prejudices which might beawakened. I recognise that a Royal Commission or Committee might have difficulty in making recommendations acceptable to all parties on thesecontroversial issues, but their conclusions might well enable us to take limitedaction even if comprehensive reforms have to be ruled out. I believe that theappointment of such a body would, in fact, be generally welcomed. Moreover,I do not think that we can any longer resist the pressure for an inquiry and thata refusal on our part might well be exploited by the Opposition.conclusion. I accordingly ask for the agreement of the Cabinet to the proposal for a royal Commission or a strong independent Committee to enquire into the law of commons..    D. H. A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. I,15th April, 1955.
