secret.P.(55) 28 COPY NO.   6 24th June, 1955CABINETMONOPOLIESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Cabinet invited me to report on the present position inregard to monopolies and restrictive practices, and to recommend thelines on which the matter could best be handled if it were raised duringthe forthcoming Debate on the Address.2. During the Election campaign, the Socialist Party made muchplay of the evil effects of monopolies and restrictive practices.Conservative spokesmen indicated that the Government would tackle the problem with energy and determination.    The Chancellor of theExchequer said:-&quot;We don&apos;t intend to tolerate monopolies orunfair price rigging.    At the same time we shan&apos;thesitate to reward success and to cut loose crampingrestrictions on human endeavour. &quot;The Queen&apos;s, Speech will contain the following sentence:-&quot;My Government will take such further action as may be required in the public interest to dealwith abuses in the field of monopolies and restrictive practices. &quot;3. Our policy has been to undertake through the monopolies commission full and fair enquiry into these practices and to take actionto eliminate them where they are shown to be against the national interest.4. We shall be faced with two quite different criticisms.    On theone hand, the Socialists and the Daily Express are urging us to take actionbefore we have any examination or get a report, and to eliminate allrestrictive practices without exception.    On the other hand, there is theview, about which less is heard in public but which is sometimes power-fully pressed in private, that monopoly is on the whole a good thing (atleast to hold in reserve against a recession) and that the conservative party ought to encourage it.    Both these schools of thought attack the monopolies Commission, the former for being slow and lethargic and thelatter for reaching conclusions on a priori notions of economic theory,5. I strongly urge that we hold firm against both forms of criticism. I believe that a study of the Monopolies Commission^ reportsindicates that they are doing a difficult job with considerable success.-1-
I also believe that we should continue with our declared policy of fullenquiry followed by resolute action, where this is shown to be necessary.Indeed, the 1948 legislation, which we supported, requires this,6. To carry forward this policy vigorously, there are twoprerequisite s:-(i)  We must have a strong independent monopolies commission, and be prepared to defend itagainst criticism,    I am satisfied with thegeneral calibre of the present Commissionthough I would like to bring in moreindustrialists;(ii) we cannot sustain the case that we are beingresolute in action unless we are preparedto make references to the Commission,I cannot do this from Board of Trade industriesalone, and need the help of my colleagues incharge of Production Departments,7, I propose to refer to the Monopolies Commission the cottonyarn spinners1 ring,    I hope also to make a number of other referenceswhich I shall have discussed with the Ministers directly concerned bythe time this paper is considered in Cabinet,    I intend to follow the normal course of announcing these references at the time when they are made,8, In deciding what might be said in any debate, we should bear the following points in mind:-(a) We have already demonstrated our determination to deal effectively in this field by doubling the size of the Monopolies Commission, by increasingthe output of its work and by acting upon its reports as they are received,(b) We can contrast this with Socialist policy which Idescribed in the last debate on Monopolies asfollows:&quot;&quot;It is to strengthen the Commission butto act in advance of its recommendations,and if on any occasion it puts in a report which is unpopular or difficult, to ignore it, 11(c) We have substantially implemented the main recommend&quot;ations of every report received from the monopolies commission except the report on the Calico Printerswhere we have already announced that we shall dothe same,    (I have recently received a report onsemi-manufactures of copper but this has not yetbeen published).(d) We took the initiative in referring to the commission the whole range of practices known as the collective boycott and exclusive dealing and I havenow received their report.    This report, which willbe published shortly, is of the utmost importance,
covering very prevalent and much-criticisedpractices.    It will give rise to considerablepublic discussion.    Although there is a minority view expressed, I believe that thereport will provide a basis on which action can be taken.    If action is taken, important and far-reaching legislation will be needed.(e)  The Monopolies Commission now have nineindustries under enquiry.    Tlie furtherreferences mentioned in paragraph 7 willbe made shortly.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.14th June, 1955.
