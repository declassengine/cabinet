REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTICAIntroductionAntarctica has been considered by the Cabinet twice during the last year:  (i) A memorandum by the then Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary,C.   (54)   261,  was  considered   on   29th  July,   1954   (C.C.   (54)56th Conclusions, Minute 4).       -(ii) A memorandum by the then Foreign Secretary, C. (55) 36, was considered on 15th February, 1955 (C.C. (55) 13th Conclusions, Minute.3).It was as a consequence of this second discussion that we were appointed, as aCommittee of Ministers:  &quot;To recommend to the Cabinet a plan for increased United Kingdomactivity in the Antarctic and to supervise its execution.&quot;2. - In acccordance with our terms of reference, the main purpose of our report is, therefore, to set out a detailed plan for increased United Kingdomactivity. Towards the end of the Report, however, we comment on some of thepolitical aspects. We do this because, as we see it, the primary justification forany plan of activities is political.THE AREA AND ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIALITIES3. The Antarctic continent has been divided up into sectors under a numberof territorial claims (see Map A). Apart from the United Kingdom sector theso-called Falkland Islands Dependencies-nearly half the continent is coveredby Australian and New Zealand claims. This Report is however confined to the falkland Islands Dependencies sector.- 4.   Three parts of our Sector have so far been explored or visited : .(a) The Graham Land peninsula, its fringing islands, and the South Shetland.   Islands.   Graham Land, West of the Weddell Sea, is a mountainouschain, rising to about 9,000 feet in the South, approximately 800 mileslong, and the geological continuation of the Andes.(b) The South Orkney, South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups.(c) The shore of Coats Land East of the Weddell Sea, ending in Vahsel Bay.(c) has so far only be occasionally visited by explorers, (a) and (Z?) have howeverfor some twelve years been the subject of survey work by the Falkland IslandsDependencies Survey (F.I.D.S.). Small parties have been working from a number&apos; of isolated bases (see map B) and a considerable amount of topographical andgeological knowledge has been built up. The areas surveyed have necessarily beendiscontinuous, though considerable stretches of the eastern coast of Graham Landhave been mapped on the ground. *5.   Very little is yet known about the potentialities of the Antarctic.  At thepresent rate of scientific advancement it cannot be ruled out that at some future date it may become practicable to exploit natural resources should they exist.Future air routes and long-term weather forecasting are other possibilities.   Inthe immediate future, however, it seems that the only natural resources likely tobe of economic value (apart from whaling and sealing) are minerals though it isfair to say that no indication whatever of mineral occurrences of commercialsignificance, other than possible copper in Anvers Island, has so far been found.To be worth exploiting in such an area, minerals would have to be of unusualconcentration and rarity.   The only way of ascertaining whether such mineraloccurrences exist is to intensify the geological work and to develop our geologicalknowledge of the area as rapidly as possible.  Even when such work had shown the existence of a potentially valuable occurrence of minerals, it would be necessaryfor the possibilities of economic exploitation to be intensively examined by mininggeologists.47956 b 2
PROPOSED PLAN OF INCREASED ACTIVITIES6. In the light of our terms of reference, we now set out a series of proposalswhich, in combination, form the plan for increased United Kingdom activity inthe Antarctic.Five-Yeqr Programme by Governor of Falkland Islands7. The first, and most obvious, step in any programme of increased activity:must be to expand the work of F.I.D.S. ..The Governor, has put. forward a programme for,expanded.work over the next five years. * This, programme includes the opening of six new bases (see Map B), and its main aim is the assessment ofthe potential economic value of the territories.8.&apos; We are satisfied that this increase of the present programme of the F.I.D.S.is essential if we are to maintain our position in the area, particularly in GrahamLand and the neighbouring islands. We are already in serious danger of beingoutdone there by Argentina and Chile, who tend at. least to duplicate theestablishment of any base which we set up. This increased effort, apart fromshipping, will cost  100,000 per annum. This would double Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ present contribution of  100,000 to the operating costs of the Surveyin the current year (which is estimated to cost a total of  275,000).9. The F.I.D.SI&quot;programme also entails considerable expenditure on accountof ships (quite apart from the naval support). Following on the Cabinet decisionof 29th July, 1954, the Treasury.approved financial provision for the replacement ofthe existing R.R.S. John Biscoe at an estimated cost of  450,000. The replacementis now under contruction and will be ready by the 1956-57 Season. At present- theJohn Biscoe has a support ship, the Scandinavian Norsel, whose charter expires inthe1 middle of this year. We are advised that the essential support ship for an expanded F.I.D.S. programme, which should be larger than the Norsel, would cost about  250,000. Of this sum  110,000 has already been approved. We recommendthat&apos;approval be given for expenditure of the additional  140,000 for the supportship. &apos; -Air, Survey10. Air Survey of parts of our Antarctic territory has been repeatedlyrecommended in the past. It is the-only speedy method of providing topographicalmaps; and these are a fundamental requirement for the exploration of the region and for assessing its scientific, particularly its mineral, potential. An air surveywould be no substitute for detailed geological surveying on the ground. But the possession of a mosaic of air photographs (which would be of practical value evenin advance of the production of maps) should greatly assist the rapid deployment of geological parties in the most hopeful looking areas. An air survey would alsobe extremely valuable in providing visible evidence to the Argentines and Chileansthat we were actively maintaining our interest in, and claim to, the region (althoughan air survey.in itself.would contribute little to the strengthening of our title).11. The R.A.F. cannot undertake this air survey. The only aircraftavailable are Sunderlands whose ceiling is too low to operate safely over the terrain;they are moreover committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    - - -12. The only way of carrying out air survey is, therefore, by civil contract,which, on the best estimates at present available, would cost about  550,000 andwould take about two years. We think it important that the air survey should begin as soon as possible as we consider that this would be most valuable as avisible counter to Argentinian and Chilean activity. Unfortunately, time is now very short for the completion of a contract with either of the two available british air&apos;survey companies for the 1955-56 Season, but we recommend that the cabinet should approve in principle the proposal to carry out an air survey as soon aspracticable.Trans-Antarctic Expedition13.- Support for this project (see C. (54) 261, paragraph 8 and Annex B,paragraphs. 1 and 8); which covers the period late&apos; 1955 to 1958, has already beenapproved&apos;and a grant of  100,000 made towards its cost. The proposal-is for a&apos;crossing of the continent, starting from VahselBayin the Weddell Sea, to. be made
in the Season 1957-58, by a party led by Dr,Fuchs, the Director of the F.I.Q..Scientific Bureau! &apos; A reception party-based on Ross Island &quot;in the ;New Zealandsector: would, probably be led, by Sir Edmund Hillary. A preliminaryreconnaissance at Vahsel Bay is proposed in the forthcoming Season 1955-56, anda &quot; build up &quot;&apos; there (probably jointly&apos;with the International&apos; Geophysical Year-see below) in 1956-57.14. Light aircraft are essential to the success of the expedition arid thequestion of their provision from R.A.F.,resources is referred to in paragraph 24.15. The necessary civilian shipping can probably be obtained by chartering,but the expedition must make firm bids at an early date as the&apos;first reconnaissance-party is due to go in to Vahsel Bay in the forthcoming Antarctic Season, I9.55-56.:Before doing so they obviously wish to know whether R.A.F.&apos;support with lightaircraft will be available. The Organising Committee in the United Kingdom havenot yet launched their public appeal for funds, and there is still no information about preparations for the New Zealand reception party.International Geophysical Year U.G.Y.) 1957-5S16. As part of the programme for this international scientific project, the.Royal Society proposes to establish an observing station in Vahsel; Bay, working -in liaison with the Trans-Antarctic Expedition. - .17. In January 1955, the Argentines established a base at Vahsel Bay at whichthey have stated that they propose to operate an I.G.Y. station. Politically itwould be. damaging to British territorial claims if the Argentines alone establishedan I.G.Y. station in the area and received international recognition for it. . Onthe other hand, there is a conflict of opinion among the experts regarding thedifficulties of access to Vahsel Bay without an ice-breaker (such as the Argentinespossess but we do not) and our prestige would clearly sulfer if a British I.G.Y. parly(or the Trans-Antarctic party) came to grief and had to call on the Argentines to extricate them. On this point we would only note that those responsible for the trans-Antarctic Expedition, after careful examination of all the evidence, are fullysatisfied that, with a suitably strengthened modern ship (which could be obtained)it is reasonable to expect to be able to establish a base at Vahsel Bay.18. It is understood that the I.G.Y. organisation is considering the desirabilityof international pooling of resources in connection with the Antarctic bases forthe I.G.Y. It is also believed that the Americans regard it as important that VahselBay should be manned and would welcome our doing this; but if for any reasonwe cannot man a station there the Americans would probably wish to do so. Itis possible that the Americans might consider transporting the British J.G.Y. partyto Vahsel Bay in an ice-breaker.19. The Treasury is considering a request from the Royal Society for a grantof approximately  500,000 in support of I.G.Y. activities in different parts of theworld. Of this sum, about  150,000 is in respect of the proposed station at VahselBay. The Royal Society and the Meteorological Office are convinced of the scientific importance of establishing this station, both in the interests of purescience and for various practical reasons.20. We recommend that the Cabinet take note&apos;of the proposed british participation in the I.G.Y. activities which, if successfully carried out, should help to establish our position in the Antarctic. :FACILITIES FOR SUPPORTING OUR INCREASED ACTIVITYNaval Support21.   We are convinced that if a programme of increased activity is undertakenwe need naval support from a vessel which can operate more safely in Antarcticwaters than the frigate at present used. As an interim measure it has been agreed.that H.M.S. Protector, a naval net layer, shall be strengthened at a cost of  500,000and made available by the beginning of the 1955-56 season,22. . However, the. real requirement for any substantial long-term Antarcticprogramme is ah ice-breaker, without the services&apos; of which we foresee the iUnitqd&quot;Kingdom sooner or later being faced with serious embarrassment or loss. . It hasnot; yet. been possible to obtain. an accurate estimate, for the provision of an
ice-breaker, but it may well cost in the region of  3 millions and take 3-4 years toconstruct. The Admiralty has.been asked to investigate the problems and likelycost involved in constructing, purchasing or chartering a suitable ice-breaker.23. The manning&apos;of H.M.S. Protector, will mean that;the number of frigates,oh the ^American, and West Indies^ stations must be. reduced , by,&quot;one. Therefore,Since H.M:S. Protectot will have to be withdrawn from Uie. Antarctic for refitduring the southern winter, it will not be possible with existing&apos; resources toprovide a guard ship for the Falkland Islands during this period of the year.Although theGovernor of the falkland Islands has said hewould.have no objectionto the absence&apos;of a guard ship during the winter, there are strong.political reasons- why such a ship should be kept in the area. The possibility of covering this rcommitment by a programme of visits from ships of the West Indies station isbeing investigated.Air Support24. As stated in paragraph 14, light aircraft will be essential for the successofithe Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The Royal Air Force can provide and operatetwo Austere and could operate the Beavers if they could be obtained. The cost forthe three seasons (assuming two Beavers are needed but excluding their capital costis about  80,000 of which about three-quarters can be regarded as ordinary trainingexpenditure, leaving an estimated  20,000 to be met by the Expedition. The RoyalAir Force do not at the moment possess any Beavers, although a requirement forthis aircraft is being considered. The cost of a Beaver, suitably equipped, wouldbe about  30,000 in Canadian dollars. If the Expedition itself decides to acquireany of these aircraft they can probably be disposed of afterwards without difficulty.25. The cost of this support is consequential on the main contribution of 100,000 to the Trans-Antarctic Expedition which it has already been agreed toniake. but the Treasury&apos; have indicated their willingness to find the extra sumlinvqlyed if it is. a reasonable one.26. The extent to which long-term air cover, for the Falkland Islands and/orthe Dependencies, may be necessary will depend on the threat developing fromArgentine and Chilean reaction to our increased activity. The Governor hasrecently advised that he does not consider air support for the Colony by aircraft.such as Beavers would be an effective alternative to the protection of the Colonyby frigate. He considers that, for land aircraft, nothing would be useful short of construction of an air-base in the Falkland Islands, with several runways, capableof use&apos;by modern long-range aircraft. Such a project would be feasible and mightbe most useful for civil purposes, but enlarging the existing air-strip in this way would be expensive. :27,- An assessment of the threat has been made and the implications ofproviding long-term air coyer are being considered by the Air Ministry. Thepossibility of providing air support during the Antarctic winter is also beingconsidered.28.   We feel that, if the United Kingdom interests are to be maintained, it isunrealistic to embark on any increased programme of activity without air support.: If air support on a substantial scale proves necessary, an enlarged airstrip or airfield&quot;will be required and this will naturally involve considerable expense.  On the long-term; if we are to stay in the Antarctic, we must obviously have effective air support,.and this is bound, sooner or later, to require an airfield or airfields.Civilian Shipping29. Apart from naval support, the provision of adequate civil ships is essentialforany1 increased activity.&apos; Of the ships&quot; which appear-to-be required, only the replacement of the&apos;Vofin-Brisdoe, now under construction, is; firmly hv our hands.We&apos; are &quot;losing the Norsel,&apos;her&apos; support ship, in-the.middle, of.the year, and, aswe have &quot;stated, at least &quot;one further support ship is necessary. Various-, ships arerequired for the Trahs^Antarctic Expedition and- for the International GeophysicalYear. It; &quot;is probable-that ships, mainly Scandinavian,: are&apos;;available. for .charterbut no time&quot; rnusl j be &apos;lost: in chartering; particularly &quot;by &apos; the Trans-AntarcticExpedition. Many &quot;other countries will, in ^connection i with the) InternationalGeophysical Year,&quot; be on the look out for suitable ships.
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS30. The United&apos;kingdom existing commitments and the.;various proposalstor increased Activity are summarised, with approximate cost,, in. the, summaryin&apos; the &apos; last &quot;paragraph of this report. - Broadly they fall into the following catergories:-.   .id) Existing &quot;commitments: extending, over, the next live,years-- l  millions..(b) Proposals-requiringvimmediate approval..if, increased activity..is agreed in principle  !  millions.(c) Proposals  involving  large-scale  expenditure  which  requires   further examination (including cost of ice-breaker, long-term, air support, costof enlarged airstrip, &amp;c.) not yet known.Although items (a) and (/;) amount together to nearly  3 millions, the cost of those under (c), particularly the more uncertain commitments such: as-the ice-breakerand the airfield, will be considerably greater. It is impossible to make any firmestimate, but a really comprehensive programme of increased-&quot;activity- in the antarctic would, over the years, be very expensive.POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS31. We were not asked as a Committee to recommend whether increasedactivities should in fact be undertaken. But the uncertain economic, potentialities of Antarctica have to be balanced against the cost and political effort&quot; of maih-taining ourselves there. These two considerations in their turn have to be balancedagainst the broad political disadvantages of withdrawal-32.   We must face the fact that unless we adopt a more, vigorous policy inthe Antarctic we shall inexorably be edged out of our sector by the Argentinesand to a lesser extent the Chileans. Argentine trespass has greatly increased duringthe current season, and the Argentines have been so encouraged by lack&quot;, of opposition that we are now faced with the urgent necessity of deciding to. what extent we should reassert our sovereignty if we are not,to incur humiliation.&apos; Wecannot maintain our position without countering Argentine expansion by positivemeasures, but, as we cannot expect to keep intruders out of our entire sectorwithout disproportionate expense and effort, we must concentrate on the mostimportant areas.  What seems to be required, therefore (unless we&apos;are to withdrawforthwith), is a plan of increased activity over a five-year period,&apos;in which the objectives would be to forestall further Argentine expansion while we&apos;make ;a determined effort to assess the potential value of the Dependencies and decide whichareas we need to hold.  This is the basis of the plan set out in this Report.  It ispossible that by the end of the live years the discovery of natural resources would invite further expenditure, or that other reasons for retaining the Dependenciesmay emerge from a broad scientific survey.   Alternatively, if it ;could be shown to the satisfaction of public opinion in this country that a very thorough investi-gation had disclosed no reasons for maintaining ,our full claim, it might then be politically possible to consider a reduction of the area over which we would wishto maintain our sovereignty.  Australia and New Zealand are, of course, closely concerned.33: It is:clear that the;niahv reason- for increased ;United,Kingdom activity in: the Antarctic&quot; is&apos;- political; -Such a position is necessarily, an-uneasy., one.&apos; the element of-competition which exists may meaivthat measures which;;serve UnitedKingdom-purposes now-will seem;inadequate in a. few-years.1 time;!&apos;&apos;,(and although we&apos;are-informed :thatt;in -relation;to world- strategy,; the area has . no \ strategic importance at present, the growth of United Kingdom civilian commitments theremust-mean ah increased possibility- of.calls on Service,resources.to...defend them.While,1 therefore, we have set.out.plans to,meet the.present, situation, we must draw attention to the fact that;tjie Situation.is not likely., to remain, static, and that if
3/l.FCONCLUSION35. The projects in this Report, if put into effect, should go far to achieve the objective which we think the Cabinet had in mind of intensifying ourexploration and survey activities in order to find out where it would be.mostprofitable t6 concentrate future elforts. We must emphasise,&apos;however, that the primary objective is political rather than economic and that there is at present no indication that there will be any commensurate economic return for the expenditure involved. The extent to which the expenditure can be justified must ultimatelydepend on how high we rate the political importance of maintaining our positionagainst foreign encroachment, and, as we have said in paragraph 33, the commit-ment may be an increasing one. The existing commitments in the area are setout at (a) in the summary below. If the Cabinet accept that there shall be no reduction in the United Kingdom&apos;s claims in the Antarctic, we recommend that,&apos;at least the additional programme set out in [b) below should be undertaken.Summary of Protosals tor increased Activity, and financial implications: 36.
