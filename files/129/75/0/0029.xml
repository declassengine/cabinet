^4CONFIDENTIALC.P.(55) 29 COPY NO.      Q6th June, 1955CABINETEMERGENCIES OCCURRING AFTERDISSOLUTION OF parliament memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe need for a proclamation of emergency immediately afterthe General Election has drawn attention to the difficulties that can arise in the event of a sudden emergency after a dissolution of Parliament.2. Except in the case of a demise of the Crown, once a parliament has been dissolved it cannot be recalled; nor does there appear to be any power to advance the date fixed by the proclamation for the assembly of anew Parliament.    It is therefore impossible for Parliament to meet duringthe period of a minimum of three weeks between a dissolution and the datefixed for the assembly of the new Parliament.3. Section 3 of the Meeting of Parliament Act, 1797, provides thatin case of the demise of the Sovereign after the dissolution or expiration ofa Parliament and before the day appointed for assembling a new Parliament,the old Parliament shall immediately convene and continue (unless againdissolved) for six months.    The effect appears to be that if the demiseoccurs between a dissolution and polling day at the ensuing General Election,the Election is cancelled; and even if it occurs after the result of theElection is known, the old Parliament is revived and the Election is madevoid.4. There appear to be three questions for consideration:-(a) Should there be power to advance the date fixed for the assembly of a new Parliament after aGeneral Election - for instance when a proclamation of emergency has been made ?A case can clearly be made out for this.(b) Should there be power to cancel a General election and recall the old Parliament in the event ofan emergency other than a demise of the Crownoccurring between a dissolution and polling-day?It can be argued that the absence of any such power is a gap in our constitutional arrangements thatought to be filled.    The exercise of the power,however, would be a matter of extreme gravity;it would be difficult to foresee and provide forthe circumstances in which it might be used;
legislation to confer the power mightarouse needless controversy; and thereis much to be said for leaving the question for consideration, if necessary, in the context of an actual threatened emergency.(c) Should Section 3 of the Meeting of Parliament Act,1797, be modified?If the Sovereign dies between a dissolution andpolling-day at the ensuing General Election, itseems clear that the only proper and satisfactorycourse is to cancel the Election and revive theold Parliament, as the Act of 1797 provides.But if the Sovereign dies on or after polling-day- and particularly if the result of the Electionis known and shows that the Government has been defeated - the case is very different.    Even inthese circumstances, the present arrangement hasthe advantage that the old Parliament can meet and proceed to business at once, whereas the new parliament cannot meet at all until the writs havebeen returned (but this is only a matter of a fewdays); and even then a Speaker must be elected,Members must be sworn in, and the new Parliamentmust be opened.    It is also possible to argue that,after the business arising from the demise had beenattended to, the old Parliament would be bound topass an Act providing for its own dissolution andvalidating the Election that had just taken place; butthis involves difficult constitutional issues;  and much would depend on the circumstances of the time.At best the situation would be anomalous and difficult in the extreme; and there is a strong case for limiting the provisions of the Act of 1797 to a demisewhich occurs between a dissolution and polling-day at the ensuing General Election.5. The first of these questions is likely to be raised in the debate on the present emergency, and the others are related.    I therefore thinkit right to bring them to the notice of the Cabinet, so that we may considerwhether or not we ought to contemplate legislation on all or any of them.G. LiLi. -G.Home Office, S.W.1.4th June, 1955.
