,(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)kCONFIDENTIAL,C.P.(55) 5022nd June,1955CABINETINDUSTRIAL DISPUTES;  OCEAN LINERSMemorandum by the Attorney general  was invited by the Cabinet at their last meeting to consider andreport to what extent the right of a seaman to withhold his labour isqualified by his obligations under the Merchant Shipping Acts (C.M. (55) 16thConclusions, Minute 5).2.     -  Once a seaman (defined by the Merchant Shipping Act 1394,Section 742 as including every person (except masters, pilots andapprentices duly indentured and apprenticed) employed or engaged in anycapacity on board a ship) is &quot;lawfully engaged&quot;, he becomes subject tothe disciplinary code contained in that Act.    If after being lawfullyengaged, he is, for instance, guilty of wilful disobedience to a lawfulcommand, of neglect of duty, of desertion or absence without leave he maybe punished summarily.3, When he has signed Articles, he is clearly &quot;lawfully engaged&quot;but he may be engaged before he has signed Articles, e, g, by agreeing to serve as a seaman (Vickerson v. Crowe (1914) 1 K. 3. 462).4.        By Section 236 of the 1894 Act it is made an offence for anyperson by any means whatsoever to persuade or attempt to persuade aseaman to neglect or refuse to join or to proceed to sea in or to desertfrom his ship, or otherwise to absent himself from his dirty,.    A mancan be convicted of so attempting to persuade a man engaged as a seamanwho has not signed Articles (Vickerson v. Crowe supra).5.        It is clear that a lawfully engaged seaman has not the right to strike which is enjoyed by those employed in other industries.    Theeffect of Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1375is to legalise conspiracies to do or procure an act to be done in contemplation of or in furtherance of a trade dispute, so long as the actis not criminal or actionable if done by one person.    The Act of 1375however does not apply to seamen (vide Section 16) and engaged seamentherefore cannot rely upon the protection of Section 3.    For the same reason engaged seamen are not subject to the provisions of Section 7of that Act in regard to intimidation.    Men not so engaged however can rely upon the protection of Section 3 but are liable to prosecution underSection 7 (R. v. Lynch (1898) 1 Q.B. 61).6.       A man not already engaged as a seaman commits no offence by refusing engagement and it is neither a criminal offence nor anactionable wrong for a person other than an engaged seaman to attemptCOPY NO.
ISA-to persuade a man not to engage himself as a seaman unless the methodsof persuasion used are such as to constitute an offence under Section 7of the 1875 Act.    Engaged seamen, as I have already said, are not subjectto Section 7 of the Act; they can therefore apparently persuade othersnot to engage with impunity.7.        I was also asked by the Cabinet to consider and report whetherthe procedure adopted in the present strike by the Merchant NavyEstablishment Pool could be held to be inconsistent with the right ofa seaman to withhold his labour.    I do not know what was the procedure adopted in relation to the employment of the strikers in the present dispute and I cannot say whether any of the strikers were lawfullyengaged seamen before they signed Articles.    Directly, however, theysigned Articles they clearly became lawfully engaged.8.        The arrangements made by the Merchant Navy EstablishmentBoard do not alter the position stated in the preceding paragraphs.RJ3..M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W. C.2.22nd June, 1955.\
