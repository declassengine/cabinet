secret.?.(55) 5 COPY NO.18th April, 1955CABINETTHE COTTON INDUSTRY:  DRAFT STATE MS NTNote by the President of the Board of TradeI attach for consideration by my colleagues a draft of astatement on the cotton industry which I might make after Questions onWednesday, 20th April.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.18th April, 1955.annex draft STATEMENT ON THE COTTON INDUSTRYHer Majesty&apos;s Government have given further consideration tothe representations put forward by the delegation from the cotton textile industry on the 24th March.2. These representations dealt among other things with the scale of duty-free imports of cotton cloth from the Commonwealth, particularly from India and Hong Kong.    Imports of cloth from non-commonwealth countries are subject to quotas or duty.    In particular, imports from Japancontinue to be governed by the Japanese Sterling Payments agreement which enables control to be kept of the flow of Japanese imports into theUnited Kingdom.3. Import restrictions against cotton cloth from the Common-wealth would have to be applied by a tariff, preceded perhaps by a purely temporary quota as a holding measure against forestalling.    The impositionof such a tariff would involve a revision of the arrangements for the duty-free entry of Commonwealth goods under the Ottawa Agreements, andamendment of the legislation giving effect to them.    It would lead to ademand for similar treatment by some industries, and affect the exportopportunities of others.-1-

Ik40 In the case of the Colonies, it would represent an importantchange in the general policy which we have traditionally pursued towards them in trade matters.    We have indeed very recently emphasised andsafeguarded this special relationship during the negotiations in Geneva.5. In these circumstances, the Government do not propose atthis time to introduce restrictions on imports of Commonwealth cloth.What action we may have to take in the future will depend on the outlook for the cotton textile trade generally in the coming months, and we havemade this clear to the Government of India,,Possible reference to purchase tax^Jm6. If I might mention one separate matter     A mission fromthe cotton textile industry has just returned from discussions in India,with the Government and the mill owners therej, on the desirability of areduction in the very high rates of duty imposed by India on her textileimports from the United Kingdom. &apos; We have made it clear that any such reduction would not inhibit us from taking such action against imports ofcotton cloth from India as we might in the future decide upon.    But weare hopeful that the Government of India with whom we are in close touchon the subject, may as a result of this mission, see their way to makinga material modification of their tariff.\
