Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1955SECRET Copy No.   ?CP. (55) 3311th June, 1955CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the ColoniesWhen the Cabinet considered on 19th April, 1955, memoranda by theColonial Secretary (C. (55) 92) and the former Foreign Secretary (C. (55) 93) on future policy for Cyprus, they deferred a decision on the proposals outlined therein(CM. (55) 4th Conclusions, Minute 8).2. Since then we have together reviewed the problem afresh, and have agreedthat a somewhat different approach may prove more fruitful.3. Two problems are involved for Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and, though these are closely inter-related, it is important to distinguish them. There is, first,the problem of Cyprus itself, and of the connected complications with Greece and turkey. Secondly, there is the problem of public opinion in the United Kingdomand abroad, and notably that of the reactions of the dispute at the United Nations.4.   Briefly, the alternatives before Her Majesty&apos;s Government are:  (a) To take no new initiative, either in the international field or towards self-government in Cyprus, but to concentrate on maintaining order in cyprus and repressing &quot; Enosis &quot; agitation, while resisting all attemptsby the Greek Government to intervene.(b) At the other extreme it would theoretically be possible to cede Cyprus to greece, subject to a lease ensuring our use of the island and its facilitiesfor our strategic purposes.(c) To seek some middle course between these two extremes.5. We exclude alternative (b) partly because of the Turks, and partly because a leasehold interest is not considered a sufficiently firm tenure. But for thedifficulties in the United Nations Organisation and the pressure of world opinion,there would be something to be said for adopting course (a), at least provisionally,and waiting to see how the position develops. Marshal Papagos, whoseintransigence over Cyprus is the cause of much of our difficulty, is ill and may soondisappear from the head of affairs in Greece. Though there is still no clear indication of his probable successor, the latter might turn out to be more amenable.But we cannot count on this; and meanwhile the Greek Government are committed to taking their case to the United Nations Assembly again at its next meeting. It is unlikely that we shall be able to defeat or outflank them by a similarprocedural device to that which we employed last year. Nor can we count on equalsupport for our own case. The United States Government have made it clear that,unless we make some &quot; forward &quot; move, they will find great difficulty in backingus; without their support we may well be faced with an adverse vote. All this neednot of itself be decisive. But the danger is that if the Greek Government and theCypriot Ethnarchy once get international backing for their cause any possibility ofthe Greek Government being brought to reason will finally disappear. At the sametime the situation in Cyprus itself will become still more intractable. Terrorismmay take root and lead to outrages which would make any political settlement evenmore difficult.48167b
6. We are accordingly agreed to recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould take a new initiative in the near future, and that this initiative should takethe form of a proposal tpthe Greek and Turkish, Governments, that they should join with ourselves in tripartite discussion of the Cyprus question. The following paragraphs contain,our views on the timing, manner and terms of such a proposal..7. From every point of view the sooner the deadlock is broken the better. Ifthe Cabinet approves our proposal we accordingly suggest that the invitations beissued as soon as possible with a view to a first meeting at a convenient date inJuly. ,;./.-&apos;8. The place to be proposed for the discussions would be London. It Wouldbe for the Greek and Turkish Governments to decide, if they accepted the invitation,whether they wished to be represented by their Ambassadors or by special delegates.The invitation would be given confidentially but, since it would undoubtedly leakquickly in Athens, an announcement would have to be made very shortly after. Inany case we cannot long defer a new statement about Cyprus in the House ofCommons.9. The terms of the invitation should in our view be very general and on thefollowing lines: -&quot; Recognising the common interest which bind the United Kingdom,Greece and Turkey in alliance, Her Majesty&apos;s Government deeply regret thatdisagreements over Cyprus have disturbed old friendships and led to mostunwelcome controversy. They accordingly consider that the time has come when questions relating to Cyprus should be frankly discussed between them.Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore invite the Greek and turkish governments to send representatives to confer with them in London to try tofind whether a basis exists for a solution of outstanding differences.&quot;10. The Turkish Government would probably be willing to participate, since our invitation would be a recognition of their right to be consulted on an equal footing with Greece. They would perhaps ask for some reassurance (at leastprivate) about our purpose, viz., that we did not intend to propose the cession of cyprus to Greece.11. The Greek Government might refuse outright, not wishing to be placedin a minority of one. More probably they would temporise, and ask whetherself-determination for Cyprus and an eventual change of sovereignty would bediscussable. Our reply would have to be that any of the three Governments wasfree to raise any matter they wished and that we were prepared to listen to any point of view that might be expressed; but that we could not commit ourselvesbeforehand as to our own attitude.12. If the Greek Government refuse to attend any conference they will haveconsiderably weakened their case at the United Nations. If they accept, and aconference takes place, it will be important for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to hold the initiative. For this purpose we must have a plan ready. We would then eitherplace this plan before the other two parties as a proposal, or use it as the modeltowards which we would try to steer the discussion.13. We have given much thought to finding some arrangement which would secure Greek acquiescence, reassure the Turks and safeguard the use of Cyprus asthe seat of our Combined Headquarters and as a base for our forces. As a resultof our studies we have prepared the preliminary outlines of alternative plans,contained in Annexes I and II. We do not ask now for approval of either of these plans. But if the Cabinet approves in principle the idea of inviting the Greek and turkish Governments to a discussion about Cyprus, we suggest that thealternative plans should be subjected to intensive study.14. We would then hope to resubmit the matter to the Cabinet in about afortnighfs time, with a view to taking a final decision both on the plan and on theform and timing of the invitation.H. M.A. L.-B.10th June, 1955.
ANNEX ICYPRUS: FIRST ALTERNATIVE PLANIt was announced to the House of Commons on 25th July, 1954, that the 1948constitutional offer was withdrawn and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decidedto take a new initiative and introduce a constitution, of which the broad outline wasgiven. It was to be one providing for a Legislature, in which official and nominated members together would form a majority over elected members. Some unofficial members of the Legislature would be appointed to the Executive Council to take charge of Departments.2. The House was promised that no irrevocable steps would be taken before there was another opportunity for debate, and that a White Paper would probablybe laid.3. There has been no further statement to the House since then about thedetails of the proposed new Constitution; but the Governor has advised that the1954 proposals would have to be liberalised and that something would have to besaid about willingness ultimately to discuss &quot; self-determination,&quot; if there is to beany hope of getting acceptance of these proposals. In C. (55) 92 of 6th April theColonial Secretary set out accordingly the details of a proposed more liberal, but stillfirst stage, Constitution including a Legislature containing a narrow majority of elected members, with fifteen elected, of whom three would be Turks, ten nominatedand three ex-officio; and an Executive Council composed of ex-officio members and a majority of Cypriot Ministers, drawn from the Legislature, probably three, ofwhom would be given the executive charge of departments and proposed, inparagraph 12, the text of a new accompanying statement. This, it was suggested,should conclude with the statement that, when the stage of full internal self-government had been reached, and provided international conditions permitted,there was no reason why agreement on the future status of the Island should not be arrived at between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the constitutionally elected representatives of the Cypriots.4. It is by no means certain that this was a big enough step forward to gainsupport in Cyprus, and support or acquiescence from the Greek Government.Accordingly, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 19th April we have thought furtherabout the proposed draft statement. We are advised that, for there to be a prospectof this policy&apos;s keeping the Greek Government quiet for a period of years, and sogiving self-government a chance to prove itself, it will be necessary to specify a termof years after which the consultation about the future status of the Island will takeplace.5. To this end, the United Kingdom Delegate at the proposed trypartite discussions might indicate that Her Majesty&apos;s Government intended to go forwardwithout delay with introducing the Constitution as outlined in C. (55) 92 and toinclude the following statement in their explanation to Parliament:  &quot; This will be a first stage in the closer association of the people of Cypruswith the administration of the Island, and it will, if successful, be followed by further advances in the same direction, leading finally to full internal self-government, subject to satisfactory safeguards for minorities. Atpresent it is impossible for strategic and political reasons to contemplatea change in the status of the Island. But once full self-government has beenestablished and proved to be working successfully, the means will exist whereby the Cypriot people can constitutionally be consulted about their future status.When this stage has been reached, and international relations permit, the definite purpose of Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be to reach agreementwith the constitutionally elected representatives of the Cypriot people aboutthe future status of the Island. Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot of courseforesee how long it will take to attain this objective. This must inevitablydepend on factors outside the control of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Butit is their intention that the position should in any event be reviewed withthe representatives of the Cypriot people in [ten] years&apos; time. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise the special cultural and other links which Greece and turkey have with Cyprus, and would be willing at any time to discuss with theGreek and Turkish Governments matters arising out of such interests.&quot;48617
ANNEX IICYPRUS: SECOND ALTERNATIVE PLANArgumentsThe interests of Britain and the free world require the use of Cyprus as a Britishbase, for the same broad purposes for which rights over Cyprus were first acquiredfrom Turkey in 1878. Britain cannot afford, in the world as it is, to abandonsovereignty over the Island. But the Island&apos;s political problem, which has becomeacute since the Greek Government decided to take the matter to the United nations organisation, is essentially that of a multi-racial community. The Greek Cypriotand Turkish Cypriot groups in the Island strongly value their historical and culturallinks with Greece and Turkey respectively, and they are championed respectivelyby the Greek and Turkish Governments. Self-government has languished since1931, and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs policy is to re-start it; whilst Greek policyis to promote enosis under the cloak of claims to &quot; self-determination.&quot;N 2. What is required is some form of arrangement which would associate theGreek and Turkish Governments with the administration. A full condominiumwould involve a sharing of sovereignty; would be incompatible with our strategicneeds; and would lead to administrative chaos.Proposals3. The following programme would combine rapid progress towards fullinternal self-government with a restricted association of the Greek and turkish governments in the administration of the Island.4. The sovereignty of Cyprus would remain with the British Crown, and theGovernor and his senior officials would continue to be appointed by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. But the Governor would be assisted by one representative each ofthe Greek and Turkish Governments, with some such style as &quot; Assessor,&quot; &quot; Resi-dent Minister,&quot; or &quot;Commissioner-General.&quot; The Governor would be obligedto consult them regularly, in the exercise of his duties under the Constitutionincluding his responsibilities for defence and police and external relations (on whichsee paragraph 6 below); but the decisions would be his own, and in his absence his powers would devolve on the Colonial Secretary as Acting Governor as at present.The three Governments would establish joint machinery to settle any differences which arose out of the operation of these arrangements or disagreements by anAssessor with a decision taken by the Governor, fin the last resort governments might have certain rights to refer to the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty6. This statement is on the general Tines of that proposed in paragraph 12of C. (55) 92 with the following modifications and additions:  (i) a pledge would now be given by Her Majesty&apos;s Government that whenself-government had been established in Cyprus and internationalconditions permitted, it would be their &quot; definite purpose &quot; to reach agreement with the constitutionally elected representatives of theCypriot people about the future status of the Island;(ii) a separate undertaking would be given by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to review the position with the representatives of the Cypriot people inany event after a definite period (N.B. No time-limit attaches to the&quot; definite intention &quot; to reach agreement);(iii) an offer would be made to discuss with the Greek and Turkish Govern-. ments matters arising out of the special cultural and other links between those two countries and Cyprus.The purpose of these amendments, particularly (i) and (ii), is to improve theprospects of securing the Greek Government^ acquiescence in our policy and thusof advancing towards self-government in Cyprus. There is some hope that onceself-government is firmly established vested interests will grow up in Cyprus infavour of maintaining the Island&apos;s independence from Greece.
Organisation, on matters of importance where they deemed their national interests to be adversely affected]. The Greek and Turkish flags would fly officially along-side the Union Jack.5. Anglo-Greek and Anglo-Turkish cultural conventions relating to Cypruscould be proposed; and the assessors could have defined responsibilities for super-vising cultural interests of the Greek and Turkish communities respectively.6. As this proposed near-condominium would be an attempt at a permanent settlement, the new Constitution to be introduced should be an advanced form ofself-government, providing for (i) an elected Legislature, with a proportion of seats reserved for the Turkishminority, and containing initially three ex-officio members (the colonial secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Attorney-General);(ii) a Council of Ministers, of whom the majority would be chosen by theGovernor from the members of the Legislature, after consultation withthe members of the Legislature. (This form of the Council of Ministersmeans that, to begin with, it would contain the Governor, the threeex-officio members and not less than, say, five unofficial members. Assoon as conditions permit, one of the unofficial members should becalled Chief Minister. At any rate for the lifetime of the firstLegislature the responsibility for choosing the Ministers should be withthe Governors discretion. He would, however, be expected to consult the members of the Legislature about his choice.)Departments of the Cyprus Government would be progressively transferred toCypriot Ministers, except those dealing with matters related to foreign affairs,defence and police, which matters would be reserved to the Governor. Theindependence of the Judiciary, and the terms of service for civil servants would be safeguarded in the Constitution. In the early stages, some financial safeguardsmight be desirable. The Assembly would enjoy full freedom of debate, but any bill which in the Governors opinion sought to amend the Constitution would have tobe reserved for the Royal Assent. (This arrangement would probably have to applyalso to Bills affecting the right of minorities, &amp;c).7. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake to review these arrangementsafter [five] years in consultation with the Greek and Turkish Governments, and withthe Cypriot Council of Ministers. We should aim at maintaining the plan (apartfrom detailed changes) for say, twenty years. There should be an instrument ortreaty establishing the Greek and Turkish Assessors, and this should recognise the paramount importance of Cyprus for common defence in present conditions.Comments8. The essence of the plan is that it seeks to provide an imaginative new proposal within the framework of continued British sovereignty over the Island.For this purpose certain calculated risks have to be taken. First, the limitedassociation of Greek and Turkish representatives in the exercise of the Governorspowers must inevitably mean some sacrifice of administrative convenience andpossibly of efficiency. Secondly, the advanced constitution which is proposed mustinvolve the initial danger of a Communist-controlled Government. We should,moreover, be abandoning, in this instance, the argument that our colonial territories are a matter of purely domestic jurisdiction and no concern of other powers; and, although Cyprus is a special case, there is some risk of our action beingquoted against us by other claimants to British territory. It is arguable, however,that the sum of these objections does not outweigh the advantage of breaking thepresent deadlock. More specifically the plan (i) safeguards Turkish interests and places the Turkish Government on an equal footing with the Greek;(ii) implies no commitment to grant self-determination.  The undertaking to review the arrangements after five years has been included in order tomake Greek acceptance possible (and also for practical reasons); but it involves no implied promise of a change in the status of Cyprus;(iii) if the Greek Government accept the proposals, they will have accepted thecontinuance of British sovereignty in Cyprus for an indefinite time tocome. If they reject them, the offer will remain on record as one whichwe are prepared to discuss again at any time.
