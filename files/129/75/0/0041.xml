Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1955SECRETCP. (55) 4115th June, 1955MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade we have so far held the position on this subject in the debate on the Address.We could, however, lose the initiative very quickly and the Socialists will certainlytry to take it from us.2. The Press on all sides are instancing the action or inaction we may displayin this field as a test of our sincerity. We certainly cannot continue to proclaim in public our intention to show vigour against abuses of monopoly unless at the sametime we demonstrate by our actions our willingness to make use of the machineryfor inquiry upon which our policy is based.3. The urgent need is to make some further references to the Commission.It will have been no good doubling its size if we persist in giving it no work to do.I have 9 questions down to me on this subject this week and it is essential that 1should make a comprehensive statement about the references we now intend tomake to the Commission.4. I accordingly propose to make the attached statement in answer to theseQuestions. It falls fairly and squarely within our declared policy. The reference of common prices will cover the present outburst of complaints on level tendering.It need not preclude us from taking such action as we may decide upon the reporton exclusive dealing and collective boycott which we have just received from theCommission. It will make it unnecessary to refer either cotton yarn spinning orcement.5. The individual references have been cleared with the Ministers responsiblefor the industries concerned.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,14th June, 1955.ANNEXSTATEMENT ABOUT MONOPOLIESWith permission, I will answer Questions together.2. Since the Monopolies Commission was set up it has produced elevenreports, on eight of which action has already been taken. The latest of these reports is one under Section 15 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act,the receipt of which was announced by the Prime Minister on 9th June.Copy No.  6 3CABINET48197
3. At the present -time the Commission has nine inquiries on hand and it isexpected that reports on at least three of these will be received before the end-of this year.4. I have had under consideration a programme of further references to theCommission for the next six to nine months. On the 23rd July, 1952, whenannouncing the first reference under Section 15 of the Act into practices whichprevail throughout industry generally, I emphasised the importance of this typeof investigation. I now propose to send to the Commission a further ;general reference under Section 15 covering common prices and level tendering, both ofwhich have been much in the public mind in recent months.5. I intend in addition to make a number of individual references. I wishto emphasise, as I have done before, that the making of a reference in no wayprejudges the question whether or not the arrangements involved operate againstthe public interest. It is indeed one of the main functions of the Commission to enquire into this point. The references which I expect to make very shortly willbe on the supply-of steel frames for buildings, electrical street lighting, tea, chemicalfertilisers and electric batteries.
