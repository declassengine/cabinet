I fill(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 44 COPY NO.   6 120th Tune, 1955CABINETPROFOSED COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY on administrative TRIBUNALSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Queen&apos;s Speech contained a passage promising an inquiry into the practice and procedure of administrative tribunals and quasi-judicial inquiries, including those concerned with land.    This was based onthe statement Conservative Party&apos;s manifesto before the GeneralElection that a just balance should be struck between the interests of theindividual and those of the community and that in this connection there wasroom for further improvement in the machinery of tribunals, of publicinquiries and of departmental decisions affecting individual interests inproperty.    I think my colleagues will now wish to consider what steps shouldbe taken to give effect to this undertaking.2, This matter was last considered by the Committee on Ministers&apos;Powers under the chairmanship of the Earl of Donoughmore, (then JLordChairman of Committees in the House of Lords) which was appointed by my predecessor Lord Sankey in October, 1929, &quot;after consultation with thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (acting Prime Minister)&quot;.The composition and terms of reference of this Committee are set out inthe Annex to this paper.    As will be seen, the scope of the DonoughmoreCommittee&apos;s inquiry was wider than that now envisaged, for that Committeewas concerned also with delegated legislation, but so far as administrative tribunals are concerned it covered very much the same ground as that nowin question.    Since the Committee reported in 1932, the general influence of these tribunals in the national life has of course enormously increased andI think there can be no doubt that the time has arrived for an impartial inquiryby a really authoritative Committee, if only to allay the widespread fear thatthis development represents a dangerous interference with our traditionalliberties.    There can, I think, be little doubt that many of the fears expressedfrom time to time are exaggerated, and in my view one of the most importanttasks of such a Committee will be to educate public opinion on this subject.3, My colleagues will be aware that a Private Member&apos;s Bill,entitled the Liberties of the Subject Bill, was introduced in the lastParliament which was intended to give effect to the recommendations madein a pamphlet entitled &apos;\Rule of Law&quot;, published earlier this year by theInns of Court Conservative and Unionist Society.    This Bill would have givenanyone affected by any decision of an administrative authority (including a minister of the Crown or any government department) the right to require theauthority to publish a statement of the evidence, findings of fact and reasonson which the decision was based; and the new Administrative Division of theHigh Court to be set up by the Bill would have had the right to quash thedecision if it thought that the decision was based on an error of fact, on
inferences which could not reasonably have been drawn from the facts, oron other considerations which could not reasonably have led to the decision inquestion.    I hope my colleagues will agree that such a proposal is mis-conceived and that Parliament is the proper place in which to question andcriticise matters of this kind.    I think it is essential that we should be clear from the outset about this and that the proposed Committee should not be free to canvass the desirability of enabling the day-to-day decisions of theExecutive to be reviewed by some independent authority.4. So far as matters affecting land are concerned, the main points on which public uneasiness has been expressed and which will, I think, haveto be considered by the new Committee are   -(i) whether the members of the tribunal or the inspectors by whom public inquiries areconducted should be independent of theMinister or department responsible;(ii) whether, in the case of public inquiries andsubject to the needs of national security, allthe facts relevant to the Minister&apos;s decision should be fully deployed at the inquiry so thatali objectors may know exactly what case theyhave to meet;(iii) whether the inspector^ report should be published;(iv) whether the tribunal or the Minister should berequired to give a reasoned decision on the matterscovered by the hearing or inquiry;(v) whether there should in all cases be an appeal tothe High Court on any question of law involved.I think that such matters as these would be covered by terms of referencefollowing the words used in The Queen&apos;s Speech.5. It is of the first importance to ensure that the Chairman of theproposed Committee should be a person in whom all shades of opinion will feel general confidence.    I doubt whether we could find anyone better suitedfor this purpose than Lord Radcliffe, whose recent Reith Lectures on theProblem of Power showed his interest in the subject.    Should he not beavailable, I think that Lord Justice Parker would make a very good Chairman;before his appointment to the Bench, he had much experience of problems ofthis kind.6. I think it is important that the Committee should not be too large and that it should not represent too many diverse interests, for a report which included minority reports representing several different points ofview would satisfy no one.    Apart from the Chairman, the Committee mightwell consist of two Members of Parliament, an academic representative with experience of this subject, such as Sir Ivor Jennings or Dr. R.M. Jackson, aQueen&apos;s Counsel, a solicitor of the calibre of Sir Edwin Herbert, and representatives of the Trades Union Congress and of the local authorities.Although the Civil Service was represented on the Donoughmore Committee,I think it would be better to have no civil servants on the new Committee.
7. If my colleagues agree with these suggestions, I ask for authority to make the necessary preliminary enquiries with a view to puttingdefinite proposals before the Cabinet in due course.K.Lord Chancellor^ Office, S.W.1.20th June, 1955.annex the terms of reference of the Committee on Ministers&apos;Fowers appointed in 1929 were as follows:-&quot;To consider the powers exercised by or under thedirection of (or by persons or bodies appointed speciallyby) Ministers of the Crown by way of (a) delegated legislation and (b) judicial or quasi-judicial decision, andto report what safeguards are desirable or necessary tosecure the constitutional principles of the sovereignty of Parliament and the supremacy of the Law&quot;.The Committee consisted of:-The Rt.
