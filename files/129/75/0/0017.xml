THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    g 1CP. (55) 174th May, 1955CABINETDEPARTMENTAL RECORDSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulated a memorandum (C. (55) 16) to the Cabinet in January proposing that we should accept the main recommendations in the Grigg Report, on thearrangements for the preservation of the records of Government departments in England and Wales. The Cabinet considered my memorandum and amemorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (54) 265) on 3rd March(C. (55) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4), when the main issue discussed was whetherCabinet records should be open to public inspection after 50 years. Noconclusion was reached and 1 understand that the Secretary of the Cabinet is making further enquiries into various aspects of the eventual public disclosure of Cabinet records. Obviously this issue is not urgent and there is every advantage in having the subject thoroughly explored before a decision is taken.2. Meantime, however, some difficulty may arise through the delay incarrying into effect the other recommendations of the Grigg Committee,particularly those relating to the reorganisation of the Public Record Office. Ishould, therefore, be glad if the Cabinet would give me authority to proceed withthese other matters on the lines proposed in C. (55) 16. I should not, of course,take any action which would prejudice the issue at what date Cabinet recordsshould be made available for public inspection.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,2nd May, 1955.48011
