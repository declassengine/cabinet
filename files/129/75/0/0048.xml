[1   &apos;. I-M (liT(THIS D    iUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(55) 4020th June, 1955WESTERN ADEN PROTECTORATENote by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will have seen reports in the Press of anambush, by Rabizi rebels.    The Acting Governor, Aden reported on16th June that on the previous day a combined convoy of Aden ProtectorateLevies and Government Guards, after taking replacements and stores tothe garrison at Rabat Fort had been ambushed on the return journey and suffered heavy casualties.    Two British officers were killed and three other Levies, together with three Government Guards, and there were other casualties.2. The Secretary of State for Air has now received full reports on this incident from the A.O.C., British Forces, Aden.    The aden protectorate Levies and Government Guards have been maintaining theRabat Fort since early in 1954.    There have been twenty-four previousconvoys to it, on which there have been frequent attacks by the Rabiziwith a total of seven killed and eleven wounded.    On this occasion morethan usually heavy air cover was provided;  on the outward journey therewas normal air cover of six Venoms in continuous pairs; and on thereturn, the same;  in addition there were special prearranged attacks against potential trouble areas by three Vampires and four Venoms.    Iunderstand that without this support there would have been even heaviercasualties.3. This incident is only one of many skirmishes between the aden Protectorate Levies and Government Guards on our side, and dissidenttribesmen on the other, which are continually taking place in the WesternAden Protectorate, as part of our efforts to maintain internal security.So far as the Rabizis themselves are concerned they have been, in revoltagainst their Ruler, the Sultan of the Upper Aulaqi, since December, 1953.From the beginning of this revolt there has been ample evidence that itwas stimulated and supported by the Amil of Beidha, the neighbouringProvince of the Yemen.    This support has been given in the form of money,arms and ammunition.    The Rabizis themselves have, on one occasion,admitted that they were receiving support from this source.    This revoltis therefore only a part of the aggressive activities of the Yemen Govern-ment against the Western Aden Protectorate.4. I am submitting, with the concurrence of the Treasury, theForeign Office and the Air Ministry, a memorandum to my colleaguesabout the state of affairs in the Western Aden Protectorate, and Yemeniaggressive activities, asking for approval for a number of measures designed to counteract this situation (C.P.(55) 47).     It is purelyCOPY NO.    &quot;*CABINET
coincidental that this incident has taken place just at the time when theproblem as a whole v/as coming up for our consideration;  but it servesto point the acute difficulties which now exist in the We stern aden protectorate, and to underline the imperative necessity of the adoption ofthe various counter-measures discussed in my memorandum.5. As I send in this note,further telegrams have arrived fromthe Acting Governor.    I will circulate these separately.A. L. -B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.20th June, 1955.

HOUSE OF COMMONS DISQUALIFICATION BILL

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and Minister for Welsh Affairs

When the Cabinet considered on 14th June the draft Bill attached to my memorandum of 22nd March (C.(55) 74) they invited me (C.M.(55) 14th Conclusions, Minute 3) to discuss three points with the other Ministers concerned and to submit a further report. The discussion took place in the Home Affairs Committee on 17th June (H.P.(55) 17 and H.P.(55) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1) and the Committee agreed to make the following recommendations to the Cabinet:-



(i) reference to Commonwealth and Colonial office-holders should be omitted from the draft Bill;

(ii) the provisions of the Bill disqualifying clerks and deputy clerks of all local authorities in Great Britain should be retained;

(iii) clause l(l)(e), which disqualifies members of non-Commonwealth legislatures, should also remain in the Bill.

I invite the Cabinet to accept these recommendations and to authorise consultation on the provisions of the Bill with the Government of Northern Ireland and with the Opposition Parties at Westminster.
