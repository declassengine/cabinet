secret.P.(55) 252nd June, 1955CURRENT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PROBLEMSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national ServiceThere has been in recent weeks a serious deterioration in industrial relations.    The purpose of this paper is to consider some of the suggestions which have been made to meet this situation and to propose a policy for theimmediate future.Secret Ballot2.        To impose a legal requirement of a secret ballot before strike action would in my judgment meet resistance from the trade union movementas a whole.    There would have to be control of the ballot by some body or person outside the trade union concerned, e. g. the Chief Registrar of friendly Societies.    To protect the individual member from pressure andto encourage a high proportion of the membership to vote, it might be preferable in some casesfor the ballot to be conducted by post and in national disputes of major importance it might be desirable for the results to be published for the information of the public.3.        This proposal would be resisted as an interference with the right to strike and as an interference with the union&apos;s management and regulation ofits own affairs.    In any event, provision for a secret ballot would not, ofcourse, help to prevent unofficial strikes which are ex hypothesi against the will and authority of the union.    Moreover, a determined union could stillpursue its militant aim while keeping within the law.    It could arm itself with the necessary authority by vote at an early stage in the negotiations;it could encourage, without formally authorising, unofficial action;  and itcould engage in lawful obstruction such as going slow and working to rule.And in the case of the more moderate unions, an authorisation by ballot to strike might make it more difficult for the negotiators to settle oncompromise terms.  I doubt whether the proposal discussed in this para-graph would be effective but it is one of the matters which will no doubt bediscussed in the talks with the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) recommendedbelow.Unofficial Strikes4.       Any attempt to make unofficial strikes illegal raises difficult questions of penalties and enforcement.    Penal sanctions against individualstrikers - there may be tens of thousands of them as in the recent unofficialcoal stoppage in Yorkshire - would be ineffective and dangerous andsanctions could hardly be directed against the funds or officers of theunions whose authority is being flouted.COPY NO.cabinet-1-
Compulsory Arbitration5.        Compulsory arbitration involves the withdrawal of the right to strike.    It is not compatible with generally accepted ideas of free negotiation and free contract and is contrary to political pledges given on this subject.A General Inquiry6,        There have been many demands for an inquiry by some such bodyas a Royal Commission into the whole position of trade unions and thesystem of industrial relations.    A call for a comprehensive review was recently made by the Chairman of the British Employers1 Confederation.The existing consultative machinery, composed of leading re oresentativesof employers&apos; organisations and trade unions would hardly have thenecessary independence.   A Royal Commission would be ponderous andslow-moving.    In my view, an authoritative independent Committee would prove a better instrument.    Such a body would be unlikely to produce novelsolutions for current troubles, but it might serve a useful purpose inclarifying the issues, dispelling popular misconceptions and giving authorityto acceptable doctrine, much as the Whitley Committee during the first world war developed, without revolutionising, fundamental industrial relations policy.    Moreover, if any form of legislation is to be attempted,it would in my view be necessary to have some inquiry first to formulateideas and shape public opinion.    For all these reasons, I feel that if any government action is to be taken at this stage it should be on these lines.Inter-union Disputes7.        Inter-union rivalry has been a prominent feature of recent disputesDIt can lead to employers being presented with the dilemma of conflictingwage claims (as in the railways) or irreconcilable claims for recognition(as in the docks).    Government action in this sphere is neither desirablenor practicable.    The Government cannot dictate the form of trade union organisation in a particular industry and it is for the employer and not for the Government to decide with whom the employer should do business.The T. U, C. have a role in this field; reference is made to it in thefollowing paragraph.The Fosition of the T. U.. C.8.        The axithority of the T. U. C. in these matters is limited.Collective bargaining is the concern of the affiliated unions and not of theT. U. C. which can act only in an advisory capacity.    The T. U, C.represents many conflicting interests within its membership and it isclearly difficult for it to advocate action contrary to the policy of anaffiliated union, particularly if it is large and powerful.    Nevertheless,the T. U. C. has a duty under its Constitution to concern itself in disputes which may cause widespread unemployment.    Under its Constitution it also has a special role in seeking to reconcile inter-union disputes.    Itcan generally be counted on to exercise a moderating influence (though thiswould be ineffective in the case of recalcitrant unions such as the electrical Trades Union) if the action of an individual union is likely tobring discredit on the trade union movement in general.    It is, in my view,essential that any Government initiative in the field of industrial relations should carry the greatest possible measure of T. U. C. approval andconcurrence.    Unless we carry with us the responsible elements, who areat present in a majority, we run the risk of uniting the whole movementagainst us.
Action Proposed9.       We are committed by election statements to discuss currentindustrial problems with the T. U. C, in the first place, and later with theNational Joint Advisory Council (N.J.A.C.) which would bring in theemployers and the nationalised industries.    Discussions with the T, U. C.would in any case be a necessary step before any action is undertaken.I propose to initiate these discussions which will be preceded by informaltalks with selected T. U. C. leaders.    I would, of course, take parallelsoundings with representatives of the British Employers&apos; Confederation.In these talks I would express the concern of the Government and thecountry at recent developments and ask both the unions and the employers for their own suggestions and for their views on the ideas which have beencanvassed in recent weeks (without of course identifying *he Governmentwith any of these ideas).    I would like to make it clear in these talks thatit was not the Governments wish to seek to regulate matters which couldbe more satisfactorily dealt with by industry itself.    Nevertheless thedemand for Government action and for regulatory legislation would be bound to grow if our present system led to frequent breakdowns.    I would seek to enlist the support of the N, J. A. G. for an independent review ofour system of industrial relations to which I refer in paragraph 6, making it clear that the object of the review would be to seek to strengthen that system rather than overturn it.    I would propose to seek the advice of mycolleagues on further action in the light of these consultations.10.      In my view there is no panacea for these ills and, in particular, thescope for remedial action by the Government is limited.    At bottom, theproblem is a question of developing a sense of national responsibility andof internal discipline among the rank and file of the trade union movement.The poor quality of local union officials and the small and apatheticattendances at branch meetings play into the hands of extremists and encourage industrial unrest.    The educational task involved is a long-termone and can only be tackled by the unions themselves.    The trade unionmovements existing facilities for training and education are inadequate and it is perhaps worth considering whether the Government could withpropriety help over the question of premises.    A way in which employersmight help is to allow trade union branch meetings to be held in workingtime; this might encourage better attendances and, it is hoped, more responsible decisions.W.
