secret.P.(55) 39 COPY NO.   fi 114th June, 1955CABINETGAT WICK airport memorandum by the Secretary of State for air in October 1954 the Cabinet finally decided that a new airportshould be constructed at Gatwick (C.C.(54) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 7).Both before and since that decision the Director General of &quot;Works at theAir Ministry has employed a number of his qualified staff upon this project and also in connection with the Public Inquiry.2. Early in the war the Select Committee on National Expenditurerecommended that the Air Ministry should carry out all airfield constructionwork for the Government.    This arrangement, so far as the Ministry ofCivil Aviation was concerned, was confirmed in 1945, when this new ministry was set up.    It has been reviewed on at least two occasions sincethe war and continues to this day.    For this purpose, a Director of Worksfrom the Air Ministry; together with appropriate staff, has been secondedto the civil aviation department to plan and execute airfield works.    ThisDirector has advised on the practicability of developing the Gatwick sie and on the technical problems involved.    He has given a broad estimate ofthe cost of the- proposed works.It is true that certain works for civil aviation since the war have been undertaken by outside firms.    These have been airport terminalbuildings.    But all runway work for the Civil Aviation Ministry, including that at London Airport, has been controlled by the Director General of Works.It is true as well that f rom time to time consultants areemployed on some R.A.F. projects (though not on runways).    These are appointed by the Director General of Works at the Air Ministry who carriesthe technical responsibility and who supervises all work on any Air Ministryairfield on which outside contractors are employed.3. The desire of the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to assure himself that the works plans for Gatwick are both technically sound and financially economical is a natural one which I appreciate.    I have nowish to insist upon the maintenance of existing practices (described inparagraph 2) should he wish to alter them.    It would however have been better had this view been taken earlier.    But I hold strongly to the opinionthat, quite apart from questions of professional etiquette, undividedresponsibility for a task of this kind must be placed squarely upon either the Director General of Works or upon an outside consultant.    Theresponsibility must be for the whole scheme ab initio because any short-comings in design or construction by an outside consultant could much tooeasily be ascribed to the preliminary work already carried out by my
Department.    In this field, advice which does not carry with it the onus of bringing the work to a successful conclusion is valueless.    The only true testis the result.4. In these circumstances, the Director General of Works, being unable to settle satisfactorily this matter of ultimate responsibility, whichwas put in question when the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation showedtheir intention to call in outside consultants, was in my view right to discontinue work on this project pending a decision.    I must point out thatit has been open to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to bring forward this point for decision at any time since March.    It was perfectly clear at that time that a major question of principle affecting the positionof professional civil servants was under challenge by the proposal to put them in competition with outside consultants.5. To sum up my position, there is no objection on my part to theuse of an outside firm on the Gatwick project if that is what the Ministerwishes.    Indeed I should welcome it.    What in my view is objectionableon administrative as well as on professional grounds - is that outsiders ofthe same profession should be called in to &quot;vet&quot; the work of government servants or enter into competition over it.    If the work is to be done by an outside firm it should be on the basis of full technical and financial responsibility.    Thus everything, including the resumption of work by myDepartment, turns upon the decision of the Minister of Transport and civil Aviation whether or not to employ outside consultants upon this project.D.L.D.Air Ministry, S. W. 1.14th June, 1955.
