 6(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 16 &apos;   COPY NO.3rd May, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL, immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh affairs at their meeting on 6th December, 1954, the Cabinet invited theColonial Secretary and myself to arrange for the preparation of draftlegislation designed to place restrictions on the admission of ColonialBritish subjects into this country (C. C. (54) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 7).A Bill has now been drafted and is ready for consideration by the Cabinet,but I do not think that the Cabinet will wish to consider its provisions until after the Election.    In the meantime, however, the question arises whether any statement should be made before the Election about the policy of theGovernment in this connection.2. In order to bring the facts up to date I should say that the flow of Colonial immigrants continues to increase and, on present information,those coming from the West Indies in 1955 may well reach 20,000, ascompared with some 10,000 in 1954, and some 2,000 in 1953.    The numberof immigrants from the Indian continent is more difficult to estimate, but probably amounts to some thousands a year.    I understand that the immigrants are still experiencing little difficulty in finding work and arenot making excessive demands on National Assistance.    The mainpractical problems are in the field of housing and public health: theytend to congregate and live in overcrowded conditions which it is beyondthe resources of the housing authorities concerned to alleviate.    On thewhole the degree of public interest taken in their arrival has tended to grow less.i3. I have been of opinion that, before taking any decision aboutwhether or not there should be legislation, it would be well to have thereport of a committee of inquiry.    I remain of this opinion, though I havegiven the subject further consideration particularly as regards immediate action in the light of the Election.    It seems to me that the proposalinvolves two further questions, namely (a) what would be the purpose ofthe inquiry, and (b) when should the appointment be announced?4. As regards (a), doubts have already been expressed at themeeting of the Cabinet on 6th December about the outcome of such an inquiry.    I agree that it is very unlikely that any committee representativeof public opinion would arrive at a unanimous conclusion and indeed the,issues involved are essentially matters of opinion and policy.    On theother hand a good deal of information on the subject is lacking and publicopinion is still uninformed.    Accordingly, I suggest the appointment ofwhat would be primarily a fact-finding committee, though no doubt it wouldbe necessary (unless the committee were to consist entirely of officials)to draft its terms of reference so as to permit it to make recommendations.-1-
ID5. As regards (b), if it is decided to set up a committee I think thatthe announcement at this juncture would be most undesirable.    It is known that the Government has been considering this problem for many months,and indeed a request for an inquiry was turned down by the former PrimeMinister in the House of Commons on 18th March, 1954.&apos; If a sudden changewere made now it would alarm those who are against restrictions and atthe same time appear to those who live in areas which are directly affectedas being nothing but a dilatory device.6. It is however certain that questions will be put to members of theGovernment and their supporters during the Election on this subject and itwill therefore be necessary to take a very early decision about the advice to be given.    The choice appears to lie between four courses - (i) a promise of legislation, (ii) refusal to legislate, (iii) reservation of our position,(iv) the appointment of a committee of inquiry.7. I am personally of opinion that it will be necessary to pass somelegislation sooner or later to deal with this problem.    I therefore favourtaking a firm decision now that it is the Governments intention to legislate,though the extent of the legislative powers needed have yet to be settled.I therefore suggest that I should take an early opportunity during the election and after dissolution to include in a speech a statement that this is theParty&apos;s attitude.G.Li. -G.Home Office, S.W.1,2sd May, 1955.
