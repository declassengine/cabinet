Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (55) 4015th June, 1955CABINETORGANISATION OF CROWN LANDSNote by the Prime minister have received the attached Report from the Committee, under thechairmanship of Sir Malcolm Eve, which was appointed to examine the organisationof Crown Lands. I have it in mind to publish the Report as a Command Paper.2. The main proposal made by the Committee is that there should be a Boardof Trustees who would be in charge of Crown Lands, in place of the present threeCommissioners (the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary of State for Scotland anda civil servant). If my colleagues agree with this proposal, there might be some advantage in taking a decision forthwith in favour of it since we could then begin to look for the chairman and the deputy chairman, the proposed permanent head ofthe office, who could be selected now and appointed as Commissioners under theexisting legislation. I would announce our acceptance of the idea of a Board of trustees when publishing the Report. There are, of course, other recommendations in the Report which we should have to consider at greater leisure.A. E.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,14th June, 1955.48196

Reportto the rt. hon. sir anthony eden, k.g., m.c., m.p.Prime Minister and First Lord of the treasury sir,We were appointed in December 1954 to &quot; examine the present organisation for the administration of Crown Lands and to report whether any change should be made &quot;.Conduct of enquiry2. We have held 15 meetings. During a temporary absence of the chairman,Sir Edward Gillett took the chair at meetings in London and Mr. Hugh Watsonin Edinburgh. We are much indebted to the Commissioners of Crown Landsand their staff and agents, and to the departments and other bodies who also provided us with valuable information and advice (appendix A).Layout of report3. Paragraphs 4-7 describe Crown Lands. Some appendices and tables areadded because of the lack of.published information. Paragraphs 8-20 recom-mend that there should be a new board of trustees, subject to parliamentary control but with a substantial measure of independence. This would require legislation. Paragraphs 21-33 suggest that the organisation should, be strengthened in ways that would not require legislation, and review the employ-ment of firms of land agents for local management. There is a summary of recommendations in paragraph 34.PART IThe Crown EstateCrown Lands4. Crown Lands are a large holding of rural and urban property. They havea long history (appendix B) and are administered under the Crown Lands Acts1829-1943 by three Commissioners. The Commissioners are the Minister ofAgriculture, the Secretary of State for Scotland and a whole time administrativecivil servant.5. In effect, Crown Lands are a trust estate, of which the capital belongsto the Sovereign. The income after meeting costs of upkeep has been sur-rendered to Parliament at the beginning of each reign since that of king george III, in accordance with a Civil List Act. Currently, it is paid intothe Exchequer under the Civil List Act 1952 &quot; during the present reign anda period of six months afterwards&quot;.&apos;.a
Name6. The name &quot; Crown Lands &quot; is perhaps confusing. The name &quot; WoodsForests and Land Revenues &quot; was used in the title of the Commissioners formany years. The present name was adopted in 1924 when most of the v/oodsand forests were transferred to the Forestry Commission. Crown Lands area revenue-producing trust estate, essentially different from land acquired and maintained by the Government for various uses such as bombing ranges,airfields, the erection of government offices and other public purposes. Toavoid ambiguity we refer to Crown Lands as &quot; the Crown Estate &quot; and werecommend that they should be so described in future Acts and publicdocuments.The estate7. The present estate (appendix C) consists of 384,000 acres of ruralproperty in England, Scotland and Wales, some very valuable Londonproperty, much of the foreshore round the coast, some mineral and otherrights, and a holding of government securities. Most of the properties are held as an investment. A few are held because they are ancient hereditarypossessions of the Sovereign, or for other reasons. The estate is one of thelargest, most varied and most valuable holdings of landed property in GreatBritain. Gross revenue is at present  2  million and net revenue  1 million(table 1). No recent valuation has been made, but the total assets are probablyworth at least  50 million.PART IIA Board of ManagementManagement8. The present statutory organisation dates, with minor changes, from1810 (appendix D). A high standard of administration has been achieved,especially on the agricultural side, despite defects of organisation. For this great credit is due to the Commissioners and their staff and agents, but a-stronger organisation should be amply repaid by increases in the capital value of the estates and in the income payable to the Exchequer. The workof protecting and improving capital assets and of securing an adequatereturn on landed property in town or country is more complex than it usedto be. Owners of large landed estates have been compelled by changes in egislation and for economic and other reasons to overhaul their arrange-ments for management. At the present time few individuals, however ex-ineperienced and able, can adequately oversee scattered agricultural estates,valuable urban properties, and a portfolio of investments. For a task of this magnitude a team of experts has become a necessity; the team require a defined policy and the power to take decisions within the time often onlyfleeting that is available for successful investment. A single chief agentis still probably the best arrangement for smaller and less varied estatesbut is outdated for the largest.The Commissioners9. The Commissioners of Crown Lands do not meet and take decisions as a Commission. Since 1906, Ministers of Agriculture have taken a par-ticular interest as Commissioners in the administration of the agriculturalestates in England and Wales. Since 1943, Secretaries of State for Scotland
i7     a    ffPhave performed a similar service for the Scottish estates. These benefits are however outweighed by the artificiality of a Commission which includes two ministers and an official, and by the risk of using, or even appearing to use,trust monies to further government policy. The duties of a Minister ofAgriculture may conflict with the duties of a trustee for the Crown agricul-tural estates. This we think has caused difficulty, and few Ministers ofAgriculture have been, as such, particularly interested in the urban properties.In practice, the Permanent Commissioner (appointed from within the civilservice) heads a small government department for which the two ministers are responsible to Parliament. He seeks the approval of one or other ofthe Ministers at his discretion but is &quot; out on a limb &quot; with a wide andlonely responsibility. For many purposes, he is his own chairman, manage-ment board, general manager and finance officer.Need for a board10. The Crown Estate requires a board of management that meets regularlyand takes decisions as a board. There is no point on which we have receivedsuch a striking unanimity of advice, borne out by the experience of many other large estates. Of those about which we have enquired, all have atthe head of their organisation a board, council or executive committee. the forestry Commission and the Agricultural Land Commission are boardscreated by statute for the management of large areas of land owned by thegovernment. An estates and finance committee are given by statute themanagement of the Church Commissioners&apos; estates and investments. TheDuchies of Cornwall and Lancaster have councils. The National Trust havean executive committee. A large private estate and the estate department ofa large commercial undertaking were also kind enough to give us particulars of their organisation and a strong committee featured in each.Main recommendation11. We therefore recommend a new statutory board of trustees, to be knownperhaps as the &quot;Crown Estate Trustees&quot;. The relations of the board withthe Sovereign as owner of the estate, and with the immediate advisers of the sovereign, would naturally remain, as now, close and not on a formal basis.We should expect one of the principal duties of its chairman to be to seek the Sovereign^ consent on such matters as the more important capitaltransactions and the administration of the Windsor estate.Public control12. The board should be a public authority, but not a government depart-ment in the sense of an organ of executive government. We have been asked by some of those whom we have consulted to recommend that the board should be given complete statutory freedom as trustees from all Treasurycontrol, and an almost complete freedom from Parliamentary and ministerial control. We appreciate and endorse the need for trustees to be independent.Parliament are however entitled to the whole surplus income during onereign. We do not think that any private person or public corporation entitledto such an important interest would give a blank cheque to any managementboard, however distinguished in membership. There must therefore be powersto ensure the possibility of control at least over policy and major mattersof management. A specified Minister of the Crown should have power to: give directions (whether general or specific) to the board, the Treasury should; have a power of control over staffing. and expenditure, the administrative: head of the office should be accounting officer for the board&apos;s accounts and
should appear before the Public Accounts Committee, the Comptroller and auditor General should audit the accounts, and the board should be requiredto submit an annual report (paragraph 18) and accounts to Parliament. Inaddition the headquarters expenses of the board should probably continueto appear on a Parliamentary Vote, but should in future be repaid to the vote out of the land revenues, so that the staff and the public can more readily realise the true cost of managing the Crown Estate (table 1).Limits of control13. The extent to which the powers of control are used must be for thedecision of the Government and Parliament. We do however respectfully advise that the board should be more, not less, independent than the present Com-missioners and that they should be given defined powers and duties astrustees and allowed to work them out with the minimum of direction or control. The board should be free to buy and sell properties and to managethe estate within a broad programme agreed with the Treasury and revisedannually. Establishment control, especially of local staff, should be less rigidthan at present. It is only in this way that men of the right calibre and experience may be attracted to serve on the board, and that capital and revenue can be increased to the extent which is practicable.Use of trust monies14. Government expenditure is voted by Parliament. It would be a breach of Parliamentary control if the government spent the surplus income fromthe Crown Estate instead of paying it into the Exchequer. This was a main reason why the Office of Woods Forests and Land Revenues was separated from the Office of Works in 1851 (Lord John Russell, quoted in appendix D).It is even more important that the government should not use the capital to subsidise departmental expenditure. Even as regards capital, however,which it is their inherent duty to conserve, the Commissioners have in thepast occasionally accepted decisions by the government differing from thepolicy which they could justify as trustees. In so doing, they have been left open to the suspicion of providing hidden subsidies to government depart-ments and other public bodies, as for instance when valuable forestry assetswere transferred to the Forestry Commission without payment in 1924(appendix D). We note however that after the report of Lord GorelPsCommittee on the regent&apos;s  Park Terraces (Cmd. 7094) the government under-took to make good from a Parliamentary Vote the costs of uneconomicretention of the property. We recommend that the latter precedent should befollowed and carried out in any similar case. In fairness to the board we also think that they should be consulted before any direction is given to themby their Minister and that the direction should be published in the annual report of the board. Only by acting openly will the board be protectedfrom the suspicion of subsidising government expenditure.Composition of board15. The statutory requirements about the size and composition of the board should, we suggest, not be too precise or detailed. The board, when firstappointed, may have to be somewhat larger than would be necessary later,and flexibility is in any event desirable. We propose that it should consistof.a chairman and between 4 and 7 other members appointed by royal warrant, and that there should be power to pay the chairman and members.Much will depend on the ability and experience of the chairman, who needhoweyer devote only part of his time to the board. Most of the members
should be part-time and should be selected on a broad basis paying attentionboth to variety of experience and to the geographical situation of the estatesat any given time. So long as the Scottish estates retain their present im-portance we assume that there will be adequate Scottish representation.There should be a power, but not an obligation, to appoint a deputy chair-man and to appoint one or more persons as full-time members. We recom-mend that a full-time administrator from within the civil service should beappointed initially as deputy chairman, administrative head, and accountingofficer; and that two of the part-time members of the first board should beprofessionally qualified, one on urban and one on agricultural land manage-ment (paragraphs 22, 25).The responsible Minister16. We understand that it would be proper for us to suggest some of the considerations which should be borne in mind in selecting the Minister or ministers to be responsible for the board to Parliament. We feel that the selected Minister ought not to be any Minister with a special interest as  minister in the use or control of land. This recommendation, if accepted,would exclude any Minister of agriculture, works, housing or town and country planning, but would not necessarily exclude the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, as &quot; Scotland&apos;s Minister &quot;. The choice of Minister would appearto us to lie between the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Home Secretary and a non-departmental Minister. If reasonable freedomof action were given to the board we do not believe that the new responsibility would add substantially to the existing burden of any Minister.Definition of duties17. An important statutory defect of organisation is that the general dutiesof the Commissioners are unwritten and undefined (appendix E). It can beinferred from the Crown Lands Acts and the Civil List Act that the Com-missioners are to act generally as trustees. It is tacitly understood that it is their duty to preserve and increase the value of the properties entrusted totheir charge, to meet the obligations of a good landowner, and (subject tothese duties) to obtain the maximum revenue for the Sovereign or for such other beneficiary as may be laid down by statute. The lack of a clear statutoryduty has made it more difficult to weigh their duties as trustees against theclaims of conformity with government policy. These duties should now be written into statute.Annual report18. A further ^defect is the lack of an informative annual report to Parlia-ment. There is a striking lack of knowledge about the Crown Estate and itsownership and management. (Each of us had to learn almost everything aboutthe estate after our appointment.) A report is required by statute, but itsform was prescribed in too much detail. The reports contained a mass ofnow useless information and neither the woods nor the forests nor the landrevenues could be seen for the trees. Over-control defeated its object, and publication has been discontinued (without authority, but sensibly) for sometime. Reports by the board should be in the form normal to other reportsof statutory bodies.The Crown Lands Acts19. In order to give full effect to the recommendations in this part of our report, there would have to be a considerable revision of the Crown LandsActs 1829-1943. It would appear desirable to undertake at the same time a
much needed general revision of the acts, and to consolidate them. We recommended-mend that the board should ibe required to consider their powers and duties under the acts and to report on them, after consulting the Ministers concerned,within a specified period.Timetable20. We recommend that these changes should be brought into effect in three stages. Firstly, a chairman-designate and deputy chairman-designateshould be appointed as Commissioners of Crown Lands by reviving a post of Commissioner which has been vacant since 1912 (appendix D). Thesetwo appointments would be an immediate stop-gap to enable urgent workto be undertaken before the creation of the board. Secondly, a short actshould be passed to set up the board which should then be left to operatetemporarily within the present statutory framework. We recommend thatthis short act should be passed at a very early date because there has alreadybeen a period of uncertainty which is bad for the estate and for the office.Thirdly, the board should report on the Crown Lands Acts so that further .legislation might be introduced at the earliest convenient date to revise and consolidate the acts. We are, in effect, recommending that a task begun(appendix D) in 1793 and continued by Lord John Russell in 1851 theestablishment of a trust for the Sovereign and Parliament should becompleted.PART IIIOther Questions of ManagementIntroductory21. The vital change required for the management of the Crown Estateis the setting up of a board of trustees. The head office and the localorganisation are each at least as important as the organisation of the boarditself, but such defects as at present exist derive mainly from the lack ofa board and from the defects in the statutory organisation with which wehave already dealt. Changes in staffing and organisation, seem to us tobe questions of management which the new board should examine and decide for themselves, and we do not consider that we ought to suggest a staff organisation for them. We have however thought it right to offer briefcomments on one or two of the matters of management which the board would be expected by Parliament and the government to solve. Nothing whichwe say should be taken as reflecting on the efficiency of the present staff.The administrative head22. We have suggested (paragraph 15) that the administrative head shouldinitially be deputy chairman of the board and appointed from within thecivil service. We think that this is the correct solution at present, but wehave reached our conclusion only after receiving conflicting advice. It has for instance been urged that the administrative head should be an officer ofthe board and not a member. We do not accept this view. One of several reasons is that a person with the status of a trustee should visit the estatesand the whole-time administrative head must necessarily do most of this important work. However, the arrangements w,e propose should not, if theyare. adopted, be thought of as unalterable. It should be open to the board to recommend at a later stage if circumstances have changed that the full-timedeputy chairman should be replaced by a chief officer who is not a memberof the board.
Cm  W 123. It has also been urged that the administrative head of the CrownEstate should be a surveyor or land agent with administrative ability ratherthan a general administrator. Permanent Commissioners, who are at bestisolated and vulnerable, have also been handicapped by a lack of knowledgeor experience of the management of property, particularly on first appoint-ment. On the other hand, the duties of the administrative head of a verylarge publicly-owned estate are in many ways more like those of an ownerthan an agent. It would moreover be diffioult to find a surveyor or landagent at the present time with the requisite knowledge and experience ofboth urban and rural property. He would still have to lean on professionaladvice for some of his work, though less so than an administrator withouta professional qualification. Even a privately owned estate might thereforewish to consider, as a possible alternative to a surveyor or land agent, alawyer, an accountant with special experience, a person with businessexperience, or a trained administrator; or perhaps to train a potential headfrom within the staff. The board, however, will be a public authority. the pay of their staff will have to be kept in general line (as is the case with the forestry Commission and the Church Commissioners) with the pay of thestaff of government departments. The early achievement of a substantialdegree of working independence from the Government, a matter which we regard as being of crucial importance (paragraph 13), would largely dependon having as the senior administrator and accounting officer a person with a thorough understanding of government business generally, and in particular of the Treasury, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the public accounts Committee. We can think of no one fitting these requirements sowell as a senior civil servant. He must however have adequate professionaladvice and be a member of a team of experts headed by a chairman withwide experience. Under these conditions he would not be so isolated andvulnerable as the Permanent Commissioner.Overall professional advice24. We consider that the deputy chairman, being non-professional, willoften require advice from agents with an overall view of the rural and urbanestates respectively and that such advice will be complementary to that ofthe local agent. We also regard it as essential that any agent who is chargedwith the day to day management of particular estates should have directaccess on technical matters, if not to a salaried chief agent, at any rate to apart-time consultant with an overall view of the estates. A local agent shouldnot object to a dissenting opinion being placed before the board togetherwith his own, especially on capital transactions ; some of the most efficientlandowning organisations find that it pays them to get the opinion of morethan one agent on any important proposal for acquisition or sale. We also consider that there is a need for some professional supervision of the localagents who have not got the advantage of being able to call on the resourcesof a large firm.25. There is at present no such advice, although a second opinion on capital projects may be taken from the Valuation Office of the Board of inland Revenue. We believe that the advice now lacking should be madeavailable, although we should deprecate any close supervision of qualifiedstaff in their day to day work. We note however that the Assistant Corri-missioner and the other senior non-professional staff of the head office have in practice acquired a knowledge of many of the technical problems. Wehave therefore assumed that a new board might well not wish to disturb thepresent arrangements by the immediate appointment of a salaried chiefagent or a part-time consultant either on the rural or on the urban side.9
It is for these reasons that we have recommended (paragraph 15) that thereshould be two professional members of the first board. They would help the board to decide how far existing arrangements are adequate, how far thedistribution of estates among Receivers requires overhaul and redistribution,how far working arrangements for local management might be made withother large estates, how far extra advice should be available on particularquestions, whether a part-time consultant should be appointed with an overallbrief, or whether a salaried chief land agent should be introduced for the urban or rural estates. During this interim period the professional staff shouldhave direct access on technical matters to the professional board members and the two members should receive a fee in addition to their part-time salaryas members. This interim period should be short, and permanent arrangements should be authorised as soon as possible.The Windsor estate26. The Windsor estate enjoys a special relationship to the Sovereign, andHis Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is the present Ranger of WindsorGreat Park. There are also special problems of management, including themaintenance of Windsor Great Park to which there is public access. A whole-time resident agent is essential.Agricultural properties27. The local management of the agricultural properties does not differessentially from the management of properties belonging to a private individual -dual or an institution, although the link with the Crown exacts its own high standards and is rightly a matter of pride to all concerned. The term &quot; CrownReceiver &quot; is of considerable antiquity tout must not toe thought to connotean official position or to imply any special responsibility to a Minister or tothe government departments with whose officials the Receiver may come in contact. He stands in the normal professional relation of a land agent tohis client, the landowner. We believe it to be important that this should be clearly stated and generally understood.28. Various alternative methods of administration are open to the board.They may, for instance, employ:(a) their own salaried staff ;(b) fee-paid firms of land agents ;(c) the local salaried staff of government departments and other public bodies j orid) local solicitors.Of these the third and fourth methods are probably the least well suited tothe Crown Estate, although the use of. a solicitor may have advantages inScotland. As we consider that the administration of the Crown Estate shouldbe kept clearly distinct from normal government administration we do not recommend any general use of the salaried land agency staffs of governmentdepartments or of the Forestry Commission.29. As between a whole-time salaried agent and a firm, our views coincide with the advice given to us toy the representative associations of landowners,surveyors and agents. The choice depends largely on the size and location of the particular estates and on personalities. Generalisation is difficult, butthere is almost certainly a place for tooth methods in managing the CrownEstate. Salaried agents are at present&quot; employed toy the Commissioners to manage large individual estates and also reasonably compact groups of
smaller estates. Groups of more isolated estates are now entrusted to firmsof land agents and surveyors. The Commissioners have in practice usedfirms of agents and surveyors to manage the majority of their estates becausethe estates vary in size and are widely distributed (table 3). The system hasnot on the whole been more expensive than that of maintaining whole-timestaff and is a convenient method of obtaining the services of professionalstaff with the highest qualifications and experience who are also able todraw on the professional advice and experience of the other partners and specialist employees of the firm. It is important that the board should not get out of touch with the best practice of private landowners and other large corporate landowners. By managing the estates of other landownersin the same area a firm may be able to devote the work of a whole-timepartner or qualified assistant to the area. Much of the advantage is lost ifthe firm does not manage other properties in the area or becomes almostwhole-time in the service of one landowner.Crichel Down30. Before coming to these conclusions we have taken account of the comments in the Crichel Down report (Cmd. 9176) on the employment of firms. These comments arose in connection with the work of Mr. Thomson,a partner in a firm of high repute (Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son) who acted forthe Commissioners of Crown Lands ; and appear to have arisen from Mr.Thomson&apos;s handling of a claim for dilapidations and the initial estimate ofthe firm&apos;s fee. Except on these two points we do not read the report as implying that the use of a salaried agent would have made a materialdifference to the course of events. Subsequent enquiries1 have however beenmade into these two points and no criticism of substance was sustainedagainst Mr. Thomson or his firm by the report of either enquiry. We aretherefore satisfied that there was no such dereliction of duty on the partof Mr. Thomson or of his firm a duty owed by them to the commissioners of Crown Lands and to the Commissioners alone as to bring discredit onthe method of employing private firms of land agents. We have not therefore thought it necessary to change or qualify our general conclusions about theuse of firms because of the particular instance of Crichel Down.31. The Crichel Down report found a lack of adequate control over theactivities of Crown Receivers, a tendency to leave too much to the Receiver,and inadequate consultation of the ex-ofncio Commissioner (the Minister)by the Permanent Commissioner. Our general review has not shown thatthese failings were widespread but we are confident that a board of trusteeswould be free from any weaknesses of this kind which may have existed.Indeed the findings of the Crichel Down report appear to ais to provide agood illustration of the weaknesses that might result from the lack of aboard of trustees. The isolation of a recently appointed Permanent Com-missioner and the dual position of the Minister are particularly noted inthe report. The risks of appearing to be merely a subordinate governmentdepartment and an instrument of government policy are also evident, asis the lack of a second opinion on a capital project or of professional adviceat the head office on the agricultural side. It is in our opinion revealing thatthese defects should have been evident on the agricultural side on whichthe general standard of administration is high.1 By Mr. R. C. Walmsley, F.R.I.C.S., F.L.A.S., and Mr. KG. Fleury, O.B.E., F.R.I.C.S.(nominated by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors at the requestof the Minister of Agriculture). Copies of Mr. Walmsley&apos;s report were placed in theHouse of Commons Library.   See also Hansard 20th July, 1954, cols. 1188, 1189.
Urban properties32. We recommend that the board should give special and early attentionto its urban properties. The first essential is a clear division of responsibility between the non-professional and professional staff. If the professional respon-sibility for the urban estates is divided between more than one agent, there ought also to be a clear division of responsibilities between the agents. Theproperties are at present managed by the salaried Crown Surveyor on thestaff of the head office, by a firm who act as Crown Surveyors, and by housingmanagers. These properties produce three-quarters of the gross revenue ofthe Crown Estate and an even higher proportion of net revenue. Inherentlythey have great possibilities. They require a more positive policy and closermanagement.Investments33. We regard the holding and management of an investment portfolio asan ancillary and necessary part of the management of landed estates of this size. The Commissioners have the power with the consent of the treasury to invest capital in any one or more of the modes authorised by the TrusteeAct, 1925. We recommend that the new board, while keeping in close touchwith the Treasury and the National Debt Office on matters of investmentpolicy, should manage their own investments. They should have powersof investment similar to those which are given from time to time to othertrustees under the general law.Main findings34. Our main findings may be summarised as follows :(a) Crown Lands should be renamed the Crown Estate (paragraph 6).(Jb) The Commissioners of Crown Lands should be replaced by a board .of trustees (paragraphs 8-11).(c) The rights of the Sovereign and of Parliament should be secured(paragraphs 11-12).(d) The board should enjoy a substantial measure of independence astrustees (paragraph 13).(e) They should be protected from any suspicion of subsidising govern-ment expenditure (paragraph 14).,-.    if) The statutory requirements about the size and composition of theboard should not be too precise and detailed (paragraph 15).ig) The responsible Minister should not have a special interest as. Minister in the use or control of land (paragraph 16).Qi) The general duties of the board should be written into statute(paragraph 17).(0 There should be an informative annual report (paragraph 18).GO The Crown Lands Acts should be revised and consolidated (paragraph19).(Jk) The changes should be brought into effect as soon as possible (para-graph 20).(/) The post of administrative head of the office should be filled by a civil servant who should also, at any rate initially, be deputy chairman(paragraphs 21-23).(m) There is a need for overall professional advice for both the ruraland urban estates (paragraphs 24, 25).
(n) The employment of firms of land agents and surveyors is a suitablemethod of local administration for agricultural estates in appropriate cases(paragraphs 27-31).(o) The organisation for managing the urban estates should be strengthened (paragraph 32),(p) The board should manage their own investment portfolio in consul-tation with the Treasury and the National Debt Commissioners (paragraph33).35. We are grateful to our secretary Mr. R. B. Moberly, of the machineryof government branch of the Treasury, and to Mr. J. S. Hogg, who was placed at our disposal by the Crown Lands Office during the earlier part of theenquiry. An enquiry without formal evidence throws a considerable extraburden on the secretary.

o IfHistorical background .1. There appear to have been substantial Crown lands as early as the ninthcentury. Domesday Book records 1,422 manors or lordships as being appropriatedto the Crown besides lands and farms in Middlesex, Shropshire and Rutland.These estates, which had belonged to King Edward the Confessor, came to beregarded as the &quot; ancient demesnes&quot;, as opposed to lands acquired later byescheat or forfeiture. It was considered impious to alienate ancient demesnesalthough the Sovereign was not precluded from doing so. Lands alienated inone reign were sometimes resumed at a later date. Parliament, insistent that&quot; the King should live of his own &quot; and reluctant to supplement the hereditaryrevenues from taxation, called for resumptions in 1450, 1473 and 1485.2. Before the reign of King Henry VII, the revenues arising from Crown landswere paid into the exchequer direct, or were collected by the sheriffs of counties and by them accounted for to the exchequer. It became necessary in Tudortimes (probably because the work had increased owing to forfeiture of landduring the Wars of the Roses and was greatly increased by the seizure ofmonastery estates in the reign of King Henry VIII) to introduce a number of changes in the organisation for managing the estates and collecting the revenues(note at end of appendix). Eventually, Surveyors General were appointed, tobe replaced only in 1810 by the Commissioners of Woods Forests and LandRevenues (appendix D).3. Queen Elizabeth I and the Stuart Kings were obliged to sell and mortgageland in order to raise income without recourse to Parliament. Queen Elizabeth Iraised  876,332 during her reign by the sales of Crown estates and KingCharles I, on. one occasion, borrowed  320,000 from the city of london on the security of the estates. Under the Commonwealth, most of the remainingestates were sold. At the restoration the sales were made void and the totalrevenue was then about  218,000 per annum. Three years later, mainly because of grants made by the King, the net revenue was reduced to about  100,000.4. In 1697 the first Civil List Act was passed. The estate had suffered furtherdiminution from the rewards that King William III gave to those who hadaided the revolution and by the end of his reign the revenue was estimated at only  6,000. This with the other hereditary revenues (totalling  776,000 and including the hereditary excise and hereditary post office duties) was appropriatedwith the temporary excise and a new subsidy of tonnage and poundage, subjectto various charges, for the service of the King&apos;s household and family and forother necessary expenses and occasions,, for his lifetime. There was a similar actin 1702 which also restrained the Crown from alienating any part of its landedproperty. Similar acts were passed in 1714 and in 1727.5. It was not until 1760, on the accession of King George III, that the duties and hereditary revenues payable to the support of the Crown were carried to the&quot; aggregate fund\&quot; subject to the incumbrances then charged on them, and thatthere was granted to the Crown out of the aggregate fund a fixed civil listrevenue of  800,000 for the support of the household and for the expenses ofcivil government subject to several annuities.6. This was in effect a surrender by the Sovereign of the hereditary revenues,including the land revenues, for his lifetime. The amount of the Civil List hasvaried from time to time owing among other things to the readjustment ofburdens on it. Similarly the amount of the land revenues has varied as chargeshave been placed upon or removed from them. Broadly speaking however.Parliamentary control has led to detailed appropriation of expenditure. Govern-ment expenditure, including the cost of Crown land held for various public purposes, has come to be borne on the Votes of the appropriate departments.Section 113 of the Crown Lands Act 1829 provided, however, &quot;that the annual income of all the said possessions and land revenues of the Crown to which thisAct relates including . . . shall be applied in manner following: (that is to say)in the first place, in Payment of the Costs, Charges, and Expenses attending the
Management of the said Possessions and Land Revenues . . . and, subject to the applications aforesaid, the said annual Income from and after the Demise ofHis Present Majesty (whom God long preserve) shall be payable and paid tothe King&apos;s Majesty, his Heirs and Successors &quot;.7. By the Civil List Acts passed after the accession of King George IV,King William IV and Queen Victoria, the hereditary revenues, including the landrevenues, were surrendered for the reign of each Sovereign, the surrender beingretrospective to the beginning of the reign. Subsequent Civil List Acts havesurrendered the hereditary revenues, as defined by reference to earlier acts,&quot; during the present reign and a period of six months afterwards.&quot; Recent civil list Acts have received the Royal assent before the expiry of the six monthsperiod.8. What appears to have emerged from constitutional change and from thedevelopment of Parliamentary financial control is an implied trust under whichneither the Sovereign nor Parliament have full rights over the estate. Prior to1688, the whole of the expenses of the state were defrayed from the King&apos;revenue, which included the hereditary revenues of the Crown and therefore theland revenues. The hereditary revenues had once sufficed to meet all the private and public expenditure of the Sovereign in normal circumstances. The CrownEstate is the Sovereign^ public estate by right of the Crown and when Parliamentassumed responsibility for providing funds for the upkeep of the Royal householdas well as for the expenses of Government the surrender of the revenue for the lifetime of the Sovereign was regarded as a corollary. Maitland wrote, however:  (Constitutional History of England, p. 437.) &quot; It seems as if Parliament had considered that a King could not, even with Parliaments concurrence, deprivehis successors of their hereditary revenues, or that at all events it would not be fair to ask a King to do it.&quot; See also Halsbury Laws of England 3rd edition,Vol. 7, p. 452.NOTE ON EARLY CHANGES OF ORGANISATION(appendix B, paragraph 2)The machinery of the Exchequer appears to have become unable to cope with the increasing business relating to the King&apos;s lands. King Henry VII adopted theexpedient of getting various Crown Receivers and occupiers of Crown lands to account before two persons appointed by him, Sir Reginald Bray and Sir RobertSouthwell, in the Chamber. This was continued by King Henry VIII, but receiptsgiven in the Chamber were not acceptable in the Exchequer, and the matter wasregularized by the statute of 3 Hen. 8 c. 23 (1511-12), by which two persons, one being Sir Robert Southwell and the other Bartholomew Westby, one of the Baronsof the Exchequer, were authorised to survey and approve the lands mentionedin a Commission of 1511. They were by that statute called General Surveyors andApprovers of King&apos;s Lands. This statute was a temporary measure, followedby other temporary measures, 4 Hen. 8 c. 18 (1512-13), 6 Hen. 8 c. 24 (1515),7 Hen. 8 c. 7 (1515-16) and 14 and 15 Hen. 8 c. 15 (1523-24). Each of those Actsgave the General Surveyors authority over lands mentioned in a Schedule annexed to the Act. The institution of the General Surveyors was made perpetual in thesame year that the Court of Augmentations was set up (1536). The Court ofGeneral Surveyors and the Court of Augmentations did not between themcover all Crown lands. There were apparently some which remained with theExchequer. The authority given by the statute of 33 Hen. 8 c. 39 (1542) to theCourt of General Surveyors was only over lands mentioned in a Schedule to theAct. No Schedule has been found, so that it is not possible to speak with certainty of the extent of the Court&apos;s authority.In 1547 the two Courts were amalgamated as the Court of Augmentations andRevenues of the Crown, which had among its officials two General Surveyors,Particular Surveyors for individual Counties, and two Surveyors of Woods (forthe South and North sides of the Trent respectively). The Court was abolishedby Queen Mary in 1554 and its business annexed to the Exchequer, but Surveyors&apos;. probably continued to be appointed.Sir Thomas Fanshawe was appointed Surveyor General of the King&apos;s Landsby letters patent in 1625; and in 1715 the two Surveyors of Woods were replaced by a Surveyor General of Woods.
The Crown Estate today1. Financial position. Tables 1 and 2.2. General. Total (town and country): about 384,000 acres. The origin of individual estates outside London is shown in Table 3. A general power existsto sell estates. Occasionally land has been sold for some public purpose such as local authority housing. Capital from sales and from such sources as compensationfor royalties on undersea coal has usually been invested in rural or urban propertyas suitable opportunity occurs. During the present century a considerable numberof purchases have been made. Recent purchases have included the formerPortman estate at Taunton, Somerset (1944), a large part.of the Savernake estate,Wiltshire (1950) and the Dunster estate, Somerset (1950).3. London. The estate includes about 930 buildings let on building leases, and about 1,730 buildings let at rack rents or rents fined down from rack rents. Theyare mainly in Regent Street, New Oxford Street, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, trafalgar square, Whitehall, the Strand, regent&apos;s  Park, Kensington Square, KensingtonPalace Gardens, Millbank and Victoria Park. Regent Street is the most valuableholding in the Crown Estate, with annual rents of over  500,000. The regent&apos;s  Parkterraces and Carlton House Terrace, though of great architectural interest, are lessvaluable. The former are being retained pending a decision on the recommenda-tions of the Gorell Committee in 1946 (Cmd. 7094).4. England (outside London). Table 3. Total: nearly 200,000 acres. The estatesare predominately agricultural and are one of the largest holdings of agricultural land held by one owner in England. There are about 21,000 acres of woodland,of which about 10,000 acres are leased to the Forestry Commission (mainly on theCroxton estate near Thetford in Norfolk) and over 6,000 acres are on theWindsor estate.5. Scotland. Table 3. Total: about 106,000 acres. 26,000 acres are unenclosedwastes, moorland and grouse moors. 73,000 acres are included in the lettings ofagricultural holdings, of which about 38,500 acres are mainly rough hill pastureor moorland. About 4,500 acres of woodland are feued to the Forestry Corn-mission. The Crown Estate also derives income from feu duties, some of ancientorigin, from surplus teinds and from salmon fishings in many parts of the seacoast and rivers (with the exception of Orkney and Shetland).6. Wales and Monmouthshire. Table 3. Total: about 78,000 acres of which76,800 are mountainous country. The income comes mainly from foreshore andmineral lettings.7. Securities. Table 4.8. Foreshore.

The Commissioners1. 1786. An enquiry was authorised by statute into the &quot;State, Produce, Man-encouragement , Extent and Value &quot; of the Woods Forests and Land Revenues belongingto the Crown.2. 1793. The 17th Report resulting from the enquiry proposed that themanagement of the whole of the Crown&apos;s landed estates should be placed undera board to be established for the purpose.3. 1810. &quot; Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Woods, Forests and Land Revenues,not to exceed three in number,&quot; replaced the Surveyor-General of the land revenue of the Crown and the Surveyors or Surveyor-General of His Majesty&apos;sWoods, Forests, Parks, and Chases.4. 1829. The Crown Lands Act 1829 revised and consolidated the powers ofthe Commissioners and denned the woods forests and land revenues as:  &quot; all Honours, Hundreds, Castles, Lordships, Manors, Forests, Chases,Woods, Parks, Messuages, Lands, Tithes, Fisheries, Franchises, Services, rents and other Land Revenues, Possessions, Tenements and Hereditaments what so-ever (Advowsons of Churches and Vicarages only excepted) which do nowbelong to His Majesty or hereafter shall belong to His Majesty, His Heirs orSuccessors within the Ordering and Survey of the Court of Exchequer inEngland or Wales, in Ireland, in the Isle of Man and its Dependencies and the isle of Alderney, whether in Possession, Remainder or Reversion &quot;.The Aot forms the basis of many of the powers at present exercised by theCommissioners of Crown Lands. (See also para. 12 below.)5. 1832. The Commissioners took over the duties of the Surveyor-Generalof His Majesty&apos;s Works and Public Buildings. Three Commissioners of HisMajesty&apos;s Woods Forests Land Revenues Works and Buildings were appointed,one of whom sat in the House of Commons.6. 1833. The land revenues of Scotland (until then vested in the Barons of theExchequer) were placed under the management of the Commissioners by Treasurywarrant under an 1832 act.7. 1851. Works and Land Revenues were separated for reasons stated by thePrime Minister, Lord John Russell, as follows:  &quot; Experience has shown that the combination of these offices has led to theimposition of very large and undue charges on the land revenues of the Crownfor the purpose of public works, and that the first Commissioner being a personconnected with a political party is not so well fitted for the. management ofthe Crown Lands as a person would be who was totally unconnected with apolitical party ... By this proposed separation we get rid of what hasfrequently happened, namely that when large expenses have to be incurredfor certain public works the sums were raised by making them a charge onthe land revenue of the Crown ; whereas the expense should rather have been thrown on the general revenue of the country &quot;.A First Commissioner of Works was therefore appointed and most of the RoyalParks and certain other parts of the Crown Lands such as Hampton CourtGardens, Kensington Gardens etc. were placed under the management of theOffice of Works. This left two Commissioners of Woods, Forests and LandRevenues appointed by Royal Warrant and holding office during the Sovereign^pleasure.8. 1866. The management of the bulk of the foreshore of the United kingdom was transferred by statute from the Commissioners of Woods to the Board ofTrade. The consideration for this transfer was the sum of  496,000 which was paid by the release of a debt due from the Land Revenue to the consolidate fund, and by the transfer from the Land Revenue to the Consolidated Fund ofvarious small annuities.
9. 1906. The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries was made an additional Commissioner, without salary and without being rendered incapablecf sitting in Parliament, to assist the government in carrying out its policy forthe creation of smallholdings. The Treasury assigned the principal agriculturalestates to the President and divided the other estates between the other twoCommissioners, each Commissioner being responsible only for the estates placedin his charge.10. 1912. On retirement of Sir Edward Stafford Howard, one of the threeposts was left unfilled. The properties were reallocated by Treasury warrantbetween the President and the other remaining Commissioner, the formerretaining the principal agricultural estates.11. 1924-6. The majority of woods and forests, including the New Forestand the Forest of Dean, were transferred to the Forestry Commission (set up in1919) by orders under a 1923 Act. Payment was only to be made in the eventof the land revenues being taken into possession by the Sovereign. The remainingestates were placed under the joint management of the ex-officio commissioner and the Permanent Commissioner, who were styled Commissioners of crown lands.12. 1927. The Commissioners became a body corporate (Crown Lands Act 1927,s. 1) and were given revised powers of sale and leasing.13. 1933. The position of the ex-officio Commissioner was clarified by Treasurywarrant. A Crown Lands Advisory Committee were appointed by the PrimeMinister &quot; to advise the Commissioners of Crown Lands on questions remittedtc them by the Commissioners relating to the development of the Crown&apos;s urbanestates, with particular reference to aesthetic and similar considerations of publicinterest&quot;.The Committee were reappointed in 1937 but not in 1941.14. 1943. The Secretary of State for Scotland was made a Commissioner(Crown Lands Act 1943).15. 1949. The management of Crown foreshore was retransferred to theCommissioners by statute (having become vested in the Ministry of Transport).*5s
General Duties of the Commissioners1. The Crown Lands Acts do not prescribe for the Commissioners of crown lands any general aim, or contain any broad definition of their duties, in theway that statutes governing other bodies frequently do; as, for instance, the forestry Acts with regard to the Forestry Commission (a), the Tithe Acts withregard to the Tithe Redemption Commission (b), or the War Damage Acts withregard to the War Damage Commission (c). The Land Revenues of the Crownare merely placed under the management of the Commissioners of crown lands id). No standard of management is laid down, nor is any general guidancegiven to the Commissioners as to the interests to be considered in managing crown lands ; not even such limited guidance as is given to a tenant for life by theSettled Land Act 1925 (e), which imposes on him the duties and obligations of atrustee for the persons interested in the settled land.2. The Commissioners are not specifically required to take any active steps to preserve the value of the estate. There are, however, provisions in the crown lands Acts which prevent their disposing of Crown land in such a way as to diminish, to any large extent, the capital of the Land Revenues. Under their general power of sale if) they may only sell land at the best price which in theiropinion can reasonably be obtained; and, before they sell, they are required,except in certain unimportant cases ig), to have a survey and valuation made ofthe property to be sold (h). They are not actually prohibited from selling below theamount of the valuation ; but, as an additional safeguard, they are required toobtain the consent of the Treasury wherever the sale price exceeds  1,000 (i).3. Again, under the Commissioners&apos; general power of leasing, they must, subjectto certain unimportant exceptions if), only let land at the best rent, or the bestrent and premium, that in their opinion can reasonably be obtained (k). The sameprovisions with regard to obtaining a valuation apply as in the case of sales.Treasury authority is required by statute for all lettings (0, though a generalTreasury authority has been given, authorising any letting where the rent does notexceed a stated figure, so that the Commissioners need not seek consent in individual cases within that limit.4. The minor powers of disposition are less circumscribed, but Treasuryauthority is necessary, whether the Commissioners wish to exchange (0 or mort-gage Crown land (I) or make a voluntary grant of it for public or charitablepurposes (i):5. Since the Crown Lands&apos;Acts impose no obligations on the Commissioners totake any active steps to preserve the Land Revenues, it would be strange if theyimposed on them any obligation to augment them and, in fact, they do not. Theopportunity for augmentation arises as soon as the Commissioners have funds to invest. It might have been expected that the Commissioners would be requiredto invest those funds forthwith to the best advantage. But the Acts impose nosuch duties ; they merely confer powers. Funds arising from sales and exchanges of Crown land may, generally speaking, be invested in the purchase of other(a) Forestry Act, 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. 58), s. 3 (1); Forestry Act, 1951 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 6.c. 61), s. 1 (1).(b) Tithe Act, 1936 (26 Geo. 5 &amp; 1 Edw. 8. c. 32), s. 4 (2).(c) War Damage Act, 1943 (6 &amp; 7 Geo. 6. c. 21), s. 3 (1).(rf) Crown Lands Act, 1829 (10 Geo. 4. c. 50), s. 8.(e) Settled Land Act, 1925 (15 Geo. 5. c. 18), s. 107 (1).(/) Crown Lands Act, 1927 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 23), s. 3 (1).(g) Crown Lands Act, 1829, s. 62.(h) ib., s. 61.(0 Crown Lands Act, 1927, s. 21 (1).0&apos;) Crown Lands Act, 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Viet. c. 99), s. 6; ib., s. 2 and Crown Lands Act, 1927,s. 22 (2); ib., s. 10.(k) Crown Lands Act, 1927, s. 5 (1) (ii) &amp; (4).(/) 4 &amp; 5 Viet. c. 40, s. 1; Crown Lands Act, 1851 (14 &amp; 15 Viet. c. 42), s. 3.
land (m), or with the consent of the Treasury in trustee securities (n), but theCommissioners are not under any obligation to apply them in either of these ways.The Crown Lands Act 1829 seems to have assumed that the Commissioners would,in fact, invest in land as soon as possible, because it allows such funds, if not immediately wanted, to be invested in 2Jr per cent. Consols (o) ; but even to-day-there is no statutory requirement that funds awaiting investment in land shouldbe invested to advantage in any way.6. On the other hand, although the Crown Lands Acts do not impel the Com-missioners to seek the augmentation of the Land Revenues, they impose certainrequirements on them if they do take steps towards this end. As regards the typeof land they should invest in, they are given the widest discretion. Their powersof purchasing freehold land are, indeed, limited to purchasing such land as, intheir judgment, is desirable to be purchased on behalf of the Crown (p), but theyare sole judges of what is desirable ; while even this slender restriction is not expressly placed on their power to take (q) or purchase (/-) leases, or on their power to acquire land by exchange (s). Before making any purchase or exchange,however, they are, as in the case of sales, required, except in certain unimportantcases (g), to have a survey and valuation made of the land to be purchased, or the lands to be given and taken in exchange (h). Again, they are not prohibited frompurchasing or exchanging at prices at variance with the valuation, but they arerequired to obtain the consent of the Treasury to every exchange and everypurchase where the purchase price exceeds  1,000 (/&apos;).(m) Crown Lands Act, 1829, ss. 107, 108.(n) Crown Lands Act, 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Viet. c. 43), s. 1.
