(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCaP.(55) 12 COPY NO..26th April, 1955CABINETAUSTRIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsIntroductionAs a result of prolonged negotiations from 1947-50 between UnitedKingdom, United States, French and Soviet representatives, the main linesof an Austrian State Treaty were agreed (the text of the Draft Treaty was included as the Appendix to Command 9041 presented in January, 1954)0Only five Articles of relatively small importance remained disagreed.At this point, the Soviet Government evidently decided that they did not wish to conclude the Treaty and, during the following four years, they putforward various extraneous and irrelevant pretexts for obstructing anyfurther negotiations.2.     At the Berlin Conference in 1954, the three Western foreign ministers informed the Soviet Foreign Minister that they would acceptthe Soviet texts of the five disagreed Articles if Mr. Molotov wouldconclude and sign the Treaty.    Mr. Molotov, however, put forward new conditions, refusing in particular to fix a firm date for the evacuation offoreign forces from Austria.3.      This was the position when in March of this year the Soviet Govern-ment initiated talks with the Austrian Ambassador in Moscow.    Theseled to a visit to Moscow in April by an Austrian delegation including theAustrian Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister.4.      The Austrian Ministers returned from Moscow convinced that theSoviet Government were at last ready to conclude the Austrian StateTreaty.Soviet Motives5.      I think the Austrian estimate is probably correct.    Soviet motivesare no doubt mixed.    They may have been embarrassed by the bad inter-national posture in which they found themselves on the Austrian question;they may wish to demonstrate their willingness to settle this outstandingquestion as a preliminary to wider Great Power negotiations; they may feel that, by the further condition regarding neutrality which they haveimposed on the Austrian Ministers, they will have been successful in preventing the absorption of Austria into the Western defence systemsBut I have little doubt that their main purpose is to unsettle opinion in western Germany by holding out the prospect of the re-unification ofGermany on condition of neutralisation.-1-
4 Soviet proposals. The Austro-Soviet Memorandum of Understanding signed in Moscowduring the visit of the Austrian delegation contains, inter alia, the following provisions s-Austrian Engagements(a) In the sense of the declaration already given by the austrians at the Conference of Berlin in 1954 thatAustria would not join any military alliances norpermit military bases on her territory, the AustrianFederal Government will make a declaration in a form which will bind Austria internationally toexercise permanent neutrality of the type practisedby Switzerland,(b) The Austrian Federal Government will take all appropriate steps to obtain international recognitionof the declaration, which must first be approved bythe Austrian Parliament.(c) The Austrian Federal Government will welcome aguarantee by the Four Powers of the integrity andinviolability of Austrian territory.    They will use their best endeavours with the Goivernments ofFrance, Great Britain and the United States toobtain such a guarantee,Soviet Engagements(i)     The Soviet Government are ready to sign the AustrianState Treaty without delay.(ii)     The Soviet Government agree that all occupation troops of the Four Powers should be withdrawn from Austriaafter the entry into force of the State Treaty and not later than 31st December, 1955e(iii)     The Soviet Government are ready to recognise the neutrality of Austria.(iv)    The Soviet Government are ready to take part in aguarantee by the Four Powers of the integrity andinviolability of the territory of the Austrian Stateafter the pattern of Switzerland.(v)    The Soviet Government agree to a number ofimportant economic concessions, including inparticular the transfer to the Austrians, in returnfor compensation, of the oil undertakings in EasternAustria and of the assets of the Danubian Shipping Co.Procedure?0      On 19th April the Soviet Government proposed that the fourForeign Ministers should meet in the near future in Vienna &quot;to discussthe question of concluding a State Treaty&quot;.    In reply, we have agreed
mto a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers to sign the Treaty, but have proposed that the necessary preparatory work should be put in hand on 2nd May by the Ambassadors in Vienna of the four responsible Powers,with Austrian participation.Decisions Required8.      The two points on which I wish to consult my colleagues aret-(a) Should we recognise an Austrian declaration of neutrality &quot;of the type practised by Switzerland&quot;?(b) Should we participate in a Four-Power guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity and inviolability?Neutrality.9.     At the Berlin Conference, the Austrian Government signified their acceptance of a Soviet condition that Austria would not join any military alliance or permit military bases on her territory.    This assurance wasformally repeated in Moscow.    There is no doubt that the Austrian people are prepared to pay this price for a Treaty, and the Western Powers have little alternative but to acquiesce.    The Chiefs of Staff Committee havestated that:-&quot;from the military and strategic point of view, a neutralAustria, debarred from joining N.A,T.O, or from givingtransit to N.A.T.O. forces, was acceptable only providedthat its neutrality was made really effective and wasadequately guaranteed. &quot;10.    It is not yet clear how far beyond military neutrality the Russianswill wish to push the Austrians and the Austrians will be prepared to go.The Austrian Ministers claim that the Soviet Government does not wish to exclude Austria from the United Nations, and at present they appeardetermined to retain freedom to join economic organisations such as theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation and the European coal and Steel Community, though less interested in the Council of Europe, an attitude which I personally deplore and would like to remedy.    The firsttask of the Western representatives when they start negotiating with theSoviet representative will be to establish exactly what the Soviet Govern-ment understand by the &quot;exercise of permanent neutrality of the typepractised by Switzerland&quot;,    It must obviously be our aim to retain forAustria the maximum possible freedom to determine her own policy inthe political and economic fields.    Provided this purpose can, within reasonable limits, be achieved, I do not see any serious objection torecognising Austrian neutrality.    It is, however, as much in our interest at in that of the Austrians and Russians to link our recognition of Austrianneutrality with an effective international guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity.Guarantee of Austrian Territorial Integrity11.    According to Article 17 of the Draft State Treaty, Austrian armed forces are strictly limited, to an extent indeed which leaves Austriadefenceless against any external aggression.    In this respect there isno analogy with the liberty of Sweden and Switzerland to maintain powerful
dpforces to protect their neutrality.    Even if the Soviet Government agreedto delete the Article restricting the level of Austrian armaments, Austriawould be unable, and probably unwilling, to afford an army and an airforce of any size.    The Austrians do not at present realise how isolated and defenceless they will be when the Western occupation forces are withdrawn.    When they do, an international guarantee of Austrianterritorial integrity may do something to bolster up,their morale.12.    There is the further point that, should the Western Powers fail toparticipate in any guarantee, there would be nothing, with the entry intoforce of the Austrian Treaty, to prevent separate Austro/Russian bi-lateral arrangements about a guarantee which would give the Russiansalone the right of intervention.    One way of limiting the danger of unilateral Soviet intervention would be by participation of the western powers in a Four-Power guarantee providing for joint Four-Power action,such action to be preceded by Four**Power consultation.    But since we ourselves might want to intervene, against the wishes of the SovietGovernment, in the event for example of an attack on Austria by a neighbouring satellite country, the exact formulation of any internationalguarantee will need very careful consideration.    My view, however,  isthat, if we are not to leave the field entirely clear for the Russians, itwill be difficult to avoid entering into some kind of commitment, providingof course that the United States and French Governments are ready todo the same.13.    It is not yet possible, so many are the potential variations, to define precisely the guarantee or the commitment which I shall ask mycolleagues to consider.    It could vary from a collective guarantee, onlyoperative if all the guarantors agreed that it should come into effect, toa series of individual guarantees which could be either binding orpermissive on the guarantor.    At this stage it is only necessary to give some guidance to the Ambassador who is conducting the preliminaryenquiries with the Austrian Government, and who may have to enter into negotiations with the Russians on 2nd May.    Before the government accept a definite guarantee, it would be necessary to inform at least theold Commonwealth countries and probably N.A.T.O,    It may be wise to keep them apprised of the situation from the beginning.Re c ommendation14.    Accordingly I recommend that, subject to further clarification of the issues involved in the proposed conference in Vienna, we shouldbe prepared in principle  -(a) to recognise an Austrian declaration of neutrality of the type practised by Switzerland;(b) to participate in a Four-Power guarantee of austrian territorial integrity and inviolability.H.M,Foreign Office, S. W. 1.26th April, 1955.
