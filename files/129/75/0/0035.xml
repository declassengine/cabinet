Gg(55) 3511th June, 1955CABINETPALESTINE settlement memorandum by the  Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in C, (55) 96 dated 6th April9 Sir Anthony Eden summarised an agreed Anglo-American plan for the settlement of the dispute between theArab States arid Israel,,    He explained that talks on the matter had takenplace between the United States Ambassador in Cairo and fee egyptian foreing Minister.    X. now continue the story.2,        Immediately before he left for Bandoeng, the Egyptian PrimeMinister sent a message through his Foreign Minister to our ambassador in Cairo, to say that in spite of many misgivings he was ready to do his best.    He suggested that the period of his stay in Bandoeng should be used by the two Governments to work out concrete proposals.    Both he andhis Foreign Minister made it clear that their main interest in a setile-ment lay in the restoration of a land link between Egypt and the arab states to the East.    They would, therefore, consider making peace withIsrael only if she abandoned the major part of the Negeb,    A corridoracross an Israeli Negeb would not be enough.3.       The proposals summarised in paragraph 7 of C. (55) 96 providedfor the establishment of a sovereign Arab right of way across the Negebwithout impairing the Israeli sovereign right of way to Elath on the red sea.    The idea was that Israel should cede two small triangles, one to egypt with its base on the Egypt-Israel frontier and one to Jordan with itsbase on the Jordan-Israel frontier, in the extreme south of the Negebga few miles north of Elath.    The points of the two triangles would meeton the Israeli road from Beersheba to E laths and at this junction, whichmight need mixed or international supervision, a road from Egypt toJordan under complete Arab control could pass over (or under) &quot;the road to Elath, which would remain under complete Israeli control.4.       This combination of diplomacy and engineering would be a noveIsbut perhaps decisive, feature in the settlement proposed..    However, bothAmbassadors took the view that the arrangement, though ingenious,would not do so far as Colonel Nasser was concerned.    They proposed a number of alternative solutions ranging from joint Arab-Israeladministration of the entire Negeb to the creation of an autonomous Arabterritory under Western guarantees.    As this is a vital part in the wholeplan, further discussions were arranged between the Foreign Office andthe State Department to reconsider the proposals for the Negeb.ilThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No
50       It was agreed that the Israelis would never surrender the wholeNegeb or the greater part&apos; of it as the Egyptians desired,,    They aredeeply attached to this territory, which has for them a religious signifi-easacsjj ensures their access to the Red Sea and allows them to tastethe freedom of an area in which they can be out of sight of an hostilefrontier.    On the other hand, there is little doubt that the Egyptianswill not accept a settlement which leaves the whole of the Negeb inIsraeli hands0    There can be no solution except by the- principle under-lying the proposal described in paragraph 3 above - that is the principleof a point at the junction of two triangles where the sovez*eignty appertainsto both or neither.    Solomon could do no better,60       So the two Ambassadors must now try to get Colonel Nnsgex^s agreement to the principle of the double triangle as meeting his desire for a land connection with JordanQ    If Nasser shows interest in theprinciple and asks for an example of its applications, the Ambassadorswould then explain the proposal, described in paragraph 3 above, of a double triangle in the extreme south of the Negeb, coupled with transitrights across the northern Negeb between Egypt and Jordan.    If they find that this solution is unacceptable to Nasser on account of the small-ness of the territory ceded, it may be necessary to suggest that the doubletriangle principle might be applied to link both Egypt and the Gaza Stripto Jordan,,    This could be done by using the 1947 partition line sanih*&quot;C- t.s$of Gaza and building upon it a triangle pointing eastwards to link up at the israeli road from Beersheba to Elath with the apex of a second trianglewhose base would be on the Israel-Jordan frontier opposite Shobek.This would involve a fairly large cession of territory by Israel in theNegeb and might, therefore, tempt Nasser, since he would be better ableto defend a settlement of this kind to the other Arab States.    It also hasthe merit, in Arab eyes, of being based on the partition of the Negebrecommended in the United Nations Resolution of 1947; and it would ease the pressure of the refugees in the Gaza Strip by giving them anopportunity to disperse eastwards.    3ut it would leave Israel in controlof all the cultivable land and all known mineral deposits in the NorthernNegeb, a.s well as a sovereign right of way to Elath.7.       It would, however, be very difficult to induce the Israelis toaccept this alternative proposal; and only if it seemed that Nasser*sco-operation could be secured on this basis and on no other should weconsider putting the proposal to him.    If we did so, we should reducethe territorial concessions expected of Israel in other areas.    It shouldbe added that the Government of Israel have taken the position, in a formal communication to the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments, that they are not willing to surrender any territory at all, though they do not rule out &quot;minor and mutual&quot; adjustments of frontiers as partof a general settlement,    This uncompromising attitude will, no doubtapersist during the pre-election period in Israel, and the timing of our approach will have to be carefully judged.    In view of the dangeroustension on the Gaza front and of the fact that the Israel Government maytry to fore stall our action, decisions may have to be taken at short notice 080       Any settlement of the Palestine &quot;affair must provide for the pay-ment of compensation by Israel to the Arab refugees,,    The negotiation,financing and distribution of this compensation raise many difficultieswhich have been the subject of detailed discussion between the ForeignOffice, the Treasury and the State Department:,    It is the intention that 100 millions should be the maximum amount that Israel will be calledupon to pay; and that Her Majesty!s Governments contribution to this -by way of loan - should not be more than  15 millions, on the understanding
that the United States Government will provide about  50 millions andthe Israel Government about  30 millions from their own resources andthe contributions of the international Jewish community.    The advice ofthe Treasury and their representative in the Middle East is being soughton methods of distribution of the compensation which will satisfy the claimants without causing serious inflation in the Arab countries, and every effort will be made to devise satisfactory solutions to this andother problems before any firm financial commitments are made.    Inthe meantime I have instructed our Ambassador in Cairo to avoid in histalks with Colonel Nasser all discussion of the financing of Israel&apos;compensation payments; and I have suggested to Mr0 Dulles that similarinstructions should be sent to the United States Ambassador in Cairo09,       When we open discussions with the Israelis, and perhaps before,if Nasser insists on knowing  how Israel could find the compensations weshall have to be ready to say what contribution Her Majesty*s Governmentwould be prepared to make towards the cost of a settlement.    There areof course several financial uncertainties which could only be cleared upfinally in the coarse of negotiations with Israel and the Arab States;for example, it is likely that the parties to the dispute will seek to makethe United States Government and ourselves pay for their co-operation in the terms of increased financial assistance.    We at any rate shallresist any pressure of this kind; and as far as can be seen at present,our financial liabilities in connection with the proposed settlement couldbe limited to the following contributions to the  100 millionscompensation which Israel will have to pay to the Arab refugees*-(a) a loan to Israel, probably on unattractive terms,but spread over ten years, of the order of ic.15 millions;(b) permission for the Israelis to raise about  15 millions over ten years by the sale of Israel Government bondsin the United Kingdom,10,      I ask the authority of my colleagues 3--to co-operate with the United States Government inan attempt, through discussions with Colonel Nasserand subsequently with the other parties to the dispute,to bring about a settlement of the Palestine affairon the lines described in Sir Anthony Eden&apos;smemorandum and in the preceding paragraphs;(b) to undertake, as part of such a settlement, thefinancial commitments set out in paragraph 9 above.H.M.(a)\Foreign Office, S.W&apos;,1,10th June, 1955,
