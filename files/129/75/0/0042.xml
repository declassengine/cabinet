SECRET Copy No. 6 iCP. (55) 4216th June, 1955CABINETORGANISATION FOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO-operation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer took the Chair at what proved to be a successful meeting of the ministerial council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) inParis on 9th and 10th June. I was accompanied by the Economic Secretary to theTreasury who spoke on behalf of the United Kingdom.2. Our objective at the meeting was, in general terms, to keep up the momentum in Europe towards a freer system of trade and payments and to carry a further stage forward the European preparations for a collective approach toconvertibility when the right time comes.  More specifically, we wanted (i) the continuation of the European Payments Union for a further year after30th June, 1955 (subject to an increase from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent,of the proportion in which settlements have to be made in gold);(ii) a break-clause which would enable the United Kingdom, together withother like-minded countries, to move into a wider system and make ourcurrencies convertible if conditions should prove favourable, withoutany breach of our O.E.E.C. obligations;(iii) the establishment of conditions which would enable the eventual transition from the present European Payments Union to be carried out withoutany set-back in European trade liberalisation.3. These objectives have broadly been achieved.&apos; Further work of a technicalnature remains to be done, and final decisions will not be taken before the end ofJuly, since no member country wished to commit itself finally until it could see the picture as a whole. But full agreement was reached in principle.4. The main problem which arose was how to maintain European monetaryco-operation after the move to convertibility as we all agreed was desirable andwhether, as most of the other Europeans thought, this demanded the continuation of some organised system for offsetting and clearing balances between O.E.E.C.countries, rather on the lines of the present European Payments Union. We hadbeen unable, in earlier discussion, to see how the sort of system which was thenbeing proposed could be worked without on the one hand impeding the efficientoperation of the exchange markets and, on the other hand, tying our hands inregard to our exchange rate policy for sterling.5. Fortunately, however, at the Council meeting certain ideas emerged for for a more flexible system which would meet the European desire for someinstitutional framework of monetary co-operation and which we and the Bank ofEngland felt reasonably satisfied would involve no detriment to sterling and noundue restriction on our freedom to decide our own exchange rate policy. Theseideas are now being worked out in detail and a report is to be made by 15th July.6. There was much less difficulty about the other conditions to be establishedafter a move to convertibility.  These comprise the European Fund which will48201Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1955

Detailedreports on these two subjects are also to be made by 15th July.7. When all these reports are ready, and unless any unexpected difficultysupervenes, the decisions which we took in principle for continuing the european payments Union with a suitable break-clause will be formally confirmed beforethe end of July.8. All this represents a substantial achievement in European co-operationtowards the objectives of the collective approach. It marks the culmination ofthe studies which have been going on in O.E.E.C. for more than a year. A greatdeal of hard work has been done, and the results now emerging give us solidground for confidence that on the European front the transition to the widersystem can be managed, when the time comes, without political disturbance andwithout any dislocation of trade.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th June, 1955.
