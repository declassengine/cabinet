Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1955SECRET Copy No.    63CP. (55) 312th April, 1955CABINETNEWSPAPER dispute memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service expect to receive the report of the Court of Inquiry this evening. In that event the report will be published to-morrow afternoon.2. On the evidence presented at the hearings, the Court is unlikely to give and the parties did not ask for any clear-cut recommendation in figures on theUnions&apos; claim for an increase in the offer made by the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association (N.P.A.) on the basis of its previous offers to the printing trade Unions.On the other hand, the Court may well consider that the existing negotiating machinery under which the Amalgamated Engineering Union (A.E.U.) and the electrical Trades Union (E.T.U.) have had to accept on a &quot; take-it-or-leave-it&quot;basis the increases offered to the other Unions is inadequate, and that concurrently with the resumption of work, negotiations (in which the N.P.A. and all the unions concerned, i.e., both the E.T.U. and A.E.U. and the printing trade Unions wouldbe involved) should be embarked on with a view to the establishment of freshnegotiating machinery.3. Such a course would probably be acceptable to the N.P.A. It remains tobe seen whether the two Unions would consider it a sufficient ground for a resumption of work. At the hearings, they placed more emphasis on the deficiency of the existing negotiating machinery and less on their present claim for a further increase for maintenance engineers and electricians. They may wellinsist, however, that, quite apart from the establishment of new machinery, thereshould be further negotiations with the N.P.A. on their present claim (with the implication of an improvement in the N.P.A.&apos;s existing offer) and not merelyarbitration (which is the only further step which the N.P.A. are willing to consider).If the Unions stick over this point, the prospects of an immediate resumption ofwork are remote. And even if the A.E.U. and E.T.U. are prepared to agree to a resumption of work while negotiations for a revision of the negotiating machinerygo ahead, the Unions belonging to the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation,who have hitherto opposed the inclusion of the E.T.U. and A.E.U. in the negotiating machinery, would still have to be persuaded to take part in thenegotiations.4. The notices given by members of the N.P.A. to their other employees are due to expire on Friday of this week. I am arranging for the N.P.A., and the twoUnions, to be summoned for discussions immediately after the publication of thereport in the hope of securing an immediate resumption of work, while negotiationsproceed on the basis of any recommendations which the Court may make. I shall also arrange to keep in contact with the Trades Union Congress who have taken a close interest in this dispute, and with the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation.W..M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,12th April, 1955.47943
