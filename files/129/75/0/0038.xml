secret.P.(55) 33 COPY NO.   U H14th June, 1955CABINETGATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation should be grateful for the guidance of the Cabinet on a point whichhas arisen in connection with the construction of Gatwick Airport.2.       Acquisition of land for the construction of this airport is proceedingsmoothly and the point has now been reached at which the procedure to befollowed in connection with construction of the airport requires to be settled03.        As the civil aviation side of my Department has no works depart-ment, I have so far relied on the Air Ministry Works Department for thepreliminary engineering work.4.        As the time for the putting out of the contracts to tender hasapproached, I have discussed with the Treasury the most appropriate way in which the detail for contract tender, estimates for cost, and supervision of the contract should be carried out.    This can either be done by the AirMinistry Works Department or by a consulting engineer.    In view of thefact that consideration was being given to this matter, the Air MinistryWorks Department stopped their preliminary work seven weeks ago.    Asthe Secretary of State for Air has felt unable to instruct them to resumework pending a decision on this issue, it is urgent that a decision should betaken in order that further time may not be lost with an inevitable delay inthe completion of the airport.5.        There are three possible ways in which the matter can be handled:-(a) That I shotild rely for the work referred to in paragraph 4on the Air Ministry Works Department only,(b) That I should rely for this purpose on outside consultantsonly.(c) Foot this work to be done both by the Air Ministry WorksDepartment and by one or more consultants, and adecision taken as to which should be used for this and subsequent work in the light of the relative cost andsuitability of the detailed proposals submitted by the AirMinistry Works Department and by the consultants,6.        My own preference is for course (c).    It is no reflection on theAir Ministry Works Department to say that it would be useful to be ableto compare cost and standards proposed by them with those proposed bycompetent outside civil engineering firms.
7.        I am particularly anxious to follow this course in this case since,as my colleagues will recall, the decision to construct Gatwick Airportwas a somewhat controversial one and it is therefore particularly necessarynot only that every step should be taken to avoid extravagance, either in standards or in cost, but also that it should be clear to Parliament andthe public that every such step has been taken.    From this point of view,separate proposals by a Government Department and by well-known private firms would constitute a check by each upon the other.8.        The Air Ministry Works Department has very great experience in the construction of airfields.    But it has no monopoly of such knowledge,even in the rather specialised field of construction of runways.    Inter-national airports are at present being constructed at Hongkong and in Kenyaunder the supervision of civil engineering consultants appointed by theColonial Governments.    And thez*e is also the consideration that design ofcivil airports, particularly, though not solely,with respect to the buildings at such airports, is tending to diverge somewhat from the design ofmilitary airfields where the principal experience of Air Ministry WorksDepartment of course lies.9,        The course which I am suggesting was in fact followed in 1952 inconnection with the construction of a new terminal building at BlackbusheAirport,    In the event, the services of a consultant were employed, mainly because his estimate ( 24,000) was substantially below that of the AirMinistry Works Department ( 35,000),    In this case the cost worked out as estimated,10,      Admittedly this work is on a very much smaller scale than thatinvolved in the construction of Gatwick Airport,    But it involves the same principle and seems to me to be an illustration of the value of the course which I suggest.    It is also an indication that this course does not constitute a revolutionary departure from all previous practice,11.       The. Financial Secretary to the Treasury, with whom theSecretary of State for Air and I have had some discussion on this matter, isflI understand, inclined to think that my proposal might raise large issuesaffecting the role of Government works departments.    Many interestingissues indeed arise in this connection.    But I hope that it may not bethought necessary to settle these in advance of a decision on Gatwick which,particularly for the reasons given in paragraph 4 above, is now veryurgent.    I \inderstand from the Secretary of State for Air that the AirMinistry Works Department is very fully engaged with other work.    Andthe very special political and presentational problems which arise inconnection with Gatwick should, in my view, enable this matter to besettled without going into more general problems.    Apart altogether fromthis, I should have thought it would be of value both to tap the ideas and enterprise of specialist consulting engineers in this field and to introducean element of competition in this particular case,12,      I hope therefore that the Cabinet will see fit to authorise me toproceed as suggested in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 5,    I should not,in any event, feel able to accept the responsibility of proceeding with the aid of only one source of professsional advice at this stage, without the express instruction of the Cabinet.J.A.B. -C.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.11th June, 1955.
