Printed for the Cabinet. June 1955SECRET Copy No.     g ^CP. (55) 4522 nd June, 1955CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerLast March the Cabinet discussed on several occasions the proposal of theNational Coal Board to make a substantial and immediate increase in the price ofcoal (C.C. (55) 19th, 21st and 22nd Conclusions). The general conclusion was thatsuch an increase could not long be delayed.2. I have kept in close touch with the Board about this matter during thelast three months and we have so far succeeded in avoiding the necessity of eitheraccepting or refusing a formal request from them for a price increase.3. We can now no longer delay a decision. I have therefore recently brought before the Economic Policy Committee a proposal from the Board to increase thepit-head price of coal by 20 per cent. (12s. Sd. a ton on average) from the middleof next July. The details are given in Annexes I and II.4. The Committee asked me to give further consideration to certain pointsbut were disposed to agree that we should allow the Board to make a large and early increase in the price of coal. We could hardly compel the Board to go on increasing their deficit or to postpone indefinitely the discharge of their statutoryduty to make ends meet taking one year with another. Moreover, a large increasein the price of coal.would incidentally lend powerful support to the Government&apos;sfuel policy at two points: it would encourage the substitution of oil for coal and itwould also encourage the more efficient use of coal.5. The outstanding question is how much the price increase should be.The Committee asked me to consider the effects of an increase of, say, 18 per cent.(115. 6d. a ton on average) compared with the 20 per cent, proposed by theBoard. From the figures set out in Annex III it will be seen that on this basis the Board&apos;s deficit for 1955 would be  15 millions, bringing the accumulated deficitup to  32 millions by the end of the year. In 1956, when the price increase wouldbe effective over the whole year, a surplus of  10 millions is estimated, which would reduce the accumulated deficit to  22 millions by the end of the year.6. In considering these alternatives we should bear in mind the probability that the Board may not be able to avoid incurring expenditure substantially inexcess of that estimated at present. This would increase both estimates of the1955 deficit and reduce both estimates of the 1956 surplus. Thus, the present estimates make no provision for any further house-building by the Board. Theirpresent housing programme has meant a loss of  1 million a year to the Board anda new programme might double this loss. Again, we may have to consideramending the law regarding the effects of mining subsidence in a way that would increase the Board&apos;s liabilities. Further, legislation in place of the defence regulations which at present enable opencast mining to continue may well increasethe expenses of the Board. But there are two considerations which may affectthe Board&apos;s finances much more seriously. First, the present estimates make no provision for any increase in the wages of the 400,000 day-wage men for whom a new wage structure was introduced last March; and, secondly, the estimates48241
assume no rise in the existing costs of materials, equipment and services. Severalmillions of increased expenditure under these two heads may prove inevitable ifthere is a general rise in costs and wages.7. Even a 20 per cent, price increase would not now reduce the Board&apos;sdeficit for 1955 below  9 millions or prevent the accumulated deficit from reaching 26 millions by the end of this year; I hope therefore that the Cabinet will agree that we should not now insist on the Board&apos;s reducing their proposal to18 per cent, but that they should be allowed to introduce the full 20 per cent,increase as soon as possible, thus bringing their financial affairs into balance and effectively reducing their accumulated deficit by the end of 1956 without the needfor any further price increase.G.
