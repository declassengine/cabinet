C.P.(55) 306th June. 1955CABINETKENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies in the light of discussion of my proposals for the withdrawalof the current surrender offer and the imposition of heavier sanctions on those terrorists who fail to take advantage of the offer before it expires(CP.(55) 22 and C.M.(55) 11th Conclusions, Item 5), I have again consulted the Governor of Kenya.2. It is the opinion of the War Council in Kenya that the earliestpossible announcement should be made that the offer will terminate atmidnight on 10th July.    This date is strongly advocated for operational reasons by the G.O.C.   During the remaining period every inducementwill be employed, including intensified propaganda and military pressure,to bring about the greatest number of surrenders.    There are some few thousand active terrorists in the gangs still at large in the forests.Exact numbers are not known.    There is a strong feeling among the loyalKikuyu, of whom over 23,000 have served in the Home Guard - apart fromthe many supporters not on active service - that a serious shock should be administered to the remaining terrorists to strengthen the impact of the surrender offer.    Their disappointment if measures of this characterare not taken will be more serious for the future of our affairs in Kenyathan any increased resentment in the minds of those terrorists who fail to escape the impact of such measures by surrendering before 10th July.3. I am convinced that it is necessary to administer some sort of shock to the remaining terrorists to induce them to surrender.    I amalso satisfied that this shock must be connected with land.    I consider thatwe should at the least agree to an extension of the provisions for theforfeiture of existing land rights to such terrorists as the Governor mayname among those who have failed to surrender by 10th July.    In theopinion of the Governor and his closest advisers this would not go far enough to meet the needs of the situation; and he considers that it shouldbe supplemented by additional legislation to permit the disqualification ofnamed terrorists from the capacity to hold or acquire land in the future.Such a measure would savour somewhat of outlawry (though not nearly somuch as the original proposals of the Kenya Government which I did not commend to my colleagues):  it would apply to an indefinite future theconditions of which we cannot predict and it would be difficult to defendsatisfactorily before opinion outside Kenya.    But, before we reach a finaldecision on this matter, I feel that my colleagues should be aware of thearguments put forward by the Governor of Kenya in his telegram No. 629*of which a copy is attached,The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.
(a) that fee Governor of Kenya should be authorisedto announce immediately that the currentsurrender offer will terminate on 10th July;(b) that the announcement should at least state theintention of the Government of Kenya to extend the provisions for the forfeiture of existingland rights to all such terrorists as theGovernor may name who remain obdurate after that date.A.
