(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret,F.(55) 21 COPY NO.  (?131st May, 1955CABINETTROOPING THE COLOUR AND OPENINGOF PARLIAMENT;  TRAFFIC CONDITIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for &quot;Welsh affairs a rehearsal of the Trooping the Colour ceremony is due totake place on Monday, 6th June and the ceremony itself on Thursday,9th June.2. Both the rehearsal and the ceremony necessitate (i) the large-scale diversion of traffic and (ii) the prohibition of parking over a con-siderable area.    It is estimated that they would put out of use parkingaccommodation for at least 2,000 vehicles (representing about eight miles of parked vehicles).3. I expect that the railway strike, with the severe curtailment of the suburban services, will lead to a heavy increase in the private motortraffic coming into central London, which in normal times is nearsaturation point.There can be no doubt that widespread dislocation of traffic,involving much inconvenience to many.people, would result from the holding of the rehearsal and the ceremony itself.4. I understand that it would not be possible to hold the ceremonywithout the rehearsal.    I think that we must consider whether, in thecircumstances, the ceremony should be cancelled, regrettable though sucha step would be.5. Serious traffic problems would also be caused by the ceremonialState Opening of Parliament, which involves more widespread diversionsand the closing of more streets than the ceremony of Trooping the Colour.It is thought that parking accommodation for as many as 4,000 cars wouldbe lost.    Apart from the question whether a ceremonial drive is appropriateduring a national emergency, there can be no doubt that traffic conditions would be very bad and that there would be much congestion and inconvenience^It is, I suggest, for consideration whether the normal arranagements shouldbe abandoned and Her Majesty advised to drive to the Palace of Westminster,,without formality, in a closed car.G. LL. -G.Home Office, S.V/.1.31st May, 1955
