secret.P,(55) 2 COPY NO.12th April, 1955CABINETCOTTON INDUSTRY; POSSIBLE METHODSOF PROTECTIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have been asked to circulate a paper on the assumption that mycolleagues decide in favour of tariff protection against Indian grey cotton cloth, and to take no action against imports from Hong Kong.    Such a tariff would be preceded by a temporary quota to prevent forestalling.There would be no restriction on imported yarn, or upon grey clothimported for processing and re-export.2.        The holding quota on cloth would have as its object to keep therate of imports from India for the home market during the remainder of1955 to the same rate as imports for the home market in 1954,i. e. 65 million square yards a year.    Goods in transit and goods coveredby irrevocable credits would be counted against the quota.    Licences forthe rest of the trade would be distributed among traders on the basis oftheir past imports but these licences would not in all cases be sufficientto cover the goods they have ordered.    Some contracts would thereforeinevitably be broken.3.        The long-term regulation of the trade -would have to be bytariff.    This would require first an attempt to negotiate the right toimpose a tariff on Indian textiles or, alternatively, if we v/ere to failit would involve giving the six months&apos; notice of termination required bythe Agreement.    Secondly, and in any event, it would require the enact-ment of domestic legislation enabling us to put tariffs on Indian goods.It would be for consideration whether this enabling legislation should beexpressly limited to Indian cloth or extended to all goods from India, or so expressed as to cover goods in general from the whole Commonwealth,This legislation, whether in the Finance Bill or by a separate Bill arnend-ing the Import Duties and Ottawa Agreements Acts, would have to be passed into law before the end of 1955,4.        There can be no question of not proceeding to the tariff at theearliest opportunity.    To do otherwise would be an open breach of our international obligations;  and it would be inconsistent with our policyrecently re-affirmed in Paris and Geneva; and it would expose our exports generally to grave damage by similar protective quotas,5,       We must expect to be subjected to, and decide now to resist,the heavy pressures which are already building up from other industries to protect them also from cheap Commonwealth imports - such as leatherand carpets from India, cutlery and sports goods from Pakistan, and(most insistent of all) gloves from Hong Kong - to say nothing of cotton cloth from Hong Kong,
6.        If the Indians raised the question of our existing protectivearrangements for the state purchase of jute goods, it might suit us touse the opportunity to deal with this also by tariff action.7. The launching of the operation would require careful planning,.We would have to;-(i)     Notify the Government of India immediately our decision was taken in order to give them as much notice aspossible.    A draft telegram to our High Commissioneris annexed.(ii)     Brief our representatives in other Commonwealth countries to emphasise that these arrangements in no way affected- our trade with them.(iii)     Brief our representatives in foreign countries so that theycould be ready, if asked, as they might well be, to explain the special reasons for our action; and in particular to emphasise that it was a domestic Commonwealthproblem arising from our free-entry  commitmentsunder the United Kingdom/Indian Trade Agreement.They should also be asked to explain that we were not taking emergency action under Article XIX of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.(iv)    Announce our decision in such a way as to make the mostof the help we were giving Lancashire without at the sametime setting too manifestly an example which might befollowed by other Governments to the detriment of our exports, or starting an avalanche of applications for similar treatment for other industries here.    This wouldnot be a very simple statement to make.    If my colleaguesdecide on this course, however, I would submit a draft statement to them before the House re-assembled.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.7th April, 1955.
DRAFT MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNMENTOF india the United Kingdom Government has been greatly concerned forsome time with the problem which has arisen as a result of the rapid increase during 1954 in the imports of grey cotton cloth from India intothe United Kingdom.    These imports threaten the stability of the domestic market for cotton textiles in the United Kingdom.    There isparticular anxiety in the United Kingdom cotton textile industry since there is no foreseeable end to this expansion given that these imports are not subject to any restrictions and are guaranteed freedom fromduty by the United Kingdom/India Trade Agreement of 1939.2.        &quot;We have drawn the attention of the Government of India to this problem on several occasions.    Both Governments have been anxious toavoid any action which might impair the generally satisfactory economic relations and the high level of trade between the two countries.    Butin the absence of any other solution or of any sign that the volume ofimports will fall we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that theonly course open to us in the circumstances which we now face will beto open discussions with the Government of India under Article 15 of the1939 Trade Agreement with a view to imposing a tariff on Indian greycloth.3.        Meanwhile, as a holding action and in order to bring to an end the forestalling Which is already apparent, we propose to announce next week that we are placing an upper limit on these imports forthwith whilethe arrangements for the longer-term are being considered.    no restriction is being placed on imports of cloth for re-export but only oncloth for retention in the United Kingdom market.    The quotas for imports for retention in the United Kingdom market will limit importsfor the remainder of 1955 to the estimated 1954 rate.    We hope that inthis way there will be the minimum disturbance to existing orders, andto trade generally. .4.       Imports from foreign countries are subject to duty, and in somecases to quota restrictions.    We are, therefore, not making any changein the present arrangements for imports from foreign countries.    Nor,in view of our special relationship with the Colonies, are we taking any action in regard to imports from them.5.       We shall send you a further message at an early date about our proposals for further discussions.    Pending our announcement next weekwe should be grateful if this message could be treated with specialsecrecy.
