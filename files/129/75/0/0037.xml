(55) 3713th June, 1955CABINETACCESSION OF JAPAN TO THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND TRADE- -j I   -    ft &apos; &apos;&quot; \    v    .   s      -      . .- -*&apos;memorandum by the President of the Board of trade we may shortly be defending in the House of Commons our decision to sign the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.). Theannouncement of our decision to sign the revised Agreement was well receivedlargely because it was accompanied by the statement that we intended to invoke article XXXV in regard to Japan. At the Party Conference, in the House ofCommons and in Lancashire the G.A.T.T. has been defended in part at any rateupon the basis that we were able to isolate the problem of Japan.2. The Foreign Secretary proposes in his paper (CP. (55) 34) that we should nevertheless give our vote in favour of Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T. I feelthat I should warn my colleagues that, whatever else can be said for this course,it would add considerably to our difficulties in getting Parliament to endorse our policy on the G.A.T.T.3. Such a vote would be contrasted with what I said in Geneva two yearsago about the dangers of Japanese accession. I attach a copy of the speech then made which was released to the Press. Although much has happened since,the main arguments in that speech could still be effectively quoted against theGovernment. We should also have great difficulty in explaining that a vote infavour of Japan&apos;s accession was consistent with our decision to invoke ArticleXXXV. We might well create the impression that we had in some way modifiedour recently declared policy by this new step.4. Moreover, whatever other arguments could be put forward in favour ofsuch a course I would not find it possible to argue that our commercial interest was on balance served by Japan&apos;s accession. The general view of industry here and none of the arguments set out in the Annex to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper would convince them any more than they convince me to the contrary is that japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T. is much against our commercial interests.Increases in tariffs which Contracting Parties imposed against Japan would haveto be imposed against us also by reason of the G.A.T.T. obligations of non-discrimination. It would be said that we had, by our own deliberate action invoting Japan into the G.A.T.T., exposed our industries to these risks.5. I fully understand the Foreign Secretary&apos;s anxiety lest Japan should fail to secure admission into the G.A.T.T. and the whole blame for this be laid at ourdoor. This is not by any means a small issue. If it were clear that that were about to happen, I agree that we should need to look at the problem very carefullyindeed. In the last resort we might decide as a matter of policy to vote for herand defend our action upon the high foreign policy issues involved. But we shouldnot vote for Japan&apos;s accession, at the cost of incurring all the political difficulties to which I have referred, merely as a gesture which did not in fact affect the issue.48172
Board of Trade, S.W. 1,11th June, 1955.ANNEXGENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADEEighth Session of the Contracting PartiesGeneral Debate on the Japanese Proposal for AccessionStatement by the Right Honourable Peter Thorneycroft made in Plenary session on 23rd September, 1953We have all listened with close attention and with sympathy to the speech ofthe Japanese Delegate on Japan&apos;s application for provisional membership of theG.A.T.T. He developed the case for such accession with clarity and moderation.But, as I have indicated at an earlier stage, this application raises serious difficulties for a number of countries, including the United Kingdom. Early in thediscussion, I put these difficulties briefly before the Contracting Parties so thatthey can be considered here or in any Working Party which may be set up.I would emphasise that I am concerned here with a wide range Of Commercial,political and economic problems which affect the United Kingdom and the GeneralAgreement as a whole. I appreciate the difficulties which confront the JapaneseGovernment, but I should like to make plain the difficulties which arise for theUnited Kingdom on the Japanese application. These difficulties are based partly on memories of the past, but they are based also on uncertainty about the future;I should like to say something on both.A^year ago the Contracting Parties examined this matter and it presenteddifficulties then. On the one hand, there were memories of Japanese competitionbefore the war; and, on the other, fears of recurrence of such competition again.Behind these difficulties looms an even larger problem. The fears of japanese competition recurring may be justified or not; but the fact is they exist not onlyin the United Kingdom but also among many other Contracting Parties, and theywould be bound to have their effect on the tariff and quota policies of the countries concerned. They are bound to make it not easier but harder to make progress inthe lowering of trade barriers.Nations would be anxious to protect their domestic industry and, if japan was in G.A.T.T., the result would be that they would raise barriers upwards against all nations since Concessions which are made to one Contracting Party must bemade&apos; to all.Such a situation Could only do serious damage to the United Kingdom andother exporting countries and in any case could do nothing but harm to the objectives of the General Agreement.An Intersessional Committee examined these problems. There were longdiscussions to see if suitable safeguards could be introduced. , One suggestedsafeguard involved Article XIX, but I agree with the Intersessional Committee thatthere are substantial objections to the use of this Article in the way suggested.Another suggested safeguard was based on Article XXIII, but, while this wouldbe a step in the right direction, it seems to us inadequate to meet the problem of association here and now.6. The voting position of several countries is still obscure. It appears to mehowever that Japan with the assistance of the United States should succeed in getting the necessary 23 votes in order to secure admission. This would obviatethe necessity for us to vote at all and would clearly be the best solution. I therefore propose that we defer a decision until we know more about how these countries are likely to vote. We shall then be able to see whether our vote will be necessaryto secure Japan&apos;s accession.P. T.
now we have before us this application for provisional association. I mustsay that I see little difference between provisional association in this form and permanent accession. G.A.T.T. itself is provisional, and will probably go on asprovisional for quite a time. I feel that all these distinctions between provisional and permanent tend to be artificial.I wonder still if it is really wise to press this application. If other ContractingParties decide to accept the application they are free to do so, but I must make itclear that the United Kingdom would then have to stand apart.I should have thought that it would be easier to look at this matter in the lightof the general review of the G.A.T.T. which will be taking place in due course.I would ask the Contracting Parties just to consider the situation as it is to-day.First, look at tariff structure. The other day we had a discussion on Article XXVIIIin the course of which country after country pointed out the substantial difficultieswhich it faced in continuing to bind its tariffs. They explained that time had hada considerable effect upon a tariff structure which had been established underdifferent circumstances some time ago. Many expressed anxiety to modify these rates. It seems probable or at least possible that after some heart-searching weshall agree to keep the bound tariffs bound. To introduce now, however, a newlow cost producer would certainly exacerbate these difficulties. The logic of thecase which was put forward by the other countries when we were considering thedifficulties on Article XXVIII is that the time to consider the question of Japan&apos;sentry would be when we have fresh tariff negotiations.Secondly, let us look at the area of competition. For reasons which we allknow and understand the Eastern markets are much reduced. The UnitedKingdom and the United States are fully agreed upon East/West trade policy. Weall know the difficulties and the reasons underlying this but we must face the facts of the situation. The fact is that Japan had an important market in China before thewar. Japan is not the only country whose trade has been greatly reduced; the trade of other countries is similarly affected. I am not seeking here to debate the questionof East/West trade, I only ask the Contracting Parties to face the facts.If that is the situation in the markets of the East, what about the markets inthe West? Again we must face the facts. Can it be contended that dollars can be readily earned in the United States market to-day? For the time being at anyrate the United States remains highly protectionist. Whether we like it or notthe whole trade of Europe and of Japan is turned inward upon itself and isartificially concentrated on a limited area of the world including, if I may say so,the United Kingdom&apos;s traditional Commonwealth markets.In these circumstances with American commercial policy still uncertain we inthe United Kingdom feel that this application is premature. We cannot understand what practical advantages would follow from Japan&apos;s association with the GeneralAgreement which could not be obtained by other methods. Japan is faced with nopressing urgent practical problems which are not capable of solution for all practicaltrading purposes by methods of co-operation and good will outside the legal provisions of the General Agreement. After all, it is practical solutions that count.Paradoxically enough it has been the United Kingdom and her Colonies that have in recent months announced practical steps to assist Japan in her problems. Forexample, a few months ago we announced certain increases in the quotas forJapanese goods in most of our Colonies; and only a few days ago East Africaannounced an early relaxation of the embargo there on imports from Japan.I hope, therefore, that the Contracting Parties will consider these arguments.They are serious ones. I hope that they will consider whether this issue could notbe deferred.After all, is accession as a result of a majority vote, without a Tariff agreement and with the Contracting Parties deeply divided, something which will really helpJapan? If, however, Japan feels bound to press this application and the majorityagree, the United Kingdom will not vote against the application. We will, as I havemade clear, abstain from voting and abstain from participation in any newobligations that are undertaken.
