GENERAL ELECTION:  REPLIES TO ENQUIRIESIt is desirable that all Departments should, so far as possible, follow a commonprocedure in dealing with enquiries or requests for information, particularly by parliamentary candidates, during the Election campaign.Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate with factual informa-tion which is readily available and is not confidential. Such information shouldnot, however, be provided if its extraction would require a substantial use of officialtime; a useful criterion is whether information would be extracted for the purposeof a&quot; reply to a Parliamentary Question. Local and regional offices should deal onthis basis with any enquiries addressed to them; but they should refer doubtfulcases to the headquarters of their Department for decision.For information not of a factual nature, or for guidance on policy, Conservativecandidates and their agents are expected to look to the Conservative research department. In order to prevent much separate and unco-ordinated correspond-ence between the Research Department and individual Government Departments,the Election Business Committee of the Cabinet has been appointed to supervise the work of advising Government candidates about the replies which they should return to questionnaires and other enquiries put to them during the campaign.The Conservative Research Department will accordingly collate questionnaires or particular questions which they receive, and normally will prepare first drafts ofreplies. These will in appropriate cases be forwarded to the Secretary of theElection Business Committee in the Cabinet Office, who will obtain the comments of the Ministers concerned upon them in order to check the information andarguments originally supplied by the Conservative Research Department. TheSecretary of the Committee will, where this seems necessary in the light of a minister^ comments or the comments of the Conservative Research Department,submit final drafts of replies for the Committee&apos;s approval. The research department will thereafter be responsible for passing on the necessary guidance to candidates.Requests for information not of a factual nature or policy enquiries fromConservative candidates which are addressed to Departments should normally bereferred, through Ministers&apos; Private Offices, to Mr. P. Goldman, at the ConservativeResearch Department, 24 Old Queen Street, S.W..1, accompanied, in appropriate cases, by advice on how such enquiries should be answered, and on the questionwhether they are of such a nature as to require consideration by the ElectionBusiness Committee. A copy of any such communication should be sent to theSecretary of the Election Business Committee at the Cabinet Office.Enquiries addressed to Departments from any quarter may call for animportant statement of policy to be made by the Minister concerned. In that eventa Minister may decide himself to seek the guidance of the Election business committee; and in any case it would be advisable to inform the Secretary of theCommittee of the enquiry and of the terms of the reply.
