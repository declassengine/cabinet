iiCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh AffairsCOPY NO.CABINETI desire to bring again to the notice of the Cabinet the problemof colonial immigrants which was briefly discussed by the Cabinet on 3rd May (C.M.(55) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.       The following are the main facts and considerations involved:(a) there is a large and continuing influx of coloured personsinto this country;  most of these come from the west indies, the numbers estimated to come from that area in 1955 being about 20,000.    The immigrants tend tocongregate and live in over-crowded conditions,especially in the Midlands and certain parts of London,which it is beyond the resources of the housing authorities concerned to prevent or alleviate,(b) There is no means of controlling this influx without legislation.(c) Legislation confined to a power to deport undesirableindividuals would be ineffective unless it were accompanied by power to exclude individuals; itwould be necessary to empower Immigration officers to exclude any person who was undesirable on account,for example, of his criminal record or for medicalreasons, and also to require any person within the controls coming into this country for the purpose ofemployment to obtain a permit from the Ministry ofLabour and National Service and a certificate fromthe local housing authority that satisfactory housing accommodation was available for him.If the Bill extends to all British subjects without discrimination, some administrative easements infavour of British subjects from independent commonwealth countries would be needed; and thereis also the problem of citizens of the Irish Republic.secret.P.(55) 3211th June, 1955

(d) A draft Bill on these lines has been prepared but itis thought that it would be highly controversial.(e) Controversy would be reduced if it were possible to base the legislation on the recommendations of an impartial Committee.3.       I do not think that any inquiry need take long.    The facts arereadily obtainable and I should expect that it would be possible for anyinquiry to be completed in time for legislation in 195604,       I accordingly recommend the appointment of a DepartmentalCommittee with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To consider and report whether, having regard tothe importance of maintaining the traditional ties between this country and other parts of the Commonwealth, any and,if so, what changes in the law relating to the admission tothe United Kingdom of British subjects from overseas, orany class of them, and to their subsequent stay in theUnited Kingdom, are necessary or desirable in the national interest and in the interest of the immigrants themselves&quot;.and I suggest the following for the composition of the Committee:Chairman: Lord Radcliffe, or failing him, the Earl ofCrawford and Balcarres, or Mr. John Sparrow(Warden of All Souls) or Sir David Lindsay Keir(Master of Balliol). &apos;One Conservative, one Labour and one Liberal M.P.- One representative of Employers OrganisationsOne representative of the Trades Union CouncilOne person familiar with Commonwealth problems, tobe nominated by the Commonwealth SecretaryOne person experienced in Colonial administration, tobe nominated by the Colonial Secretary.One person (preferably a woman) well known as a social workerOne economic expertOne member of a local authority concerned with housing andand public health questions at least one of the members should be chosen from Scotlandand one from Wales,5.        The Commonwealth Secretary agrees with the foregoingrecommendation.    The Colonial Secretary agrees generally with theproposal to set up a Committee, but has reservations about the proposed&apos;terms of reference.G.LL. -G.Home Office, S.W.I.10th June, 1955.
