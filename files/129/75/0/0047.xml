(55) 4721st June, 1955CABINETADEN PROTECTORATE:  RELATIONS WITH THE YEMENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Cabinet last discussed the security of the Aden Protectorate and its relations with the Yemen on 8th July, 1954, in connection with the question of theextent to which air action against Yemen territory should be permitted (C.C. (54)48th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. In October 1954 the Governor of Aden had conversations with the King ofthe Yemen (the Imam) as a result of which an agreement was drafted which, ifimplemented, should have the effect of removing some of the immediate causes of trouble. Meanwhile open attacks on the Protectorate from Yemen territory have practically ceased but assistance continues to be rendered by the Yemen authoritiesto dissidents within the Protectorate.3. Moreover, in the more recent past there have been a number of attacks onEuropeans in the Protectorate, two of whom have been murdered. although there is no conclusive evidence of Yemeni complicity in these attemptsH.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires in Taiz reported recently that the two suspected murderersof one British subject were being maintained at the Government^ expense in the yemen, and the Governor of Aden fears that the policy of the Yemen Governmentmay now be directed to the instigation of murders of British Officers or government supporters in the Protectorate. Further, it has recently been reportedthat the Yemeni Government has been having copies of an anti-British pamphletprinted for distribution in Aden and the Protectorate.4. Even before these events the situation on the boundary remained strained,and I therefore asked the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs to visit Aden andthe Western Protectorate in January. Since the Minister of State reported on his visit, there have been internal troubles in the Yemen itself, during which the king was deposed by his brother. What effect, if any, these disorders will have onrelations between Aden and the Yemen is not yet clear; but, as the Kingre-established his position and has now been restored to the throne, it is hardlylikely to be good.5. The Minister of State&apos;s report has been considered with other Departmentsconcerned. Particular attention has been given to his suggestions for increasing and reorganising the forces in the Protectorate, the present state ofwhich is described in Appendix I. The Minister of State came to the conclusionthat a special enquiry was needed into this aspect. The Secretary of State for Airhas pointed out that extensive reforms of the Aden Protectorate Levies have takenplace since the Minister of State&apos;s visit and are continuing. Nevertheless it hasbeen agreed that the security problem could profitably be referred to the Chiefs ofStaff if certain aspects of policy in the Protectorate were first defined. The Chiefs48469 Bm
of Staff, with this background, would then be free if they thought fit, to conduct an enquiry into the role and organisation of the Security Forces. They would not be precluded from considering whether the present organisation is suitable for its purpose. The enquiry should take into account local political factors in so far asthey affect the security situation. I am therefore asking the Cabinet to approveterms of reference to the Chiefs of Staff on the lines indicated in the Annex.6. In July the Cabinet authorised the use of air power in Yemen territory incertain- circumstances subject to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s approval. The occasion for the use of this authority has not so far arisen. The Minister of State hasreferred to this in his report, and I agree with him that bombing within Yementerritory would not be justified particularly now that the emphasis in Yemenisubversion has shifted from frontier raiding to the encouragement of disorderwithin the Protectorate. I would propose, therefore, that the terms of reference tothe Chiefs of Staff should exclude the possibility of air action against the Yemen.7. In his report the Minister of State has recommended that the Governor of aden should be authorised to take certain action which may succeed in persuading the King of the Yemen to abandon his subversion within the Aden Protectorate.I propose that this suggestion be held in abeyance until we can see more clearlywhat the present King&apos;s position and intentions are. I may, however, raise thisquestion orally with the Cabinet if circumstances should alter.8. In his report the Minister of State has dealt also with certain long-term aspects of our policy in the Protectorate which I intend to, consider with the Governor. In one respect however, our long-term policy affects thesecurity problem. There is little doubt that the Yemeni Governments presentaggressive policy is largely motivated by fear that the proposals for federation ofthe states of the Protectorate, which were made to the Rulers by the Governor in1953, would be implemented and would have the eventual effect of producing asingle state or an integrated Federation which would be less susceptible to Yemeniinfluence and would succeed in resisting the Yemeni claim to the Protectorate asYemen territory. There can, of course, be no question of our abandoning federationsimply because it is repugnant to the Yemen, and there is no doubt that in thelong run some improvement of the administration of the states must be broughtabout. At present, however, there is no great enthusiasm for federation amongthe Rulers, and I propose that the policy of federation should not be pressed upon them but should continue to be held in abeyance unless and until it is clear thatthe Rulers themselves have come to favour it.9.   I therefore ask the Cabinet to approve the draft terms of reference to theChiefs of Staff in the annex and to confirm that the following assumptions may beincluded in them for purposes: of planning in the foreseeable future:  (1) that air power will not be used across the Yemen border;(2) that counter-subversionary measures against the Yemen will not be used at present, although this question may need to be reconsidered later;(3) that proposals for federation of the Protectorate states should not be pressedunless the Rulers themselves come to favour them.10. At the same time I am seeking Cabinet approval for immediate stepsto improve our position in the Protectorate.(1) One of the difficulties of the. situation in the Western Protectorate is the weakness of the administration of some of the poqrer States. In orderto remedy this it is proposed to provide a sum of money which wouldbe used to strengthen the administration of these States in various, ways:by payment of existing debts, by providing official buildings, subsidisingthe educational systems and the forces, and financing agricultural development. Part of this, money, about 5 per cent., Would be used infostering the loyalty of subjects in the traditional way by means ofpresents and rewards. The cost of this proposal would not exceed 76,000. If it has the. approval of the Cabinet I shall discuss it with theChancellor of the Exchequer in order to find means of implementing theproposal.(2) Pending the outcome of the consideration of the security problem by theChiefs of Staff it is necessary to take immediate steps to strengthen thesecurity forces in the Protectorate. The Air Ministry has taken allpreliminary steps for the formation of three additional squadrons of
vimANNEXSECURITY OF THE ADEN PROTECTORATEDraft Terms of Reference to the Chiefs of Staff[Paragraphs 1-4 will provide background information]5. The Chiefs of Staff are invited to consider in particular the suggestions made in the Minister of State&apos;s report for increasing and reorganising theforces in the Protectorate, including the conclusion that a special enquiry is needed into this aspect. Extensive reforms of the Aden Protectorate Levieshave taken place since the Minister of State&apos;s visit and are continuing, andwithout prejudice to any conclusions which the Chiefs of Staff may reach, authority has already been given for the expansion of the Aden Protectorate Levies by threesquadrons. Nevertheless the Cabinet have.agreed that the security problem shouldbe referred to the Chiefs of Staff, with the policy assumptions within which theymay frame their assessment.6. The Chiefs of Staff are accordingly invited to consider the scale, organ-isation equipment and deployment of all forces in the light of the threat to securitypresented by the events described above within the Aden Protectorate and in the framework of the policy laid down in paragraph 7 below. They are asked also toconsider the forces in the Colony in so far as they are relevant to the security ofthe Protectorate. The Chiefs of Staff are not precluded from considering whetherthe present organisation is suitable in prevailing circumstances and under currentpolicy, nor from taking local political factors into consideration in so far as theyaffect security. It is open to the Chiefs of Staff to decide whether to send aCommission to examine the problem locally.7. The following lines of policy have been laid down by the Cabinet for the guidance of the Chiefs of Staff in considering the security situation in the aden protectorate:  (i) air power will not be used across the Yemen border;(ii) counter-subversionary measures within the Yemen, plans for which havebeen drawn up by the Governor of Aden, will not be employed for thetime being;(iii) the proposal for federation of the Protectorate States will not be pressedunless and until the Rulers themselves come to favour it.It has also been decided : (iv) that a sum of  76,000 will be provided for administrative subsidies to someof the poorer states of the Western Aden Protectorate; and(v) that the Aden Protectorate Levies will be expanded by three squadrons,without prejudice to any future recommendations as to the scale and nature of security forces which the Joint Chiefs of Staff may make.48469the Aden Protectorate Levies in accordance with the most recentassessment of the Governor and the Air Officer Commanding. cabinet authority is sought to form these three additional squadrons withoutdelay, the annual cost of which is estimated to be  250,000, and initiallyit is estimated that there will be capital expenditure of approximately 90,000. If the Cabinet approves this proposal I shall consider withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air its financial implications.11. The expenditure involved in these two projects will be additional to current costs in the Protectorate, running at the rate of some  1-3 million perannum, as set out in Appendix II.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W. I,17th June, 1955.
APPENDIX ISECURITY FORCES IN THE WESTERN ADEN PROTECTORATE1. R.A.F. Regiment Field SquadronsThree R.A:F. Regiment Field Squadrons are located at Aden. Each squadronhas an establishment of 6 officers and 143 airmen, and is armed with 2&quot; and 3&quot;mortars, Bren LMG&apos;s, rifles and machine carbines. Two of these squadrons arepermanently retained in the Colony for security duties but the third squadron forms part of H.Q. M.E.A.F&apos;s strategic reserve and is therefore available for duty outsidethe Colony but within the Command boundaries.2. Aden Protectorate LeviesThe Aden Protectorate Levies are under the control of the Air OfficerCommanding, British Forces, Aden. The force consists of a Headquarterscontrolling two tactical wings (each of three squadrons), one Headquarters Wing(administrative and recruit training squadron) and a hospital wing. The strengthof the British element of the force is at present 34 R.A.F. Regiment officers and100 R.A.F. Regiment airmen. The Arab element of the force is recruited locallyfrom tribes in the Western Aden Protectorate and its present strength is 48 locally-commissioned Arab officers, 1,193 Arab Levies and 313 non-combatants. Theforce is armed with the same weapons as the R.A.F. Regiment squadrons but notto the same scale.3. Government GuardsGovernment Guards are gendarmerie under the control of the Governor andconsist of Arabs with Arab and British officers. On the 1st May, 1954, their strengthwas 633 all ranks and the authorised strength has since been increased by 260,including three British officers. They are armed with small arms, machine gunsand mortars. The functions of the Government Guards are various and includethe maintenance and manning of a number of fortified posts constructed for thepurpose of frontier control and for maintaining security in those areas of the protectorate where tribal unrest has threatened security; the provision of escortsto the political staff and the Governor when travelling in the Protectorate; and they also maintain a reserve to deal with any minor internal disturbances or localisedtribal incursion into the Protectorate from the Yemen. They have also the task,of ensuring stability in those areas where penetration by political staff is takingplace.4. Tribal GuardsThe Tribal Guards are in effect the armed police of the individual ProtectedStates; they are raised and commanded by the local rulers but some are partiallydependent and some wholly dependent on grants from Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The authorised strength of the Force is, according to latest records, as follows:  Lahej Trained Forces (Abdali)Fadhli Tribal Guards*Lower Yafa&apos;i Tribal Guards*Lower Aulaqi Tribal Guards19612070402975467053253030Haushabi Tribal GuardsAmiri Tribal GuardsDathina Tribal Guards*Beihan Tribal GuardsAudhali Tribal Guards*Maflahi Tribal GuardsShaib Tribal GuardsUpper Aulaqi Sheikhdom* Entirely supported by the State.
