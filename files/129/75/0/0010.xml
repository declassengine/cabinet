&quot;hi-)(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.3ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETC0Pa(55)-lj) i-O COPY NO. (p^j2 6th April, 1955 &apos;CABINE TINDUSTRIAL DISPUTES;  RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (A.S0L.EoFo) , the union representing about three-quarters ofthe footplate staffs, have declared their intention of calling their membersout on strike as from 1st May in protest against the recent award of theRailway Staff National Tribunal.    This award has the effect ofconfirming an. agreement providing for general increases in ratesbetween the British Transport Commission (B0T0C0) and the National&quot;Union of Railwaymen (NeUcR.).    It does however reduce the differentialsfor footplate men resulting from a previous award of the Tribunal,,The sums involved are small, (ranging from l/6d. to 5/6d, ), and theA0S0LoE0F0 case is based, not on any claim of pressing hardship, but ontheir concern to prevent any shrinkage of existing differentials.   they made this plain when I saw them last week.2,        The union&apos;s decision to strike was gratuitously abrupt,    It wastaken within a matter of hours of the announcement of the Tribunalsdecision and there was no attempt on their part to explore alternative methods of approach.    The decision does not, however, involve any breach of the agreed negotiating machinery.    It does nevertheless involvethrowing overboard the award of the industry&apos;s own Tribunal confirmingan award to which the other unions involved are a party.3.        In these circumstances it is difficult to see how I, as Minister ofLabour, can help.    As the issue has already been before the industry&apos;sown Tribunal, I could hardly set up an independent body, such as a Courtof Inquiry, to look into it without belittling the Railway Staff NationalTribunal and encouraging the rejection of arbitration awards in otherindustries.    Similarly, even if it were thought desirable, I could hardlyask the B.T.C0 to reconsider the footplate men&apos;s rates as this wouldinvolve jettisoning the Commission^ agreement with the N.U0R. which hasbeen confirmed by the Tribunal, and invite from them (the N.U0Ro) a claim for parallel increases in the lower grades from which their membership is mainly drawn.    The unwillingness of the B0T0C0 to consider any concession was confirmed by the Chairman, whom I saw with the Ministerof Transport to-day.4.        The Trades Union Congress,.which has shown a welcome anscietyto try and find a solution, has been giving much consideration to this problem both because of the widespread unemployment which would result from a railway stoppage and because of the rivalry between the N.U.R,,and the AeS0L.E,F0 which bedevils the present dispute,,    They have not1-
so far had any concrete suggestion to offer and it would be over-optimisticto expect them to produce a solution to this unusually difficult situationcThey contemplate seeing both the railway unions to-morrow and have promised to report the outcome of their discussions to me.5. The Executive of the N0U0R0 have to-day issued instructionsto their members to continue normal working in the event of a strikeby A0S,L0E.F. This means that their footplate members would beexpected to work those trains which they normally man, but not thoseusually worked by A0S0L0E0F0 crews. It remains to be seen whether at depots jointly staffed by N.U.RS and A0SaL0E0F0 members, the NoU0R0crews would carry out their union1 s instructions in the face of anACS0L,E0F0 strike,,W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S0W.l.25th April, 1955.
