Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 72CP. (55) 722nd April, 1955CABINETPRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES FOR AN INTERNATIONALFINANCE corporation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in July, 1952 the Cabinet asked the Foreign Secretary &quot; to give them earlynotice of any new proposal to extend .... immunities and privileges to other international agencies &quot; (C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. The Economic Policy Committee decided on 25th November, 1954 thatthe United Kingdom should support the proposal for an International finance corporation (I.F.C.X affiliated to the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (E.A. (54) 25th Meeting, Item 2). The Chancellor of the Exchequerannounced Her Majesty&apos;s Governments support in answer to a question in theHouse of Commons on 7th December, 1954.3. A draft charter for the I.F.C. providing, inter alia, for the grant of certainimmunities and privileges to the Corporation, has been drawn up. by theInternational Bank. The draft Charter, when approved by the Executive Boardof the Bank, will either be opened for signature, or signed at a ceremony towardsthe end of April.4. After signature some time will elapse before the I.F.C. can come intooperation because most Governments, including Her Majesty&apos;s Government, will need to enact legislation. The United Kingdom legislation, which will besponsored by the Treasury, will among other things enable the necessary privileges and immunities to be granted to the Corporation. The privileges and immunitiesin the\draft charter closely correspond to those already enjoyed in the UnitedKingdom by the International Bank, under the Order in Council of 1946(Statutory Rules and Orders, 1946, No. 36).5. Under this Order in Council, the International Bank enjoys the followingprivileges and immunities: the Bank&apos;s assets are free from restrictions and immune from seizure; its officers are immune from legal process when acting in an officialcapacity; the Bank&apos;s property and the official emoluments of its officers (if notlocal nationals) are immune from taxation; the Bank is exempt from Customsduties, but its officers are not.6. This means very little in practice, apart from exemption from stamp dutyon the Bank&apos;s new issues on the London market, as the headquarters of the Bankare in Washington, and its European branch office is in Paris. No more is likelyto be entailed in the case of the I.F.C., whose seat will also be in Washington. Inthe unlikely event of a branch office being set up in London, it would be small,and United Kingdom nationals, if employed in it, would be liable to UnitedKingdom taxation.7. In accordance with the decision quoted in paragraph 1 above, I ask mycolleagues to take note of this proposed extension of privileges and immunities.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th April, 1955.47945
