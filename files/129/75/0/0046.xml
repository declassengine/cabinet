secret.P.(55) 4617th June, 1955COPY NO.  6 3CABINETREMUNERATION OF minister&apos;s memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerLast October I put before my colleagues proposals for increasing the remuneration of Ministers (C. (54) 313).    After some consideration the Cabinet decided in February that legislation shouldnot be introduced before the General Election (C.C.(55) 11th Conclusions,Minute i).    They will now wish to consider the matter again.2. In C. (54) 313 1 suggested that by modern standardsMinisterial salaries are undoubtedly much too low, and also that thereis a strong case for extending to all Ministers in the Commons theright to draw the full Parliamentary salary - a course which was recommended by the Select Committee on Members1 Expenses.3. I also pointed out that it is almost impossible to do anythingworth while for the junior Minister alone without producing a nonsensicalrelationship between him and his seniors.    This is a point we cannotevade, and I am myself convinced that we ought now to deal thoroughlywith the whole question of Ministerial remuneration, including the caseof senior Ministers.4. I previously made the tentative proposal (leaving aside forthe moment the English Law Officers and Prime Minister) that allMinisterial salaries of less than  3,000 might be increased by  500,and that all Ministers in the Commons should be entitled to draw the fullParliamentary salary (at present  1,000) but not the Sessional Allowance.5. This would produce, in the three standard cases, thefollowing re suitsExistingMinisterial    Parlia-SuggestedMinisterial   Parlia-Senior MinistersMinisters ofStateParliamentarySecretariesSalary 5,0003,0001,500mentarySalary Nil500500Salary5,0003,0002,000mentarySalary   .1,0001,0001,000

These figures are of course gross   - that is, before deduction of tax and, in the case of Ministers in the Commons, before deduction of their parliamentary expenses.6. 1 am by no means wedded to this scheme, which indeed is far from lavish.    But full consideration, both of this scheme and of possible alternatives, involves a good deal of detail, particularly as tothe effect of Parliamentary expenses and of the incidence of tax at different levels on Ministerial and Parliamentary salaries.    There arealso a great many different cases to consider, as the Appendix to my previous Paper showed.7. I therefore suggest that a small Committee of senior ministers might be invited to consider the whole matter in greater detail and&apos;make recommendations to the Cabinet.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.17th June, 1955.\-4
