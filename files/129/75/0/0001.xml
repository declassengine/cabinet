C.P.(55) 112th April, 1955CABINETTHE COTTON industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have already described fully in previous papers (notably inC. (55) 88 and C. (55) 89) the problems facing us in dealing with the cottonindustry, and in this paper I merely list the various courses before us and say what I think we ought to do,2.        We must decide what to do in time both to make an announcementimmediately after the Easter recess and, if the decision makes it necessarto inform our overseas posts what we are doing and why.    The choicesbefore us are these:-(a) No action.    It won&apos;t be easy to defend a position of completeinactivity and in view of the pressure on LancashireMembers I do not think I could urge that we should do nothing whatsoever to assist.. v(b) The complete removal of purchase tax on all textiles and clothing at a cost of  42 millions in revenue.    This is theonly measure which would help the export side of theproblem, and the better end of the industry where most ofthe short-time working exists.    It is, however, a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(c) To put a tariff on India alone.    This would mean re-opening the Indian Trade Agreement, at any rate so far as cottonis concerned, and would involve temporary quotas whilethe negotiations were going on in order to prevent fore-stalling.    It would anger India because it woulddiscriminate against her, and disappoint Lancashire byfailing to deal with imports from Hong Kong.    It is unlikely that we could confine action for long to cottonor for that matter to India.    The whole issue of commonwealth free-entry would then be raised,(d) To put a tariff (preceded also in this case by a temporaryquota) on imports both from India and Hong Kong.    This... would be more attractive to Lancashire than (c) above in as much as a lot of the retained cloth comes from hong Kong.    It would, however, open up the whole issueof-Commonwealth free-entry and could certainly not be&apos; confined to cotton.
(e) A comprehensive policy consisting of putting a tariff(preceded by temporary quotas), on imports from India .and Hong Kong, coupled with the abolition of purchase7      tax and the reference of the spinners1 ring to the&apos; Monopolies Commission.    If we did this no one could say we were not grappling with the problem and Itwould have the advantage that we were dealing throughpurchase tax with the export side as well as with,imports.    But it would raise again the issue of commonwealth free-entry and Ottawa.(f) There are various compromises involving some or all of these courses, like doing something on purchase tax and soznething on India.    Like all compromises they. run the risk of getting the worst of all worlds.3.        There are two considerations which are paramount:-(i)     It is not really open to us, at or about the time we shall beannouncing our continued general support for the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.), just to puton a protective quota without at the same time sayingthat we are going to move forward and negotiate tariff protection.    To do so would put us in an entirely falseposition and cut across all the statements we have made and the pledges we have given recently in our talks withother countries on quota policy.(ii)     The decision which is made in this case is going to betaken, inside and outside this country, as setting to someextent the tone of our future external commercial policy.It will be the first decision in this field of a new Govern-ment.    It will be closely watched by the Canadians whohave just announced that they do not intend to accede totheir wool textile industry&apos;s demands for increasedprotection against United Kingdom imports (which fill40 per cent of the Canadian market, whereas totalimports of cotton textiles into the United Kingdom account for only 5 per cent of total home sales).    It will also be closely watched by the Americans, who are ponderingwhether to limit our exports of bicycles.    It will notpass unobserved by others inside and outside thiscountry.4.        I realise the difficulties which it would involve for some of mycolleagues, but my firm advice is that the right course for us to followis1 course (b) - the complete removal of purchase tax on all textiles and clothing. &apos; At the same time, we will in any event be announcing our intention not to undertake the obligations of the G.A.T.T, towards Japan,thereby giving Lancashire the assurance that we shall be able tocontinue to regulate imports under the Sterling Payments Agreement.In due course, we should also benefit from those tariff concessions on imports of cotton textiles which the Indian Government now seems,prepare^ to make, although these concessions will certainly not be made if we restrict their imports.    If we hold firmly to that policy and refuseto start restricting free entry from the Commonwealth, we shall havetaken up a position which will, in my view, be defensible in Lancashire
mand in the country as a whole.    We shall earn respect everywhere and create the best possible impression abroad, where the externalcommercial policy we follow sets, in large measure, the tone of the trading relations of the whole world.Board of Trade, S.W.1.7th April, 1955.- . -        , -
