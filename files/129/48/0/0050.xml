But, since the war, the scopeof the utility schemes has been very considerably, extended, mainly inorder to meet post-war social and economic needs; and this extension,coupled with the automatic link with tax exemption, has gradually produced a series of problems to which it is now very urgent to find an answer.2. ..    The previous Government set up a Committee, under theChairmanship of Sir. &quot;William Douglas, to consider these problems.   its terms of reference are contained in Annex &apos;A&apos;; and its report is expected in the very near future.   As soon as it is available we shall have to decide what action we are prepared to take; but provisional decisions are possible andshould be taken forthwith.3. The problems involved are briefly as follows:-(i) - Export trade is now being lost because manufacturers will not -   -produce for export a sufficient variety of medium grade goods which are not covered by the utility schemes, and for which, at present tax-inclusive prices,there is no home demand if for any reason export sales do not materialise.One serious disadvantage of the present Purchase Tax arrangements in the utility field is the virtual disappearance of goods at pricesimmediately above top utility prices which results from the sudden jumpfrom complete tax exemption to tax on the full wholesale value.   This has ledto the creation of a &quot;blind spot&quot; in the production range at this point.Similar problems arise in the case of slightly cheaper goods whichdiffer from the utility specifications.  Action to remove this &quot;blind spot&quot;is probably the only step we can take to give immediate help to textile exports.(ii)         - The utility arrangements are now in a very unsatisfactorycondition, and there is no further scope for piecemeal efforts to keep themgoing or to deal with related price control problems.   We. cannot tacklethese problems effectively as long as there is a direct link betweenPurchase Tax and utility status.   The report of the Douglas Committee will   1probably be very critical of the present arrangements, and will show that,for the most part, the utility schemes have outlived their usefulness as .a means of providing any effective measure of price control and qualitymaintenance, , - -------------,:^:&apos;:&apos;r-^y-&apos;:: &apos; 1 ----- &apos; -    ;    . I(iii)Though it is arguable whether the present Utility/Purchase Tax Jarrangements are a significant contributory factor in the present recession [jin the.textile industries, traders are putting the blame for the present Islump on these arrangements and pressure for immediate changes is
-    21)0becoming almost irresistible.   The position would become quite untenableif substantial unemployment arose in Lancashire while the presentPurchase Tax/Utility arrangements remained unchanged.(iv) We import a certain quantity of goods which are of utilityquality, but, because they are not specifically &quot;utility&quot;, are not eligiblefor remission of Purchase Tax,   This discrimination against imports is a breach of our international commercial policy obligations, and we are committed to its removal in the very near future,4.   - It is probable that the Douglas Committee will recommendthat the only solution of the above problems which is compatible withthe requirement in their terms of reference, i, e. not to sacrificerevenue but also to preserve the advantages of the utility schemes to consumers, is an arrangement which is commonly called the &apos;D&apos; scheme.The essence of this scheme is outlined in Annex &apos;3&apos;. .   .. It will be seen that the scheme is complicated and offersconsiderable opportunities for discussion in Parliament.   But we shallhave the advantage that the legislation will be based on the reportof an impartial and expert survey.... - A final decision on the acceptability of this scheme must be deferred until the Douglas Report is available and has been studied togetherwith any alternative scheme.   But if the &apos;D&apos; scheme is to be implemented,a considerable amount of detailed work will be necessary which will takeabout two months.   This work has already been put in hand and will be pressed forward with all possible speed.   Once it is known that theDouglas Report has been received by the Government there will be heavy pressure for its publication and for a statement of the Governme..t*intentions.   The longer such a statement is delayed, the more damagewill be done to trade, both at home and for export.   While we do not, at themoment, wish to commit ourselves about the best date for action, we must clearly be prepared to act rapidly if circumstances make this imperative.We, therefore, seek our colleagues approval to the preliminary work onthe &apos;Dl scheme being carried forward to the point where the necessary legislation can be introduced, if necessary, at very short notice in the spring.This will involve a certain amount of technical consultation with trade interests, but we hope, in the interests of security, to confine thisconsultation to those trade representatives who are already members of theDouglas Committee.6.       ... We will submit proposals for final decision - by the Cabinet,as rapidly as possible after the Douglas Report is available.R.A.B......P.T. -7--17TH DECEMBER, 1951.
ANNEX &apos;A*THE TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE DOUGLAS COMivHTTBETo review the present system of Purchase Taxaffecting those classes of goods within which utility schemesoperate (i,e. cloth, garments, footwear, household and furnishingtextiles, furniture and bedding) in relation to international agreementsbearing on the internal taxation of imported goods, and to the interestof the export trade, consumers and manufacturers; to consider possibleadjustments of that system with a view to removing or reducing any difficulties to which it gives rise; and to submit recommendation onthese matters, having due regard to the need&apos;to maintain the advantageof the utility schemes to consumers, the expansion of the export trade,and the yield of Purchase Tax revenue which would accrue, under theexisting arrangements, from the classes of goods in question.
THE *D* scheme, The scheme would operate only in respect of thosearticles for which there is utility manufacture.   These are textiles,clothing, footwear, and furniture.2. . Within this field it would operate in respect of all goodswhether&apos;they were,utility or non-utility.3, - &apos;.    -Purchase Tax would be charged on all such goods, but onlyoh the amount by which their wholesale value exceeded a fixed deduction,called &apos;D&apos; for short.   This deduction would, therefore, resemble the personal allowances which are deducted before Income Tax is assessed.4.     - : The deduction would have to be fixed separately for each class of goods concerned; probably about 150 separate &apos;P&apos;s&apos;would need to be assessed.5. The present revenue would be maintained if the deductionfor any class of goods were calculated so that about half of thetotal number of purchases of the goods concerned remained completelytax free.  Above this point, since the deduction, is the same for all goodsin any one class, the amount of tax would form a bigger and biggerproportion of the value of the goods as the price increased.   The tax wouldrange from a very small amount on goods just above the exemption point to something approaching the present amount on the most expensive goods.The main fiscal effect of the change would, therefore, be to redistribute the-tax collected from medium price goods in this field by reducing the tax on these goods which are at present non-utility and imposing some margin of tax on the highest priced utility goods.6, -Legislation would be necessary on Finance Bill lines,7. . -       This scheme would have the following advantages in relationto the problems outlined in the covering memorandum:-(a) The substitution, by means of the TD&apos; scheme, of a gently risingrate of tax would eliminate the &apos;blind spot&apos;, and be ofconsiderable advantage to the export trade.(b) The divorce of utility from Purchase Tax would restore to theTreasury and the Board of Trade respectively freedom ofaction to administer the Purchase Tax on a fiscal basis and to make such modifications in the utility scheme as policydictates, without the complication which at present arises from the fact that utility goods are automatically exempt from Purchase Tax.(c) There is- already widespread speculation about the report of theDouglas Committee and about possible major changes in.  the utility field;   Uncertainty on these points is probably-one contributory factor in the present abnormal recession,in buying of textile goods, -(d) The scheme would completely solve the difficulty of import/discrimination, since the tax would depend solely upon the valueof  the&apos; goods and not upon a utility mark.  ..      \&apos; -       v &apos;
