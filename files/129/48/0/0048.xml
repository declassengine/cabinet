(51) 12th Conclusions) the Cabinetappointed a Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Committee under my Chair-manship to formulate proposals for remedying the economic situation.2. I annex a first report by the Sub-Committee. We have analysed ourpresent economic position and pointed to the dangers which threaten the country from the three linked causes of inflation, the failure of production and the deficit in our balance of payments.  We proceed to the following conclusions:-(a) An announcement on economic policy will have to be made when Parlia-ment reassembles in January. The measures announced must be suchas to give confidence both at home and abroad that we can right thebalance of payments and secure a regular surplus on current account(paragraph 12).(b) Increased production, and the encouragement of production, for essentialhome needs as well as for export, is the core of our problem. Coal takesfirst place. Imports of steel are vital (paragraphs 19 to 21).(c) We should aim at increasing the volume of exports by at least  100 million.      a year.. To do this it is essential to reduce the overload on our economy(paragraphs 22 and 23).(d) A bill should be introduced in February to effect a reform of the utilityscheme and purchase tax, which is needed if textile exports are toflourish (paragraphs 23 and 24).(e) In order to reduce the overload on the engineering and metal-using indus- -tries the level of production of some goods made for the home markets bythe metal-using industry should be reduced by  60 million per annum;home investment in engineering products should be reduced below thepresent level by  100 million per annum; and the building programme should be cut back to such a scale as to need no more steel than in 1950(paragraphs 26 to 30).(/) We approve of the proposals of the Minister of Labour and NationalService, contained in his paper C. (51) 18, for a Regulation of Engage-ment Order and for labour supply inspection. We recommend thatthey shouJd.be brought into force as soon as possible (paragraph 31).(g) As one means of reducing the overload on our economy it is necessary to.cut civil expenditure substantially. We consider that we should aim ata reduction in the civil expenditure for which Departments have asked&apos;.&quot; by up to  100 million, which implies a reduction on this year&apos;s figures&apos; of more than  40-million. This involves taking about  40 million offthe health service, about  20 million off education and about  40 millionoff other civil expenditure (paragraph 35).(ft) We aim at a reduction of 7,000 in the staffs of civil departments, other thanthe Post Office, within the next few months. Over a longer period, once the principle is accepted that individual services, must sometimes be, - . curtailed, savings might rise to 15,000 or 20,000 altogether (para-: graph 37). \(/) Except for the Bill referred to in (d\ above, no fiscal measures, of a kind which would have to be carried out by a Finance Bill, should be announced in January; these should wait for the Budget (paragraph 38).41592 &apos; . :\.\ copy No.CABINET
(/) In order to help break the wage-price spiral a draft White Paper shouldbe prepared, for submission to the Cabinet, explaining the issues in,\    -     simple language for everybody to read.  The Minister of Labour and national Service will join with me in sponsoring this paper (para-. graph 39). .3. I commend these proposals for the consideration of my colleagues. our final decisions must be adequate to meet a menacing situation. The country at large does not realise where things are going. It must be realised that the attached report cannot give a complete picture. In particular, there may be much to addby way of constructive proposals as a result of the Prime Minister^ visit to Americaand following on my conversations in January with the Commonwealth finance ministers.- &quot;&apos; 4.  We should also relieve the castigation by cuts and austerities by including some indication that we intend to strike out for greater production throughencouragement of enterprise and effort. This applies especially to coal. Our taskcan be rounded off in a worthy manner only if my colleagues will add their. constructive comments and suggestions to our ad interim submission.&apos; -   &apos; R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12th December, 1951.ANNEX   ;REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ECONOMIC situation-The problem the position which confronted us1. At the end of October when the Government took office we were con-fronted with a picture of a balance of payments crisis of the utmost gravity. Three-main indicators of the state of affairs were put before us and all disclosed adeteriorating position. Our overall balance of payments, which had shown a surplus of nearly  180 million in the second half of 1950, had changed into a deficitat a rate estimated at some  350 million in the second half of 1951. This repre-sented a deterioration at an annual rate of more than  1,000 million over one year.Our gold and dollar reserves were running out at an ever-increasing pace. Inthe four months July-October we lost over  320 million or about one-quarterof our reserves at the end of June. Our position in E.P.U. which had been in largesurplus up to the Spring of 1951 had also changed into a deficit at an increasingrate. In October alone this deficit amounted to no less than  89 million.2. Unless drastic and immediate remedial action could be taken there was no prospect of any improvement in the situation. Without such action confidence in sterling, already gravely impaired, would be Still further damaged and the drain on. our vital reserves would become impossible to sustain.The action we took3. In these circumstances, the Government decided on stop-gap measureswhich would, be followed by further action. The first of these measures was toreduce overseas expenditure for 1952 by  350 million. In addition, steps were takento lighten the load on the domestic economy by postponement of new building. a review of the Investment Programme was promised as well as a rigorous examina-tion of Government expenditure. Finally, we took the first steps to reintroduce ameasure of control over the domestic monetary situation.Later developments4. Though much is to be hoped in the medium term from these steps already taken, their effect on the balance of payments itself can clearly only be gradual.Meanwhile, however, events have not stood still. In several respects the position has deteriorated even during the past few weeks, e.g:, prices of sterling area exports have fallen and demand for them, particularly from the United States, has reachednew low levels. A reassessment of the outlook which has just been made inconnection with the bilateral talks with the United States on economic assistancediscloses that the United Kingdom balance of payments deficit may be nearer  450
r   199million in the second half of this year rather than the  350 million previouslyestimated. Moreover, the gold and dollar deficit in the fourth quarter of this year will reach almost  350 million (compared with  250 million which was previouslyestimated). In the light of these developments we must assume that the prospects for 1952, both on gold and dollar account and on overall account, are considerablyworse than was previously thought. Even if there is room for argument about the precise figures of the forecasts there can be no argument about the magnitude of theproblem which faces us.The nature of the problem5. The basic fact is that we are trying to do too many things at once; to re-arm,to maintain our standard of living and social services, to carry out our international commitments, to assist in overseas development and to maintain the sterlingsystem. At the same time, we have recently met a series of misfortunes, some ofthem outside the Governmenfs control; the rise in the cost of our imports, thefall in the prices of the main sterling area raw material exports and the loss ofAbadan. The result is that our economy has become seriously overloaded andthat we have no flexibility left to meet new calls upon us and, indeed, cannot meetthose which already exist. In consequence, we are faced with a continuing crisis,both internally and externally.6. The only way out of this is to put ourselves in a position to pay our way.We are unable at present to do this because we do not produce enough, because we do not export enough (or, alternatively, import too much) and because internalinflation keeps goods at home which should go abroad and, by raising prices,adversely affects our power to compete in world markets.7. There are, therefore, three aspects of the problem, all of which are inter-related, namely: (a) Balance of Payments.(b) Load on the Economy.(c) Inflation. &quot;&quot;By far the most urgent of these three is the balance of payments. The gravity ofthis problem reflects our failure to deal effectively with the problems of productionand inflation.The balance of payments8. The dimensions of the balance of payments problem can be easilysummarised. At the outset of the rearmament programme we set ourselves thetask of maintaining the gold and dollar reserves and of keeping a balance on currentUnited Kingdom account, excluding stockpiling. We have failed to an alarmingdegree on both these accounts. As regards the central gold and dollar reserveswe shall lose  550 million in the second half of this year and, even after the cutsand other measures referred to above and assuming no major loss in confidence,we estimate that we shall lose a further  300 million or so by the middle of 1952.Our reserves would then have reached the level they were at when we devalued, i.e., 500 million, and would have dropped in one year from a total of about- 1,350million. Furthermore, there is every indication that this trend will continue.9. So far as the United Kingdom balance of payments on current account isconcerned we had a deficit in the first half of this year of about  120 million, and inthe last six months, while our import programme has been running at a fairly high level, we shall have a deficit of no less than  450 million.10. It is quite clear from this that we have in.the past set our economic objectives too low, i.e., that we have not allowed enough margin to meet the risks towhich the United Kingdom is specially prone in view of its dependence upon imports and of its position as the central banker for the sterling area. Unless we allow forthese risks we shall bump along from one crisis to another; we must, therefore, as a normal feature of our economic life work for and attain a large surplus on UnitedKingdom current account.11. In these circumstances, our major objective must be to stop or reversethis trend of our balance of payments and in the gold and dollar reserves as soon aspossible. We cannot rely on economic aid from the United States to do this. Suchaid is a help but does not really alter the basic weakness and, in fact, in some waysmay increase it. We should expect naturally to get some help in this from the othermembers of the Sterling Area, but if we attain a surplus and get this help it will notbe too much to restore our position. .
: 12. But while this must be our aim we are nevertheless faced with an imme-diate problem. We can, if we take sufficiently strong decisions, overcome our diffi-culties in the medium and long term. But in the next six months or so we shall be faced with a situation of the utmost gravity which can be decisively affected onlyin one way, namely, by the full restoration of confidence. This must depend uponthe announcements which the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes in January and.. in the Budget about the Governments policies on economic affairs, It is essentialto restore confidence in order to enable the medium-term solutions to be worked out. We suggest, therefore, that the chancellors &quot;statement must comprise two things:        - .W\&apos;(a) We should definitely announce bur view that it is absolutely necessary forthe soundness of the United Kingdom economy and of the sterling areasystem for the United Kingdom to have a surplus on current account asa regular feature of its economic life.(b) Measures which we announce in January and in the Budget should be suchas to give both the people at home and countries abroad the confidence that we shall attain this objective.Load on the economy13. The main reason why we cannot export enough to close the external gapis the excessive load of home demand on the engineering and metal-using industries.We cannot sell any more consumer goods ov^seai&amp;for lack of customers. Wecannot sell more coal or raw materials because we are not producing enough. Onlythe engineering industries can provide the really substantial increase in exports we need. The production of these industries is held down by shortage of steel.Consequently, more for export means less for the home market. But the home market is demanding more, not less; primarily for defence, but also for investment and consumption. Unless the home demand is reduced, exports will fall insteadof rise. The cuts in investment and consumption which we propose in this paper will not by themselves be enough to allow our engineering exports to expandsufficiently. It will also be necessary to curtail very sharply the rate at whichdefence production by the metal-using industries is allowed to build up.14. Similarly, unless other users of steel are restricted, production in theengineering industries will fall instead of rise, and the export problem will be evenworse. The biggest claimant for more steel is the building industry. Here, again,there must be a sharp curtailment of the claims for steel made by this industry,both for civil investment and for defence works. With more steel, our production would be higher, and this would improve the output of the engineering and buildingindustries alike.Inflation .15. First, there is inflation of demand. The sum of what the Governmentis spending, what business firms are trying to spend on plant and buildings, and what consumers are able to buy from their incomes, adds up to more than the valueof the goods available to be bought. This leads to balance of payments difficultiesbecause the home market sucks in goods that we ought to export and does notoffset this by buying less imports. It also shows itself in a demand for more workersthan are available and is partly responsible for our difficulties in manning essential industries such as coal-mining and defence production. This pressure of demand is most acute in industries producing capital goods of all kinds, and this has beenmade worse by the steel shortage which is keeping down engineering productionbelow the capacity of the industry.:. 16, Second, there is the wage-price spiral. There is a serious danger thatthis will get out of hand. The index of weekly wage-rates rose from 111 in October1950 to 122 in October 1951. We are now working through a round of wage increases which will themselves lead to price increases, and so it may continue. Theindex of retail prices rose from 115 to. 129 in the last twelve months, and if it goes on at this rate the value of money will be called in question. We cannot hope tocure this by deflationary &quot;measures alone; it would mean creating more unemploy-ment than would be economically desirable or socially tolerable. Yet we mustcheck the trend, or we shall run into grave social disturbances either by the directeffects of runaway inflation or by the drastic measures that would be needed to stop it.
17, The problem is to devise a programme of action which includes sufficienthope and adequate correction of our present unbalance. So far, inevitably, theaction which we have announced has been mainly restrictive. Restrictive steps can. be taken soonest and have quickest results, but r^he history of the last five yearsshows that, by themselves^ &quot;they are not the answer, We hope to put forward proposals in due course which shall hold a&quot;:reasonable balance between thateconomy and retrenchment which we all agreed to be necessary, however painful,and those positive, measures which provide greater incentive &quot;to work, and^morepleasure in life;     ]&apos;.&apos;\    - &apos; ....    *       .*  - . .   .   718.. Given the short time at our.disposal we cannot yet- prcducesiich a&apos;balanced programme. We have carried some of/our work further than other parts.We do not wish our colleagues to judge it, until we&apos; can put it forward in balancedform.   Therefore, at this stage we present only an interim report, asking for decisions&quot;&quot;in some matters, but reserving others for later consideration.II.-The Work of the Sub-CommitteeProduction .19. The increase of production which is our central need depends not onlyon the tightening of the economy and the avoidance of waste which are the mainsubjects of this paper, but also on the creation of incentives to produce and on hopes of a not too distant reward for work. On this side of the problem we are pursuing.several lines of attack, and certain considerations on one, in particular, will be developed early by the Lord President. For the moment we confine ourselves tostressing two points.Coal20. First, our biggest single problem is the need to produce more coal.That is vital: unless we solve it we cannot hope to avoid one crisis after another in our internal economy and in our balance of payments. We have put this questionfirst of all those which we have considered. We urge that the Secretary of Statefor the Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, who is going to discuss theproblem with us, and the other Ministers concerned, should be given every possiblesupport in his task.Steel - &quot;&apos; .  -21. The second big production problem is steel.  Here the situation may alterif we can get steel from the United States. -       rExports &apos;      .y/^-;&apos;t&apos;.&apos;..&apos;-&quot;22. There is little hope of any substantial or permanent increase in exportsuntil the.other measures to which we refer have been taken and have had timeto take effect. A nation which is seeking to carry out a large defence programme,to maintain consumption-levels at home, and to sustain investment upon a scalebeyond its monetary and material resources, has little chance of increasing exportsat the same time-quite the contrary. Retrenchment at home is thus an essential feature of any export drive. Exhortation alone is not enough, and it would in ourview be a psychological mistake to launch any major campaign for increased exports until these other measures which are proposed have been announced. TheGovernment must establish and observe the principle that exports are a first charge on our resources.23. Our aim should be to build up the volume of exports by at least f 100million worth a year. It will clearly be difficult if not impossible to attain this figure during .1952-53. The problem differs between different types of goods. in engineering products there are shortages of steel and man-power which we hope to alleviate by the methods already described. With non-metal consumer goods theproblem is to find markets. A buyer&apos;s market has developed in textiles and compe-tition will increase. We Wish to draw attention to the serious handicaps underwhich the textile industry is labouring. The confusion which at present surroundspurchase tax, utility schemes and price-fixing in this industry has now reached apoint which impairs its competitive ability. Indeed, an important range of goods isunder, present conditions virtually excluded from manufacture, and the. whole industry is under the strain of a system of controls and taxes which bears little or norelation to present-day needs.&quot;       41592        - . -..   \    .   &apos;    c        ;&apos;&apos;.
24. Steps can be taken and in our view should be taken-to deal with this problem as a matter of urgency. They will involve legislation and will affect thepurchase tax. It is inconvenient, but it is possible, to bring in such legislationbefore the Budget. The advantage to the export trade of acting quickly is so great that we recommend that a Bill should be introduced in February. The Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade will put forward detailed proposals in a separate paper.. 25. . We must not overlook the contribution that the tourist industry can make,particularly in the dollar fields, to increased earnings. Further. Government action will be needed to help the industry.Investment and the metal-using industries26. We must reduce the overload on the engineering and metal-using indus-tries to which we have referred in paragraph 13 above. The probable gap, on present policies, between total home demand on the engineering industry and thesupplies available for home use, on the assumption that we shall get the engineeringexports which we need, will be  300 million per annum in 1952 and 1.953. Thisgap will be partly closed by economies in defence. The remainder will have to be closed by cuts in home consumption and investment.27. We recommend cutting the level of production of consumer goods for thehome market by the metal-using industries by  60 million per annum at 1950prices. We have examined a&apos; schedule of cuts in the various industries, and we propose that the Departments concerned should work out detailed proposals to bebrought into action as soon as possible.28. We recommend that home investment in engineering products should bereduced below the present level by  100 million per annum. Proposals are being prepared in the review of investment programmes which has now started.29. We must restrict the use of steel for other purposes, including building.We cannot provide as much steel for building as in 1950, and the load on theindustry must be limited accordingly. Officials have been instructed to work outplans on the assumption that the defence building programme (including civil defence, storage, communications and measures to maintain the civilian economy in war-time) will not exceed  90 million in 1952 at 1950 prices.30.  These cuts will raise big problems, particularly the cuts in the building programme.   They Will be brought before the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the- Exchequer in a separate paper.Man-power&apos;   31.  The Cabinet referred to us (C.C. (51) 13th Conclusions, Minute 2) theproposals of the Minister of Labour and National Service for a Control of Engage-ment Order and for labour supply inspection which are contained in his paper c. (51) 18. -These proposals will be a useful complement to our proposals and we,recommend that they should be adopted as soon as possible.Government Expenditure.32. Expenditure by the GovernmenFis one of the main causes of our over-loaded economy. Where,the expenditure is on scarce services or commodities(e.g., building), it is particularly important. But every penny saved from the Govern-ment&apos;s net outgoing helps to reduce the claims on the country&apos;s production.Defence expenditure is being dealt with elsewhere. But we must also reduce ourcivil expenditure substantially. Unless it is checked, it will rapidly increase, both because of the natural growth of developing services, such as the National health service and Education, and because of the increases in prices and wages.33. - We have spent a; good deal of time on examining Government expen-diture. In consultation with the Ministers concerned we have gone in detail intothe National Health Service and Education, and we have discussed more briefly theestimates for 1952-53 for Agriculture, Works Services, Information Services, CivilAviation and the Board of Trade. We have also considered the question of CivilService numbers. Nevertheless, we are not yet ready to put our proposals tothe Cabinet. There is no means of cutting back expenditure substantially with-out big changes of policy, and before proposing such changes we wish to consider,the various possibilities in rather more detail.  Further, it is most important to have
a balanced programme of retrenchment. It is impossible for any Minister to defend .restrictions on financial grounds of the services for which he is responsible unless he can show that other services are being similarly treated.34. We can, at this stage, give some idea of the scope of the problem. TheChancellor has received from the Departments at least the totals of their estimates for the year 1952-53. These figures are provisional only, but when they are corn-pared with this year&apos;s estimates they show the natural increase of services of civil expenditure. This table shows the total of the sums for which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer is being asked. It excludes all defence expenditure, broadly inter-preted: it does not include the figures for Civil Defence or for strategic reserves,or for the &quot;civil &quot; expenditure of the Ministry of Supply, most of which is closelyallied to defence expenditure. The National Health Service and Education (the subjects which we have gone into in greatest detail) are put forward not at thefigures which the Ministers concerned have suggested (since they and we alwaysrecognised that economies would be needed) but at the figures to which they would rise if there were no major changes of policy. Food subsidies are put at 410 million, as last year.	1951-52	1952-53	 million	  millionNational Health Service ...     ...	-    398	417Education......      ...	228	251Other Social Services    ...	418	438All Social Services  ....	1,044	1,106Food Subsidies   ...     ...	410	410Other Services   ...	486	486	.     1,940	2,00235. Naturally we do not accept the figures put forward by Departments, andnot yet examined, as being an indication of the amount which will be put beforeParliament in the Estimates. Very substantial economies are needed and (withthe assistance which Ministers have given us) we already see our way to some ofthem. The Chancellor will secure many others in the course of his ordinaryexamination of the Estimates. In our view he must be able to say when he makeshis statement to the House in January that he is reducing civil expenditure (as defined above) substantially below the figure for 1951-52, and up to  100 millionbelow what it would be if there had been no change of policy, i.e., the figure shouldbe reduced from about  2,000 million to something approaching  1,900 million.This cannot be done without cuts in social service expenditure; about  40 million will have to be found from the health service, about  20 million from education and the other  40 million from other civil expenditure.36. Costs will be higher next year than this by about 10 per cent. Expendi-ture over the range of civilian expenditure has been steadily increasing over recentyears by something approaching  lOOjnillion a year, in spite of all that has beendone to check it. Therefore it would be a greater achievement to keep expenditurestationary or slightly dropping than appears on the face of the figures; in a timeof rising prices and wages revenue will also rise. ...Civil Service Numbers. 37, We have agreed to a proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer thathe should secure over the next few months a reduction of 7,000 in the staffs (at&quot;present 301,600) of Civil Departments other than the Post Office. This would saveabout  3 million a year. Further reductions-perhaps up to 15,000 or 20,000 will be made over a longer period, though we recognise that this will involve a curtailment of services. Appropriate reductions of staff should also be made bythe Service and Supply Departments, the Foreign Service, and the Post Office.Fiscal Measures38. It would be possible to bring forward some fiscal measures in January;for example, the Excess Profits Tax. This would mean a Finance Bill, which wouldbe hard to deal with at that season.  In general we concur with the view of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that, except for the legislation affecting purchase tax: which we have referred to in paragraph 24 above, such measures should be reservedfor the next normal Finance Bill. 1The wage-price spiral39. We have referred, in paragraph 16, to the great danger of the wage-pricespiral. Something can be done by the measures we have proposed and by othermonetary action, but., this will take time and will not remove the favourablebargaining position of the Trade Unions. Some steps must be taken to explain the situation to the country and to get that general co-operation in dealing with theproblem which is the only alternative to drastic deflation. The Chancellor thereforeproposes, and we agree, that a draft should be prepared which would set out thewhole problem in simple language and which, if the Cabinet approve it, might bepublished as a White Paper. The Minister of Labour and National Service wouldbe willing to join in sponsoring the paper and to discuss jt with his Joint AdvisoryCouncil. Such a document should lead to wide discussion and to the creation ofa public opinion in which the problem could be managed. It would help theChancellor if he could refer to this document when he makes his statement inJanuary. There are many difficulties in such a statement, but they can be considered when the draft is before the Cabinet.
