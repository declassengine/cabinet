GF I-liC BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;C GOVERITivIENT)CONFIDENTIAL.0.(51) 61 - COPY NO.24TH DaCEivIBSR,-1951   .    &apos; ;-AriT.r^; - *.....*-&quot;&apos; -- ------- ^/J-i.^,ll^ljlj 1ASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA , &apos;&apos; Memorandum by the I/.inister of Labour and National service the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations has raised again the question whether we should put an end to our obligation to pay up to 500,000 a year under the Assisted Passage Agreement with Australia.2. To do so would save money but there are disadvantages which ought to point out to my colleagues before a decision is made.    Our policy should, I assume, be to help the Commonwealth to get emigrants from GreatBritain but at the same time to avoid losing too much man-power of partic-ular types of which we stand in need, e. g. in the coal mines, brickyards,farms, foundries and engineering workshops.3. By the terms of the existing agreement, under which the paymentis made, my Department has a recognised right to intervene,... This takes the form of scrutiny of Australian publicity material, of consultation aboutrecruitment programmes especially for types of man-power in short supply, of examination of individual applications for passage assistance andof a detailed analysis of workers who are given passages under the scheme.If the agreement were ended, this right would be lost.4. Australia&apos;3 power of attracting our people shows no sign ofdiminishing.    In 194G, the figura of British migrants she received was34,445;  in 1949 the figure incr... :ased to 53,059; in 1950 it was 54,104;&apos; andin the first half of 1951 it v/as 32,858. . Approximately two-thirds of thesemigrants.have had Government assistance, and it.&apos;is estimated that more than half the &quot;breadwinners&quot; (as distinct from families and dependants) have beenskilled workers.    The potential impact, therefore, of Australian migrationpolicy on our man-power, not only in the skilled categories but in importantunskilled categories, would in the absence of come form of reasonable -eea-*-.-troi, be sharp and hard to resist.    .5. At present we can make our wishes known and these wishes mustbe respected by the Australians if the benefits of an agreement which theygreatly value are to continue.    Nole we hear^Hhat the Australians mean tobe more selective.    They are to concentrate on single men who are skilled workers in the engineering, electrical and metal trades and, if possible, oncoaLniners.    If this agreement goes, it will be difficult to control this trend.Cur experience with the Canadians, with whom we have no agreement,illustrates this; they are at present extending their migration operations inthis country and we may have to face more determined and selective recruit&quot;ment of&apos;our man-power from them also.6.        &apos; i hope, therefore, that my colleagues will weigh the advantages of going Oh with the agreement against the comparatively modest economy which could be effected by ending it.rAinistry&apos;of Labour and National Cervice,C.W.1,24T--I DECEMBER, 1951.
