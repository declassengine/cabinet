Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1951. [ Copy No.CABINET   :-CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues the draft of anAgreement on General Relations to be concluded between the United Kingdom,France, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. This draft hasbeen negotiated in Germany by the High Commissioners of the three Powers withthe German Federal Chancellor, on the basis of the instructions given to theHigh Commissioners by the three Foreign Ministers after their meeting in washington last September. With the exception of one provision (Article V,paragraph 6), it is an agreed draft and has now been referred to the four Govern-ments for consideration. It is likely to be discussed at the meeting which theForeign Ministers of the three Occupying Powers are to have with Dr. Adenauerin Paris on Thursday, 22nd November.2. I consider the draft generally acceptable and have given my provisional approval to it.  3. On the other hand this General Agreement is only a part of the wholesettlement to be concluded with the German Federal Republic. Work is still proceeding on related conventions, which will form an integral part of the wholeagreement. These will deal in more detail with important questions such as thestatus and protection of Allied forces in Germany, the transfer to the german authorities of existing Allied responsibilities, the financial implications of theproposed settlement, including a German defence contribution, and the procedure for the settlement of disputes. Moreover, the proposed contractual agreement isalso intimately related to the proposal for German participation in the european defence Community, on which negotiations are likewise still proceeding in theEuropean Defence Conference in Paris.. 4. I consider therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be finallycommitted to the present draft agreement until the related conventions have been negotiated and it is possible to see the proposed settlement as a whole. I have instructed the United Kingdom High Commissioner in this sense and prooose toadopt the same attitude in any discussion I may have on this question withdraw.
