This position persisted until the middle of 1950when general steel and alloy steel were freed from distribution control asthey were in ample supply.   Sheet steel and tinplate supplies v/ere stillinadequate and are still under distribution control. .2. In 1950 we had 12. 93 million tons of finished steel for home use and export.   It is estimated that in 1952 we shall have 12. 78 million tonsinclusive of imports,   in this calculation 400,000 ingot tons of importsfrom the United States are assumed, 900,000 ingot tons ofjmports from elsewhere, and 16 million ingot tons of home production^/ Against thissmaller supply we have much increased requirements.   Defence require-ments will be three times as high as in 1950, the building programme is10 per cent higher, the home demand for plant and machinery is  140 millionshigher, and the state of the balance of payments makes it very desirable toincrease the level of exports of metal goods above 1950 levels.   There hasbeen some increase in the demand for steel in other sectors of the economy,such as the coal mines and the railways, and there is no substantial cushionof inessential uses.3, It is impossible to assess accurately the gap between the supplies and the minimum essential demand but there is no doubt that we have ashortage of at least one million tons and that for a reasonable life weshould require lj million tons more than we got last year from home production and imports.4. The steel shortage first became acute in the middle of 1951.As immediate measures, exports of finished steel were cut, a &quot;D.O. &quot;system of priorities was introduced to protect defence orders.   A limitedsystem for civil orders was also introduced in an effort to deal with non-defence cases where important production was held up by comparatively small amounts of steel.   The priority systems have eased some difficulties but have created new difficulties by repercussion.   The task of dealing with these difficulties by administrative measures has becomeunmanageable.   Industries seriously affected include the engineering industry, mining, rail transport, shipbuilding, electricity generation, and food distribution.5. The Labour Government consulted the Iron and Steel Federation,who agreed that an allocation scheme was necessary, and also consulted theNational Production Advisory Council for Industry and the Federation ofBritish Industries regarding the type of scheme to be introduced.   they then announced that a distribution scheme would be introduced with effect
from the 3rd December.   This is not now practicable as at least eight weeks will be needed after allocations to Departments have been decidedto enable licences -to be issued to firms and firms to validate orders.Industry is, however, anxious to know if there is to be any modification in the arrangements.   I am advised that, if decisions on the allocation are reached by the end of November, the earliest date by which the allocationschemes for general steel and alloy steel could be brought into effect isthe 1st February, 1952.   The schemes for sheet steel and tinplate would continue on their present basis for the time being but consideration can begiven to their simplification at a later stage.   I have consulted theMinister of Supply, who would administer the scheme, and the other ministers whose Departments receive large allocations.  All agree that an allocation is necessary and that an announcement of our intention to&quot;introduce it should be made as soon as possible.6. Unpleasant though it is, it seems to me inescapable that weshould introduce these allocation schemes at the earliest feasible date.I arn advised that this will not cause immediate difficulties for industry,provided that firms are given sufficient time between the date they receive their licences and the effective start of the allocation to give themample opportunity to validate their orders with steel makers.7. . I now invite my colleagues to agree:-((a)   to the introduction of schemes of allocation and distributioncontrol for general steel and alloy steel;(b) to an announcement in the sense in the Annex.   This is agreed with the Minister of Supply, who would make the announcement;(c) to the issue of a Statutory Order by *he Minister of Supplyreimposing distribution control of general steel and alloysteel as from the 1st February.If this is approved I shall put forward as soon as possible recommendations as to the distribution of steel, which raises certain substantial questionsof policy.S.Cabinet Office, S. W.T.,9TH NOVEMBER, 1951.
ANNEXOUTLINE DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT ON STEELALLOCATIONOn the 28th June the House was informed by the then Chancellor.  .        &apos;    &apos; &apos;   ..   -of the Exchequer that it was intended to introduce controlled distribution&apos; &apos;   : &apos; :- &apos;of the main forms of steel not already under control, and that a preferential system was being introduced to ensure that in the meantimedefence orders were met and to enable Departments to deal in the civilfield with serious production difficulties caused by the lack of comparatively small amounts of steel.   Subsequently it was announced thata distribution scheme for carbon steel would be introduced from3rd December, and that a further announcement would be made aboutalloy steel.The Government have now reviewed the position.   The prospects for 1952 are that the steel shortage will persist.   There is no doubt thatthe shortage is interfering with supplies of steel for a variety of essential purposes and that uncertainty of supply is a serious handicapto industry.-   -In the circumstances we have decided to go forward with theallocation scheme.   Some delay in the introduction of the scheme is howeverinevitable.   Sufficient time must be given to allow industry to adjustorders and production schedules in the light of the authorisations to beissued.to consumers.   We propose therefore to bring the scheme intooperation on 1st February, 1952.   I intend to make an Order accordinglycovering general steel and alloy steel.   Meanwhile the preferential system will be continued.
