November 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   gC.(51)1L.. &apos; .9th November, 1951 \CABINETCLOSER ASSOCIATION IN CENTRAL africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Secretary of State for the ColoniesWeffecbmmerid that His Majesty&apos;s Government should issue a statement (as inAppendix I) strongly endorsing the proposed Federation of Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The last Government failed to give a lead toopinion.2. Federation will be of the greatest advantage economically, and is likely toprovide the only effective means of resisting Afrikaner pressure on these territories.3. The situation following the recent Victoria Falls Conference has reached a point at which the legislatures and public opinion in the countries concerned areawaiting a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. In our view this should be made as soon as possible and before the Secretaryof State for the Colonies goes to Malaya.5. White public opinion in all three territories is generally in favour. On theother hand the Africans have declared their opposition. The strength of this was partly due to the lack of a lead from the last Government, which allowed the opponents of the proposals, to &quot;misrepresent them.6. African interests are fully secured by the proposal that there should be a minister for African Affairs, ultimately responsible to the United Kingdom Govern-ment, and by the retention by the existing territorial governments of subjects most closely affecting Africans.7. The fears expressed in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland against completeamalgamation - are met by the assurance that no amalgamation will take place without the consent of the inhabitants of the three territories.8. There is a good chance of winning over the African opposition by HisMajesty&apos;s Government giving them a firm lead, but little or no chance otherwise.The statement proposes that a conference should be held in London in mid-1952 toreach final decisions.  By that time we hope African fears will have been allayed.9. Our views are set forth more fully in Appendix II, of which paragraph 13outlines the steps which we think should now be taken. The conclusions of the victoria Falls Conference are reproduced in Appendix III.10. . To sum up, we seek approval of the draft statement now proposed(Appendix I) and of the steps necessary to carry the scheme forward.- .   &apos;, . -       . - -&quot; &apos; -&apos;;&apos;     i.    . ;-&apos; - , &apos; &apos;\; &apos; o.

-      APPENDIX I . ..    Draft Statement on Central African Federation in the House of CommonsHis Majesty&apos;s Government are. convinced of the urgent, need to secure the-closer association of the three Central African territories; and they believe that\    this-would be best, be achieved by federation, which they regard as the only formof closer association likely to meet the requirements of Central Africa.-- \.: As the House.will be aware, anConference attended by my predecessorand the former Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, and by representa-.tives of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. was held at victoria falls in September to consider the scheme for federation of the three territoriesput forward by the London Conference of officials last March.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have studied the statement issued at theconclusion of the Victoria Falls Conference (of which I will circulate a copy withthe Official Report) and are in full agreement with it. In their view the recom-mendations of the London Conference of officials achieve the two essential aims&apos;of any scheme of closer association; they provide effective and representativemachinery, both executive and legislative, for the handling of common central african problems, and they contain full and adequate safeguards for african interests. His Majesty&apos;s Government would accordingly favour a scheme of federa-tion between the three territories on the general lines recommended in the officials&apos;report; they believe that such a scheme would be in the best interests of the Africanas well as the other inhabitants of the territories. They recognise that african opinion in the two northern territories has declared itself opposed to the proposals in the officials&apos; report; but they trust that, in the light of the assurances agreed uponat the Victoria Falls Conference, arid of the economic and other advantages of closer association, Africans will be prepared to accept them.   .4.. The assurances agreed upon at the Victoria Falls Conference are in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government of great importance. It was unanimously agreed that, in any further consideration of proposals for federation, land and land settlement questions, as well as the political advancement of the peoples ofNorthern Rhodesia and: Nyasaland, both in local and in territorial government,must remain as at present (subject to the ultimate authority of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom) the responsibility of the territorial governments and Legislatures in each territory and not of any federal authority. It was alsounanimously agreed that the Protectorate status of the two northern territories should be accepted and preserved; and that this excluded any consideration now or in. the future of the amalgamation of the three Central African territories unless a majority of the inhabitants of the three territories desired it. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment fully endorse these conclusions and in any federal scheme would ensure that these rights should be formally embodied in the constitution. HisMajesty&apos;s Government take the view that the statement of the Victoria Falls/Conference which excludes amalgamation of the three Central African territories. without the consent of a majority of the inhabitants should apply equally to amai-gamation of any two of the territories or any part of them.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish finally to draw attention to two otherconclusions of the Victoria Falls Conference. First, there was general agreement that economic and political partnership between Europeans and Africans is theonly policy under which federation could be brought about in the conditions of central Africa, and that any scheme of closer association would have to give full effect to that principle. Second, the Conference expressed grave concern at the dangers-which would flow from any weakening or dilution of the British connectionand British traditions and principles in the three territories and agreed that they. should be so strengthened as to ensure that they should continue to prevail. His: Majesty&apos;s Government regard these conclusions as of the utmost importance.v:, 6. His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious that there should be no delay in reaching final conclusions on the future relations of the Central African territories.The Victoria Falls Conference agreed that before decisions could be taken by governments further discussion within each territory and between the four Govern-ments would be required. The Conference therefore adjourned and expressed the:   hope that it could reassemble in London about the middle of 1952. His Majesty&apos;s
Government endorse this hope and propose that the resumed Conference shouldtake place about July of next year. They will do all that they can to help ensurethat the intervening period is used to the best advantage for the necessary discussions&apos;in Central Africa. &apos;   .APPENDIX memorandum on Closer Association in Central AfricaFor a number of years the closer association of Southern Rhodesia, northern rhodesia and Nyasaland has been under consideration; but no solution has beenreached,&quot; largely because the United Kingdom Government has not been preparedto give a lead to public opinion in Central Africa. We are convinced that closer association of the three territories is an urgent necessity and that this should takethe form of federation. Our reasons are given below; put briefly, we consider thatthe economic case for federation is a very strong one indeed, and that from thepolitical point of view the creation of a strong British bloc in Central Africa isnecessary to enabie us to resist Afrikaner pressure on these territories. We,aretherefore anxious to give the necessary lead by declaring ourselves strongly infavour of federation; an opportunity for this is presented by the recent victoria falls Conference attended by our predecessors, on which we must make a statement.We would propose that the statement should be made in the House of commons and that the text should be on the general lines of the draft contained inAppendix I. For psychological reasons we think it important that the statement should be made at the earliest possible date and we very much hope that our colleagues will agree that this should be done before the Secretary of State for theColonies leaves for Malaya on 26th November.2. The background to this matter is as follows. In March of this year aconference of senior officials of the United Kingdom, Southern Rhodesia, northern rhodesia and Nyasaland Governments met in London and agreed unanimouslythat closer association between the three territories ought to be brought about andthat this should be done by federation. The report of the officials&apos; conference(Cmd. 8233) put forward a detailed scheme designed to meet the special features of the Central African situation, including the self-governing status of SouthernRhodesia and the need to provide substantial safeguards for African interests.Under this scheme functions affecting the external relations of Central Africa and services which transcend territorial boundaries would be the responsibility of thefederal Government and Legislature, while services most closely affecting the life of Africans would remain the responsibility of the territorial Governments andLegislatures. Within the territorial sphere the Northern Rhodesia and NyasalandGovernments would remain responsible, as at present, to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom. In publishing this report for public consideration and discussion on 13th June, the United Kingdom Government commended the report as a constructive approach to the problem, but made it clear that it was at that stagenot committed to acceptance of any of the proposals.3. In August and September Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Gordon Walker visitedCentral Africa to consult with public opinion. Mr. Griffiths spent three weeks inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and held over eighty meetings with Europeans,Africans and others. Mr. Gordon Walker spent a week in Southern Rhodesia and discussed the problem with the Southern Rhodesia Government and a number of representative people. The reactions of public opinion to the proposals as expressed to Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Gordon Walker were as follows. In Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland African opinion was almost unanimously opposed to the proposals,largely through unjustified fears of the consequences which would follow if theywere adopted; European opinion was generally in favour. In Southern Rhodesiaopinion was divided; a majority of European opinion was in favour of closer association, although many of them would prefer amalgamation to federation. TheSouthern Rhodesia Government was prepared to come out in favour of federation,although there were certain detailed points in the officials&apos; report with which theydid not agree. - ;&quot;41425 ^2
- .4.. In view of these differences of opinion it was not possible to reach definite conclusions afthe Victoria Falls Conference, at which Mr. Griffiths and Mr. gordon walker discussed the problem with representatives of the three territories at theend of their tour.  But, since the two Secretaries of State and all three Central. African Governments were most anxious to keep the federation proposals alive, itwas agreed that further discussion within the territories and between the four governments would be needed before final decisions could be reached by theGovernments. The Conference therefore adjourned and expressed the hope thatthey could reassemble in London about the middle of 1952. The Conference, withthe exception of the African representatives but including the two Secretaries ofState, declared itself in favour of the principle of federation. There was unanimous agreement on the necessity for maintaining and strengthening British traditions in central Africa against dangers from outside a reference to Afrikaner pressure which will have been understood by the public. There was also unanimous agree-ment. on certain necessary safeguards for African interests in any scheme of federation which may be considered; this part of the conclusions should be helpful in the further discussions to be held with Africans in the northern territories.5. In a report of their visit left on record by Mr. Griffiths and Mr. gordon walker for consideration after the General Election they strongly recommendedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should now declare themselves in favour of thefederal scheme. . &apos;.6. In reaching conclusions in this matter there are three points which we must decide&apos;: -(1) Is closer association necessary?(2) If so, what form should it take?(3) How should we proceed in the matter?Is closer association necessary ?7. From the economic point of view there are the strongest arguments infavour of closer association. The economies of the Central African territories arelinked by a common port at Beira for all three of them; a common railway system for the two Rhodesias; the. dependence of copper mining in Northern Rhodesiaon coal from Southern Rhodesia; the dependence of the two Rhodesias on man-power from Nyasaland; and the Zambesi and Shire river basin with its greatpotentialities for the development of hydro-electric power on a Central Africanbasis. A vast effort of economic development will be needed if food supplies areto be adequate for the growing population and living standards are to be progres-sively improved. This development ought to proceed on a Central African basisso that the resources of the whole region may best be devoted to economicadvancement. Experience over the past few years has shown that these matterscannot effectively be handled simply by co-operation between the three existingGovernments;.the only effective method of dealing with them is by a single federalauthority answerable to a single Central African legislature.- . 8. From the political point of view the need for closer association is even more urgent. Immigration from the Union of South Africa into the two Rhodesias isalmost double that from the United Kingdom and there is no doubt that Afrikanerimmigration is being actively encouraged in certain quarters in the Union. A newparty, which is in fact an Afrikaner party, has recently been formed in SouthernRhodesia. In Northern Rhodesia the position is still more serious and, unlesseffective action is taken, it is probable that at the next General Election in 1953Afrikaners will obtain half the European seats on the Northern Rhodesia LegislativeCouncil. Southern Rhodesia has &quot;already tightened up its immigration control andNorthern Rhodesia is shortly to do the same. But immigration control is not sufficient by itself to resist encroachment by the Union. We are faced in central africa with pressure by a country far stronger economically and industrially than any of the ;Central African, territories, led by a militant Nationalist party, withexpansionist . aims, anxious to strengthen its influence in the north. this pressure can be countered only by an equally firm policy of resistance to it both inthe politicaland in the economic spheres, a policy which, in our view, has little chance of succeeding unless we can establish a British bloc of territories in central africa knit together by constitutional ties. The danger to British interests at presentassailing the Central African territories cannot be too strongly emphasised.Positive steps must be taken to resist it and by far the most effective step would beactive support for federation by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
9. For these reasons our firm conclusion is that closer association of the threeCentral African territories is an urgent necessity. .&apos; &apos;     &apos; - &apos; &apos;      - &apos;What form should closer association take ? &apos;.-:   m-. -.       :10. Complete amalgamation of the three territories would have the merit ofsimplicity and many Europeans would prefer it to federation; but most responsiblepeople in Central Africa to-day realise that amalgamation is not practical politics.The Victoria Falls Conference unanimously agreed that any consideration now orin the future of amalgamation of the three territories should be excluded unless amajority of the inhabitants of all the territories desired it. The Southern RhodesiaMinisters and representatives of Europeans in Northern Rhodesia in subscribingto this statement knew, of course, that there was no chance of Africans agreeing to amalgamation at any time in the near future. Amalgamation would involve the absorption of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in a combined territory with a self-governing constitution broadly on the lines of the present Southern Rhodesiaconstitution, the bringing to an end of the Protectorate status of the two northern territories and the abrogation of the present control of the United Kingdom Govern-ment and Parliament over policy in these two territories. It would be bitterly andviolently opposed by African opinion in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and inour view would be quite unjustifiable. The same would apply to amalgamation ofthe two Rhodesias or the absorption of any part of Northern Rhodesia by SouthernRhodesia. &apos; , . &apos;..-.&apos;...11. On the other hand, federation on the lines recommended in the officials&apos;report would leave the three territories with their own Governments and Legislaturesdealing with the subjects most closely affecting the lives of the people; and withinthe territorial sphere the United Kingdom Government and Parliament would retain their existing control over policy in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Weare convinced that federation is the right solution and that the scheme put forward by the conference of officials is well adapted to the conditions of Central Africa.Certainly federation is the only form of closer association to which there is any chance of securing African agreement or acquiescence. We believe also that, given a lead by us, Europeans throughout Central Africa would accept a federal scheme.How should we proceed in the matter?   . -12. Because of the pressure from the south we are anxious that final decisions on federation should be reached without undue delay. Nevertheless, we are sure that it would be wrong to attempt to force the proposals through now against thepresent African opposition in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. If we did this weshould provoke bitter and possibly violent opposition, in the two Protectorates;moreover, we should have a considerable section of European opinion in central africa, particularly in Nyasaland, against us. If, on the other hand, we make afurther attempt to persuade Africans and then seek to settle the matter at the 1952London Conference-a course which the Southern Rhodesia Government andpublic opinion generally in Central Africa is expecting we shall have the advantageof accepting what was agreed by the Victoria Falls Conference, including the african representatives, and of following the recommendations of our two predecessors.We may not be able to avoid controversy, but we can at least reduce it to theminimum. We are sure that a further attempt at persuasion must be made. Wecannot promise that this will succeed; but if it is to have any chance of success weare strongly advised by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland thatit must be preceded by a definite statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government in favourof federation, which ought to be made at the earliest possible moment. Since sucha statement will be primarily designed to win over Africans, it must deal fully withthe safeguards for African interests and, in suitable terms, with the danger ofAfrikaner pressure. It is with that in view that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft announcement in Appendix I have been included. ,    . .     -. 13. We accordingly recommend that the following action should be taken: -r-(1) A statement in the terms of Appendix I should be made in the House of.: Commons before 26th November endorsing the conclusions of the&apos;Victoria Falls Conference and declaring His Majesty&apos;s governments view that there is an urgent need for the closer association of the Central.&apos;. . African territories; that this should take the form of federation; and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would favour a scheme on the general linesof the report of\the London Conference of officials.,. . ,  ,
(2j- The Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should be authorised .to arrange further discussions on the proposals with Africans in the two territories on the basis of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ statement.(3) The discussions proposed in paragraph 5 of the final communique of the* Victoria Falls Conference (see Appendix III) between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the three Central African Governments, or betweenthe three Central African Governments themselves, should be under-taken with the object of elucidating points of detail in the officials&apos;report in preparation for the London Conference.-       &apos; - &apos; -     &quot;       -       &quot;. L.     * , .0. L.9th November, 1951.APPENDIX IIIVictoria Falls Conference on Closer Association of Central african territories: The Victoria Falls Conference issued the following communique after its finalmeeting on Friday, 21st September:  The present Conference was convened by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland for the purposeof discussing the question of Closer Association of the British territories in central africa.The Conference opened at Victoria Falls on Tuesday, 18th September, and was of a representative character. In the case of Southern Rhodesia the representativesincluded the Prime Minister and other Ministers, and leaders of the opposition parties in Parliament. In the case of Northern Rhodesia the delegation consisted ofthe Governor and official and unofficial members of the Legislative Council,including Africans. Nyasaland was represented by the Governor, senior officials and leading unofficial persons, European and African. The United kingdom delegation consisted of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for Common-wealth Relations, accompanied by some of their Chief Advisers,The Conference had before it the Report prepared last March by a numberof senior official advisers of the four Governments concerned. The authors of that report had been requested &quot; to examine the problem in all its aspects and considerwhether it is possible, in the light of this examination, for them to formulateproposals for a further advance to be made in,the Closer Association of the threeCentral African territories which they could recommend to the Governments ofthese territories and to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.&quot; their work was purely exploratory and did not commit any of the participating Govern-ments to the adoption of any proposals that they.might formulate.The Report of the London Conference of officials was unanimous on all points.Its main recommendation was that closer association between the three territoriesought to be brought about and that the need for this is urgent. It recommended,further, that this should be done, not by amalgamation of the territories but ona federal basis, and put forward in some detail a scheme framed to take particularaccount of the special features of the Central African situation, including the self-governing status of Southern Rhodesia, and designed to provide substantial safe-guards for the interests of Africans. Moreover, those matters most closely affectingthe life of Africans would under the proposals in the Report come within theterritorial and not within the federal sphere, and within the territorial spherethe Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland Governments would remain responsible asat present to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.In announcing the present Conference it has from the outset been made clearthat there was no intention of reaching decisions at it binding on any Government.It was realised that such a Conference might disclose points of difference withregard to the principle of federation as well as to the proposals made in Reportto bring it into being. This has proved to be the case. It has become evident that further discussion within each territory and exchanges of views between the four governments will be necessary, and the Conference has therefore adjourned.
It is hoped that the position can be sufficiently clarified to enable the conference to reassemble in London about the middle of next year.On the main question of federation as so far presented and examined, theConference, with the exception of the African representatives, showed itselffavourable to the principle of federation. The representatives of African interestsin Northern Rhodesia explained that Africans would be willing to consider thequestion of federation on the basis of the Report of the London Conference of officials after the policy of partnership in Northern Rhodesia had been defined, andas so defined put into progressive operation.There was general agreement in the Conference that economic and politicalpartnership between Europeans and Africans is the only policy under whichfederation could be brought about in the conditions of Central Africa, and it was recognised that any scheme of closer association would have to give full effect tothat principle.The Conference was gravely concerned at the dangers which would flow fromany weakening or dilution of the British connection and British traditions and principles in the three territories, and agreed that they should so be strengthenedas to ensure that they should continue to prevail.The Conference recognised the advantages which if an acceptable scheme with adequate safeguards for all could be agreed upon would arise from the commonhandling of problems that transcend territorial boundaries, such as communications,research, defence, higher education and the planning of economic development.It has, however, been made clear at the Conference that one of the mainobstacles to the general acceptance of federation rests in the apprehensions felt byAfricans in the two Northern territories that federation might impair their positionand prospects in the respective territories.The Conference agreed that in any further consideration of proposals for federation-(I) The Protectorate status of the two Northern territories would be accepted and preserved. This, therefore, excludes any consideration now or in. the future of amalgamation of the three territories unless a majority ofthe inhabitants of all three territories desired it.(II) Land and land-settlement questions in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandmust remain, as at present (subject to the ultimate authority of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom), the responsibility ofthe territorial Government and legislature in each territory and not of any federal authority. - The land rights of the African people inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland must remain secured in accordancewith the existing Orders in Council on the subject.(Ill) The political advancement of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, both in local and territorial Government, must remain as atpresent (subject to the ultimate authority of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom), the responsibility of the Government&apos; andLegislature of each territory, and not of any federal authority.It was further agreed that if any form of closer association is eventually decidedbh, all these rights should be enshrined as an integral part of the constitution the Conference did not reach the stage of discussing the constitution and powers of the Federal Parliament, but the Southern Rhodesian delegation intimated that there were certain points in the Report as written with which they do not agree and which should be discussed with all concerned before the resumedConference is held. These points would not weaken the powers of the territoriallegislatures referred to in paragraph (II) above.The Conference understood that other delegations might also have reservationson points in the report as written.
