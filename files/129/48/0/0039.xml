For the soldiers who fell in the 1944-45 campaigns there will be memorialsat Bayeux (Normandy) and Nijmegen (advance to the Rhine and into Germany).4. For the soldiers who fell in 1939-40 the Commission propose to erect, ona site adjacent to the British war graves in Dunkirk Cemetery, a memorial on which about 4,600 names would be inscribed. For this purpose the Commission have about  23,000 available.Before they proceeded with this, the Commission felt that the government might wish to consider whether a more noteworthy memorial should be erectedwhich, besides recording the names of the missing soldiers, would stand as a nationalmemorial of the Dunkirk operation. For such the Commission estimate theywould require a special grant of from  60,000 to  100,000, according to the siteselected and the character of the memorial.5. I invite my colleagues to decide whether the Commission Should proceedwith the more modest memorial, or whether a grant should be made to providea national memorial.A.
