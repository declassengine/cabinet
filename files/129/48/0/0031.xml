COPY.NO.28TH NOVEMBER, 1951 . &quot; &apos; &apos; CABINET- CONTROL OF.IMPORTED CIVILIAN-LABOUR IN EGYPT - -Memorandum-by the Secretary of State for WarA question of great urgency has arisen in the Canal Zone regardingthe control of civilian labour, which is being imported in large numbers,mainly from Cyprus and Malta, but to some extent from other countries such as Jordan. (Palestinian refugees), Cyrenaica and Greece, owing to theloss of some 80 per cent of the Egyptian labour in the Zone through the actions of the Egyptian Government.2. This labour is, of course, subject to Egyptian law except in so faras we claim immunity for it under the Immunities Convention, but forobvious reasons we cannot now contemplate handing over for trial byEgyptian Courts persons so imported v/ho commit offences.    If, however,we are to keep discipline among them and have an answer/er to inevitablecomplaints by the Egyptian Government we must try offenders among thernourselves.    Since the abolition of the Consular Courts there are no Courtsws can use except Courts-Martial.3. V/hen troops are on active service, civilians employed by oraccompanying them are subject to military law and can be tried by&quot; Court-Martial under the Army Act for criminal offences committed by them whichwould normally be tried in a civil Court if available, and if the troops in the suez Canal Zone were now actually on active service the Commander-in- ;Chief would have all the powers he needs.    They are, however, at presenthot de facto on active service under Section 189(1), Army Act, but deemedto be on active service by virtue of a declaration made in March, 1948, andrenewed every three months by the Commander-in-Chief with the consentof my predecessors under Section 189(2), and the Law Officers have advised that it would not be safe to interpret the relevant sections of theArmy Act as making these civilians subject to military law as if thetroops were actually on active service.    It has therefore been proposedthat a short Bill, for the removal of doubt, should be introduced immediately and passed through all its stages before the Christmas Recess,   A copy ofthe draft Bill is annexed.4. Unless we can get this Bill through before the House rises theCommander-in-Chief will shortly have on his hands 10,000 or moreCypriots etc., among whom there are almost certain to be crimes of violence, with no powers of arrest or punishment, and no means of getting the legislation for another ten weeks at least.    This is a most seriousprospect, and the Commander-in-Chief is naturally very anxious about it.5. In view of the urgency, I brought the draft Bill up before theLegislation Committee yesterday,     but the Committee, while fullyrealising the urgency and seriousness of the situation, felt that it was amatter which the Cabinet must consider, having regard to the issues involved, particularly the fact that not only Cypriots and Maltese, but.
foreigners of various nationalities including-Egyptians in our employwould be held subject to military law and liable to trial by Court-Martial,as well as (possibly) United Kingdom-based civil servants, wives and families of troops and civilians and such people as Press correspondentswith the Forces.6.      :\. Since the meeting of the Legislation Committee, the question hasbeen further discussed with the Foreign Office who support the proposalfor immediate legislation.    As matters stand in Egypt, it is more thanlikely that before long it will be necessary for the General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, in the interests of the security of his Forces, totake power by proclamation to arrest, search and try Egyptians who commitoutrages and crimes against British Forces and civilians, and in fact tointroduce some very limited form of martial law.    The General OfficerCorhmanding-in-Chief v/ill not of course make any such proclamation untilthe matter has been brought before Ministers and Ministers have approved.It is felt that in these circumstances we need not feel debarred from takingpowers, by a clarifying amendment, which v/ould incidentally include someEgyptians in their scope, especially as there would be no need to tryEgyptians if v/e did not wish to, though they would no doubt be more likelyto get justice from a Court-Martial of ours than from an Egyptian Court.The same thing applies to British civil servants, families and others;we need not use the powers, although they were available.    Nevertheless,if any such person commits a serious offence, it is generally out of thequestion to try him in this country, either because the offence is not onewhich can be tried here, if committed abroad, or because of the difficultyof bringing witnesses from Egypt, and it is difficult to see any alternative to trial by Court-Martial unless ha is to escape any consequences of his action.   .?, I suggest, however, that we can safeguard the position of anypeople of this sort and of Egyptian .and other foreign employees of ours by giving instructions to the Comrnander-in-chief that they are not to be subjected to trial by Court-Martial without the concurrence of the ambassador, or of the Foreign Secretary, if that is thought necessary.When the terms of the instructions to be given to the Commander-in-Chiefhave been settled, the Minister introducing the Bill, if it is approved and ifthe instructions are settled in time, will be able to indicate on SecondReading in what manner it is proposed to proceed, so far as Egyptiannationals are concerned.81 I should add that I have been asked by the Commander-in-Chief to approve the renewal of the. declaration under Section 1 G9(2) of the Army.Actthat by reason of the re cent existence of active service, it is necessary forthe public service that the Forces under his command should be temporarilysubject to the Army Act, as if they were on active service, for three months from 15th December, when the last renewal, approved by my predecessor,expires.    I understand that the Commander-in-Chief has recommendedthese successive renewals from March, 1948, to date, because it has been felt that conditions in the Middle East have remained disturbed ever since defacto active service ceased with the making of the Italian peace treaty andthe winding up of our Palestine commitments.    I have felt doubt about the validity of authorising further declarations based on the recent existence of active service, and was considering a proposal to inform the Commander-m-Chief that he should make a new declaration, referring to the imminenceof active service, but the Foreign Office see the strongest objection to this at the present moment, on political grounds.    They take the view that if weare to rely on a declaration for the purpose of the Bill, it can only be on thebasis of a further continuance of the status quo, resting on a renewal of the
old declaration.    If this cannot be accepted, the Bill will not provide asolution for the difficulty in&apos;Egypt, and the only possible basis wouldappear to be the existence of de facto active service conditions, whichwould render the civilians liable to military law under the Army Act asit stands, without the Bill.    It is, of course, possible that such conditionsmay exist before.long in Egypt.  ; They arise when a force is engaged in operations against the enemy (which includes armed rioters) or is engagedin military operations in a country or place wholly or partly occupied byan enemy, or is in military occupation of a foreign country.    While thetroops fighting terrorists in particular localities might be on active service under this definition, I am advised that this would not besufficient to place all the troops in the Canal Zone on active service, orenable us to treat the labour force as subject to military law.    If,however, proclamations were placed before the Cabinet, after considera-tion by the Law Officers, and approved by them, having the effect of introducing some limited form of martial law in Egypt, I am advised thatthis might have the effect of producing de facto a condition of active service, and so at the same time solve the civilian difficulty.    Even sucha limited measure of martial law would, however, be most distasteful tothe Foreign Office, who consider that such a move might well lead to thewithdrawal of all Egyptian officials, police etc. from the Zone with a consequent extremely unwelcome necessity of establishing military government for the whole area, an outcome which the Foreign Office are most reluctant to contemplate.    I understand, however, that the foreign secretary would be prepared to support it if he was satisfied that no other course was open.9. I feel it my duty to bring this very difficult problem to theknowledge of the Cabinet, and in the circumstances I ask for authority tointroduce this short Bill immediately, and for facilities to get it throug hall stages before the Recess.-r-.n.V/ar Office, S.W.1,28TH NOVEMBER, 1951.
