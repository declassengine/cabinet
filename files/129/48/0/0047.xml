This is a long-drawn-out business on which I shall no doubt have to consult them from time to time. -2. I have therefore had prepared the attached paper summarising the historyof the dispute and the issues involved. -3. The present position is that efforts at mediation between the two parties,conducted under the a;aegis of the Security Council, have reached a deadlock.Broadly&apos;speaking, there are two main lines of policy which the United KingdomGovernment could follow-either (a) direct intervention, or (b) continued supportof action through the Security Council.4 I am clear that, at any rate at the present stage, direct intervention wouldbe most unwise. In the past all attempts at direct intervention, whether by theUnited Kingdom Government alOne or jointly with the United States government or other Commonwealth. Governments, have proved fruitless. The fact is thatthere are no means of imposing a solution from without. &apos;5. We should, therefore, continue to work through the Security Counciltowards the holding of a plebiscite to settle the future of Kashmir.6. Dr. Graham was appointed by the Security Council this year as their representative to hold discussions with India and Pakistan on the procedure fordemilitarisation preceding a plebiscite. He put in a first report early in October,and his second and final report is expected just before Christmas. On detailedtactics much will depend on the precise form of his report. Its substance is likely tobe that he has been unable to make any progress since he reported in October.7. We have, therefore, to consider what the next step should be in the security council. The Pakistanis will probably decline to negotiate, further unless the-Security Council says how it thinks the outstanding points of difference should be resolved. This would be asking-the Security Council to go somewhat beyond thepolicy of pure mediation which they have followed in the past and to bring somepressure to bear on India to modify her present rigid attitude. It is, however,right that we should develop gradual pressure on India in this way and, providedthat the United States are in full agreement with this policy, the other members ofthe Security Council may be expected to follow our lead. But in framing aresolution for the Security Council we must be careful that the pressure on india is not such as to defeat our ends by leading India to reject the resolution and torefuse to take discussions any further.41584a ;    ,v;;X&apos;&apos;;-yyf     -:

While preserving a balance between the- Indian and Pakistan claims, the Security Council should inparticular look towards the retention by India of forcesconsiderably less than those at present stipulated by her.(iii) The Security Council should not, however, be committed to a view on the precise length of time required to complete demilitarisation-tion, since this issue raises technical military problems which theCouncil should avoid.(b) The Security Council should ask the two parties to seek to eliminate thesenarrow points of difference by direct discussion themselves and to report back within two months.. 9. An important factor in the failure of Dr. Graham&apos;s recent efforts is that india is now in the throes of a general election campaign which will not be com-pleted till the end of January. We cannot expect India to take any new decisionsuntil the election is over and we should therefore aim to postpone launching aresolution in the Security Council until the end of January at the earliest. We shallhave to take pains to persuade Pakistan to accept this delay; but we must acceptthe possibility that our hand may be forced by the Pakistan refusal to wait so long,in which case we should have to be ready to act at short notice on the above lines in the Security Council.10. It is urgently necessary to exchange views with the United States and commonwealth Governments (in particular Canada and Australia) with whom wehave always worked in close accord over this problem.11. The Foreign Secretary is in general agreement with the line of policyindicated in paragraphs 8 and 9 above and, in anticipation of our colleagues&apos;approval, he and I are proceeding on that basis to elicit the views of the UnitedStates and Commonwealth Governments.I.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.

annex report ON THE KASHMIR DISPUTE1. The Kashmir dispute is at the root of the present strained relationsbetween India and Pakistan. A settlement, of the dispute would be the greatest -single contribution which could be made io the solidarity of the commonwealth and to the strengthening of the policy for containment of Communism. While itwould leave many other problems still to be resolved in South Asia, it would havethe immediate effect of (a) binding India and Pakistan more firmly to the Commonwealth;(b) strengthening their stability and that of the whole sub-continent asa firmbase against Communism;(c) strengthening their economic position by removing the cause of cripplingdefence expenditure;(d) opening up prospects of help from Pakistan in the Middle East.So long as the Kashmir dispute lasts, however, both countries will. remainpreoccupied with this problem and there will be a constant danger of war betweenthem.&apos; , f &apos;Background of the Dispute2. The history of the dispute is long and complicated but the essential pointsare as follows:  (1) Kashmir is a predominantly Muslim State whose Hindu ruler acceded toIndia in 1947;(2) Shortly after his accession tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir andIndia sent in troops to check the invasion; -(3) The United Nations, to whom the dispute was then referred, eventuallysucceeded in January 1949 in arranging a cease-fire, leaving Pakistanin occupation of the northern and western areas of the State (almost exclusively Muslim in population) and India of the rest (including theVale of Kashmir, which is politically and economically the most impor-v tant part of the State).   United Nations military observers have beenstationed on the cease-fire line since then;(4) Both India and Pakistan have subsequently accepted the recommendationof the United Nations that the future of the State should be settled by a free and impartial plebiscite;(5) No progress has hitherto been made in implementing this recommendationbecause the parties have not been able to agree on practical measures for the arrangement of a plebiscite or for the demilitarisation which both have agreed in.principle must precede a plebiscite;(6) Dr. Graham, the present United Nations Representative, has been trying to persuade the parties to accept a detailed plan for demilitarisation.Progress has so far been blocked by disagreement on three main points (a) the speed at. which demilitarisation should be effected (Pakistanaccepts Dr. Graham&apos;s proposal for a 90 days&apos; period, whileIndia thinks a longer period will be required);(b) the balance of forces to be left on each side of the cease-fire line(India has stated that she requires about 21*000 regular indian troops and an unspecified number of locally recruited troops,against a total of 4,000 local troops on the Pakistan side; Pakistanhas proposed approximate parity between the two sides): and(c) the date on which the Plebiscite Administrator should begin to operate in Kashmir (Pakistan accepts Dr. Graham&apos;s proposal that he should be appointed during the demilitarisation period,while India considers his appointment should be separatelyconsidered at a later stage).41584    - . J b &apos;
Attitude of PartiesIndia \.-:&apos;..&apos; &apos;3. The Indian attitude throughout the United Nations negotiations has been based on the following three main claims (i) that the accession of the Maharaja to India in 1947 was valid and that until an agreed decision is made to the contrary the whole State ofKashmir is legally part of the Indian Union. From this it follows thatthe entry of Pakistan troops into Kashmir in 1948 is proof that Pakistanis an aggressor in Kashmir and as such should have no claim to an equal say in the solution of the dispute;(ii) that the Government of Sheikh Abdullah in the Indian-held part of theState is the legal Government of the whole State, and any solution tothe Kashmir dispute and any arrangements for a plebiscite must take account of this fact;(iii) that the Central Government of India is currently the responsible Govern-ment for the defence and security of the whole.State of Kashmir, andany arrangement for demilitarisation must be made on this under-standing. A major factor governing the Indian attitude has been thefact that Indian policy over Kashmir is the personal concern ofMr. Nehru and a question on which nobody else has proved to have any real influence. Mr. Nehru has a sentimental attachment to Kashmir,being himself descended from a family of Kashmiri Brahmins, and he still tends to speak of Kashmir as his native territory. He is also a personal friend&quot; of Sheikh Abdullah, the leader of the Government ofIndian-held Kashmir. In addition to this the Pakistan claims onKashmir, based as they are on the preponderance of Muslims in the. State, are in direct antipathy to Mr. Nehrus ideal of the secular Stateand his frequent denials of the validity of the two-nation theory.4. Apart from this, India&apos;s attitude throughout has been influenced by thefact that she is already in possession of the most important part of the State.Sheikh Abdullah, himself a Muslim, has introduced a number of political, economicand social reforms in this area. He has set up a Constituent Assembly as a preliminary to establishing a constitution for the State, and it is expected that,some time in 1952 the Assembly will pronounce itself in favour of the accession ofthe State to India. Indja believes with some reason that the effect of his activitieswill be to build up gradually in the Vale, which is the vital area, a majority opinion in favour of accession to India. Her main objective throughout has therefore been to play for time by raising practical objections to the implementation of anyparticular plans for demilitarisation and for a plebiscite; in the long run, whenSheikh Abdullah is ready, she would aim at securing agreement to an arrangement under which the almost entirely Muslim areas on the Pakistan side of the presentcease-fire line would go to Pakistan and the area on the Indian side of the cease-fireline, either with or without a plebiscite (which when the time is ripe she would expect to go in her favour), to India.Pakistan5. Pakistani attitude is based on the claims-(i) that the Maharaja&apos;s accession in 1947 was accepted by the Governor-General subject to the consultation of the wishes of the people;,(ii) both parties have agreed that the people&apos;s wishes should be ascertained-.. by an overall plebiscite conducted under United Nations auspices;(iii) failure to make any progress towards a plebiscite arises from India&apos;sinsistence on conditions which would in effect prevent the people ofKashmir from voting freely and fairly.6. The Pakistanis regard Kashmir as naturally an integral part of Pakistan.The economic outlets and communications of the State have traditionally beenthrough Pakistan territory, and the main rivers on which the Pakistan Punjabrelies for irrigation have their headquarters in Kashmir. The geographical positionof the State gives it an obvious strategic importance. Pakistani point of view is,therefore, that, if Kashmir was occupied by India, India could at any time gravelythreaten her strategic and economic security. Pakistan is confident that a plebiscite
3 .      x \. &apos;Covering the whole State, if not delayed too long, would be bound to give a majorityfor union with Pakistan. It is possible, however, that in the last resort she would accept a partition with a plebiscite only in the Vale.7. Against this background Pakistani general objective is exactly the oppositeOf India&apos;s; she seeks the earliest possible implementation of the agreement to holda plebiscite and presses for a firm ruling on the Security Council Which will dispose of the practical difficulties which have hitherto impeded itConsiderations which have hitherto governed United Kingdom policy. The main considerations on which United Kingdom policy has hitherto been based are as follows:-- ,(a) That fundamentally an effective solution can only be achieved by agree-ment between the parties.lb) That no opportunity should be lost of encouraging the parties to workout a solution together.(c) That the measure of agreement embodied in the United Nations recom-mendations for demilitarisation and a plebiscite, which have beenaccepted by India and Pakistan, should be preserved.Id) That in order to give every opportunity for lb) above, and to avoid inflamatory-mation of public opinion in India and Pakistan, a deadlock in the united nations proceedings should be avoided.(e) To avoid, in this dispute between two members of the Commonwealth,,. committing. ourselves to a policy definitely hostile to one or the other.At the same time our aim has always been to exert the maximumpressure of world opinion on India to exhibit some willingness to compromise.- If) Following upon this, to avoid weakening Pakistani position, e.g. byendorsing any proposal for partition without ensuring adequate safe-guards in advance.Ig) To make it easier for the Pakistan Government to restrain the highlyinflammable emotions which the Kashmir dispute arouses in the pakistan population.9. Our fundamental objective throughout the dispute has been to avoid any action which would- &apos; .&apos;\la) Increase the danger of war between India and Pakistan.(b) Arouse the hostility of India or Pakistan to such a degree as to threaten.       the defection of either, of them from the Commonwealth; and, on the positive side, to create conditions likely to lead to a settlement.10. We have throughout worked closely with the United States on theSecurity Council, and have been careful to keep in close touch with other Common-wealth Governments.Present state of Indo-Pakistan relations11. Relations between the two countries have been uneasy ever since partitionand the Kashmir dispute has acted as a focus for their mutual distrust and hostility.There have been recurrent crises of acute tension. In 1948 there was an imminent danger that the fighting in Kashmir between the armed forces of India and Pakistanwould develop into general hostilities between the two countries. The communaldisturbances of March 1950 so strained relationships that the Indian government made large-scale troop movements towards the Pakistan frontiers in the Punjaband Bengal which were countered by movements of the Pakistan Army. The twoPrime Ministers met in April 1950 and concluded the Delhi Minorities agreement which produced a relaxation of the immediate political tension; the troops, however,were not all withdrawn; in particular the bulk of the Indian troops which hadbeen moved towards the Punjab frontier were left in their advanced positions.In July 1951, when feelings had been fermenting over the Kashimr dispute and pakistan leaders had been guilty of a good deal of intemperate talk about thepossibility of settling the dispute by violent means, the Indian Government movedlarge forces, including their Armoured Division, forward from their 1950 positionsto the immediate proximity of the Punjab frontier. Counter-dispositions of the pakistan Army were made and a period of. acute tension followed.f41584 ::&apos;;-&apos;-&apos;    x.&apos; V;.     -    .,.&apos; B 2. &apos; &apos; \
12.  Although neither side has withdraw from these positions,tension has significantly relaxed since the end of August.  The assassination ofMr. Liaqat Ali Khan appears to have shocked both countries at least temporarily&apos; into a calmer mood.13.  Our belief is that neither side wishes for war nor will deliberately provokeone. The present situation, however, is. one of obvious danger which could easilylead tjj an uncontrollable outbreak. Two possible causes of an outbreak are-.&quot;., (a) A renewal of communal strife in Bengal or elsewhere; or(b) Ah incursion by Pakistan tribesmen into Kashmir arising from impatienceat the failure of the United Nations to secure a settlement &apos;of theterritorial diSpute. * &apos;Prevention.of War14. An outbreak of war between India and Pakistan would be a majordisaster. It would inevitably throw the whole sub-continent into turmoil and letloose uncontrollable communal warfare on an enormous scale. The ensuing chaosand disruption would leave the field open for Communist exploitation. We have examined the possibilities of our taking effective. action of either a military or economic nature to prevent such a war. The conclusions of this examinationare briefly as follows:-.Military-.15, An examination recently made by the Chiefs of Staff indicated that thereare no military measures open to us which could be effective in preventing hostilities.Neither the Commonwealth nor, we think, the United Nations would be able tomake available sufficient forces to control events. An arms embargo would have a fairly quick effect on Pakistan but only a long-term effect on India, and. would not,therefore, of itself prevent war.16. The possibility of a military guarantee has been considered but is opento a number of objections.  These are:-the United Kingdom.has not the power to make such a guarantee effective;a policy of &quot; gestures &quot; would be worse than useless;India would not accept a guarantee and would react strongly against a unilateral guarantee-of Pakistan;    . .there would be obvious objections to the United Kingdom undertakingsuch a guarantee without the support of the rest of the Commonwealth;it is.unlikely that this would be willingly given and an attempt to secureit might seriously shake the Commonwealth;a guarantee might result only in further disturbance of relations between india and Pakistan, each trying to manoeuvre to invoke the guarantee. against the other.Economic17. Economic sanctions would require the active co-operation of at least the rest of the Commonwealth and the United States, and could not be really effec-tive without the support of the United Nations as a whole.. It is inconceivable thatthey should be applied in advance of actual: hostilities. The suggestion has beenmade that we should work for a declaration in advance that supplies would be withheld from whichever country was the aggressor. We are unlikely to be facedwith a deliberate act of aggression and it.may be difficult to determine whichcountry was the guilty party. In such circumstances an advance commitment ofthis kind might only be a serious embarrassment; moreover it is most unlikely that. it-would have any effect in preventing war.18. An. oil embargo would have a very rapid effect since both countries are entirely dependent on imported oil. It is, however, estimated that both sidesmaintain stocks which could keep their armed forces in full operation for about twomonths. Again, therefore, an oil embargo woud not of itself prevent war, and anysuch embargo imposed in advance of hostilities would paralyse the economic life ofthe two countries, . ;  - -Diplomatic Action     .19. In this situation we are thrown back on diplomatic action as the solemeans open to us for preventing.war andv the scope of diplomatic action is of
course itself limited by the ineffectiveness of the military or economic action opento us. But we have a very great asset our present friendly relations with both countries and the strong moral influence which we still wield in both countries.It is important to build up this asset against the evil day when we may greatly need it.  For all these reasons^ therefore, there are strong&apos; arguments why we should(a) be cautious about taking sides or giving the appearance of taking sidesin the various disputes between the two countries;\b) refrain from premature intervention;&quot; -   (c) endeavour to keep down tempers on both sides and to avoid action whichmight exacerbate opinion on either side.Ultimate solution of the Kashmir dispute20. There seems no doubt that the ultimate solution must be partition. Inthat event the area at present held by Pakistan, which is almost exclusively Muslim,would remain with Pakistan, and the Hindu area of Jammu and the Buddhist areaof Ladakh would go to India. Such a settlement would avoid large-scale migration(and the danger of communal disturbances) which would inevitably follow the acces-sion of the whole State to one country or the other. But the future of the Valewould still remain in the crux. This could be settled either (a) by recognising the present de facto partition along the cease-fire line, givingthe. Vale to India, or&apos; . (b) by a plebiscite. There is little doubt that a fair plebiscite would give theVale to Pakistan, provided it was conducted before India has had timeto consolidate her hold over the area. This consideration is, of course,one of the main reasons for Pakistani impatience.21. It must be assumed that an imposed solution is out of the question. Nooutside powers could, or would be willing to, undertake the necessary coerciveaction. In any case an imposed solution would entail bitter opposition from one party and could not lessen but might well increase the present tension betweenthe two countries. We must therefore work for a settlement by agreement between india and Pakistan, or at least for one acceptable to both. It is for considerationhow far, if at all, we should come out openly on one side or the other in thenegotiations.22. To back India would be morally wrong. She is committed to a plebiscite,and there is little doubt that her present tactics are directed towards spinning outnegotiations until either the cease first line is acceped, faute de mieux, as a per-manent dividing line or she so consolidated her position in the Vale that she can beconfident that a plebiscite would go in her favour. To support India in this policy would, moreover, provoke Pakistan to the point of explosion.23. We are firmly committed to a fair plebiscite under United Nationsauspices, and this is the solution Pakistan demands. To that extent, therefore,we are bound to support Pakistan, particularly as, since India holds the crucial areaof the Vale, it is India who must make positive moves before a plebiscite can beheld. We have accepted the view (which is amply endorsed by a study of plebiscitesheld in the past) that a fair plebiscite would be impossible without more or lesscomplete demilitarisation and it is by her failure to accept this that India is atpresent blocking progress. It must, however, be admitted that India has somecause for her reluctance to leave a military vacuum in the Vale. Four years agotribesmen from Pakistan invaded the Vale and were eventually supported by regularPakistan forces. During last summer Pakistan spokesmen and the entire Pakistanpress were guilty of a series of bellicose and threatening statements. Although thesethreats were concerned with the action that Pakistan might take.if continuedIndian intransigence prevented a plebiscite and therefore might be discounted ifa plebiscite were actually being prepared, it remains true that demilitarisation mustbe to a certain extent an.act.of faith by India. It is essential that Pakistan should realise this and should help to dispel Indian suspicions. It is fair to add that although Pakistan agreed, India refused to entertain suggestions of a neutral force(put forward by the Prime Minister of Australia at the London meetings in January1951) to guard the security of Kashmir and hence to allow the withdrawal of indian forces. This gives justification to suspicions that she is making the most of thesemilitary difficulties in order to aid her policy of delay.24.  ThereJs only.one agreed principle on which a solution can be based-that is that the future of the State should&quot; be decided by a plebiscite.  Unless this41584 - B 3
... H3ft6measure of agreement is preserved the whole dispute will be thrown back into the melting pot. But in order to make any progress, pressure of some kind must bebrought to bear on India..25. There are, however, limitations on the methods open to us. No goodpurpose would be served by the United Nations, still less the United Kingdom,taking a line openly hostile to India. This would do no good over Kashmir, whereIndia would merely dig in her toes and feelings would be further exacerbated; inthe broader sphere it would do harm to India&apos;s relations with the United Kingdomand with the West in general. We are, therefore, limited to the use of diplomaticpressure and the hope that India may gradually be influenced by the force of world opinion. wJ- - 26. Although it is frustrating to see this dispute, with all its debilitatingeffects on the two countries, drag on, and tempting to search for some method ofsolving it by direct and vigorous action, experience in the past has shown that India,is not to be easily moved from her position. The Security Council have for fouryears been searching for a means of bringing about a plebiscite, both by discussion in the Council and by the negotiating efforts of a series of agents (the commission for. India and Pakistan, General McNaughton of Canada, Sir Owen Dixon ofAustralia and now Dr. Graham of the United States). In September 1949 Mr. Attleeand President Truman jointly supported, in personal messages to the two PrimeMinisters, a proposal for arbitration. Although the Pakistan Government accepted this proposal, the joint appeal did not succeed in persuading Mr. Nehru to accept it: At the time of the Commonwealth Prime Minister^ meetings in London inJanuary 1951 the Prime Ministers of five Commonwealth countries (the UnitedKingdom^ Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon) jointly tried in private conversation with the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to persuade them toaccept suggestions in particular for a neutral force; Liaquat Ali Khan accepted the suggestions, Mr. Nehru did not.27. There is, in fact, no panacea which could bring a speedy solution of this dispute. There is no clear-cut choice between right and wrong. Even the mostintransigent aspects of Indian policy may be partially justified by reference to the. history of the dispute, and Pakistani undoubtedly greater readiness to fall in withconstructive suggestions no doubt stems in part from the fact that India is inpossession of the disputed territory.Alternative Lines of Approach in the Immediate Future28.  It is against this background that we must determine our future policy.Three broad lines of approach are at present under consideration:-(a) That Kashmir should be partitioned straight away by agreement of indian and Pakistan Governments outside the Vale and that the problem ofthe Vale should be left &quot; on ice &quot; for, say, 5 or 10 years with some form.; of United Nations supervision over the administration; meanwhile, thedevelopment of water resources of the Indus basin should be under-taken under some international authority. (This suggestion was putforward by the Americans as a new approach to the problem.)(b) To initiate secret diplomatic action by the United Kingdom, with or withoutthe assistance of the United States and/or other commonwealth countries, to impress on both parties the urgency and gravity of theproblem and to use our good offices towards rinding a solution.(c) To continue our efforts in the Security Council to bring the parties to an agreed solution. Comments on these three possibilities, are asfollows.29. There are serious objections to course (a) above:  (i) Neither party would accept putting the Vale &quot; on ice &quot; as proposed,though India&apos;s objections would be directed against the supervision ofthe^adrninistration by the United Nations..  - 1 (ii) It is most unlikely that the Canal waters question could be settled in theabsence of a final territorial settlement of Kashmir.(iii) The International Bank are engaged in an attempt to make some progress towards joint development of the Indus basin, and we are anxious notto make their task more difficult by involving it in the political dispute.
30.  As to course (b) considerations in favour are (i) that negotiations of this sort might create a new atmosphere for discussion;(ii) that such negotiations would be away from the glare of publicity and both.      sides might be more ready to make decisions in private;(iii) that Pakistan is likely to welcome the prospect of direct intervention by.  the United Kingdom Government in such negotiations.Considerations against are:-- (iv) direct intervention by the United Kingdom has proved fruitless in the past;experience shows that it produces no response; n &apos;(v) that we should have nothing new to offer;(vi) that there would, therefore, be real danger that the negotiations would&apos;&apos;   fail; this might both(a) impair our influence with both parties, which might seriously weaken our position if we were faced at any time with the necessity for urgent diplomatic action in face of a threat of war between thetwo countries;(b) seriously exacerbate feeling&quot; in Pakistan, because the fact of thediscussions would have to be made public and their failure would inevitably cause acute disappointment to Pakistan public opinion:(vii) India would be unlikely to welcome such negotiations and might evendecline to take part in them at all.31. It seems, therefore, that course (c) above is the least unsatisfactory avail-able. But there is one issue which we shall have to face in this context. TheSecurity Council has so far concentrated its efforts on bringing the two parties together. We must face the fact that there is no further hope of progress simplyalong these lines. The time has come when the Security Council must consideradopting a resolution which would express a view on the way in which a settlement should be reached of the outstanding points of difference between the parties on the demilitarisation of Kashmir. We would have to be prepared to put our namesto a resolution embodying such a statement, although it would mean going beyondthe considerations set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 above which have hitherto governedour policy. This resolution would need extremely careful phrasing, to avoid anyoutright criticism of the Indian arguments. -Commonwealth Relations Office,\5th December, 1951.
