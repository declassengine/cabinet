-    117THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTThe  circulation   of   this   paper   has   been   strictly   limited.It   Is   issued  for. the   personal   use   of.....* .... t^O^Ujyaju   ^f*t^.TOP SECRET &quot;Copy NoC.(?l? 2320TH NOVEMBER, 1951CABINET.. 7X9PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for air in C. (51) 27 the Minister of Supply refers to the aircraft supply programme,2. I emphasise the seriousness of the present position of supplies for the Royal Air Force.3. The Royal Air Force is small.    Its front line numbers only 1,600aircraft. (The comparable size of the R.A.F. in 1939 was 3,250, and thatof the Soviet Air Force today is thought to be in the region of 20,000). Itis therefore essential that its quality should be high.4. We have today no fighter in service to match the MIG.15, which was introduced in 1949 and of which the Soviet Air Force now has very largequantities.    On the Minister of Supply&apos;s forecasts, we shall not have asingle squadron of British fighters superior to the MIG.15 until late in 1953.5. We have today only one squadron of Canberra light bombers (the replacement for the Mosquito).    By March, 1953, we shall have only fivesquadrons (50 aircraft).6. Of the Valiant medium bomber (the replacement for the Lincoln)we shall not have a single squadron till well on in 1954.7. Production of the Venom fighter bomber, which is inferior in speedto the MIG. 15, will not reach its peak until 1954.    Meanwhile much of ourexpansion for our contribution to General Eisenhower*s force and tostrengthen the defence of the Middle East will have to be done withobsolescent Vampires.8. We have no war reserve of jet fighters or jet bombers.   We shallnot have any war reserves of modern interceptor fighters or of Canberrasbefore 1955.9. We have no ammunition for our fighters, except some war-timestocks which have deteriorated and become unsafe.    We are producing inone month enough ammunition for one sortie by two squadrons.   When thenew fighters (the F. 3 and the Swift) are delivered, there is every prospect that we shall be short of the guns, ammunition and rockets they need tofight with. . &apos; ;     -
ill10. The position about electronic equipment is also very bad.The Canberra has not got, and will not have before 1954 at the earliest,the gear for which it was designed.    The navigation and bombing gear -for the Valiant looks like falling behind the aircraft.    Even the naviga-tional equipment for the Lincoln is unsatisfactory and unreliable.    TheUnited Kingdom radar chain covers only part of the country and can easily be flown round, and its equipment is out of date.    Adequate radar cover for the most vital areas of the United Kingdom cannot be completed beforethe end of 1953.11.         I cannot believe that a major improvement is impossible.    Thereis no lack of skill in design.    If in production the country is trying to dotoo much, then at least let us ensure, whatever else we do, that we havethe air power without which we cannot defend these islands and without which we should be at an overwhelming disadvantage on land and at sea.Our whole rearmament programme is threatened by the deplorable weak-ness of the preparations made to supply the Royal Air Force,12.        We have no justification for hoping that American production will come to our rescue.    We are already counting on a great deal -probably more than they can spare - to fill the gaps in our own programme.Conclusion13. I urge that the Government should examine every possibility of improving air supplies. The measures proposed by the Minister ofSupply would be an immediate step forward, but a great deal more is needed if we are to make up the ground that has been lost.De L&apos;I, and D,Air Ministry, S.W.1,20TH NOVEMBER, 1951.
