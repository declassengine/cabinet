&quot;I   135S DOCUMENT-IS T HE - P R OF ER-T Y OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;? GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALC.(51) 33 :  &apos; COPY NO.30TH NOVEMBER, 1951CABINETLICENSING ARRANGEMENTS IN NEW TOWNSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland we wish to raise the question of the future of State management in the new towns.2. The Licensing Act, 1949, provides &quot;for extending to all new towns the State management of the liquor trade in operation in.........the Carlisle, Cromarty Firth and Gretna districts&quot;. The steps hithertotaken to implement the Act have been preparatory only, and at this stagea reversal of policy would present no great administrative difficulty,3. State Management was applied to the new towns as a means ofsecuring the provision of public houses of a high standard according to a proper plan.    To a great extent this can be secured by the exercise ofthe Development Corporations&apos; general powers; but if the ordinaryLicensing lav/ were left to operate, there would always be the risk thatthe Corporations&apos; plans might be frustrated by the licensing authoritiesrefusing to grant some of the necessary licences.    Some machinery for avoiding conflicts between the Development Corporations and the licensing authorities therefore seems necessary, and we propose a statutory Committee on which both the Development Corporation and the licensing authorities would be represented, and which should have theduty of deciding the number, nature and location of the facilities to beprovided for the sale of intoxicating liquor.A Committee&apos;s proposals should be subject to confirmation after consideration of any objections; thereafter licensing authorities shouldbe required to grant any licence applied for in accordance with the pro-posals provided they were satisfied as to the suitability of the applicantand of the proposed premises,4. We recommend that authority should be given for the preparationof legislation to repeal the provisions of the Licensing Act, 1949, relatingto new towns, and to substitute provisions on the lines suggested above.The Minister of Housing and Local Government agrees.    We think thelegislation should be introduced this Session, and that an announcementof the Governments intentions should be made at once, in response to enquiries which are already being received from Development Corpora-tions, Local Advisory Committees, the trade and interested local bodies,and by way of Parliamentary Questions.D.M.F.7.S.30TK NOVEMBER, 1951
