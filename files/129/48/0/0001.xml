THE DETERIORATING POSITION AND OUTLOOK2. We are in a balance of payments crisis, worse than 1949, and inmany ways worse even than 1947.    Confidence in sterling is impaired, aswitness the large discounts on forward sterling in New York, andspeculation against it is considerable, increasing the deficits and the drain on our gold and dollar reserves.3. There are three main indicators of the change in our position.These are by no means all; but they are the best known and the most significant.    The change between 1950 and 1951 is first dealt with, andthen the outlook for 1952:-A,     The change between 1950 and 1951(i)  The U.K. general balance of paymentsSurplus (4) Deficit (-)&apos;      - millions1950 January-June 4-    42July-December 4 179Year 4 221-1951 January-June - 122 ;July-December (forecast) - 350Year - 472Currently, therefore&quot;(I. e, in the present half-year) we are runningan external deficit at a rate of  700 million a year, compared withan annual rate of surplus of some  350 million in the correspondingperiod a year ago - a deterioration of more than  1,000 million per- . annum. .    - ,  .
(ii) The sterling area gold and dollar balance and thechange in reserves  millionsGold and Dollar&quot; Gain or lossxSurplus or of reservesDeficit   .1950 January-June (quarterly average)    4-    39 .4 131July-December    &quot;            &quot;            4 104 4 1571951 January-March    &quot;            &quot;.&apos;           4 129 4- 164April-June           &quot;            &quot;           4    19 4- 39July-September   &quot;             &quot;            - 228 - 214October (estimated)                          -90 - 90x Any difference between the figures of the gold and dollar deficit andthe figures of the gait! or loss of reserves is accounted for by the factthat the figures of the deficit exclude U.S. aid.The third quarter deficit was inflated by exceptional andseasonal losses, as well as speculative movements.    In October, sofar, the latter are probably playing an even greater part.    Unless a major change of sentiment occurs, at the present rate we face a gold and dollar deficit and a loss of reserves this quarter of over  285million.    (At the end of the year we are due to pay  62 millionservice on the North American lines of credit, of which  39 million is on account of interest -  23 million being on account of amortisa-tion of the loans;  we may be able to claim waiver of payment of theinterest.)   This would bring them down to under  900 million by31st December, compared with their peak  1,381 million at 31stJune    a loss of nearly  500 million in six months.    The presentdrain on the reserves themselves is greater than at any time sincethe war.(iii) The U.K. balance in the European Payments Union (E.P.U.)This is, of course, a reflection of the whole sterling areabalance on current and capital account with E.P.U, countries.U.K. net surplus or deficit with E.P.U. ..------ -.   millions1950 July-December 4-1701951 1st quarter *    572nd quarter -    10July &quot;    43.   August ,      &quot;    ^7September &apos;JOctober (estimated) (-    85)Speculative factors have almost certainly played a part recently,though we have no idea of their scale.    Unless a major reversal of sentiment occurs here, too, we shall run through all the gold-free credit available to us in E.P.U. and be paying gold atincreasing rates by November,
B.-  The outlook for 1952On present trends and policies the following is the outlook for 1952:-(i) A U.K, general balance of payments deficit of  540million. (ii) A deficit in E.P.U. of the order of  300 million.(iii) A loss of gold and dollar reserves of approximately 750 million.4. All these forecasts allow for some improvements on presentconditions, e.g. a full year&apos;s imports and exports at current prices,implying better terms of trade than in 1951, but no worse or betterthan now, no allowance for further speculative losses, and a slowing upof the increase in sterling area spending in the non-sterling area,particularly in E.P.U. countries.    In spite of this, the estimates dis-close an insupportable position, one in which even apart from specula-vtiy^ pressure, we stand to lose virtually the whole of our remainingreserves in 1952.5. These figures mean, in short, that both the United Kingdom andthe sterling Dominions are buying more than they can afford to pay for from current earnings.    This has been made worse by the loss ofconfidence in sterling and the additional strain of the loss of Abadan.II. THE NEED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE6. This very serious deterioration in our position, coming as itdoes at the inception and not during the full impact of the rearmament programme, threatens the whole position of sterling and of the UnitedKingdom and sterling area.    It is a clear indication not only that thereare serious underlying weaknesses in our position, but also that foreignconfidence in our ability to deal with these weaknesses is greatlyimpaired.    The only chance of restoring the position beforeirreparable harm has been done is to restore confidence.    I recommendtherefore that the restoration of confidence in sterling and our economicsituation should be the first and most important object of our policy.III. THE URGENT NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENTOF GOVERNMENT POLICY7. - The restoration of confidence requires, in my view, an early and comprehensive statement by the Government which shows that it is both ready and able to grip the situation.    The statement is requiredearly because the position is deteriorating very rapidly.    The state-ment should be comprehensive because half-measures would notrestore confidence and might, in certain circumstances s do more harm than good.    It is therefore necessary to consider first the content,and, secondly, the timing of any statement (see IV, V and VI below).I recommend that the need for an early and comprehensive statementbe accepted as an essential part of our policy to restore confidence in sterling and our economic situation.IV. THE INTERNATIONAL AJPECTS OF THE STATEMENT8. It is important that the statement should both give a lead to theCommonwealth and induce them to take action on similar lines, andalso assure our United States and Western European Allies that we
intend to take any action in a manner which will..not create needlesseconomic-difficulties for them, and which is indeed designed to make usa stronger partner in the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E,E;C.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A,T,0.), and the enterprises in which we are jointly engaged.. V. THE CONTENT OF THE STATEMENT &apos;. .. -,---, .-. -- ,p ,- .-19.4        It is important that any statement should&quot; set out not only the basic position&apos;with which we have to:deal but also the objectives which wehave in mind.    It is also important that it1 should cover all essentialaspects of the question, including the international aspects referred to inIV above.10. Broadly, the position with which we have to deal is one of anoverloaded economy, and our first objective must be to limit the load on&apos;the economy to the amount which it can bear and so to provide a solidbase on which to carry out the necessary expansion to meet future needs.The statement would not give confidence if it was limited merely to aseries of measures designed to restrict the economy, although these measures are necessary and must be taken urgently if we are to stop,and subsequently reverse, the present downward trend.11. The following are the broad headings of the measures which I ask my colleagues to consider.    These measures have been discussed in a preliminary manner with the Ministers mainly concerned who were already appointed.A. IMPORT CUTS.    I recommend that immediate action betaken, and announced, to reduce external expenditure by  350 million a year - this to be secured by direct cuts in the 1952 import&quot;pro-gramme of  300 million, and in the tourist ration to yield  15million, and the rest to be made up by shipping savings consequent upon the import cuts and a general tightening up on imports andother forms of external expenditure.    The general scale of these measures may be&apos; related to total estimated imports in 1952, at end-September prices, of some  3,620 million, of which  1,340 millioncomesfrom other sterling area countries, which it is not proposed to cut directly at this stage.The following are my detailed proposals to achieve this:-(a)    Saving of  150 million by direct cuts on a selected list ofimports from European and other non-sterling sources.About 90 per cent of our imports from Europe are importedwithout restriction, under the O.E.E.C, &quot;liberalisation&quot;.    policy.    We are entitled at any time to reimpose restric-tions which reduce the &quot;liberalisation&quot; percentage to 75 percent, and we can reimpose further restrictions if we aredangerously in deficit with E.P.U. (as we are), subject to our being prepared to justify our action to O.E.E.C. afterwards,-&apos;; If we cut our imports too drastically, however, we shouldrisk a collapse of the O.E.E.C. liberalisation structure, andreprisals against our exports.    This risk must be balancedagainst the risk of not cutting our expenditure enough, and ofthus failing to right our own deficit with the E,P,U., whichwould also, lead to the collapse of the E.P.U. itself.
intend to take any action in a manner which will not create needlesseconomic difficulties for them, and which is indeed designed to make usa stronger partner in the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.), and the enterprises in which we are jointly engaged.V.  THE CONTENT OF THE STATEMENT9. It is important that any statement should set out not only the basic position with which we have to deal but also the objectives which wehave in mind.    It is also important that it should cover all essentialaspects of the question, including the international aspects referred to inIV above. ,10. -      Broadly, the position with which we have to deal is one of anoverloaded economy, and our first objective must be to limit the load onthe economy to the amount which it can bear and so to provide a solidbase on which to carry out the necessary expansion to meet future needs.The statement would not give confidence if it was limited merely to aseries of.measures designed to restrict the economy, although these measures are necessary and must be taken urgently if we are to stop,and subsequently reverse, the present downward trend.11.

These measures have been discussed in a preliminary manner with the Ministers mainly concerned who were already appointed.A. IMPORT CUTS.    I recommend that immediate action be. taken, and announced, to reduce external expenditure by  350 million a year - this to be secured by direct cuts in the 1952 import pro-gramme of  300 million, and in the tourist ration to yield  15million, and the rest to be made up by shipping savings consequent upon the import cuts and a general tightening up on imports andother forms of external expenditure.    The general scale of these measures may be related to total estimated imports in 1952, at end-September prices, of some  3,620 million, of which  1,340 million  -cbmesfrom other sterling area countries, which it is not proposed to cut directly at this stage.The following are my detailed proposals to achieve this:-(a)    Saving of  150 million by direct cuts on a selected list ofimports from European and other non-sterling sources. :About 90 per cent of our imports from Europe are importedwithout restriction, under the O.E.E.C. &quot;liberalisation&quot;policy.    We are entitled at any time to reimpose restric-tions which reduce the &quot;liberalisation&quot; percentage to 75 percent, and we can reimpose further restrictions if we aredangerously in deficit with E.P.U. (as we are), subject to our being prepared to justify our action to O.E.E.C. afterwards.If we cut our imports too drastically, however, we shouldrisk a collapse of the O.E.E.C, liberalisation structure, and&apos;     ..  reprisals against our exports.    This risk must be balancedagainst the risk of not cutting our expenditure enough, and ofthus failing to right our own deficit with the E.P.U., whichwould also lead to the collapse of the E.P.U. itself.
I therefore propose that we make a selective list of cuts of  150 million, making a sharp cut (generally, but notinvariably, about 50 per cent) in each item, and choosing alist in a way which avoids cutting items which would invitereprisal, and not reducing our &quot;liberalisation&quot; percentagebelow about 60 per cent.    This list should include:-(i) Private imports of unrationed food,including wines and spirits -  100 million.    Thiswould include about thirty items, such as canned meat,canned hams, sugar fat mixtures, apples, pears, nuts,non-rationed cheeses, canned tomatoes, etc.    an allowance of  5 million for wines and spirits has beenmade, but this would have to be done by fiscal action and not by direct import cuts.    There are alreadyrestrictions on fruit and vegetables at times of the yea:when the imports would compete with United Kingdomproducers.    Total imports in this class, from all sources, are.estimated at  414 million in 1952.(ii) Government imports of unrationed food -  20 million.This includes dried fruit, condensed milk, coffee, etc.Total imports from E.P.U. and other non-sterlingsources are estimated at  44 million in 1952.(iii) Private imports of manufactures -  15 million.    Inthis field, total imports from E.P.U. and other non-sterling sources are estimated at  145 million in 1952,but  26 million consists of machinery and  70 million,of textiles.    In the manufactured field, we are more vulnerable to reprisal, than in food, and if supplies are excluded from the United Kingdom they will compete with our exports in Europe and elsewhere.    It isbelieved that a saving of  15 million could be made without damaging repercussions.    To save more wouldinvolve cutting textiles (over  50 million from Europealone) which would involve major risks, particularlybecause textiles are on the O.E.E.C. &quot;common list&quot;,in which restrictions are being removed throughout europe in order to build up a common market.(iv) Private imports of raw materials -  15 million.The major item is paper, board, and wood pulp forpaper.   A reduction of  12^ million or more could bemade on imports from all sources without damage to tieconomy (total imports from all sources about  180million) and without impact on newsprint supplies....---Butihis would, involy^reimpositipn of controls on paper distribution in order to safeguard supplies for - -essential uses, such as export packing.Introduction.of import restrictions would involve administra-tive difficulty at the outset, but this is in my view inevitable,and I recommend that this action, to a total of  150 million,should be put into effect immediately after the statement inParliament.

(b)    Saving of  50 million by cutting the 1952 import programmeof rationed foods.    It is estimated that we could buy enoughj   to support increases in consumption of wheat and rationed foods in 1952,^compared with the average 1951 level, of some 50 million,    I recommend that we cut the total programme by  50 million, so that if we-get:more meat than the 1951average, we should make corresponding reductions in otherrations, such as sugar or oils and fats.    The total programme in this class for 1952 is  714 million.    It may be convenient to save more on the unrationed foods and less on ih*% rationed foods or vice versa. . *&apos;-. (c)      Limiting imports of timber to maintain present consumptiononly.     To maintain present consumption of soft wood involvesimports of about  100 million a year.   At present there isno restriction on imports,, except from North America andthe Soviet bloc which are on Government purchase,    It willbe necessary to consider the purchasing arrangements forsoft wood, i.e. whether all purchase should not return to private account, and I recommend that.we. should make nocut in our proposed imports but in present circumstances we cannot go further.    If we permitted more, it would be anadditional expenditure above what is allowed for in the:  !     estimates of the outlook for 1952.(d) Saving of  100 million by suspension of strategic stock-piling programme.    The present strategic stockpilingprogramme will cost  147 million in 1952, of which  76million represents expenditure in the dollar area.    By theend of 1951, we shall have accumulated a strategic stock-pile of  140 million - mainly food, tobacco, soft wood,rubber.    I recommend that we should stop making purchasesfor this programme and have the programme re-examined with the purpose of saving  100 million in 1952, in purchases from non-sterling sources,    I fully appreciate, that this involves a defence risk, but on this basis we shall haveaccumulated some  180 million of supplies by the end of1952, and in my view the danger to our defence effort of a balance of payments crisis involving inability to buy essentialfood and raw materials far exceeds the defence risk of post-postponing stockpiling.(e) Saving of   15 million by reducisv   -ourist ration from  100to  50.    I recommend this, to take effect from thebeginning of the 1952 tourist year.    It would be possible to save a little more by introducing this from 1st January, butthis would impinge upon commitments already made.(f) General tightening up of external expenditure, I propose tokeep a tight check on projects of all kinds involving externalexpenditure, both in imports and in overseas Governmental. and &quot;invisible&quot; expenditure, in order that the maximum possible saving should be achieved by administrative......   means.    I would ask my colleagues to support me in this,and I- shall of course bring before them any matters whichmay involve policy considerations,B. MONETARY MEASURES.    I am satisfied that it has now become necessar^y to remove the rigidity in short term interest rates .of the last few years, which has limited the power of the authoritiesto exercise sufficient pressure upon credit policy,
-   11C, REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE.&apos;   We needan urgent review of all Government expenditure so as to cut out waste,and - far more important - to cut out and slow down expenditure on work which is valuable but not essential in times of crisis.    We mayhave to go further and take some big steps of a kind which no one canwelcome.    How far this will be necessary depends on how much wecan save by our general review.    I shall be circulating in a few days a separate paper to my colleagues setting out the steps which I hopethey will take in the interests of economy.    I cannot ask that majordecisions on policy should be taken before my speech on the Address,i . but I shall wish to inform the House of the general lines on which Ihave asked them to review their expenditure.. . -      -        .       &apos;. &apos;      &apos;&apos;D. INVESTMENT.    The present building programme authorised for 1952 is 10 per cent higher than the work actually carried out in1950.    But in the first half of 1951 the building industry achievedabout 4 per cent less than in 1950.    This was due to bad weather, -shortage of steel, and an attempt to achieve too much with limitedlabour and materials.    There will therefore be a backlog on the 1951building programme.    It is probable that shortage of steel will prevent the output of the building industry in 1952 from rising above,the level in 1950.    The industry is already overloaded and the first essential is to limit severely any more work being started under thepresent programme until the overload has been worked off and periods of completion of existing jobs have been shortened.    This will increase and not decrease the amount of work completed in 1952,It is also necessary-to reduce the level of home investment inplant, machinery and vehicles in order to make more metal goodsavailable for export.I therefore propose:-that the general rule should be that no new starting datesshould be given, to take effect within the next three months,and ho firm commitments made for starting dates to operate later in 1952; but that within this general rulespecial consideration should be given to housing;starting dates already granted for operation during the next three months should be reviewed and postponed in all casesexcept defence, fuel and power, and housing;the Headquarters Building Committee should make recommen-dations to carry out this general decision, including limited. provision for exceptions to be granted on their authority;officials should prepare a revised Investment Programme for1952 and 1953, to be ready for consideration by Ministersnot later than the end of January, 1952.12. I have considered whether these steps should be supplemented by. fiscal measures in an Autumn Budget.    There are some advantages in this, but great practical difficulties in the way of doing anythingeffective in the time available.    I do not believe that an Autumn budget is necessary to restore confidence; and would advise against one.    i therefore recommend that there should be no Autumn Budget.(ii)(iii)(iv)
13. The above are restrictive measures.    But our objective is an expanding economy.    The first essential for this is to restore confidence in the  .    These measures are necessary for that purpose, and to providethe solid base for expansion.    What are the measures for expansion?    Itis quite clear that the two fundamental limitations on the expansion of bur; economy are, first, coal output, and, secondly, the output of the engineering industry which, in turn, depends both on coal and on the availability of -steel.    Unless something can be done in both these fields then the pros-pects of expansion are greatly reduced.    Decisions and following actionon these matters are urgent, but the decisions cannot be taken in time for specific steps to be announced in the statement.    Nevertheless, the state-ment should include a reference to the constructive action which theGovernment intend to take in the following fields:-(a) Coal and Steel.These are of fundamental importance to the economy, and theGovernments intention to see that adequate supplies are avail-able should be stressed, adding that specific steps in thisdirection will be announced as soon as they are fully worked out.(b) Engineering Industry.The statement should show the expansion which is requiredin this industry to meet our needs, and which can be madeprovided adequate supplies of steel are available.    Thestatement would also emphasise that for increased steel supplieswe would depend very largely on what the Americans can do forus.(c) Exports.The fundamental question here is the priority to be given to exports as against defence orders.    Nothing can be said on this in the statement, but the Government would need to re-emphasise the existing policy of putting full weight behind the export drive.VI. TIMING OF THE STATEMENT14. From the point of view of the balance of payments crisis, theearlier the statement is made the better.    Indeed, the longer it is delayedthe more reserves we shall lose and the harder it will be to restore- confidence.15. The King&apos;s Speech is to be made on 6th November and the Debatewill open the next day.    Clearly, the King&apos;s Speech v/ill have to containreferences to the balance of payments crisis and to the vital need for measures to correct it.    Having regard to the seriousness of the crisisand to the need for setting out the full gravity of the situation, further deterioration would inevitably take place unless my statement specifiedremedial measures.    I therefore recommend strongly that I should beauthorised in my speech on the address not only to make clear how far thebalance of payments position has deteriorated in the last few weeks, butat the same time to announce the steps which are being taken to put theposition right.    This s ould include an announcement of the measuressummarised in paragraph 11 of this memorandum, with some general indication of those mentioned in paragraph 13. .R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,31ST OCTOBER, 1951. . - &apos;-8*
