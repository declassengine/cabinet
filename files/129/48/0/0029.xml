TilS DOCtMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENiI 2 0/Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1951SECRET Copy No.C..(51) 29.22nd November, 1951&apos;     *  &apos; . cabinet food SUBSIDIES AND RETAIL prices memorandum by the Minister of food. The latest review of the Ministry&apos;s trading position as at 31st Octoberhas disclosed an estimated &quot;excess&quot; in the financial year 1951-52 of  22-5 million over the subsidy ceiling of  410 million, laid down by the previous Government.This estimated &quot;excess&quot; includes a provision of  7-8 million to meet the extra cost of food in this financial year due to the Special Farm Prices Review in whichwe are now.involved.2. On.the assumption that for the time being we have to keep within a subsidy ceiling of  410 million, I must now ask&apos;my colleagues to consider how best to make the necessary subsidy saving of about  20. million by increased food prices.3. There is not much of the financial year left in which to make this saving.As it is difficult to increase the retail price of certain foods quickly, our choice isrestricted. Whatever price increases we decide on should be introduced quickly.4. After consultation with the Lord President, I recommend the followingprice increases:  Estimated.Saving (in the Increase inremainder of the All-ItemsFinancial Year 1951-52) Index(i) lOd. a lb. on bacon from:       30th December  ...     ...        8-75 -90(ii) lOd. a lb. on rationed cheesefrom 30ih December    ...        4-85 -50(iii) Id. a quart on milk from 1st  December  for  four, months    ...     ......        6 00 -3519-60 1-755. The dates shown above for bacon and cheese are the earliest dates fromwhich the increases in price can be made effective. I must also warn my colleagues that the increases proposed for bacon and cheese are steeper than individual price increases which have been made in the past to adjust prices to the subsidy ceiling.6. I attach as Appendix 1 notes on the various commodities showing why Ihave selected bacon, cheese and milk for price increases, and I attach as Appendix 2a summary of the present distribution of food subsidies on different commodities.G. LL-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,22nd November, 1951.41483 -    : Y28
APPENDIX 1It is generally preferable to introduce new prices for rationed foods at thebeginning of a new rationing period, after adequate notice to the trade. A rationingperiod begins on 30th December and I propose that the bulk Of the saving shouldbe made from that date. New prices for&apos;the main unrationed but subsidised foods-bread, flour and milk-can be introduced at about a fortnights notice.My conclusion is that for the immediate necessities of the situation we should concentrate price increases on three commodities, bacon, cheese and milk (a seasonal increase). But my colleagues will wish to know why I have chosen these and rejected others.A.-Commodities recommended to bear increases (i) Bacon. Although bacon is popular it is not easy, on nutritional grounds,to defend the present disproportionately high subsidy on it. This isnow about  52 million a year, representing about Is. 3\d. a lb. ascompared with a subsidy of Z\d. a lb. on meat. The cost of bacon tothe Ministry is likely to go on increasing and an increase in the retail.  price of bacon is overdue.(ii) Cheese. The subsidy on rationed cheese is about  24 million or Is. l%d.a lb. At the current retail price of Is. 2d. per lb. cheese is cheap in comparison with meat and other protein foods. Apart from agricul-tural workers, who enjoy a special ration of 12 ounces a week, con-sumption per head is small at 1J ounces a week. As in the case ofbacon, a substantial increase in the retail price of cheese would do no more than restore its relationship with the prices of other subsidisedfoods.(iii) Milk. The price of liquid milk for domestic consumption was increasedby Id. a quart in July without any marked effect on consumer demand.If consumer demand is maintained at its present level throughout the. winter, there is some danger that supplies may prove inadequate.Although, therefore, a further price increase might lead to some fall insales^a small decrease of consumption during the winter months wouldnot be unwelcome. The subsidy on domestic milk costs about  59-5 million, or 2\d. a quart, excluding any part of the cost of the AttestedHerds Scheme ( 7-8 million). While recognising its great nutritionalimportance, I am in favour of a seasonal increase of Id. per quart in theprice of milk, to run from 1st December * to the end of March, giving a saving of about  6 million. The reintroduction of a seasonal variationinto the price of milk seems to offer the only prospect of reducing thesubsidy. The increase which I now propose would provide a valuabletest of consumer reaction to higher winter prices. Moreover, a seasonalincrease in the price of a food, the supply of which fluctuates according tothe season is likely to attract less notice than a permanent increase inthe price of a food, the supply of which does not fluctuate seasonally.The price of welfare and cheap milk for infants and nursing motherswould not be affected.B. Commodities considered for price increases but rejected(i) Bread and Flour. The combined subsidies on bread and flour now exceed 90 million a year.  Much of the wheat from which flour is made isimported from dollar countries.   On this ground and because of therelative cheapness of bread there is a good case for reducing the subsidy.I have, however, rejected it for the moment partly on general grounds.- of public policy and partly because of the complicated adjustmentsnecessary in the price structure of the products of flour for which thereis not enough time at the moment.  It will, however, be necessary to&quot;   consider an increase in bread and flour prices next year.S-i\ihButter and Fats. The subsidy on butter is about  26 million a year, or%d. a lb., but here again for technical reasons we could not bring intoforce a price increase in the time available sufficient to yield a worth-while saving in the remainder of the financial year.* An increase from 1st December would be practicable if a decision could be reached by27th November. Otherwise an increase cannot be effective before 1st January, 1952.
(iii) Tea. The tea subsidy is estimated at about  15 million a year, repre-senting fyd. a lb., but in order to eliminate the subsidy it would benecessary, for technical reasons, to raise the price by lOd. a lb. I am infavour of the early removal of the tea subsidy as a first step towardsthe possible decontrol of tea prices. It is, however, necessary to give thetrade long notice of any variation in the subsidy and again time is tooshort in include tea in this operation.(iv) I have also considered and rejected eggs and meat which have home sub-stantial price increases very recently.APPENDIX ministry OF FOODSummary of Estimated Food Subsidies for the Year Ending 31st March, 1952Current    Unit subsidyCommodityUnitaverageretail(tonearestTotalsubsidyApprox. saving Anprox. effect in a full ye&amp; of criange of Id.from change of on the Interim		price		farthing)		Id. in	Index of						retail price	retail prices						(8)			s.	d.	s.   d.
