DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OE HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS . GOVERNMENT88Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1951CONFIDENTIALCopy No.C. (51) 2219th November, 1951CABINETBALANCE OF PAYMENTS OF THE COLONIAL territories memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the memorandum which I attach concerns the balance of payments of theColonial territories taken as a whole in relation to the crisis of the sterling area.It sets out the particular position of the Colonies and the extent to which this differs from that of the sterling area as a whole. It suggests the course of action to befollowed so far as the Colonial territories are concerned. . The need to define our policies arises from a number of factors:  (1) It is urgent to decide whether we must ask the Colonies to take measurescorresponding to those which we have decided upon in the UnitedKingdom or which we may be asking the Independent commonwealth to take.(2) Important decisions are about to be taken on the allocation of exports,particularly of steel, to the Commonwealth and the Colonies.(3) The policy to be followed in respect of the Colonies must be settled wellin advance of the Conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers.The main implication of this paper is that we should not ask the Colonies toincrease restrictions on their imports in order to assist the sterling area to correct the overall deficit. The paper goes further and argues that in certain matters theyshould indeed be given specially favourable treatment. The argument is founded,on the facts about the current and expected Colonial surplus. But I want to stresstwo things.Firstly, I do^not underestimate the vital interest of the Colonies in the health of the sterling area; their economic and currency systems are integrated into the sterling system. Their trade depends in large part upon the multilateral tradingsystem of which the sterling area is one of the principal props. If the sterling areacollapsed the economies of most of the Colonial territories would be shaken totheir roots.Secondly, I would stress the political aspects of the problem. We are directly responsible for the welfare of the Colonial peoples. We have preached and --continue to preach the gospel that they must be developed in order to make adequate contribution to the world&apos;s needs and to raise their own standards ofliving, which are for the most part miserably low. A certain amount of progress has been made, but there is undoubtedly a growing feeling of discontent anddissatisfaction at the way in which progress is hampered by decisions taken in theUnited Kingdom limiting the Colonies&apos; freedom to use fully their monetary andfinancial resources for their own development. It may be possible to set othertechnical arguments against some of the technical arguments advanced in theattached paper. But, however that may be, I feel it my duty to warn my colleagues
of the serious political consequences which will follow if we cannot go furthertowards meeting the needs and aspirations of the Colonial peoples on the economicfront than we have been able to do so far.The specific recommendations of the paper for which 1 seek the support of mycolleagues are:-   &apos;(i) United Kingdom policies should be based on a recognition Of the claim- of the Colonies, in present circumstances, to a volume of imports whichpermits both progress in development to continue and some improve-rrients in standards of living to take place even during the rearmamentperiod. This may mean not only efforts to increase total volume ofUnited Kingdom exports, but also, in appropriate cases, according to exports to the Colonies a higher priority than they at present enjoy,and, if necessary, a higher place than exports to the rest of the sterling. area.(ii) There should be more favourable allocations from the United Kingdomof scarce goods which are subject to allocation, notably steel and tin-:       plate.  As regards the former, 250,000 tons per annum would be theminimum consistent with the general policies advocated above.(iii) The question of the import policies which Colonial Governments shouldbe asked to follow should be considered between the Treasury and theColonial Office on the basis that those policies should take accountof the special position of the Colonial balance of payments within the sterling area balance of payments, in so far as this is possible withoutinviting repercussions in the sterling Dominions such as to threaten the unity arid stability of the area.(iv) United Kingdom industry should be encouraged to study more closely. .     and try to meet the present and future demands in the Colonies forconsumer goods.(v) The position should be kept regularly under review interdepartmentally..

annex memorandum on the Implications of the Colonial Balance of PaymentsPosition1. Examination of the balance of payments accounts shows that, whereas the-United Kingdom and the other independent members of the sterling area have been running since 1950 into rapidly increasing deficits in their current accounts with both the dollar area and the rest of the world, the Colonial territories have main-tained,-rand, if present trends and policies continue, will continue to maintain asubstantial surplus.The principal figures are as follows:  Sterling AreaOversea Balance of Payments, 1950-52  million   million   million1950 1951                1952(actual)      (partly forecast) (forecast)United Kingdom current account        ...     ...       +221 -472 -^540Independent Sterling Area current account     ...       -f-101 - 34 -355Bahrain current account   ...     ...     ...     ;..       -t- 14 -f 23 -f- 35Colonies current account..........     -4-131 -j-212 -f 90^otal Sterling Area current account        ...       +467 - 271 -770At the same time the sterling assets of the Colonies in London have now toppedthe  1,000 million mark, having grown by about  400 million during the pasteighteen months. .-2. Part of the Colonies&apos; surplus on current account is attributable to UnitedKingdom military expenditure in the Colonies and direct grants of one type or another to the Colonies. If there were no military expenditure and no direct grants the Colonial surplus would be reduced to  58 million in 1950 and to  124 million(partly estimated) in 1951, whilst the forecast for 1952 would show a slight deficit.On the other hand military expenditure in the Colonies represents services providedby the territories to the forces on the basis of agreed arrangements for sharingdefence expenditure throughout the Colonies, whilst grants in aid of colonial development and Welfare are made as a result of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsrecognition of the need of the Colonies for financial assistance, in view of the widedifferences in the standard of living between the United Kingdom and the Colonies.3. More detailed statistical information is contained in the appendix. Thefigures there quoted indicate that both the general movement referred to above and also the very substantial dollar surplus within the general surplus apply to allthe main regional groups, though in varying degrees. Statistical information for theperiod before 1950 is insufficient to enable a detailed comparison to be made between current figures and those of the early post-war years. The probability is,however, that, although there was an increase of some  100 million in the Colonies&apos;sterling balances over the four years 1946-1950, this was more than cancelled out bymovements of capital in the opposite direction and by a moderate import surplus,so that the Colonies during that period may have had a moderate balance of.payments deficit.     .4. The situation since .1950, which stands out in marked contrast has, ofcourse, been due in the first place to the exceptional increase in the earnings of theColonies due to high prices as a result of rearmament and other world factors. Buthigh prices and earnings by themselves would not have led to a surplus, which only arises because imports have not risen as fast as exports. (In fact, while exports have almost trebled in value between 1948 and 1951 imports have only aboutdoubled.) The surplus is due in fact to two main factors. Firstly, part of the proceeds of the sale of Colonial products have, in these times of high raw material prices, been, creamed off, partly by marketing boards and similar organisations and partly by Governments, and have been laid aside in reserves. This has, ofcourse^ been done deliberately and to a large part it has been done with the sole\  41470 , ----    , b 2
purpose of creating reserves for use for stabilisation or for expenditure on research and development in less prosperous times. To some degree, however, the extentof. the funds so diverted from the producer has also been due to knowledge of theauthorities concerned of the difficulties of obtaining supplies from abroad and consequent fears of inflation. The second series of factors has consisted of the effectof the world situation and decisions taken by other Governments on the available-bility of imported supplies for the Colonial territories. The world-wide shortageof capital goods, particularly steel, and the reduction, since the end of 1950, inthe quantities of the latter; which have been allocated for export to the Coloniesfrom the United Kingdom, have acted as a severe brake on the implementation of development programmes, both public and private, just as they had gainedmbmentum. An increase in the volume of steel imports would not by itself sub-stantially affect the Colonial balance of payments surplus; and the urgent needfor a greater volume of steel exports to the Colonies arises at least as much fromthe crying need of development and the political effect of it being held up for lackof steel in the present balance of payments situation as from that situation itself.Nevertheless, since steel is a key item in development, the increased volume of steelsupplies would generate expenditure on other capital goods as well as consumer goods for those engaged in development and consequently would lead to a muchgreater expansion of the total volume of imports. For consumer goods the position has been rather better; but even in this field more would have been imported ifthere had not been a shortage of supplies of certain kinds of goods, such as hollowware and certain types of textiles (e.g., bafts and shirtings in Nigeria) which are particularly needed in Colonial territories.5. To lay aside reserves in prosperous times is a very sound principle, andit should certainly not be argued that the Colonial territories should never havea balance of payments surplus. Indeed, one of the principal aims of war-timeand post-war policy has been to build up reserves as an insurance against futuredeclines in export earnings. Even on present prospects it will be necessary tomaintain a high absolute level of reserves since it would be imprudent to assume that the current level of earnings could be maintained indefinitely. But reserves are already high and the longer the process of accumulation goes on, the less easyis it to justify, especially in countries where the need for an early rise in a very low standard of living is universally recognised, and at a time when there appearsno early prospect of a substantial decline in raw material prices. The marketing boards in.West. Africa and Uganda have already accumulated very large surplusesindeed and are under sharp criticism for holding down unduly the standard ofliving of the producers whose interests they are meant to represent. Equally,Governments will find it increasingly difficult to get support in Legislatures andfrom the public for the continuation of present taxation levels, let alone theirincrease, if more of the funds accumulated through past taxation cannot be spenton the development which is so urgently needed and for which they were intended.In short, any further substantial deliberate withholding of purchasing power fromthe Colonial producer seems to me to be unjustified and, in all probability, wouldin any case be politically impracticable.6. It seems clear, therefore, that steps must be taken, in so far as it is withinthe power of the United Kingdom to take them, to secure a better flow to theColonies of the supplies which they require and on which they must be allowed to spend their earnings if discontent and severe inflation, with all its dangerouspossibilities, are to be avoided. That this is necessary on grounds of Colonial policycannot be disputed; and in this connection it. must not be forgotten that the UnitedKingdom Government has a special constitutional responsibility for the colonial territories such as it does not have even for other members of the sterling commonwealth. But it is also, it is submitted, in the interests of the UnitedKingdom.itself; for.increased production in the Colonial territories of the rawmaterials and food-stuffs which are so badly needed depends partly on direct investment in that production and on the improvement of basic economic services,such as communications, all of which require capital goods, and partly on animprovement in the physique, morale and willingness to work of Colonial peoples,all ofwhich depend on availability of more consumer goods of the right type.7. In short, at a time when the fall in the value of money would otherwise have gravely limited the effectiveness of the financial assistance being given by HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Colonial development, the relatively high earnings from Colonial products over the last two years have afforded a great opportunity
for making a reality of the policy of Colonial development to which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is pledged without additional cost to the Exchequer and to the greatultimate benefit not only of the Colonies but also of His Majesty&apos;s Government.But, while every effort is made, and will continue to be made, to ensure thatColonial Governments utilise their own available financial resources in prosecutingtheir own development, it is quite fallacious to argue that they do not need themoney which comes to them from outside because they have not got the goods to spend it on. They need both the goods and the money, and failure to provide theone would be no less a reversal of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy than failure to provide the other. - 18. The difficulties which have arisen in the field of supplies were foreseen;and, although the Steering Committee did not feel able to approve some of the suggestions put forward at the official level by the Colonial Office last December,some action has already been taken to deal with the situation. Thus, sincethe liberalisation of trade with Western Europe, the only sources from whichColonial territories are now asked to restrict their imports are the dollar area and Japan. Moreover, although imports from Japan must still be confined to&quot;essentials,&quot; the actual volume of such imports has been allowed gradually toincrease. Again, during the course of 1951, Colonial Governments were encouraged to submit modest supplementary dollar import programmes and, after scrutiny ofthese programmes, the dollar allocations for that year of some Colonial territories were increased. More recently, Colonial Governments hav^ ber.51 authorised to admit under World Open General Licence a limited list oi goods, mainly rawmaterials,. of particular importance for their development programmes. Unfor-unfortunately, however, the effect of these measures will have been offset, and in somecases more than offset, by the increasing difficulty of obtaining supplies from theUnited Kingdom, and, in particular, by the recent drastic reduction in the allocation of steel for export to the Colonies. Accordingly, it now seems necessary both toincrease the flow of supplies to the Colonies from the United Kingdom and alsoto consider some further relaxation in Colonial import restrictions.9. It is recommended that consideration should be given to the following measures:  (i) United Kingdom policies should be based on a recognition of the claim ofthe Colonies, in present circumstances, to a volume of imports whichpermits both progress in development to continue and Some improve-ments in standards of living to take place even during the rearmamentperiod. This may mean not only efforts to increase the total volumeof United Kingdom exports, but also, in appropriate cases, accordingto exports to the Colonies a higher priority than they at present enjoy,and, if necessary, a higher place than exports to the rest of the sterling- area.&apos;(ii) There should be more favourable allocations from the United Kingdom. of goods in short supply which are subject to allocation, notably steel and tinptate. As regards the former, 250,000 tons per annum wouldbe the minimum consistent with general policies advocated -above,(hi) The question of the Import policies which Colonial Governments shouldbe asked to follow should be considered between the Treasury and theColonial Office on the basis that those policies should take account ofthe special position of the Colonial balance of payments within the sterling area balance of payments,, in so far as this is possible withoutinviting repercussions in the sterling Dominions such as to threaten the unity and stability.of the area.(iv) United Kingdom industry should be encouraged to study more closely,------    and to endeavour better to meet, the potential and actual demands inthe Colonies for consumer goods; and(v) The position should be kept regularly under review interdepartmentally.&apos; . APPENDIXBalance of Payments of Colonial Territories since the WarColonial balance of payments figures, similar, to those set out below for theperiod since 1950, are not available for the period between the end of the war andthe end of 1949.  But such information as can be gathered from identified capital
movements shows that there may have been a small current account deficit possiblyaveraging some  25 million per annum which implies that, although the Colonies&apos;sterling balances increased by about  100 million during that period, capital&quot; move-ments in the other direction may have more than offset this. This would not besurprising since, although new development was only beginning Xo gather. momentum towards the end of the period, it was during this period that much ofthe rehabilitation expenditure, private and public, took place, particularly i/tv-Malaya, while there must have been considerable expenditure, on t\vs restockingof consumer goods, particularly in the West Indies.2* The balance of payments figures for 1950, 1951 (partly forecast) and 1952(forecast) show surpluses of  131 million to  212 million ^and  90 million respectively.. ..-&apos; .

Hong Kong&apos;s situation represents a special case which need not be pursued in this paper, but the figures for the remaining Colonial territories can be analysedfurther.Colonial territories (excluding Hong Kong and Malaya)An approximate analysis of the total current account surplus for these territories is:-...        , ,     % - &apos; &apos;&quot; &apos; . v;. ^ &apos; &apos;(  million); .    - 1950 1951       * 1952(1st half only)  (forecast)East and Central Africa 4-9 4-15     \    r25West Africa      ...     ...     ...       4-52      -   4-59     /West Indies -     ...     ... ....       4-1 .4-3. -.

The African territories, in particular, had a large surplus in 1950 and the first half of 1951. As there was undoubtedly some inflow of capital both official and private in this period, there must also have been a much larger outflow of capital and this can be found in the sterling assets which the African territories werebuilding up in London.  The increase was as follows:  ... ..&apos; (  million)- Increase Increase in the. in 1950 1st half of 195\Currency Board holdings      ...     ... 18                 8Disposable Government funds    .    ... 14  -             15Non-disposable Government funds* ... 12                 7Commercial Bank funds        ...... 23                28Official loanstoHisMajesty&apos;sGovernment - 2             - west African Marketing Board securities 20                23Total of above items...... 85                75&quot;* Sinking funds, &amp;c.4. Part Of these increases represent reactions to higher prices, i,e., more local currency and larger local bank balances are likely to be held and therefore the currency authorities and the commercial banks must hold larger funds in London:buoyant local revenues explain another part; and part, the increase in the Marketing.Board securities, arises from the present policy of paying producers less than theworld market price in order to build up reserves for disposal in less favourableyears. A further part, however, must be attributed to an inability to obtain asufficient expansion Of supplies of imported goods.5. The implication of the African forecast for 1952 is that not only are thereno prospects of past accumulations being reduced by increased purchases fromabroad but further accumulations will be made. As some inflow of capital into these territories can be expected in 1952, the addition to their sterling assets is likely tobe well in excess of the  25 million shown in the table above.6. The figures for the West Indies show less startling changes, the main reasonbeing that there has been relatively little increase in the prices of their main exports,notably sugar. Nevertheless, a desirable state of affairs, with capital of all kindsflowing into the West Indies, would be represented by a deficit in the current account and not by a virtual balance. The combined figure for the remaining colonial territories is a residual; although there are a number of special problems the totalsinvolved are relatively small, and no attempt has been made to calculate detailed figures.Malaya7. The high prices of rubber and tin caused export earnings to soar in thelatter half of 1950, and current prices (on which the forecasts are based) are stillhigh enough to keep these earnings at a level more than twice as high as in 1948and 1949. Since Malaya also imports large quantities of rubber and other rawmaterials there has been some increase of imports attributable to this cause, but,in total, the growth of imports has been much smaller. Even when the invisiblepayments to London of the trading surpluses of the rubber and tin companies are brought into the account, Malaya had a large current account surplus in 1950and 1951, and the forecasts for 1952 show essentially the same picture.8. The capital movements which are the counterpart of this current accountsurplus are not easy to trace. All that is known with any certainty is that currency,Government and commercial bank funds held in London increased by  57 million in 1950 and a further  62 million in the first half of 1951. As in the case of the african territories, part of this increase would not have occurred had more imported supplies been available.9. So far, the figures given have referred to the Colonial territories in relationto all countries. Within the total the dollar account, as indicated in the table below, has shown a consistent surplus.

The increase in this surplus since 1949 has, of course, been mainly dueto the large increase since that time in the prices obtained for raw materials sold to the dollar area. But the following table shows that a considerable element inthe particularly favourable showing of the Colonies has been the great degree of restraint exercised by them, as compared with the rest of the sterling area, in their imports from the dollar area:-&apos;   (S million)1948              1950              1951 1952(1st. half at (forecast)annual rate)United Kingdom       ...                1,610             1,192             1,680   &apos; 2,100Independent Sterling Area (ex-cluding South Africa) .    ...         845              . 590               920 1,100*Dependent territories  ...     ...         315               125               1.70 210* Including, for the time being, almost the whole cost to the Sterling Area (apart from UnitedKingdom) of replacing Abadan oil.       :     .      -    -11. The forecasts contain some elements of doubt (e.g., how soon will theUnited States resume its buying of tin for stockpiling purposes?) and the exactlevel of essential dollar requirements in 1952 will not be known until the bulk of import programmes have been received and analysed. Nevertheless, they indicatethat the high dollar-earnipg capacity of the Colonial territories is likely to continue in 1952.
