Investment Programmes Committee&apos; .We Have been instructed to report urgently on the&apos;investment.-programme for 1952 on the following provisional assumptions: ,(a) That the civil building programme, should be reduced sufficiently.to enable...&quot;    90 million of defence building work other than n^aintenance. to be donef at 1950 prices without overloading the building industry.   This is equivalent to  105 million at 1951 prices.(b) That investment in engineering products should be reduced by  100 million per annum at factory prices below the estimated level in 1951.  Thismeans a reduction of  140 million in the plant, machinery and vehicleselement in the present 1952 approved investment programme.We shall report further on the investment programme for 1953.2. For the purpose of this Report we have Ourselves made two further .assumptions:  (i) That if the level of steel supplies in 1952 should exceed present estimates,the increase will have to go first and foremost to exports. There is thus. little prospect of relief for home investment whether in plant or in building.(ii) That it is desired to increase the housing programme.3. The present investment programme for 1952, in terms of end-1951 prices,is given in the following Table, together with, for comparison, estimates of theoutturn of investment in 1950 and 1951. We have made an overall increase of about15 per cent, in respect of the increase in prices since the compilation of the previousprogramme:-- . .....TABLE i .: ,Gross Fixed Investment-   million at end-] 951 prices	1950	1951   .

The building part of the programme for 1952 is much in excess of the resources available and, even so, does not provide for an increase in housing or for certain other increased demands of high essentiality. On the plant and machinery sideit is far more than can be done without a fall in exports if the defence programme is achieved. ;The Building programme. The output of the building industry increased by 5-6 per cent, perannum in 1949 and 1950 with a constant labour force. It is still far below the pre-war level. The programme for 1951-53 assumes an increase of 5 per cent, perannum, but the achievement in 1951 is estimated to be rather less than in 1950.As a result there is a general state of overload. Far more work has been approvedthan can be undertaken with the materials and labour available. This is due to a: combination of the following factors: (a) The addition at the end of 1950 of some  80 million of defence work to the1951 programme. The volume of other work being attempted was not-    reduced either sufficiently, or soon enough, to balance this addition,which was forced into the programme with priority starting dates.(b) Adverse weather last winter and spring.(c) Shortage of building steel, and to some extent of bricks, during 1951.The present position is that,except in certain outlying areas (e.g. Wales, West Countryand the north of Scotland) the building industry is generally overloaded, and startingdates (except for defence projects) are being deferred from three to nine months.(Housing does not come under the starting date procedure.)5. Optimum building output is obtained by attempting a programme rather less than the best that could in theory be achieved, because this ensures a readyflow of materials to work in hand.  The benefit comes in quicker completions.6. The remedy for the present situation is therefore to defer new starts andcut down the building programme to a size which will accord reasonably withthe labour and materials available. Unless this is done there will be general delaydue to shortages.. 7.  After discussions with those concerned we have reached the following conclusions about building materials and labour. : (a) Bricks. A 10 per cent, increase of output over 1951 would be feasiblein favourable conditions, but the labour supply in the brickyards is very uncertain. This would give 600 million more bricks in 1952. In 1953a further increase of 400 million might be achieved.(b) Cement-There should be enough for home requirements and exports atpresent levels.(c) Building steel. It will not be possible in 1952 as a whole to increasematerially the rate of allocation approved for the first quarter of 1952(i.e. 231,000 tons) which is believed to be less than was actually usedin 1950. We understand that the general steel position is so acute- that no more steel.can be diverted to building without serious effects on other work.(d) Labour-No increase in the number of craftsmen is feasible. They may even decline in number through failure to replace losses. Adult training is very desirable but attempts to arrange this have failed hitherto. Inany case it could not now alleviate the position in 1952.These factors affect different parts of the building programme differently. Annex Ishows, the component elements classified by consumption of building steel per 1 million of new building work. The top groups in this classification use about twenty-five times as much steel as the bottom groups, and unfortunately includethe investment which is most essential for raising the level of industrial production.Very large reductions in the lower groups would be required to alleviate to an appreciable extent the severe shortage of steel which is affecting the middle and-higher groups. On the other hand, brick requirements for industrial building,though substantial are not relatively so high as for those categories of work whichuse little steel, e.g. housing, health services.
8. Our general conclusion is that output of building work in the heavy steel-using groups in 1952 cannot exceed and may fall short of 1950, on the assumptionthat no more steel can be made available. Therefore we have endeavoured toimpose the largest cuts on those heavy steel-using programmes which, althoughimportant, must give way to other more basic investment needs which must be protected as far as possible. On the assumption that the building steel allocationremains at or about the present level serious consequences cannot be avoided,particularly on the programmes for manufacturing industry, and water and sewerage, in which much work already licensed and some in progress will have tocome to a stop.The Housing programme . The Ministry of Housing and the Department of Health for Scotland have proposed to us that the combined housing programme for England and wales and Scotland should be:  1952       ...     ...      ...     230,000 houses1953.......     ...     260,000 houses1954.      ...     ... 300,000 houses,compared with 200,000 houses in the previous programme. They put the costof this programme as  371 million in 1952, an addition of  30 million (at 1951prices) to the approved programme. The Ministry of Housing estimate thatin 1953 25 per cent, of the houses completed might be of the new type. 25 percent, might also be built under private licence.. These would, we understand, tendto be larger than the type of house hitherto built by the local authorities, and sooffset some savings from the adoption of the new standards. By 1954 the new types may fill half the whole programme.10. The 1952 housing programme.is already largely planned and there willbe virtually no savings in labour and materials in that year from the new types ofhouses. The programme proposed by the Departments will, therefore, requireabout 15 percent more bricks and labour than in 1951. The additional brickrequirement is about 600 million more than in 1951. This is equivalent to thewhole of the probable increase in output. The additional labour will have to comeeither from an increase in productivity by the existing labour force engaged on housing,&apos; or from labour drawn away from other work. Even if there were in1952 an increase of 6 per cent, in productivity by labour now working on housing,this would provide only about 12,000 additional houses, leaving 18,000 to beprovided for at the expense of other work.11. In 1953 it is expected that the requirements of labour and materials for additional houses will be found only to a small extent from savings from theinclusion of the new types of houses in the programme. Even if productivityon housing and on other building work which uses little steel rises by 8 per cent,between 1950 and 1953 additional labour and resources would have to be found from other forms of building work for another 30,000 houses in 1953. Another500 million bricks would be needed, which is the whole of the further increase ofbrick production which might be obtained in 1953.12. The proposed housing programme will require approximately anadditional 45,000 standards of softwood in 1952, and an additional 90,000 standards in 1953. This can only be found in 1952 by increasing imports from non-sterlingsources or by raiding the strategic stockpile.Investment Linked with Housing13; The housing programme gives rise directly to a substantial volume of investment in. other programmes for example, water and sewerage, electricity,gas, schools, roads, railway facilities, and-postal and telephone work. Morechurches, shops, public houses, health service buildings, and, in the case of new towns, factories, offices, entertainments and municipal buildings have to beprovided. On a broad estimate this investment might be put at about  50 million ayear Tor a housing programme of 200,000 houses. Ari increase in the housing programme entails an increase in this ancillary investment.,&apos;-  4.1583 .:.;:;  - .;   s : ,y .      .&apos;-      b 2 ,
Recommendations14. Our recomehdations are based on discussions, necessarily brief, with theDepartments who control large programmes, but rest solely on our own judgment.Since the function of the Investment Programmes Committee is arbitral the pro-posals do not carry the agreement of the Departments concerned.&apos; We must makeit clear that nearly all the proposals for reductions are regarded by the officials concerned with the particular programmes as seriously damaging. In the caseof .some nationalised industries, it has not in all cases been possible in the time&apos;available to get the views of nationalised Boards, - -&quot;15.  The main principles.of our proposals are: (1) That the revised programme in money terms should be somewhat above what can be achieved with the probable availability of building steel.. This allows for greater emphasis in departmental programmes in projects which require little steel. Under our proposals building steel require-ments will be 10-15 per cent, above Current availability on theassumption that the steel requirements are reduced in proportion to expenditure on new work.(2) That the total building programme, including housing, should not exceed. 1950 levels except in so far as an increase in productivity can be expectedon housing work, and some allowance can be made for transfer oflabour now on maintenance work.  &quot;(3) That plant and machinery and vehicles should be reduced where the leasteconomic damage is likely to result, and so far as possible in harmony with the reductions in building.Table II summarises our proposals:   -TABLE IIGross Fixed Investment .  million at end-1951. prices	1950	1951 estimate	1952 Approved pro-gramme	&apos; 1952 Recommendation(*)							New building	Plant	Building repairs	TotalCivil investment- .

These proposals are set out in\more detail in Annex II, and it is the programmes there given which are now put forward for Ministerial consideration.
Annex III summarises the effects on individual programmes. The main conse-quences and decisions involved are as follows:  Fuel and PowerCoal, coke ovens and petroleum receive .the programmes asked for. the petroleum programme is, we are informed, above the level which can be achievedwith the current steel allocation, but it is all directly contributing to dollar savingand&apos;gives a high return on the steel used. We have, therefore, not proposed any reduction in it.    - . &quot;Electricity -.  ;:.&apos;.&apos;.-. &apos;A reduction of  8 million is proposed. A restriction of this programme in1952 will also produce a saving in total investment expenditure in 1953, when theelectricity programme proposed by the Ministry of Fuel and Power will otherwiseincrease by another  20 million. We have emphasised before the need for measuresto restrict domestic peak demand for electricity as an alternative to the rapid increase in investment in new capacity. If the reduction we propose is made, thiswill be all the more necessary. The programme put forward by the british electricity Authority provides for an increase in the volume of work on distributionof  4 million in 1952&quot; over 1951, and we think that considerable savings might bemade in this field. We are advised that.about  2 million could be saved in 1952by an immediate decision to discontinue rural electrification, which is a most costlyform of investment. In so far as the savings proposed cannot be made ondistribution, they will entail some slowing down of the construction of power stations and the installation of new generating plant. In view of the prospectivedifficulties in meeting the demand for electricity at peak hours, this is a serious matter. . On present estimates of demand, it would prolong beyond 1956 the period during which there will still be a considerable shortage at peak hours in coldweather in a normal winter, and therefore a continued need for organised loadspreading. The implications of this are such that the matter might have to be madethe subject of a public statement. In view, however, of the extreme difficulties whichwill result-from the shortage of steel for manufacturing industry and other important programmes and the necessity of finding more steel for investment inpetroleum, we think that the proposed reduction should nevertheless be made.GasA reduction of  4 million on the approved programme. A much largerprogramme is desired and would be feasible if there were steel available.Transport and CommunicationsRailways. Our recommendation is probably rather above what the steelallocation, continued at the present levels, will allow to be done. Even so, therewill have to be a considerable reduction in the production of rolling-stock, though we hope that the wagon programme will be protected as far as possible. Providedthat steel can be made available it should be possible to achieve the desired level. of track maintenance. We. have received representations, signed personally by the chairmen of the Railway Executive and the Transport Commission, asking for asubstantial increase in the Railway Executive programme for 1952 and a further increase in 1953. Though we recognise the high importance of railway investment,we cannot feel that these proposals are practicable in present circumstances, havingregard to the shortage of steel.Ships.^Om proposal is in line with the steel allocation. The output of new ships will be reduced to 10 per cent, below current levels at a time when order books are fuller than ever before. Shipbuilding is a large contributor to exports,both visible and invisible, and also to defence needs. The Admiralty expect that labour will be lost to the industry if this reduction takes place and urge the serious-ness of this for the future, both in peace and war. We understand that it is notpossible to allocate steel to the shipbuilding industry in such a way as to favourproduction of ships for United Kingdom owners as distinct from foreign owners,and that there is no other way of securing this result..   Motor Vehicles.-Supplies for home use would be reduced to 60,000-commercial vehicles and 60,000 passenger cars.   This is 25 per cent, below the reduced quotas already envisaged for next year and a much larger reduction on the .
supplies made available in 1951. It is uncertain whether more vehicles can be soldabroad as 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the output is already exported. The result ofthe proposal may therefore be to reduce the total output and divert steel to other purposes. The Ministry of Supply have pointed out that in a mass production ofthis kind reduction of total output raises costs and reduces competitive power inforeign markets. This will be to some extent offset by the defence orders placed onmotor industry firms. -- .Agriculture /&apos; &apos;A reduction of 30 per cent, in agricultural machinery for home use is proposed,and a cut of  3-5 million, or about 15 per cent, on building including farm building and arterial water courses.Social ServicesHousing.-We propose that the increase in the housing programme shouldbe 15,000 houses as compared with the 30,000 houses proposed by the HousingDepartments. Our reasons for making this proposal are more fully set out inparagraph 18 below.Water and Sewerage.-The major part of this programme, other than worklinked with housing, will, we are informed, have to stop in mid-progress, though some of it is essential for important industrial development work planned or in prospect.Education. In the general circumstances set out in this Report we have felt it tobe necessary to propose a substantial cut in the educational building programme of 7-4 million for England and Wales and  i million for Scotland. This will notbe achieved unless the rate of new starts in 1952 is closely restricted. We thinkthat if approval is given to the limited programme that we propose, it shouldbe made clear that it may not be possible to provide the steel required to achieveall the steel-using work which the Ministry would like to undertake within this total.Health Services. No new work using much steel could be begun and somemay have to stop. There is urgent need for the construction of new hospitals, bothgeneral and mental. Improvements are required at many hospitals to raise the .administrative efficiency, and new increased provision for old people&apos;s homes. Onthe proposed level of investment the standard of the service will, we are advised,deteriorate.Manufacturing IndustryOver the whole field a reduction of about 25 per cent, in new building work is proposed. This means that very few new projects can be licensed in 1952 except at the cost of stopping work already licensed. Since some projects must beallowed to start a considerable amount of building work already licensed andsome now in progress will have to be stopped. Our proposal is rather less severethan the current level of building steel allocation, but there must be some scope for allowing buildings in this field to proceed when they use less steel&quot; and morebricks than the average. So far as this can be done it is, in our view, highly desirable that it should be done. The purchase of plant and machinery by manu-facturing industry are estimated at about  310 million in 1950 at present prices.To some extent not precisely determinable and varying in different fields thisinvestment is linked with new building work. But the reductions in new building will, if approved, not affect the demand for plant and machinery very much in1952. There is no form of control over investment in plant and machinery for replacement purposes. In order to obtain the full reduction required,  140 million in the 1952 programme, it will be necessary to reduce this total of  310 million by about. 15 per cent. A corresponding reduction is required in investment inmiscellaneous plant &quot;and machinery, which amounted to about  70 million in 1950.Control of Plant and Machinery Investment17.  It is not possible to control home investment of this type satisfactorilyThrbughsteel alone because, if output is restricted, home demand may, and often does&quot;,displace exports. Since the objective is to raise exports of this machinery quicklyspecial measures will have to be taken.  The same problem in effect arises on
investment in vehicles and agricultural machinery. The methods of controllinginvestment in this field on which we have hitherto relied are:  (a) restriction of building licensing; &quot;(ft) exhortation by the Ministry of Supply to the engineering industry to export up to fixed proportions of their product, or as with the motor industry-to observe voluntarily a home market quota. Backed bythe control of steel distribution, this will become more effective.(c) fiscal measures-for example, purchase tax on cars and commercial vehicles,and the withdrawal of initial taxation allowances which was announcedlast April and will take effect in April next.To achieve a reduction of the size now needed these three methods are probablyinadequate, (a) is slow and only partial in its effects, (b) operated adequatelyso long as total supplies for home and export were increasing, but will be much less effective for reducing an existing level of home supply in the face of risinghome demand and (c) is designed to lower the general level of demand but hasnot yet had any noticeable effect on the problem. We have not been able in thetime available to measure this problem in detail but we have discussed it withthe Ministry of Supply.  In bur view the field of possible new measures is: -(i) a compulsory system of licences to acquire plant and machinery abovecertain value levels;(ii) a compulsory system of limitation of sales to the home market applied atthe manufacturing end. This would make if-ap ofgnce for a firm tosell in the home market more than X per cent, of what it sold in a baseperiod;(iii) further fiscal or credit measures.A system of limitation of supplies ((ii) above) is a statutory form of what is nowdone by the exhortation by the Ministry of Supply to export. In our view thisis the most hopeful line and likely to produce less formidable administrative diffi-culties than license to acquire. License to acquire makes possible discrimination between firms, but if adopted on a large scale necessitates the employment of alarge force of technicians to advise on the respective merits of applications for licences. It may be, however, that to achieve the result needed, a blend of all threetypes of measures is required. We recommend that a closer examination of these possibilities be made by officials as soon as possible. It would, no doubt, be desir-able thereafter for the whole matter to be discussed with leaders of industry at a high level.The Effects of a Further Increase in the Housing Programme18. In spite of the severity of the cuts imposed and the adverse consequences which will follow, the total of new building work other than housing to be donein 1952 under the reduced programme will be approximately the same as in 1950.The question is, therefore, how far the housing programme can be increased withoutoverloading the building industry if no further cuts are made in other building programmes. In paragraph 10 above we have shown that labour &quot;for 12,000 addi-tional houses might be found in 1952 if there were a 6 per cent, increase in productivity by the existing housing labour force. This is a higher increase than we believe to be probable. The Ministry think that labour can be drawn away from minor maintenance work. A total of the order of  740 million* maintenance and repair work is done each year. Over half of this is minor maintenance work,below the licensing limits, to houses and business premises. Large maintenance jobsare licensed and have been closely restricted for two years. In our view it is neither desirable that much labour should be drawn away from necessary large-maintenance work nor probable that any considerable balanced labour force for housing can be found in this way. We, therefore, conclude that if a programme of230,000 houses in 1952 were adopted, this would mean that the labour for at least18,000 houses would have to come from other work, and that most of this wouldhave to be drawn away from other new building work. If this is a correct assessmentit follows in our judgment that, if a continuing state of overload is to be avoided,and if the full housing programme is to be undertaken the right course would be to restrict new building work other than housing below 1950 levels during 1952.. * This estimate is based not on the number of men employed but on the returns made by firms to the Ministry of Works of the value of work done from the total of which is deducted the totalof work licensed.
This would mean increasing the cuts now proposed at thg-expense of building work in progress, and, in particular, would mean a further restriction of building for industrial purposes. For this reason we recommend that the increase in thehousing programme in 1952 should not exceed 15,000 houses. This number might,on an optimistic view, be manned by increased output of the existing labour forceand some withdrawaf-of-labour from minor maintenance, and would absorb halfof the additional brick supplies which seem probable in 1952, leaving^some marginto take care of local shortages and to allow for increased use of bricks for-industrial&apos;building in lieu of steel.  ... &apos; - &apos; -- .- - k .If, in spite of these considerations, it is decided to aim at a farget.of 30,000&apos;morehouses*in.l952, then we think that this can only be done without overloading.thebuilding industry and prejudicing the accomplishment of other building programmesat the reduced levels now recommended if housing is brought within the starting-date procedure. - It is through this procedure that flexibility according to localconditions and the progress of&apos;? productivity in the building industry can best beachieved.  The Housing Departments are, however, opposed to this proposal.Flexibility in the Programme19. The starting-date system provides a degree of flexibility but it does notat present apply to housing or to work done by local authorities and others withtheir own direct labour, which are a large, part of the whole. Flexibility is also provided by the fact that Departments have general discretion within their programmes as to what work they do and where they do it. There is nothing to stop houses or schools being built first where early starting dates can be given,provided the total programme in money terms is not exceeded, though, of course,the greatest needs may be elsewhere. It has often been proposed that there shouldbe discretion to license maintenance work more freely in the lightly loaded areaswhenever building labour is in danger of under-employment. This has much to commend it, but it seems to us inconsistent with the objective of drawing labouraway from maintenance and repair work to the housing programme, defence workand other essential building. It will be possible to adjust regional ceilings for maintenance work relatively to one another when the 15 per cent, increase for prices is distributed, to the regions, and the underloaded regions could then befavoured. On the whole, we do not favour this proposal, but if it is decided tohave a system of this kind we think it should be confined to licensed maintenance work and to conversion and improvement work on housing. Apart from this, thedevelopment of any real slack in the system should be the occasion of a special review of the programme.Halting Work in Progress r20. We are advised that work in progress can be stopped by the cancellation of licences without incurring legal penalties. This was done in 1947, when 269 licenceswere in fact revoked. Cancellations should, so far as possible, only be made inthe early stages of building work and before steel erection has begun. Where a building has to.be slowed down or stopped at a later stage it may be more appro-priate to achieve this by restricting the steel allocation, but in all cases where work has not begun it is clearly desirable to inform the promoter definitely if the prospectis that the project cannot proceed. - :Relation of the Investment Programme to the Steel Allocations21. It should be made clear that it is not possible to draw up programmes in terms of money which accord accurately with any given level of steel supply.The programme we now put forward allows a considerable margin to enabieDepartments to switch to work which uses little steel. To the extent that they can do this they will be able to spend up to the limit of the programme. It follows thatapproval- of the investment programme at any given level must not be taken to imply that the full steel requirements for the programme can necessarily be met inthe steel allocations. -A;    incement *22. If proposals on these lines are approved it will be necessary for an earlypublic statement to be made on the circumstances which give rise to them. the cuts on manufacturing industry, for example, can clearly not be imposed withouton authoritative Ministerial statement.
Northern Ireland23. We have made no reduction in this, but, since Northern Ireland may not get the steel required, there may be a shortfall in the programme.conclusions the approval of Ministers is sought for-(a) the programme for 1952 revised as proposed in the last column of the table in Annex II, subject to their decision on the size of the housing programme in 1952;(b) in particular, to the reductions proposed in the Electricity programme inparagraph 16, involving suspension of the rural electrification develop-ment; -(c) further examination by officials of the methods of controlling plant,machinery and vehicle investment discussed in paragraph&quot; 17;(d) acceptance of the principle that building work in progress must be stoppedwhere necessary to implement the programme;(e) the preparation by the Investment Programmes Committee of more detailed proposals for 1953 for consideration by Ministers.41583c

ANNEX III -.      INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES - JDeep Mined Coal1. The National Coal Board have-hitherto failed to achieve their authorisedinvestment programme. Thus in 1951 capital expenditure is unlikely to exceed 28-7 million despite price increases, compared with the approved amount of 36-8 million, which was itself  3 million less than what the N.C.B. expected to do a year ago. Among the reasons given by the Coal Board are lack of planning staff, unexpected difficulties in executing the work, and shortages of mining^machinery and equipment caused indirectly by the Defence programme.2. The Ministry of Fuel and Power have now submitted a revised programmeamounting to  33 million for 1952 and  38 million for 1953 which is stated to bemaximum investment realisable. (These fall substantially below the previouslyapproved levels of  44 million and  46 million respectively.) We recommend thatthe current proposals should be accepted without any diminution whatsoever.Indeed, in view of the vital importance &quot;of increasing coal production, it is essentialthat the N.C.B. should make every possible effort to achieve the greatest practicablerate of investment in the mines even if this entails exceeding in real terms the present proposals.Hard Coke3. Hard coke-making capacity must be increased as adequate supplies ofmetallurgical coke are essential to the expanding steel production programme,especially as the steel industry is becoming increasingly dependent upon pig ironsupplies, to a growing extent from lean home ores. Accordingly we propose thatthis programme should not be cut.Electricity (British Electricity Authority)4. The British Electricity Authority have proposed a programme of 160 million for 1952. This provides for an increase in expenditure on distributionof  9 million of which  4 million is due to increased volume of work. Some increase will result from, the increase in the housing programme and some further expenditure on reinforcement is no doubt unavoidable, but a reduction of about 2 million can be made if a decision is taken to suspend rural electrification, andthere may be room for some reductions elsewhere. The residue of the cut will fallon generation and main transmission with the broad consequences indicated inparagraph 16 of this Report.North of Scotland Hydro-Electric board. Work on the Board&apos;s projects has been running at a level rate for several years. They now propose that capital expenditure in 1952 should be maintained at the earlier approved level of  14 million, despite the rise in prices, thus makinga reduction in real terms. We recommend that this programme should be accepted for 1952 so that a sufficient labour force may be maintained to permit an orderlycontinuation of the schemes. Steel supplies may not be as large as desired by theBoard but we understand that they can continue non-steel using work.Gas6. The Ministry of Fuel and Power, in Consultation with the Gas Council,have drastically reduced the investment requirements of the Area Boards for 1952in order to bring them into relation with the capacity of the gas plant manufacturers and. the availability of specialised components; Even so the programme putforward is substantially higher, in real terms, than that already authorised. the justification for this is the present inability of the gas industry to meet large new industrial demands, the likelihood of widespread gas shortages in spells of severe weather, and the need to improve the efficiency of many gas plants.
7. There is undoubtedly a cogent case for more investment in this sector.Other needs are, however, relatively more urgent, and it is unlikely that sufficientsteel would be available to permit a programme of the size envisaged. Accordinglywe recommend that investment should be reduced to  48 million, which is equivalent in real terms to a cut of 5 per cent, on the previously authorised programme.Within the reduced total available to them we consider that development work should be, as far as possible, concentrated in those areas where the shortages are most acute. -&apos; Petroleum   .8. As indicated in Paragraph 16 of the main report this programme is of vital importance in saving dollar expenditure and should not be.curtailed. Un-fortunately it requires a considerable tonnage of steel, larger than the amountallocated for Period I, 1952. The return on each ton of steel is, however, very high and we consider that more steel must be found for it.Railways9. The -British Transport Commission and the Railway Executive have repre-sented to us that it is now imperative to restore the full efficiency of the track;to repair a large number of structures which, if left alone, will become more andmore dilapidated; and to strengthen the rolling stock by renewal. The proposalsthey have made to us are designed to increase the current level of investment inorder to overtake arrears of maintenance and renewal and to start a small amountof new development work. We regard the case which has been made opt asextremely strong. Unfortunately, to carry out a programme such as has been proposed the Railways would need considerably more steel in 1952 than they usedm 1950. We do not believe that such quantities can be made available. Wetherefore recommend that the Railway Executive should reduce the new building work which they propose to start in 1952 by two-thirds and should make a verylarge reduction in the coaching stock they plan to build. We consider that their proposals for new wagons and locomotives should not be cut. Although we havedoubts as to whether there will be enough steel for their maintenance proposals we propose no cut on this item.10.. We recommend that the London Transport Executive should also reducethe new building work which they propose to start in 1952 by two-thirds, but we: do not consider that any cut on their rolling stock programme would be possiblein 1952.Roads ^ &apos;. /-11. We recommend that the Ministry of Transports proposals for themaintenance of roads be accepted. The volume of maintenance work on trunk roads and on classified roads in counties should be kept at the present level. Therequest which has been made to highway authorities to reduce the level of main-tenance on unclassified roads should not be withdrawn.12. We recommend a cut of  0-7 million on the Ministry&apos;s proposals for new works. It will be possible to start very few new road works in 1952 and these willbe ancillary to other programmes (e.g., in New Towns).... 13. A request was made by the Ministry of Transport to be allowed to spend 1-5 million a year, over and above what they had included in their programme,on a large number of small road improvement schemes which might help to reducethe accident rate on the roads. Whilst appreciative of the desirability of effectingsuch improvements we feel that in present circumstances much the same end mightbe achieved by earmarking a small part of the amount spent on maintenance,much of which in any case covers improvement schemes for this specific purpose.Ports14. The Ports-investment programme is intended to replace war damage, toimprove efficiency at the ports and to improve the working conditions of dockers:A cut of  1-9 million on this programme would allow all work in progress tocontinue but would not enable any new major works to be started in 1952 andwould cut new minor works to one half of the level proposed by the Ministry.
New starts in 1952 would be limited to those small works which are urgent and essential on safety grounds.Inland Waterways &apos;*15.  This programme does not include any new major works, but only minor improvements.  No cut on this programme is proposed.Civil Aviation16. It is probable that the conflicting demands of military aircraft will not permit the achievement of the civil aircraft investment programme. accordingly the major part of the reduction we recommend is on aircraft.Post Office17. The Post Office has cut its proposals for civil investment very severelyin order to free men and material for the large amount of defence work which itis undertaking. Most of the Post Office civil work will be inextricably linked with defence work. The programme has been planned so that provision for civil needsis made at the same time and place that.defence work is done. Although the civil work which is to be done in this way would not normally be given very high priorityby the Post Office this civil work will have to be done eventually and it would be most uneconomic not to do it at the same time as the defence work is done. Verylittle of the civil work which the Post Office would normally wish to do has been included in their programme, but we consider that it should be possible to achieve a small reduction on this work.Ships -18. The shipyards have a large volume of orders on hand both on UnitedKingdom and overseas account. The Admiralty and the Ministry of transport would like at least to maintain the level of activity of the last few years. the objective for British shipbuilding at the present is to supply the growing numberof tankers which are now necessary and to modernise the dry cargo and passengerfleet. Ships are a valuable war potential. Even those sold abroad go to friendlycountries and would be available to us in time of war. Unfortunately the ship-building industry consumes very large quantities of steel which are unlikely to beavailable. On the present steel allocation the Admiralty intimated that their present programme would have to be cut by about 10 per cent, and that this reduction would have to fall on both United Kingdom and foreign orders alike. We cannot see any way of avoiding this cut of 10 per cent, in the programme.Agriculture19. We recommend that agricultural building, including farm building andarterial watercourses, be cut by about 15 per cent. We believe that a relatively small cut on the volume of work in this programme can considerably reduce the steel requirements since it is only a small part of the work (e.g., arterial watercoursesand farm water supplies) which needs substantial quantities of steel.20. We recommend that the Scottish programme be reduced from  0 - 45-million to  0-40 million and that the Fisheries programmes for England and wales and for Scotland each be reduced by  0-2 million.  It will not then be possible to begin any new major works in 1952.21. We recommend that supplies of agricultural machinery and tractors to thehome market should be cut by 30 per cent, below the programme previouslyapproved. This will enable exports to be increased or the steel requirements ofthe industry to be reduced. This reduction of supplies to the home market could,we understand, be achieved by voluntary co-operation of the manufacturers ofagricultural machinery and implements.Iron and Steel22. We recommend a small cut on the programme previously approved. Theprogramme we recommend will allow work to be begun in 1952 on several blastfurnaces, on ore preparation plant and on two mills for the production of bearingtubes. We understand that the industry would also wish to embark on large-scale development schemes in 1952. We consider, however, that in present circumstancessuch schemes must be postponed.41583 -     &apos; :   E
HeaIthvSiervir.es-a       - .25. This programme covers hospitals, clinics, old peoples&apos; homes, health centres arid nurseries. The most important work in this programme is that intendedto relieve overcrowding in mental hospitals and to provide hospitals and clinics in new Towns and on new housing estates. The reduction we propose is very severebut we were informed that it is broadly in line with what could be done if theprovisional building steel allocation for the first quarter of 1952 were maintainedthroughout the year. This level of steel supplies will make it necessary to stopsome work already in progress. Since the proposals of the Department of health for Scotland are very modest in relation to the programme previously approved, we propose that the cut on the Scottish programme should be less severe than that onEngland and Wales.Water and Sewerage26. The water and sewerage programme for England and Wales has been running above the previously authorised level, mainly because the schemes involved are generally large and take many years to complete so that the decisions to reduceinvestment could not be implemented quickly. The programme for 1952, recentlyput forward by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, is for the expendi-ture of  36 million, which exceeds the authorised programme by nearly 50 per cent.Such a programme would involve considerable quantities of building steel, whichwill not be available. Accordingly, we recommend that it should be reduced to 24 million. We are informed that this will entail stopping work in progress with consequent locking up of valuable resources in idleness. In straitened circum-stances, however, it is less undesirable to postpone such long-term projects thanschemes which yield an earlier return.Miscellaneous Local Services27, This programme covers all investment by local authoric, England and&apos; Wales which is not included in other programmes. The biggesi items are privatestreet works, parks, offices, public halls, libraries, piers, sea defence works, andpublic cleansing and refuse disposal services The Ministry has proposed that this programme should be raised from the  5 million previously approved to  7 million.We consider, however, that much of this work is inessential and that the programme should be reduced to  3-5 million. Of the programme proposed by the Ministry 1 million is maintenance work and about  3 million is new work already approvedby the Ministry, although some of the work approved has not yet been started.It will be necessary, therefore, to withdraw some approvals and it may be necessaryto stop some work in progress. .       * .    -Manufacturing Industry23. The Departmental proposals for new building for manufacturing industryin 1952 are framed on very modest lines and represent a smaller volume of work. than was done in 1950.  We have no doubt that these proposals are far below what it would be profitable arid desirable to invest in manufacturing industry.24. We propose that the Departmental proposals should be reduced by about one-quarter. We understand that in general these cuts are less severe.than thosewhich are likely to be enforced by the building steel allocation if the present levelof allocation is maintained for the whole of 1952. Nevertheless, the consequences of the cuts we propose will be very severe. In general, the reduced programmesallow for no more work than has already been licensed. Since the Departmentsmust issue licences in 1952 for some highly essential projects, such as sulphuric acidplants and work specified by the factory inspectors, they will find it necessary to review the licences already issued and to revoke the less essential. Although work has hot yet started on some of the projects already licensed it will probably benecessary to stop some work which is now in the early stages of construction. this may be done either by the revocation of licences or by an intimation that it willnot be possible to allocate any steel for these projects.
Education28. We recommend a cut of  7-4 million on the Education programme for-England and Wales. We believe that the effects of this cut will be less severethan woi^d be the effects of the provisional building steel allocation for this,programme (of 10,000 tons in the first quarter of 1952) if it were continued forthe whole of 1952. Nevertheless, ij; will not be possible on the prograrnme werecommend to start work on any new.schools until late in 1952..- This will lead.to grave difficulties in areas&apos;where the^-school population is rapidly rising and: wherenew housing estates are being built at a distance from existing schools, these problems will become especially acute in 1954 and 1955. Although the cut we propose,on the Scottish pVogi&amp;ihme is proportionately less than that on Englandand Wales the effects of this cut will.be of the same character. ;&apos;  -.Universities &apos;29. . In order to save steel we recommend that the Universities should not startwork on any new major projects in 1952. We recommend, therefore, that theUniversity Grants Committee&apos;s proposals for new building work in 1952 be reducedby  150,000. We recommend a small increase in the programme for maintenance work above that previously approved.Home Departments30. The reduction, we propose will allow the Home Office to start less thanone-sixth of the new work in their programme for 1952. The work to be cut outincludes new cells at prisons, the conversion of existing premises into childrenYhomes, heating installations at approved schools, the replacement of police stations and fire stations, a public house, and police stations in new housing areas. our proposal is  0-4 million below the Home. Office&apos;s absolute minimum requirement.We propose that the proportionate reduction, on the Scottish Home Departmentsprogramme should be the same as on the Home Office&apos;s programme.B.B.C. ^ -. ;&apos; .:;03TT All the major works in this programme are already well under way.About  0-4 million is proposed for minor works, including those already started.A cut of  0-2 million is unlikely to allow the B.B.C. to begin any new work in 1952other than what is essential on safety grounds.Northern Ireland32. We have not in the time available been able to discuss with the NorthernIreland Departments concerned the review of their investment programme. in real terms this is in accordance with the programme they drew up a year ago.In view of the special difficulties of Northern Ireland, in particular the.higher levelof unemployment, it seems unexceptionable that the previous level -of investment should be maintained as an objective. But it seems clear that the shortage of somematerials, in particular building steel, will have adverse effects. Accordingly wethink that it is unlikely that as much will be achieved as is hoped for. The situation may be eased, however, if the building programme can be adjusted so that more work is done on projects which require but little steel.Miscellaneous Sector33. This sector covers a wide and varied range of investment. Only thelicensed building work, however, is subject to control and the rest of this sectoris no more than&quot; a reasonable estimate on the basis of past experience.34.  Our recommendations for the licensed building work in this sector are asfollows:-  P-]    -&apos;: &quot; . .v;.-\.&apos;:&apos;..-.. - &quot;(a) Board of Trade. This programme covers insurance offices, hotels, ware-houses, laundries, &amp;c.   We recommend a cut of about 40 per cent..*. on. this work. The Board of Trade should be permitted to use partof its allocation for manufacturing industry for this work if it wishes to do so. &apos;.&apos;
(b) Ministry of Food-This programme covers slaughterhouses, catering, eggpacking, grain drying and storage, &amp;c. We recommend a cut of about40 per cent, on this work. The Ministry of Food should be permitted;   to use part of its allocation for manufacturing industry for this work ifit wishes to do so.(c) Ministry of Transport. This programme covers building for the road transport industry and a small amount of other work. We recommenda cut of about 30 per cent.(d) Blitzed Cities-This programme covers the rebuilding of the centres oft)rovincial blitzed cities. The present programme of  4 million is notarge in relation to the demand, but since the greater part of this workconsists of rebuilding shops and offices its economic value is small.We recommend a cut from the  4 million at present approved to 2-5 million. This will necessitate the stopping of work in progress, but. ;    we consider that steel should not be made available for this work, when-it is impossible to find steel for important industrial projects, often inthe same areas.   The Ministry of Housing and Local Governmenti propose to tell the authorities concerned to concentrate on work whichuses little steel.   If this is done we believe that the amount of steelrequired for a programme of  2-5 million should be very small.(e) New Towns-This programme covers work on offices, shops, town centres,public houses, industrial sites, churches, &amp;c. in the New Towns. Werecommend a 25 per cent, cut since we consider that this work should bekept down to a very austere basis for the present.if) Ministry of Works. This programme covers the building work which is. licensed by the Ministry of Works without the sponsorship of another.   -Department. We recommend that the new work on shops, offices, &amp;c,should be severely restricted and that work in progress should be stopped where to do so will save substantial quantities of steel.  We-   recommend that the licensing ceilings for maintenance work (includinghousing conversions) should be raised by 15 per cent, to meet the risein costs since 1950. This maintenance work has been severely restrictedfor many years and we consider that it would be most unwise to furtherreduce the volume of work. An increase in the licensing ceiling should enable the allocation between the local authorities to be made on a-        more equitable basis.
