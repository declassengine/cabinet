DOCUMENT IS THE -PR OPERT-Y-O F -HIS- BRPF A-NNIG-MA-JE ST Y *S GOVERNMENT-) jCONFIDENTIALC.(51) 23. 19TH NOVEMBER, 195193COPY NO.7S-CABINETHOUSING programme memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentIn the execution of our housing policy I propose to take the following action -(1) To give to-Local Authorities discretion to increase the proportionof houses for which licences may be issued from 1 in 5 to 1 in 2,making administrative arrangements to control the maximum si .eof houses and their sale or resale, and to ensure that the housesgo to persons in need of a home.In Scotland, where different arrangements have prevailed, theSecretary of State proposes a broadly corresponding increase inthe ratio from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5.(2) To authorise the sale of municipal houses, subject to appropriate. safeguards as to resale.Subsidy will cease to be payable on houses which are sold.(3) To encourage the building of smaller houses by Local Authorities.Plans have been prepared which preserve the establishedminimum standards for living rooms and bedrooms while effectinga substantial reduction in the overall size of the houses.I propose at once to advise Local Authorities of the generalstandards and to publish a supplementary Manual with appropriateplans as soon as possible.   Bedrooms in Scotland have been somewhalarger than in England and Wales and the Secretary of State is. encouraging the adoption of English standards.2,        None of the above measures will increase the total number of houses built during 1952 except so far as the wider facilities for building houses undeilicence may bring into house building smaller builders now engaged on repairs and maintenance.The adoption of smaller house plans will not affect house completions in 1952 but should increase the numbers which can be built out of the same amount of resources in 1953 and 1954. \At present there are 226,000 houses under construction in GreatBritain and a further 73,882 houses in contracts let or licences issued.
Our: object must be to complete as many of these houses as possibleduring 1952.   To secure this object it is essential that in the months immediately ahead we should get the best results out of the resources which are or can be made available.   For this purpose the housing programme cannot be considered in isolation.   It is a question ofutilising to the best advantage our building resources over the whole field of our operations,   I suggest, therefore, that it is important to set up now a small working Committee of Ministers, under the Chairmanship of aCabinet Minister, which would include as regular members ministers concerned with the production of our building resources (the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and Ministers of Labour,&quot;Supply and Works), with suitable representation from Scotland, and to which representativesof the using Departments could be invited to attend as may be foundnecessary from time to time.   The duty of the Committee would be to watchover the approved programme and ensure that it was fulfilled economically and effectively in regard to the use of materials and labour resources.I have discussed this proposal with the Secretary of State forScotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister ofWorks who agree.4.        I ask for the approval of my colleagues to the above proposals..H.M. ;Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W, 1.,19TH NOVEMBER, 1951. - -------
