confidential Copy No.c. (51) 3023rd November, 1951 -   .\-----rCABINETAGRICULTURAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretaryof State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State forScotlandImmediate action is required if serious developments in the agricultural industry are to be avoided. In the accompanying memorandum we have described the present state of the industry and the action we think should now be taken. Themain points in our memorandum may be summarised as follows:  1. A definite and significant slackening in home food production is takingplace.2. Since prices were last fixed, there has been a steep rise in costs amountingin all to well over  40 million per annum. This includes, in particular,wage increases awarded by independent Wages Boards which will costfarmers an additional  16 million per annum for the main farm products.3. It is recommended that under the Special Review procedure these increases in labour costs should be offset by increases in the prices of these products.4. Fertiliser costs have increased by  9 million more than was expected whenprices were fixed. Medium and smaller farmers will &quot; economise &quot; onfertilisers, to the serious detriment of soil fertility and future yields of crops and grass.5. A subsidy of not more than  10 million on phosphates for the currentfertiliser year is recommended.6. A carefully-worded statement about our future intentions with regard to agriculture is considered necessary to maintain the confidence of farmers, who are now making plans and taking decisions which will affect future supplies of meat and milk. A draft is attached.7. The Lord President and the Minister of Food support these recommendations.- - (Initialled)        T. L. D.&apos; &apos; - - d; m. f.J. G.

2 .AGRICULTURAL PRICES^ 1. We mustbring to our colleagues&apos; attention the need for immediate holdingaction if we are to avoid the development of a serious position in the agricultural industry. . From our personal observation, as well as from official statistics and reports and from our discussions with farmers&apos; leaders, we have, come to theconclusion that over the last few months there has been a loss of confidence amongfarmers and a definite and significant slackening in production. This has come when the industry has made good progress towards completing its present task of securing an approximate increase of 50 per cent, over pre-war; last year, output in 1951-52 was expected to be about 146 per cent, of pre-war, but it is not nowlikely to exceed 143 per cent. Unless this decline is quickly arrested and reversed,the industry&apos;s contribution to our balance of payments problem, so far from being increased as is technically possible, will be endangered.2. The reasons are complex but the following may be briefly stated. The bad weather of the autumn and winter of 1950-51 was partly responsible for the declinein the acreage of the 1951 harvest and also caused a poor fall of lambs last spring.But there are more serious factors. The prices fixed last February were regarded by farmers as a harsh settlement. Farmers have further been increasingly worried bya very steep rise in costs outside their own control. This means that overdrafts mustbe increased if the intensity of production is to be maintained, and overdrafts areexpensive and distasteful to farmers even when their credit is good enough to securethem. The alternative of decreasing the intensity of production consequentlybecomes more attractive.3. The difficulties were brought to. a head by the award of the agricultural wages Board for England and Wales, confirmed on 10th October last, of an increasepf 8s. in the standard minimum wage and an addition of 5 days to the previousstatutory 7 days&apos; paid holidays. Under authority of the late Government, and inaccordance with Section 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, officials have carried out,in consultation with the National Farmers&apos; Union, a Special Review of the economic condition and prospects of the industry as affected by this award. This has beena fact-finding enquiry which leaves the Government quite free to take what actionit considers expedient or indeed to take no action at all. It is accepted that theresult of the English Board&apos;s award, together with wage increases (without extraholidays) awarded in Scotland and Northern Ireland, is to increase farmers&apos; costs in respect of the main farm products for which prices are guaranteed under statuteby amounts representing an annual rate for the United Kingdom of approximately 16 million.4. - There are strong reasons for adjustment of guaranteed prices to restorethis sum to the farmers:  (a) In November 1946 the late Government exchanged letters with the national farmers&apos; Unions undertaking in effect to give 100 per cent, recoupment. of&quot; sudden and substantial&quot; changes in costs occuring between annual reviews. This undertaking was confirmed during the passage of the agriculture Bill through the House of Commons in 1947, and has beenaccepted as an-important part.of the system of assured markets andguaranteed prices on which the industry now rests.(b) In the past, Special Reviews have taken place and full recoupment has been awarded in respect of increases in costs (all for labour) of  20 million inJuly 1946,  25 million in August 1947,  14f million in March 1949 and 13^ million in November 1950.,(c) Apart from these formal, though very strong, considerations it is clear fromthe circumstances briefly mentioned above that recoupment of this order^is necessary, though not sufficient, to maintain production and the basis 7for further expansion, if needed, later on.5.  In the course of the Special Review of the condition of the industry asaffected by the wages increase officials have established as background the following figures for increases in other costs in respect of all products (i.e., &quot; non-review&quot; pro- &quot;ducts such as fruit and vegetables as well as the main products for which prices and markets are guaranteed): -  MillionFertilisers...      ...   &quot;... 91Other items      ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    12
6. This last figure represents an aggregation of relatively minor increases inthe cost of oil, transport, sacks and so on, and we think it would be proper as wellas in accordance with precedent to require farmers to bear these increases withoutany adjustment of prices pending the next Annual Review (next February) of theeconomic condition of the industry.1.  There are special reasons, however, for action in respect of fertilisers.(a) The increase is the consequence of the final abandonment last July by thelate Government of the policy of keeping fertiliser prices stable by meansof a Government subsidy. It was always recognised that this wouldresult in an increase in farmers&apos; costs, and the prices fixed last February,purported to take full account of the prospective increase. In fact, how-ever, the estimated increase taken into account represented only about half the increase that has occurred, the figure of  9-1 million quoted above being the excess increase.(b) Supplies of fertilisers are likely to be at least 10 per cent, less in the current year than last year but evidence is building up that if things were allowedto take their course even the reduced amounts would be far from fullytaken up. The effects on yields of grass and other crops would be serious and apart from other considerations it would be good business on our part to counteract this excess increase of  9-1 million..8. The problem over fertilisers is in large part that of the medium and smallerfarmers who will be more tempted to be &quot; penny wise.&quot; The remedy is likely to bemuch more effective if it is applied to fertiliser prices than by way of addition to prices of farm products. We recommend that the Minister of Agriculture shouldbe authorised to add phosphatic fertilisers to the arrangements under which he paysa contribution to the cost of applying lime to agricultural land. The administrativemachine is available and could readily apply the subsidy retrospectively from thebeginning of the current fertiliser year, i.e., from 1st July, 1951, the date on whichthe increased prices took effect. A payment representing 30 per cent, of the cost ofphosphates would, it is estimated, amount at present prices to  91 million over afull year. The increase in prices of phosphates has been relatively much heavier thanthat of other fertilisers and an arrangement of this kind would keep prices of themain fertilisers pretty well in line. We recommend that the Government commit-ment should be limited at this stage to an expenditure of say  10 million in respectof phosphates bought during the current fertiliser year. If it were decided later onto continue a subsidy the rate of contribution could, if necessary, be varied from year to year.9. One consequence of taking this action on fertilisers would be to give some assistance to the horticultural industry which is outside the system of assuredmarkets and guaranteed prices and which has been facing increasing difficultiesdue to rising costs. This is reflected in the decline in acreage of bush fruit and vegetables. At 4th June, 1951, there had been a decline of 14 per cent, in the UnitedKingdom compared with the year earlier, and the September returns indicate thata further fall has taken place.10.  To sum up at this point, we recommend as immediate action (a) that prices fixed for livestock products up to 31st March next and for crops. of the 1952 harvest should be increased to recoup the increases in labour&apos; costs amounting in total to  16 million for the United Kingdom on anannual basis;(b) that the Minister of Agriculture should be authorised to extend for thecurrent fertiliser year the existing scheme for contributions to the... cost of liming agricultural land to cover the application of phosphaticfertilisers at a rate equivalent to about 30 per cent, of their present cost. .11.. Proposal (o) in paragraph 10 will lead to an increase in food prices of 5 to  6 million if the food subsidies are not to exceed  410 million; this will comeon top of increases for other reasons of  12 million. The proposal at (b) will leadto expenditure of  2 to  3 million on the Ministry of Agriculture and FisheriesVote in the current year and will require a Supplementary Estimate.. It is assumed that this subsidy would be included in the total of the food subsidies, as the oldfertiliser subsidy was, especially as it is being granted in lieu of an increase in prices.If it was so included, the increase in retail prices necessary to keep the food subsidiesdown to  410 million would be  2 to  3 million higher. Some additional clerical staff will be required to administer the &quot;arrangements for the fertiliser subsidy.41487 B 2
12. We consider these measures to be essential and urgent, but we are boundto advise our colleagues that they will be regarded by the industry as no morethan scant justice, conveying no assurance in themselves that the government intend to create conditions which will inspire and enable agriculture to maintain and, if desired, raise the level of home food production. How much more we shall need from home agriculture.and how much we can afford to pay for it, are questions to which it would be imprudent to attempt to give an immediate answer. Theywill require the most careful study in relation to the other grave economic problems with which we are faced. We are undertaking that study in consultation with theChancellor and the Minister of Food and we hope to be able to put our conclusions.and recommendations before our colleagues in good time before we have to start the Annual Review of the condition and prospects of the industry next February.In the meantime, farmers are making their production plans and taking decisions which will affect in particular the amount of meat and milk we are to get from home resources in two or three years&apos; time. It is of the greatest importance in ourview therefore that an announcement of the decision we seek above should be accompanied by a statement which, although not committing us to any specific measures, is of a generally reassuring nature. This is obviously not easy to do,but we attach to this memorandum a draft of the kind of statement we consider necessary..13. The Minister of Food concurs in the views and recommendations putforward in this memorandum.(Intlld.)        T. L. D.:-: &apos;   D. M. F.&quot; &apos;;/.;- J. G. S. &quot;i23rd November, 1951..  ANNEX .AGRICULTURAL&quot;COSTS AND PRICESDRAFT STATEMENT IN HOUSE OF; COMMONSQuestion: To ask the Minister of Agriculture whether he is yet in a positionto announce the Governments decision as a result of the recent special review ofagricultural prices.Answer: Yes Sir. I should first explain that the Special Review which tookplace recently under the authority of the previous Government was a Review underSection 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, not of prices but of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry, as affected by the awards of the threeAgricultural Wages Boards for the United Kingdom of an increase in the minimum wage, and for England and Wales only-Hive additional days holiday with pay.The Government have now considered the effect of these awards on the economic condition and prospects of the industry, and have also taken note of other increases in costs that have taken place since the Annual Review of last February.. The Government have decided that a case exists for adjusting those farm prices which were fixed after last February&apos;s Annual Review, so as to take account of the sudden and substantial change in labour costs resulting from the awards of theAgricultural Wages Boards. I will circulate in the Official Report a statementgiving the price increases and the dates from which they will operate. It will bepossible in the case of milk and wool, but not for other commodities, to make thenew price retrospective to the dates on which the increased wages became payable in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.I have said that other increases in costs have also been examined. Of these^he most notable single item both in magnitude and in regard to its potential effecton production, has been the steep rise in fertiliser prices. The excess increase overthe estimate used for the purpose of last February&apos;s Annual Review is equivalent toan annual rate of just over  9 million. We have decided that this is a matter whichshould be dealt with separately by means which will most effectively encourage theproper use of fertilisers on crops and grass.   Arrangements are being made
accordingly for the payment of a contribution towards the cost of acquiringphosphatic fertilisers in the United Kingdom. The contributions will be at a rateequivalent to about 30 per cent, of the present cost to farmers and will apply to allphosphatic fertilisers bought between 1st July last and 30th June, 1952.The Government recognise that the rapid and substantial increases in costs which have taken place this year have created severe difficulties for agriculture, as for other industries. The decisions I have announced will mitigate this severity butthe Government are iully conscious that the formidable problems of the industryrequire further intensive study. Necessarily these problems must be considered inrelation to the general economic condition of the country and defence requirements.The whole economy is seriously overloaded; there are grave external financial difficulties; and we have heavy defence commitments. One of the most importantcontributions that can be rendered to agriculture is for the Government to presson with the attempt to get control of inflationary tendencies. Farmers will beamong the chief beneficiaries of successful policies in this regard.It will require more time than has so far been available to the present Govern-ment to balance, on the one hand, the nation&apos;s food production requirements and appropriate ways and means of enabling the agricultural industry to meet them,and, on the other, the national economic and material resources which are likelyto be available for that purpose. We are applying ourselves to that task with energy and determination; we have made these present awards; and we intend to do allthat is possible to ensure that agriculture can make a full contribution both to thenation&apos;s food requirements and towards the solution of its economic problems.
