We reached the following conclusions :-A. The negotiations with the German Federal Government shouldbe started at an early date.    We were in entire agreement with theForeign Secretary^ proposal that he should endeavour to secure agree- -ment to this course at the forthcoming meeting of the three foreign ministers on 21st November.B. In order to leave no room for doubt about our inability to accept any additional financial liability as a result of German rearmament weshare the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that we should make it clear that whilethe problem of the gap remained unresolved His Majesty&apos;s government could agree to enter into negotiations with the Germans only on the clear understanding that we were not prepared to accept any additionalfinancial burden.C. We should not depart from our present policy of declining toaccept any additional defence burdens or any additional external burdens,D. Although the rough estimate given in C. (51) 15 of the cost ofbuilding up the German forces would certainly prove to be substantially higher than the expenditure ultimately involved, a considerable gapwould almost certainly remain.    This gap could in fact be filled only bya United States contribution.E. A reduction in our own forces in Germany would not be acceptable, though a further economy in our expenditure on them mustbe achieved.    In his discussion with the two Foreign Ministers theForeign Secretary could make it clear that we were now engaged In response-examining our defence costs in Germany and elsewhere with a view       ^to eliminating-^!! unavoidable expenditure. iOffice of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,17TH NOVEMBER,&apos;1951.
