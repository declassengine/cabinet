Ills DOCEMKNT -IS the &quot;PROPERTY- 01&apos;   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1951      ,.SECRET Copy No.c (5i) 21 , -vrVv.;19M November, 1951 :&apos; - -CABINETBAMANGWATO affairs memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsBamangwato affairs demand action by His Majesty&apos;s Government urgently.The Reserve is in a turmoil. The people are perplexed about the governments intentions. Parliamentary questions are being asked. Tshekedi is returning toLondon.2. A summary of the past is attached in Annex B.3. The question requiring immediate decision is Tshekedi&apos;s future, but mycolleagues should know in broad outline the over-all solution I have in mind.4. There is no solution which does not include factors open to justifiable criti-criticism. We must therefore be content with finding a solution which contains thegreatest number of good points and is otherwise defensible. It calls for a gradualapproach and its announcement will require careful timing.. 5. The comprehensive solution I have in mind is:  (1) the effective exclusion of Tshekedi Khama from the political life of the bamangwato allied with his return to the Reserve as a private personat the earliest moment consistent with the peace of the tribe and his ownsafety;(2) reconciliation between the tribe and Rasebolai Khama, chief lieutenant of tshekedi and third in adult succession to the chieftainship, and his pro-motion as a prospective nominee by the tribe for the chieftainship; and(3) the announcement, after an appropriate interval, of the permanent exclu-sion of Seretse Khama from the chieftainship of the tribe as a necessary preliminary to their nomination of Rasebolai.(1) will quiet the tribe and make possible its effective administration under theDistrict Commissioner, who for the present will continue as Native Authority, inwhich capacity he exercises some of the functions of chief. (2) will offer arallying point, alternative to Seretse, for the traditional allegiance of the tribe.(3) will remove permanently from the Union Government a potentially powerfulweapon in its campaign for incorporation of the High Commission Territories andthe declaration of a Republic.6. Under an exclusion order issued in accordance with the White Paper policy,Tshekedi cannot enter the Reserve save with permission, which is granted or with-held according to the situation in the Reserve (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of annex B). He smarts under a sense of injustice. As soon as we can we mustpermit him to return to look after his large personal interests. But the observers&apos;reports confirm the existence of such strong feeling against him in the tribe that his return now could only lead to serious disorders and danger to his life. He himself,Vifr&quot;1 Provocative actions, has aggravated /eeling against him. The tribe donot believe his renunciation of claim to the chieftainship and blame him for Seretse&apos;s41461 R
exclusion. The immediate need is to quiet their fear of his return to power and todo this Government must make it evident that he will be effectively excludedfrom their political life. The frequency of his visits and the prospects of his ultimateresidence in the Reserve will depend upon his own actions.7. The Bamangwato are so firmly wedded to the hereditary chieftainship thatthe idea of a council system, put forward in the original White Paper, of itself offersno alternative. The only satisfactory solution is the promotion of a suitable personas chief instead of Seretse. With both Seretse and Tshekedi out of the running forthe chieftainship, Rasebolai would be the obvious choice. He would be acceptable to Government, but his advancement towards office must be cautious, since hisassociation with Tshekedi has made him suspect by the tribe.8. Most of the tribe want Seretse back. To let him and his white wife return in any capacity would provoke an immediate demand in South Africa for the trans-fer of the Territories, a demand in which all white South Africans, including those ofBritish descent, would be united. This was the view ofjGeneral Smuts and is confirmed by the present leader of the United Party in South Africa. (south africans are very sensitive and emotional over racial purity; mixed marriages are prohibited and sexual relations between persons of different colour are a criminal offence.) A strong indication has been given that the present Government of SouthAfrica would resort to economic sanctions against the Territories, which, geographic-9 ally and economically, are virtually defenceless. All our relations with the union would be seriously impaired and we would probably lose the Territories. our interests in Southern Africa therefore demand the continued exclusion of Seretse.But if his exclusion is to be permanent it is unfair to him and to the tribe to keepalive hopes of his ultimate return. Moreover, it makes any permanent solution ofthe problem impossible. But to announce his permanent exclusion before the tribehas been suitably conditioned for it by the removal of their fears about tshekedi and the promotion of a possible alternative chief, would provoke an explosion from them. Moreover, the effect on colonial opinion of substituting permanent exclusionin place of the undertaking to review the position in not less than five years wouldbe serious and would have to be carefully considered.9. In short, my purposes would be to restore peaceful conditions in theReserve by determining forthwith the future of Tshekedi, doing all that is possiblefor him while at the same time allaying the fears of the tribe; to secure the return of Rasebolai to the Reserve and to promote his popularity with the tribe; and, at as early a date as possible, and certainly before the end of the five-year period laiddown in the White Paper, to announce the permanent exclusion of Seretse and tobring about the nomination by the tribe of Rasebolai as chief.10. At this stage, I ask only for approval of the first step which is to make clear our intentions regarding Tshekedi. In Annex A, I submit the draft of a parlia-mentary question and reply indicating these intentions. In it we make clear that weare sympathetic over the present deprivation of his liberty of movement in theReserve and that, provided he will co-operate in allaying the tribe&apos;s fears, we meanto work towards its restoration. I would give Tshekedi; who has asked for an interview with me, opportunity to see me before the reply is given in the House. Iwould accord the same courtesy to Seretse, who has also asked for an interview.11. There is no reason why the observers&apos; reports (Annexes C and D)should not be published. My proposals are kinder to Tshekedi than their recommendations.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,\9th November, 1951.
&quot; .&apos; ANNEX A    - /.      Draft Parliamentary. Question and ReplyP.Q.-To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the Government w-intentions regarding the request of Tshekedi,:&apos;     Khama for permission to-return&apos;-to&apos;the Bamarigwato Reserve,      .&apos;Reply&apos;   - &apos;/      -: / .......       -.The Secretary of State is desirous that thePe should be np permanentsuppression of Tshekedi. Khama&apos;s private rights in the Bamangwato Reserve. TheSecretary of State is convinced that the interests of peace in the Reserve demand(hat Tshekedi Khama should be excluded from the political life of the tribe. Hehas several times reiterated his renunciation of all claims to the Chieftainship,and such a renunciation is clearly incompatible with his continued exercise ofpolitical influence in the tribe&apos;s affairs. The sooner his exclusion from their political life is shown to be effective, and it is the intention of the Secretary of State to makeit so, the sooner will it be possible to permit to him progressively greater freedomof movement within the Reserve for his private purposes.. Ultimately, it is hoped,it will be possible for him to return permanently to his home as a private person,but that hope will depend for its fulfilment very largely upon his own recognitionof the requirement which the Secretary of State regards as paramount, namely, thathe abstains from intervention in the political affairs of the tribe.41461
ANNEX BA Note on Bamangwato AffairsThe Bechuanaland Protectorate is one of three territories lying within or on the borders of the Union of South Africa, administered directly by the United Kingdom.The South Africa Act, 1909, provided for the possible transfer at some future date of these territories to the Union. During its passage through parliament the United Kingdom Government gave pledges that transfer should not takeplace until the inhabitants of the territories had been consulted and the UnitedKingdom Parliament given an opportunity of expressing its views. The inhabitantshave been and are strongly averse from transfer. But owing to their geographicand economic position and their complete dependence on Union assistance, SouthAfrica could exercise a stranglehold if it wished. Although White South Africans .generally want transfer, the Union Government is likely to be deterred from drastic action if opinion in favour of transfer remains lukewarm, as it is likely to do so.long as His Majesty&apos;s Government, in its administration of the three territories,avoids doing anything likely to inflame and unite White South Africans in a demand that the territories be handed over.&quot;: 2. The Bamangwato tribe inhabits 40,000 square miles in the middle of the bechuanaland Protectorate. It has a population of roughly 100,000, consisting ofabout 20,000 Bamangwato proper and about 80,000 allied tribes. The system ofadministration has been for the Government of the territory to work through localtribal institutions. Among the Bamangwato the native administration wasconducted by a Chief who enjoyed considerable power and exercised it through a series of Chiefs Representatives (all Bamangwato) in charge of the outlyingareas of the allied tribes.3. The hereditary chiefs of the Bamangwato have been drawn for manygenerations from the Khama family, which has produced several distinguishedAfrican rulers. Seretse&apos;s father died when he was a boy, hence Tshekedi&apos;s regency.For 23 years Tshekedi administered the affairs of the tribe efficiently but rigorouslyand perhaps sometimes harshly.4.  Seretse Khama was educated in South Africa and later at Oxford and london.In September 1948, then being 27 years old, he married a white woman, MissRuth Williams. He did this despite efforts to dissuade him, which; because of the disastrous results that the marriage was bound to have for the tribe, were madeby responsible British officials and by the tribal leaders, including his uncle, Tshekedi.5. The tribe as a whole was seriously shaken and perplexed by the marriage.This is shown by the history of the three kgotlas (tribal meetings) which were heldat Serowe, the Bamangwato capital, in 1948 and 1949 to discuss this crisis precipitate-tated by Seretse. At the first, in November 1948, condemnation of the marriagewas almost unanimous; at the second, in December 1948, opinion against it had begun to waver. After this second meeting Seretse returned to England to continue his law studies, but in June 1949 he went back to the Reserve and at the thirdkgotla succeeded in obtaining a large majority in his favour.6. An important, and probably the decisive, factor in this swing-over to Seretsewas the tribe&apos;s fear of Tshekedi. Although progressive and efficient, Tshekedi had,because of his strictness, incurred unpopularity particularly towards the end of histwenty-three years as Regent. The tribe feared that if they rejected Seretse theywould have Tshekedi over them, not merely-as Regent but as permanent Chief.Tshekedi and his chief followers were adamant in their objection to the marriage.They went into voluntary exile from the Bamangwato Reserve, formally statingthat they &quot; challenged &quot; the kgotla&apos;s decision, that native law and custom had beenviolated, and that they would not accept a white woman as the Chiefs consort.7. All available evidence confirmed that public opinion in South Africa and southern Rhodesia would be greatly incensed by the recognition as Chief of Seretse,married as he was to a white woman. The Union Government declared Seretseand his wife prohibited immigrants in South Africa.. 8. Faced with a most invidious choice between, on the one hand, provokingthe Union to a point of applying &quot; sanctions &quot; against the three High Commission
Territories and, on the other hand, antagonising the Bamangwato tribe and indeed,a.very large body of non-Europeans throughout the Commonwealth, the HighCommissioner advised that we should play for time. He therefore recommendedthat a Judicial Enquiry should be held. He suggested that the following reasonscould be given for holding an Enquiry, and that, if established, they would justifywithholding of recognition from Seretse:  . &apos;(a) that the third kgotla was not fully representative of the tribe;(b) that the deliberations of the three kgotlas were too indefinite; ,k) that the status of Seretse&apos;s wife and of any children of the marriage wasobscure; and(d) that there was the danger of a split in the tribe.      &apos;9. The High Commissioners advice was taken and a Judicial Enquiry intothe Bamangwato crisis was held.   Its two findings were as follows:-(1) that the kgotla held in June 1949, at which Seretse was designated as Chief,was properly convened and assembled and its proceedings conducted in accordance with native custom; and(2) that, having regard to the interests and well-being of the tribe, Seretse was-  -      not a fit and proper person to discharge the functions of Chief.In its. Report the Judicial Enquiry made it clear that the main reason why Seretsewas not a fit and proper person was that his recognition as Chief would producereactions in the Union of South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia which wouldhave the gravest consequences for the Bamangwato tribe, the Bechuanaland Pro-tectorate, and the other two High Commission Territories of Basutoland andSwaziland. The Government agreed with the Judicial Enquiry&apos;s two findings, butconsidered it impolitic to publish the Report, because of the reasons given for the findings.10. As the crisis was likely to be solved if Seretse voluntarily renounced the chieftainship, he and his wife were invited to London for discussions. he accordingly came to London but refused to abdicate, saying that he could not doso without consulting the tribe.11. It was therefore decided, in March 1950, that recognition of SeretseYsuccession to the Chieftainship should be withheld for a period of years sufficiently long for the disappearance of the tendencies to disruption which threatened the unity and well-being of the tribe. During this period, which would not be less than five years, the system of direct rule, which would have to be introduced as atemporary expedient, would be progressively modified and steps taken to associatethe tribe with the administration of its affairs through a system of councils.12. This decision was announced in the House of Commons on 8th March,1950, and on 22nd March a White Paper (Command 7913) was published which gave the following reasons for the decision:     .[a) that recognition of Seretse whose marriage had already caused tshekedi and a large number of followers to leave the Reserve would cause aserious split in the tribe;; (A) that Seretse, by contracting his marriage without prior consultation with the tribe and against all good advice, showed himself to be unmindful oftrue tribal interests and of his public duty;(c) that the uncertainty of the status of any children of the marriage was likely.-.   to cause serious disputes within the tribe.The White Paper was at pains to make out that the Government was not influenced by any representations from jhe Government of the Union of South Africa orSouthern Rhodesia on the matter. &quot;    ......&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;        &quot; *. 1.3. The White Paper required that, throughout the period during which recog-nition was to be withheld, Seretse should Jive outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate,and that Tshekedi should live outside the Bamangwato Reserve and should not enter it without special permission. (Consideration was given to leaving Seretsein the Bechuanaland Protectorate, whilst excluding him from the bamangwato reserve, but this possibility was abandoned mainly because good administration ofthe&apos;tribe would be impracticable with Seretse near at hand.) On 1st April, 1950,Seretse returned with our permission to the Bechuanaland Protectorate to attend to
certain private affairs. He later refused to leave voluntarily for England andexpulsion orders were served on him. Accompanied by Ruth, he finally left for england by air on 17th August, 1950.14. In early April 1951 Tshekedi came to London ostensibly to discuss his&quot;private affairs.&quot; During the preceding twelve months he had been living close to-the Bamangwato boundary in the adjoining Bakwena Reserve, and had at first beengiven generous facilities to enable him to look after his property and interests inthe Reserve. But his increasing unpopularity and a desire on the Administration^part to secure the tribe&apos;s co-operation over councils, &amp;c, had led to stricter treatmentof him. During talks in London, Tshekedi made various proposals about splittingthe tribal area or federating it with a neighbouring tribe. As these proposals wouldhave been bitterly resented and resisted by the Bamangwato, the Governmentdeclined to entertain them and thereafter the discussions were mainly concernedwith Jshekedfs private rights as a great cattle-owner.15. Tshekedi asked for the rescinding of the exclusion order made against him and for permission to live in the Reserve as a private person. He asserted thathe could not from a distance deal properly with his private and business affairs. he also wished the Government to pursue a firmer line with his enemies and so pavethe way for the return to power of his followers. The Administration held, however,that amongst the Bamangwato it was impossible, with a man of Tshekedi&apos;s stature,to differentiate between his personal and his public capacities. The Bamangwatofeared him and did not want him back in any capacity. The Secretary of state proposed, even though this was rather more than the Bamangwato were likely toaccept peaceably, that Tshekedi should be allowed limited access to his cattle posts and that as many as possible of his cattle should be concentrated with Governmentsassistance in an area near his then place of residence, in the land of a neighbouringtribe, provided that Tshekedi, who had already renounced the Chieftainship, wouldgive certain undertakings, e.g., that he would accept the White Paper decisions andwould not interfere in the affairs of the Bamangwato. Tshekedi rejected theseproposals. He regarded them as inadequate and he doubted the sincerity of theGovernments intentions towards him. He then demanded full liberty of movement and action.    .16. Tshekedi then pursued his case publicly with considerable success. InJune 1951 an Opposition motion was tabled deploring the decision to banishTshekedi without hearing or enquiry into the grounds for such banishment, andcalling upon Government to rescind the banishment order and to allow him to dwellfreely within the territory of his tribe. The Government considered that this wouldbe a piecemeal destruction of the White Paper policy culminating in Seretse&apos;sinevitable return too. Reports from the High Commissioner showed that Unionreactions to Seretse&apos;s return in 1951 would be even more violent than they wouldhave been a year previously and that the return of Tshekedi alone would lead to serious and sustained trouble in the Reserve. The Government accordingly stoodfirm on the White Paper decisions but undertook that the tribe&apos;s attitude to thequestion of TshekedFs return should be ascertained more precisely at a furtherkgotla of the Bamangwato attended by observers from the United Kingdom. the motion was defeated.17. The Opposition parties declined to send any of their members and insteadof a Parliamentary delegation three independent observers (Mr. Bullock, Mr. Lipsonand Professor Macmillan) were despatched. It was hoped that a joint kgotla, i.e.,one which would include Tshekedi and his followers, could be summoned for theobservers&apos; benefit. The tribal leaders refused to agree to the attendance of tshekedi and his followers and efforts to arrange a joint kgotla were abandoned. Instead theObservers attended a series of local meetings throughout the Reserve to soundopinion. In September the observers submitted their reports which are annexed.Mr. Lipson argued that the Bamangwato would for the most part acquiesce inTshekedfs return, if Seretse were allowed back too. All three agreed that there wasa strong feeling against Tshekedi in the Reserve. In the words of Mr. Bullock and professor Macmillan: :- ,&quot; On this one question we have no hesitation in declaring that the return&apos;    of tshekedi Khama in any capacity whatsoever at the present time and in thepresent ^circumstances would be contrary to the wishes of the majority of the tribe and bitterly resented by a substantial number. -On this.issue emotionsnow run kangerously high throughout the tribe.&quot;
ANNEX CJoint Report by Mr. H. L. Bullock and Professor W..M. MacmillanI.- BackgroundIn July last we were asked by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to undertake a mission in the Bamangwato Reserve of the bechuanaland protectorate. The object of our mission is best set out in the following extractfrom a letter addressed to us by Mr. Gordon Walker on 20th July :-&quot; As I have explained in the House of Commons, the purpose of your visitis to report on the Single question of the attitude of the tribe to tshekedi khama&apos;s return to the Bamangwato Reserve as a private individual.As I also told the House, I intend to invite the Bamangwato tribe to holda special kgotla under the presidency of an impartial person in order to estab-lish their views on this question. I will cause my invitation to the tribe tohold this kgotla to be presented to them at a meeting with the tribal repre-sentatives in your presence. I have made it clear to the House that in my view this kgotla should be attended by Tshekedi Khama and his followers.I hope you will use your best endeavours and all the weight of yourinfluence to persuade the tribe to agree to hold such a kgotla and tore-emphasise to them that Tshekedi Khama has renounced all claims to the chieftainship. I would be grateful for your views and advice on details ofarrangements for the holding of this kgotla. Any decisions that have to betaken must of course be mine, but I shall much value your advice and recom-mendations. Please do not hesitate to consult and advise me on any mattersyou wish at any stage of your visit.I of course leave to your judgment any steps besides the holding of the kgotla that you may decide to take to ascertain for yourselves the views ofthe tribe on the question at issue&quot;and to consult with neighbouring chiefs andany other people you may wish to see. You may count on the full co-operationof my officers in any such steps that you may see fit to take and in all other.  &apos; * ways.&quot;2. The circumstances in which the issue of Tshekedi Khama&apos;s return to the bamangwato Reserve came before Parliament are well known and need be recordedhere only very briefly. For 23 years 1923-49 Tshekedi Khama had ruled the bamangwato people as Regent for his nephew, Seretse Khama, the heir to the chieftainship. During all these years Tshekedi had been in the position of fatherand mentor to Seretse and had cared for his affairs within the Reserve. Differencesarose between them over Seretse^ marriage in 1948. The tribe also was dividedon this matter, and at the instance of Tshekedi, a series of kgotlas was held todiscuss his position. Later a judicial commission was appointed to enquire intothe circumstances that had arisen. In consequence of that commission it wasdecided by the Secretary of State that the chieftainship should be held in abeyancefor five years and that Seretse Khama should for that period be required to liveoutside the Bechuanaland Protectorate. At the same time Tshekedi Khama was required to live outside the Bamangwato Reserve. These decisions, and the reasonsfor them, are recorded at length in the White Paner (Cmd. 7913) published in March1950.    &apos; .   .. -.3. During the years of his regency, Tshekedi had cared for the cattle and otherproperty that appertained to the chieftainship, to himself and to Seretse. In 1950an effective distribution of this property was made. It is understood that, in fact,this distribution has given rise to disputes between the tribe, representing the chief,and Tshekedi, but such disputes will be a matter for the courts and do not concernthis mission. &apos;\.4. Since his departure, Seretse Khama has apparently experienced ho difficultyin leaving his property within the Reserve to be managed by one Keaboka, fourthsenior member of the chiefly family, who has since been nominated by the tribe as its leading representative and its &quot; messenger &quot; for the purpose of dealing with government. Tshekedi, on the contrary, has not found it possible to leave his property to the care of a representative, and in 1950 sought and obtained the permission of the High Commissioner for a series of visits to the Reserve for thepurpose of managing his affairs. These visits were made the subject of representa-: tions to the High Commissioner by representatives of the tribe, it being alleged
that his presence in the Reserve was repugnant to the tribe, which was disturbedas to the intentions of both Tshekedi and Government. It is understood that theSecretary of State entered into prolonged negotiations with the intention of arriving at an accommodation with Tshekedi Khama that would secure to him adequate control of his property and yet be acceptable to the tribe. Those negotiations failedand the Secretary of State thereafter decided that the interest of peace and good order within the tribe demanded the re-enforcement of the exclusion order againstTshekedi Khama. Thereafter Tshekedi, having publicly renounced all claim toChieftainship, demanded the right of free access to the Reserve as a privateindividual. The issue found its way to Parliament, in order to satisfy which theSecretary of State offered to send observers to the Protectorate to report on the truestate of feeling within the Reserve.5. The Bamangwato Reserve has an area of 40,000 square miles and a popu-latibn roughly estimated to be 100,000 people. Of these only rather less than 20,000belong to. the Ngwato tribe proper, the remainder having from time to time broken.away from their original tribes and affiliated themselves with the Ngwato tribe andacknowledged its supremacy. The Reserve is divided into nine districts, the. chiefof which is that surrounding Serowe, which is also the capital of the Reserve. TheSerowe district is the stronghold of the Ngwato tribe proper, but a number of its members reside in the several districts and are normally amongst the most influen-tial persons in them. The dominance of the Ngwato is ultimately due to the geniusof Khama (1875-1923) who made his kingdom a rallying point for tribes scattered over the huge area in times when security was threatened from the North by raidingMatabele and from the South-East by the encroachment of European farmers.Khama&apos;s protection of the lesser tribes was made more effective by the backinghe himself enjoyed from the Government of his great patron, Queen Victoria. Yetat that time, and even later, the protecting Government was in no position toassume what has come to be known as &quot;direct&quot; rule over this vast territory, sothat from the beginning the Protectorate administration came to rely even for themaintenance of law and order almost entirely on the discipline enforced, until 1923by Khama, and latterly by the Regent, Tshekedi. In consequence of this, nativecustom has been distorted and the power of the Chief raised considerably aboveany checks traditionally exercised by the people of the tribe over the chiefs&apos;autocracy.6. It was the great achievement of Khama&apos;s system that the rule he imposedthrough Bamangwato Representatives with the backing of the &quot; regiments&quot; fromSerowe and ultimately of His Majesty&apos;s Government was loyally accepted and stillis by the out-lying dependants. More than once some of us were corrected and told not to speak or think, e.g., of Bakalaka or Bakalanga, since all claim to beBamangwato. Even if they have made little material progress these people werewisely allowed to retain their own tribal headmen and they continue to speakfour or five distinct languages.7. The Reserve, and all its people, are normally ruled by the chief, whooccupies his position by right of birth. To each district he nominates a personknown as the chiefs representative, who rules on his behalf. The system is Khama&apos;sand the agents of the system, though they may constitute something like a civilservice, were and still are drawn largely, though not now exclusively, from themembers of Khama&apos;s family, being thus undoubtedly also a privileged aristocracy.Their Office clearly brings some profit as well as social prestige and they are intenselyconscious and jealous of their order of precedence. In spite of the great almostuntracked distances this ruling class maintain close links with each other and withSerowe, where they frequently gather for meetings, and where, as a result, tribalpolitics often have the intensity and ferocity of a village family dispute. The unity of the tribe is, nevertheless, something very real and jealously guarded, even if thesystem is thus aristocratic and, although not exclusively, autocratic. Certainly itadmits of no organised opposition: to stand out against the ruling power on any major issue is to be guilty almost of treason.8. Yet there are certain checks upon the use of power by the chief. Thefirst of these is the kgotla, a meeting at which, in theory, every male adult memberof the tribe has the right to attend and to be heard. We return to the point that therecent exclusion of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters&apos; is based on the ground that they havetransferred their allegiance to another tribe, the Bakwena. Such kgotla meetingsmay take place at the village or district level, but it is accepted that all the great
affairs of the tribe are discussed and determined in the presence of chiefs&apos; repre-sentatives and tribal headmen meeting in formal kgotla at the Ngwato stronghold,Serowe. No vote is normally taken at such meetings. When all who wish havespoken the chief, or person presiding on his behalf, assesses the feeling of the meeting and announces his decision. In theory, as Tshekedi Khama had himself claimedlately, that decision may be his own and need not accord with the feeling of themeeting; in practice a strong chief can possibly go contrary to the views of themajority. The meeting in kgotla is, however, an essential part of the system of native rule and is accorded much respect by the Bamangwato as by other tribes ofthe Protectorate. .9. The second check upon the absolute rule of the chief is the devotion totradition and to precedent embodied in the complex and unrecorded system of native law and customs. Tshekedi himself told us it is &quot; case law.&quot; Argumentsmay and do arise as to the particular application of native law and custom.(e.g., as to the present claims of Tshekedi Khama), but custom is certainly arestraining force of some potency.10. The Chieftainship of the Bamangwato has remained with the house ofKhama, to which both Tshekedi and Seretse belong and which has included among its members some very remarkable Africans. Of these last Tshekedi Khama isacknowledged to be one, but all members of the very large royal family, whatever their personal merits, are to be reckoned with as people of influence.11. The foregoihj represents, in brief outline, the organisation of the tribeas it has existed for many years. It should be recorded that in recent months theAdministration has been engaged, we understand with success, upon a series ofreforms designed to establish more firmly the democratic principle.&quot; The intention is to establish councils on a new democratic model, comprising representativesnominated by the village kgotlas in each district of the Reserve, these councilsbeing advisory to the chiefs representatives, who would themselves be nominated by the district kgotlas and confirmed by the full (i.e., tribal) kgotla at Serowe.The district councils would in turn send representatives to a central council atSerowe, which would in due course become the constituted Native Authority, andin effect the executive, or working, committee of the tribal kgotla. In these reformsmembers of the subsidiary or &quot; allied &quot; tribes were to have equal standing with members of the Ngwato and, in fact, a number of them had been nominated both as chiefs representatives and council members. All progress on these reformsceased when the future of Tshekedi Khama came before Parliament. Then, asis well known, disturbances occurred within the Reserve.II. Moves towards a &quot;Joint&quot; Kgotla12. We arrived in the Reserve on 27th July and were met by the HighCommissioner and officials of the Administration, who most willingly placed them-selves at our disposal and helped us in very way without in any way interfering with our judgment concerning the things we desired to find out. Indeed, we had made our minds up from the time of the appointment that nothing should prevent us from coming to our own conclusions; we made this quite clear to everyoneconcerned and it was appreciated by them.13. We immediately addressed ourselves to the task of securing agreement to a special meeting of the tribe in kgotla with Tshekedi Khama and his supporterspresent. It had been hoped that the invitation to convene such a kgotla would beextended, and the arrangements for it discussed, at a meeting attended by repre-sentatives of both the tribe and Tshekedi (the latter had not himself yet returnedto Africa). We were informed that the tribal representatives had resolutely refusedto attend such a meeting and we perforce agreed to see the parties separately. we saw representatives of the tribe on 29th July and the supporters of Tshekedi, headed by Rasebolai, on 30th July. On each occasion the invitation to take part in thejoint kgotla was extended on behalf of the Secretary of State by the HighCommissioner (on 29th July by Sir Evelyn Baring, and after his departure, onthe 30th by Mr. R. E. Turnbull). On the morning of the 29th the tribal representa-tives merely welcomed us as their guests and said that they were empowered to listen but not to answer. They agreed to meet us again, for informal discussion, inthe afternoon, but, in the event, maintained the same attitude. They would not.41461 .    C .
give us a precise datetor their reply, but, upon our representations of urgency,promised that it would be soon. On 30th July the supporters&quot; of Tshekedi welcomed the proposal for a joint kgotla and&apos;promised their full co-operation. It can bestate^ that on that occasion, and on every subsequent one of our meetings, the supporters of Tshekedi gave every evidence of desiring to face their opponents ata joint meeting. It was clear^that our difficulties in arranging it would lie. only with the, established representativesof. the efcribe. . ....14.&apos;. We. also had informal&apos; talks with the lawyers representing both sides ofthe dispute stressing all the time the heed for a large tribal kgotla with both sidespresent and taking part jn the discussions so that we could qbtain a free, fair and independent expression of opinion on the issue before us. -     *15. Meanwhile, on 30th July, a meeting stated %o be representative of the tribehad been convened in kgotla at Serowe and a reply on behalf of the tribe to theSecretary of State&apos;s invitation reached us through the District Commissioner on31st July. The reply was to the effect that the tribe regretted that only under the presidency of Seretse, Tshekedi&apos;s one senior in the tribe; would it be possible underBamangwato law and custom to permit Tshekedi&apos;s presence. It went on to suggestthat the interests of all would be best served if we agreed to travel throughout theReserve and make direct contact with the people in the villages and towns.16. At our invitation a small deputation, led by Keaboka, visited us informallyon the morning of 1st August, They enlarged to some extent upon the reasons forthe refusal (these reasons will be discussed later in this report) but were clearlyunwilling to amend their attitude.17. The refusal was firm, but we were not then disposed to accept it as final.It was, nevertheless, obvious that any process of persuasion would be prolonged and might.even then be unsuccessful. It therefore appeared to us to be the wisercourse to adopt, as an interim measure, the suggestion of the tribal representativesfor a series of district meetings, in arranging which they were prepared to co-operate.It seemed, indeed, that quite apart from the knowledge we would gain of theReserve and its people a programme of such meetings might be the best means ofestablishing confidence in our mission and thereby persuading the representativesof the tribe of the wisdom of holding a joint kgotla.18. .: In the ensuing nine days we travelled an aggregate of 1,500 miles and werepresent, either together or separately, at 8 meetings attended by perhaps 4,000members of the tribe. Before our departure the tribal representatives, though they- could not agree to a joint kgotla with Tshekedi present, said they would not offerobjection to the presence at such local meetings of any of Tshekedi&apos;s supporterswho lived in, or happened to be present in, the several localities. In fact, supporters of Tshekedi appeared at only four of these earlier meetings. At Mahalapye some30 of them appeared before our arrival, but the reaction of the gathering was soantagonistic that they had no choice but to leave under police protection. AtMadinare nine of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters and at Bobonong one, appeared; in both cases the people refused to proceed with the meeting until after they had departed.At Sefhare (claimed by Tshekedi to be a centre where support for him is strongest)30 Tshekedi men, some of them from Rametsana, sought to attend the meeting atWhich 300 persons were present. Mr. Lipson intervened in their behalf and in this instance the Headman allowed them to remain. It is significant of the weight of influence attaching to rank that Tshekedi himself presently claimed that his Sefharesupporters owed this immunity to the seniority enjoyed by their foremost leader.19. The meetings were most successful in the interest they attracted. At all times the tribesmen were most polite and courteous, making us welcome, but they also made overwhelmingly clear their attitude to Tshekedi, This they did not byvote so much, although in one or two instances votes were taken, but by methodsreminiscent of a Quaker meeting, i.e., after many speeches from the tribe theheadman expressed the spirit of the meeting. Often it was pointed out to us thatthe question we were putting had been answered by the tribe more than once ortwice before and that they had given clear and definite -answers which left no room for doubt.20. On Friday, 10th August, we all three reassembled at Mahalapye andresumed our efforts to persuade the tribal representatives to agree to the holding of a joint kgotla. In those efforts we were supported by the Administration.  On
the morning of 11th August the High Commissioner met some 60 of the repre-sentatives and in the afternoon we saw the same people. Both meetings were unsuccessful and at the second the tribal representatives went so far as to suggestthat if they were pressed further on the point they would be unable to continue their co-operation with us, even limited as it was to district meetings.21. Time had begun to press, and it was necessary for us to consider therecommendations we could make to the Secretary of State as to the proposed jointkgotla and our further programme. In the event, we advised the Secretary of State,strongly and unanimously, that the effort to secure a joint kgotla should be abandoned. In doing so we further expressed our unanimous and unqualifiedopinion that the alternative programme of investigation upon which we were engaged would give us all the opportunity we needed to arrive at a true valuation of the views of the people of the Reserve on the one question that was before us.Our reasons for making these recommendations may be summarised as follows: -(1) The smaller informal district meetings which we had attended and which,as stated above, numbered in the aggregate some 4,000 persons, hadbeen a success in that we had been able to make intimate contact withthe rank and file of the tribe, many of whom freely expressed theiropinions in open debate.(2) The freshness of discussion at these meetings, and the variety of speakers,.&apos; had been such as to rule out the possibility of wholesale previousdirection. It is true that the failure to arrange for a joint kgotla meant that Tshekedi Khama had had no opportunity to state his case in.person to the people of the Reserve and that, consequently, we had had no opportunity to observe their reactions to such a personal statement. Itis not for us to hazard conjecture as to the effect upon the tribe of astatement of his case by so compelling a personality as Tshekedi Khama,but we have no hesitation in recording our conviction that in theirpresent mood the people of the Reserve would not, in fact, give him ahearing.(3) To force the joint kgotla against the wishes of the tribal representatives would almost certainly be answered with a boycott by their supporters.The ability of the tribe to boycott a meeting had been effectivelydemonstrated in 1950, and we decided that a kgotla summoned in such circumstances, attended as would be likely only by Tshekedi and his supporters, would in no way advance the primary purpose of our mission.More was likely to be gained from the meeting, already arranged, withTshekedi and his people on his own ground where there would be no opposition and no difficulty in securing the attendance of his supporters.(4) Again, we had already received evidence of such strong feeling within the tribe that we could not ignore the possibility that, even if a joint kgotlacould be arranged, emotions might gain the upper hand and the kgotlaend in disorder.(5) Finally, although we had faithfully undertaken the task imposed upon us by the Secretary of State of seeking to secure a joint kgotla, it was thecase that native law and custom would make a full tribal kgotla essentialonlyif a decision were required from the tribe. Our mission was onlyto assess the state of feeling within the tribe and our ability to do this in one large formal kgotla might actually be restricted.22. In.making these recommendations we received the full support of theHigh Commissioner and the Administration. On Tuesday, 14th August, we learntthat the Secretary of State had accepted our recommendations and had decidedthat the intention to hold a joint kgotla could be abandoned in favour of ouralternative programme of investigation.Ill-Alternatives to the Joint Kgotla23. On Monday, 13th August, we met Tshekedi Khama at Rametsana, the locality within the Bakwena Reserve just south of the Bamangwato border towhich he had retired in 1949 and to which Seretse&apos;s father had been exiled by his &quot;own father many years before. We held three private meetings with Tshekedi and attended a public meeting of fully 200 of his supporters, at which Chief Kgari ofthe Bakwena was also present. Tshekedi&quot; repeated the arguments which have become so familiar in interested circles in London. He expressed the belief that-      41461 &apos; - &apos; .:   D      -
if he were allowed into the Bamangwato Reserve he could ensure a joint kgotla.As we state elsewhere in this report, remembering how the High Commissionersmeeting was boycotted in 1950, we did not share his confidence.24. On August 15th we were present at yet another district meeting atPalapye. A number of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters sought to attend, but their presencewas resented- by the mass of the people and the headman asked us to arrange forthem to leave before the meeting could proceed. Appeals failed to move the people,and after some discussion between ourselves we agreed that since it was theirown meeting the headman himself must take responsibility for asking them to go.25. On Thursday, 16th August, we held our final meeting in the Reserve, atthe capital, Serowe. This was a most impressive gathering of between 5,000 and,000 people, presided over by Keaboka as leading tribal representative, who had also invited the small European population of Serowe to be present as witnesses.Keaboka did not himself address the meeting except as Chairman to introduceus and state our object. If there were nominated speakers among those taking partthere were certainly more who spoke extempore and took their chance among the many who wished to speak. The refusal to agree to a joint kgotla was forcefullyexplained and-en two occasions, by loud and spontaneous acclamation, the meetingleft no doubt as to the general feeling on the subject of Tshekedi&apos;s return. No recog-nised followers of Tshekedi were present and none sought to attend.26. In the afternoon of the same day we met and talked with more than,000 women of the tribe, a succession of whom passionately and even threateninglyelaborated the theme &quot; we do not want Tshekedi back.&quot; (Women, too, were theringleaders in the disturbance at Mahalapye that made it impossible for Tshekedi&apos;ssmall band of supporters to state their case at our meeting.) This we note as anovel departure in local custom, since it is not the women&apos;s habit to engage in political discussion. That they should have done so on this occasion is evidenceof the strong emotion they feel on the subject of the present dispute.27. On 17th August, at Gaberones, we met, in the morning, some of theleading Europeans in the Protectorate, members of the European Advisory Council.In general they confirmed our interpretation of views expressed at the tribalmeetings. They were helpful especially about the economic background, animportant aid to understanding, but outside the scope of this report.28. In the afternoon we met chiefs of other tribes in the Protectorate, withtheir leading advisers, in all some twenty-six members of the Protectorate AfricanAdvisory Council. It is of interest that this Council were strongly of opinion that full discussion demanded the presence of both parties to the dispute, expressingregret that the Bamangwato representatives failed to accept the invitation to attend.Tshekedi was present, and the fact that those who spoke did so in his favour is perhaps a tribute to his great personal magnetism, but  it also reflected the pre-occupied concern of the speakers for the rights and privileges of Chiefs and chieflyfamilies:29. There was also made available to us for questioning a panel of respectedAfricans versed in native law and custom. It is evidence of the &quot;difficulty of inter-preting custom that Tshekedi objected to all three members of this panel (one of. whom is an expert constantly used in the Courts) but by this we were not greatlymoved since there was now little that we had need to refer to them.30. We then left the Bechuanaland Protectorate for Swaziland, where, onMonday 21st August, we had the pleasure of meeting Sobhuza, Paramount Chief ofthe Swazi Nation, and his Council. The Paramount Chief, a very distinguishedAfrican, strongly urged that the Bamangwato. dispute in all its aspects be submittedtd a-conference of leading Africans. On a major issue, however, he was scepticalabout the very possibility of Tshekedi returning to his country as &quot; a private- citizen.&quot;IV. Conclusion31. In pursuing pur task many matters came to our attention but only uponone, the views of the people of the Reserve on this question of the return of tshekedi khama as a private individual, are we called to judge. On this one question wehave no.hesitation in declaring that the return of Tshekedi Khama in any capacity
whatsoever at the present time and in the present circumstances would be contraryto the wishes of the majority of the tribe and bitterly resented by a substantial number. On this issue emotions now run dangerously high throughout the tribe.32. Only on one condition, that Seretse Kharrfa were present to preside, would the people agree to hear Tshekedi. That possibility is outside our terms of reference.;33. The main reason advanced to us, at our many hearings, for the refusal to hold a joint kgotla in the presence of Tshekedi was this; that Tshekedi, havingleft the Reserve and declared his allegiance to the Bakwena tribe, had therebysurrendered his right to take part in Bamangwato tribal discussions, and that bydeparting from native law and custom so far as to permit his return to attend atribal kgotla, they would open the way to a resumption by him, by. fhe mere forceof tradition, of all the authority that previously pertained to him as the seniormember of the tribe second only to Seretse. This argument rests upon the claim that by native law and custom Tshekedi&apos;s presence in a tribal kgotla would make him again a member of the tribe, and the rest would inevitably follow. We do not regard it as incumbent upon ourselves to pronounce upon this question of nativelaw and custom. It is sufficient to state that it is the view clearly and strongly held by, the tribe. To them &quot; private citizenship &quot; is impossible to a man of Royalrank.- 34. In fact, the mass of the tribe reject Tshekedi Khama&apos;s declaration of hisrenunciation of all claim to the chieftainship. In their view, whatever the intentions of Tshekedi, once he was again received as a member of the tribe, his claim toseniority within the tribe would be inalienable, even by himself. It is their contentions-tion that in making this renunciation, Tshekedi Khama was appealing to a Britishway of thought, and one that he knew to be foreign to the Bamangwato.35. It must be recalled that the present division in the tribe arose not fromTshekedfs going but from Seretse Khama&apos;s defiance of tribal opinion by marryingas he did in September 1948 without the tribal sanction that custom demanded.The division only became palpable after June 1949 when, in the kgotla meetingcalled by himself, Tshekedi suffered political defeat. In this connection, we were impressed by the evidence that Tshekedi&apos;s action in leaving the reserve was indeed&quot; strictly in accordance with tribal law and custom.&quot; He then appeared to accept and act on the tradition that there is no place for an opposition party within the tribe, and at the tribal kgotla, and that a defeated leader can only &quot; retire to hiscattle post &quot; or, preferably, banish himself altogether.36. If western phraseology is at all applicable Tshekedi&apos;s Government suffered a parliamentary defeat on a vote of confidence. It appears to the tribe, therefore,that Tshekedi&apos;s demand for readmission to the Reserve goes back on his formerdecision and is an attempt to climb back to power, with his Ministers, with thebacking of the Bechuanaland Protectorate Administration and of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. It has even been suggested that the true analogy is to be found inCharles the Firsfs dealings with his Parliament.     .. 37. At this point the conventions of the tribal aristocracy and hierarchy, andespecially their general acceptance by the people, gravely complicate the issue. at every meeting we attended it was obvious how every man knows his ov/n station,from the lowest to the highest, and it is particularly at the highest levels that thismatters. Genealogical tables are readily available making clear (what every tribes-man knows) the present rank in the hierarchy of the almost innumerable individualsof the Royal family-Seretse is No. 1, Tshekedi No. 2, Rasebolai (Tshekedi&apos;s righthand) No. 3, Keaboka No. 4 and so to the nth. During our visit, Rasebolai-No. 3 having been &quot; ordered.&quot; out of Serowe by the tribal representatives was eventuallyboWed out with salutations of &quot; Nkosi&quot; (Chief), At every point we were met bythe argument that these Royal rights are an inalienable birth-right.38. The chief fear is that if Tshekedi returns in the absence of a superior hewill and must step as of right into the position of Chief and bring about a counter-revolution and this in,spite of what amounted to his constitutional displacementby the kgotla in 1949. It is, in fact, impossible to conceive of Tshekedi &quot; as a privatecitizen &quot; so long at least as the Serowe kgotla is the dominant factor in Bamangwatopolitics. If he is at liberty to attend he automatically becomes its chairman andruler, and he has&apos;himself gone so far as to claim that by custom the decision of the kgotla is the decision of the president alone. -&quot;. 41461 \ ,   D 2 -
September 1951.14 &apos;39. In the course of our investigations we were faced with a series of personalgrievances, some of them dating from many years past, against Tshekedi. After. 23 years of personal rule personal grudges were perhaps to be expected. Therecan be no doubt of the great administrative ability shown by Tshekedi Khama in. the past, nor that he has great ambitions for the Bamangwato tribe. We received an impression, none the less, that if only for want of effective administrative machinery, Tshekedi&apos;s personal exercise of power paid little regard to the individual or his rights. It is significant that the spokesmen of the allied tribes in the &quot; backblocks&quot; were solid with those elsewhere in their expressed opposition to the return of Tshekedi.&apos; In their eyes even his laudable work for the Bamangwato secondary school at Moen (? g) involved them chiefly in the payment of a heavy cattle levywhich left so,much less revenue for the.establishment or development of schoolsneeded in their own localities. Clearly wishing to continue to enjoy greater freedom to manage their own affairs, the people now fear the return of this powerfulpersonality.40. We would record also that we have received ample evidence that thishostile feeling extends, in lesser but still large part, to the leading supporters of tshekedi, the so-called Rametsanes. It is our view that this feeling is one of suchstrength that the Administration may have to give this minority positive protection.Although the emotional storm makes it hard to judge the number of those whowould in different circumstances be prepared to follow Tshekedi, there is no doubtthat his active supporters include a high proportion of the ablest and administra-tively most experienced members of the Bamangwato and that their permanentexclusion from the Reserve would represent an impoverishment of the tribe.41. Perhaps our overriding impression is this, that the greatest need of thepeople of the Bamangwato Reserve is a period of peace to go about their everyday-affairs freed from the distraction of continuing disturbances resulting from consideration of the affairs of members of the chiefly house.H. L. BULLOCK.W. M. MACMILLAN.
ANNEX DReport by Mr. D. L. LipsonI. The purpose of the visit of the three observers to the Bamangwato Reservewas to find out and report on one question only: whether the tribe was in favourof the return of Tshekedi to the Reserve as a private individual or not, he havingrenounced all claims to the chieftainship.2. It was originally hoped to obtain this information by the summoning ofa special kgotla to be held at the capital, Serowe, which Tshekedi and his supporters would attend. We were to convey to the tribe the invitation from the Secretary ofState to hold such a meeting.3. Our first aim was to get both the opponents and supporters of Tshekedi toagree to the holding of a joint meeting. It was necessary to approach each sideseparately in order to obtain consent. Soon after our arrival in the Reserve we meton two occasions representatives of the tribe who were opposed to Tshekedi andurged them to accept the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation; They answered that before giving their reply they must consult those whom they represented in the various districts from which they had come. Subsequently they declined the invitation.The reason they.gave was that it would be contrary to &quot;native law and custom &quot;to hold such a meeting. Tshekedi, they said, had left the Bamangwato and gone tothe Bakwena tribe, to whom he now owed allegiance and paid taxes; he could not,therefore, take part in a kgotla of the Bamangwato. They declared that they were at war with &quot;the supporters of Tshekedi and could not agree to sit down at a meeting with them.4. Our approach to the representatives of the supporters of Tshekedi, whom we next met, resulted in an immediate acceptance of the Secretary of State&apos;s invita-tion. They welcomed, and to the end continued to ask for, a joint kgotla.5. The representatives of the tribe in refusing the Secretary of State&apos;s invita-tion said that they were willing for us to move freely throughout the Reserve andto attend kgotlas in the districts. These would enable us to ascertain the views ofthe tribe on the question of Tshekedfs return.6. We decided that it would be unwise at this stage to press our request fora special joint kgotla lest it might lead to the tribal representatives being unwilling to co-operate with us in the holding of the district kgotlas. They had already told us that if a special joint kgotla was summoned by the District Commissioner, whowas the legal Native Authority, they would boycott it, as they had done on a previous occasion. We should then be faced with the presence of only tshekedi and his supporters and that would not serve the purpose of our mission. We hoped,however, that if the district kgotlas were a success and we were able to convince the tribal representatives as a result of better acquaintance with iis that we werewhat we claimed to be independent observers, not concerned with taking sides asto whether Tshekedi should return or not, but only anxious to obtain the trueview of the tribe as a whole on this matter that they might later be willing to reconsider their decision against a joint kgotla.7. We then decided that in order to cover the whole Reserve it would notbe possible for the three observers to attend all the district kgotlas, so agreed togo separately on tour and each one of us to take his share of the meetings.8. Before doing this we held a tribal meeting at Mahalapye at which all three off us were present and spoke and heard the views of those present.9. At only one of the district kgotlas, that at Sefhare, were supporters of tshekedi allowed to be present, and there it was in consequence of a special appealmade to the headman. At this meeting the 300 present included 40 supporters of Tshekedi, some of whom spoke and were heard without interruption by the rest.10. These district kgotlas had this advantage: many of the speakers describedthemselves as private individuals. In this way we were enabled to obtain the viewof the rank and file. At a special kgotla the speeches would have been made bythe leaders only.II. All the same the district kgotlas were only a second best. Nothing could help us so much to form a true opinion of the views of the tribe as a joint kgotla
at which both parties to the dispute were present and were able freely to express their views.: ,12. On our return from tour we made a further attempt to secure a jointkgotla. An appeal was made to 60 representatives of the tribe, but they persisted in their refusal. .13. We three observers then went to Rametsana to meet Tshekedi and 200 ofbis supporters who were there with him. We had three meetings with Tshekedipersonally and one with his supporters. He and other speakers declared that herenounced all claims to the chieftainship, had committed no crime, all that he askedfor was permission to return to the Reserve as a private individual and look after his own personal affairs. (He is the owner of a large number of cattle, the majorityof which are in the Reserve, and maintained that their proper care required his personal visits to the cattle posts in the Bamangwato territory.) He asserted thathe had been banished without trial not by the tribe but by the British Government.14. The Rametsana meeting was followed by two others, one at Palapye andthe other at Serowe. At the former, attended by about 400, the headman insisted on the exclusion of 5 Tshekedi supporters who had come there. A strong protestwas made against their exclusion, but efforts to secure their attendance did not succeed, and the meeting proceeded without them.15. The exclusion here and at other meetings of supporters of Tshekedi wasproof of intimidation. It is true foat the?number excluded was small but it is reason-able to suppose that there were many other supporters of Tshekedi who were afraidto attempt to attend meetings because they feared violent treatment from their opponents.16. The Serowe meeting was the largest we had attended. There were over ,000 present. A final appeal was made there for a joint kgotla. It was pointedout to those present that, large and important as the meeting was, it was not the kgotla which the Secretary of State had hoped would take place because it wasrepresentative of only one side. The appeal fell on deaf ears. There can be little doubt that the representatives of the tribe had made up their minds before we entered the Reserve not to accept the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation to a joint kgotla.They paid no heed to the arguments used in favour of acceptance. In my opinionone reason for their refusal was their fear of the influence the presence of tshekedi and his supporters at a joint kgotla might have in winning over some of their sup-porters to his side. The experience of the meeting at Sefhare showed that it waspossible for supporters of Tshekedi to be present at a kgotla and speak without fearof violence, if the leaders gave their consent to their being present. The blame,therefore, for the refusal to hold a joint kgotla rests entirely on the representativesof the tribe. I believe that, if they had agreed to a joint kgotla, their followers wouldhave accepted their decision.17. In the afternoon we attended a meeting of the women of Serowe at their special request. This was a unique event since the kgotlas were attended only bythe male population; women had never before held such a meeting. Between 1,200and 1,500 women came to the meeting and many of them spoke. They pursued thesame anti-Tshekedi line which we had heard from the men speakers at their kgotlas.If anything they were more bitter in their denunciation of Tshekedi and indulged inmore threats against his person, if he returned to the Reserve, than we had heard from the men. It is a matter of conjecture how they came to be so violently anti-Tshekedi.&apos; 18. In the course of these meetings we addressed between us from 11,000 to12,000 of the adult population. It was quite clear that the overwhelming majorityof them were strongly opposed to Tshekedi&apos;s return under existing circumstances.The principal reasons for this appeared to be:  (a) They held Tshekedi chiefly responsible for the banishment of Seretse. This,. .of course, is not true. They believed that his opposition to Seretse&apos;smarriage was due to the desire to obtain the chieftainship for himself.&quot;(b) Tshekedi had been, Regent during Seretse&apos;s minority for 22 yearsand had certainly many achievements to his credit, but it was alleged that his rule had become increasingly autocratic, harsh and cruel andthat in the carrying out of schemes, excellent in themselves, he had show no consideration for those who had to do the work they entailed.
(c) They insisted that it was not possible for-Tshekedi to return to the tribeas a private individual; he was by birth second in rank only to Seretse.If he returned, while Seretse was absent, he would automatically have;    the right and influence which his royal birth demanded according to^_native law and cu&amp;om.  &quot; He was a chief by birth,&quot; they said,- &quot; onlyGod could take his right away?&apos; In practice, therefore, it is not possiblefor Tshekedi to live in the tribe as a private individual in *he absence of seretse.       &apos;.        -  &apos;    &quot;... h -    -    ;   .(d) They further declared that according to native law and custom Tshekedi,before he could return to the &quot;tribe, would- have to eome and ask forforgiveness from the chief of the. tribe ^ and obtain his consent to be-   readmitted. In view of Seretses banishment the tribe had no chief and,therefore, there was no one to whom Tshekedi could make his appeal.19. During &apos;;he course of our three weeks&apos; stay in the Reserve we also dis-cussed the question of Tshekedi&apos;s return to the tribe as a private individual withthe lawyers representing both parties to the dispute, with representatives of the traders in the Reserve, with the European and African Advisory Councils, andother leading African chiefs. After leaving the Reserve we visited Swaziland andhad a very interesting meeting with the Paramount Chief, Sobhuza, who discussed with us the reactions of the quarrel in the Bamangwato on the African race.20. The meetings we had attended gave the impression that there was an overwhelming majority against the return of Tshekedi but, before coming to this conclusion, there are other factors to be taken into consideration. Tshekedi wasbanished from the Reserve. His opponents, on the other hand, were in control ofthe tribe and were free to organise opposition to his return. The Secretary of state had undertaken that, if a special joint kgotla took place, the banishment of tshekedi would be suspended for the three weeks during which the arrangementsfor it were being made. He would then have been free to visit the Reserve, organisehis supporters, deal with any attempts at intimidation of them and encourage themto come forward openly in his support. Further, at the joint kgotla he wouldhave the opportunity of stating his case and attempting to remove what he con-sidered to be unfair accusations against him. Tshekedi is undoubtedly a man of very great ability and, in view of this and of his right of precedence, his presenceat such a kgotla might have influenced many to have changed over to his side. Itwould also have been possible to have put to the test the fears that were expressedin some quarters that his return to the Reserve would lead to serious violence and disorder.21. It is not easy to assess what proportion of the tribe would have been wonover to favour Tshekedi&apos;s return if he had been as free to make out his case for it as his opponents were to make out theirs against it. My own view is that, in spiteof all that Tshekedi could have done, there would still have been a substantial majority against his return, so long as Seretse remained in exile. The chief fearof very many of those who were opposed to Tshekedi&apos;s return would probably beremoved had Seretse also been allowed to return. They would, for the most part,acquiesce in his return, if Seretse were back in the tribe as chief and agreed thatTshekedi might rejoin the Bamangwato. Meanwhile conditions in the tribe aredeteriorating owing to the lack of strong leadership.D. L. LIPSON.21th August, 1951. .
