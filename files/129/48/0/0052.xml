[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF IHS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1951SECRETC. (51) 5218//? December, 1951REDUCTIONS IN CIVIL INVESTMENT IN 1952Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-The investment programme for 1952, which was approved by our predecessorsearlier this year, is much in excess of the resources available to achieve it. This is mainly, though not solely, due to failure to foresee the shortage of steel and thefull extent of the adverse movement of the terms of trade. The first has seriously affected building output, which has been less in 1951 than in 1950. The secondmakes it necessary that we should export more and invest less out of the produc-tion of the metal goods industries, which is limited in total by the steel shortage.If we do not do this we shall not have an external balance. This paper only servesto show how serious our position will be unless we can get more steel.2. The Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Committee charged withpreparing measures to deal with the economic situation instructed officials toprepare proposals for a revised civil investment programme for 1952. on theassumption that building work for defence purposes would be limited to 105 million at 1951 prices in that year, and that the amount of civil building work must, therefore, be limited to what could be done without overloading the buildingindustry on this assumption about defence work. We also gave instructions thatthe aim should be to reduce investment in plant and machinery by  100 million at1950 factory prices below the estimated level in 1951.3. I have circulated separately (C. (51) 45) the report by the investment programmes Committee containing proposals for implementing these instructions.The report is not an agreed document. The function of this Committee is to hear the conflicting claims of Departments and make proposals for an arbitration by ministers between these claims which will provide a programme which is reasonable in the light of the general economic situation. The main means for enforcing theprogramme are building licensing, the authorisation of investment plans and individual projects of nationalised industries and local authorities and public utilities, and the powers of persuasion possessed by the Ministry of Supply overthe engineering industry. These have recently been reinforced by steel allocation.Tthink that we should all prefer to see the level of investment kept within reason-,able bounds mainly by influencing demand through fiscal and monetary measures,but this can be brought about only by a change in the general situation which cannotbe made quickly. Meantime, in my view, we must continue to use such directcontrols as are necessary.4. The broad consequences of the recommendations made by the investment programmes Committee are as follows: - -(1) Building work, including work for defence but excluding housing, will be-    envisaged in 1952 at approximately the same level as was achieved in1950.   This is 2 per cent, higher than in 1951.   Nevertheless, the.    :: -   revised programme involves substantial cuts from the existing pro-gramme for 1952, which was 10 per cent, higher than the achievementi  . .        in 1950.  Since work has been planned and in many cases started with the object of building up to this higher level, the revised programme willCopy No.   2 o&apos;CABINET41594
mean that very few new projects can start in 1952 and that a good dealof work already licensed and possibly some work already started will&quot;have to be stopped;(2) the Committee point out that the use of steel for building is very muchheavier in certain kinds of work, notably that for the basic industries. and for manufacturing industry, than it is for housing and some kinds of rather less essential investment. It is therefore not possible to:&apos; : alleviate a situation which is largely due to a shortage of building steelby imposing the cuts on the least essential building projects. A choicehas to be made between imposing reductions on the programmes for essential basic industries, such as the Fuel and Power industries and theRailways, and imposing it on manufacturing industry projects whichare most desirable in order to improve the competitive position ofBritish industry. The Committee have put the weight of the reductions on manufacturing industry, but also propose a reduction in the verylarge total of the electricity programme of  8 million and a reductionin the programme for gas. The Committee envisage that the cut onelectricity will be made as to  2 million, by suspending rural electrifica-tion developments, and as to the residue by slowing down the long-term programme of the British Electricity Authority. This programme is a heavy user of building steel, but the reduction will mean accepting afurther delay beyond 1956 in bringing the supply and demand for electricity into balance if the present estimates of future demand are accepted. The cut on manufacturing industry will mean that in orderthat some essential projects can be licensed during 1952 work already&apos; licensed and some work in progress will have to be stopped.   These*        consequences are no more drastic and may. be less drastic than the steel,allocation will in any case require.  The cuts also fall fairly heavily .on water and sewerage, education, the health services and on the- - .   miscellaneous field shops, churches, hotels, commercial premises,public houses, and work on the reconstruction of blitzed cities.- 5. The reductions in plant and machinery and vehicle investment will to someextent be achieved as a result of the cuts on building, but the proposals envisage a cut of 30 per cent, on agricultural machinery for home use and a reduction of thehome market quotas for motor cars and commercial vehicles to 60,000 of each type,This is a very large reduction on the level of supply in 1951. A reduction of 10 percent, in shipbuilding, as compared with 1950, is proposed in spite of the importanceof this industry for defence and for invisible exports. This is in line with the current level of steel allocation. The Railway programme, which contains much plant, is put at  5 million more than the Railways achieved in 1951, but is slightly below thelevel of 1950. A special plea has been made by the Railway Executive and theTransport Commission for a much higher programme and steel allocations to matchit. The full reduction in plant and machinery required by the instructions to the investment Programmes Committee can, in their opinion, be achieved only if additional measures of control are introduced over the sale of plant and machinery to the home market. It is recommended that officials should give further cbnsidera-tion and report again on the means available for achieving this result. I think weshould agree that a reduction of the size required is unlikely to be achieved by&quot;per-suasion and voluntary means, though before any further form of control is intro-duced I consider that we should discuss the matter with industry.6. I have brought the proposals of the Investment Programmes committee before the Cabinet because in my view reductions in investment of the size proposed are .an essential part of the measures required to restore a healthy economy. I desire, therefore, to have the approval and support of my colleagues for the propo-sition that cuts of the size proposed are necessary. There is obviously much room for discussion as to how these reductions should be distributed over the component-programmes, and, if necessary, I propose to hold a meeting of the Ministers con-cerned to discuss the distribution proposed by the Investment. programmes committee. I must emphasise that it is of great importance to get the programme for 1952 firmly decided and implemented by Departments because it is now verylate to exercise any effective influence on the programme for 1952: This can be. done only if we take quick decisions and if these are enforced by my colleaguesthrough their Departments.
-7. There is, however, one major point raised by the Investment programmes committee for the consideration of Ministers. This is the size of the housing pro-gramme. The Minister of Housing and Local Government in his memorandum,C. (51) 43, has asked for authority to build new houses with the necessary&apos;housingservices at a rate of 300,000 houses a year to be achieved in 1954 (rising by stages in the intervening years), with authority to build more if he can. I am as anxious asanyone to get the housing programme up but I believe that we shall do this best byavoiding the error of attempting more than can be performed. It seems to me thatthere is great force in the argument that if the building programme is authorised ata level which would absorb the resources of labour and materials likely to beavailable, then there are bound to be local shortages which will have a wholly dis-proportionate effect on the total level of output. If, on the other hand, the pro-gramme leaves a margin of resources and labour, this does not mean that these resources are left idle. It means that the jobs in progress are completed moreexpeditiously. In fact we get more done by trying to do less. This, of course, isonly true within limits, but it looks to me as if the programme proposed by the investment Programmes Committee (which includes only 15,000 additional new houses in 1952) will leave only a small margin, if any,.of labour and resources in1952. If this is right we ought not to add more houses to the programme withoutreducing.something else. The cuts envisaged are already severe and I do not think we can envisage larger reductions. I think we shall do better in the long run if wewait until 1953 to review the possibility of introducing more than 15,000 additionalhouses into the programme. We should not, I suggest, decide that until we have the review of investment in 1953 and can see the setting in which the decision has to betaken. - -8. conclusion ask my colleagues to agree:  (1) that cuts in the investment programme of the size and general characterproposed by the Investment Programmes Committee are required and.     should be given early approval, subject to further Ministerial discussionof the distribution of the cuts if necessary;(2)&apos;that we should impose the reduction proposed by the Committee on theelectricity programme and take a decision to suspend rural electrification;work;(3) that the question of new forms of direct control over home investment inplant and machinery should be examined and reported on by officials as speedily as possible;(4) that we should limit the number of new houses to be built under theprogramme to 215,000 in 1952, and that we should await the investment programmes Committee&apos;s report on 1953 before setting a target for thatyear and for 1954. v   &apos;. &apos; R.A.B.       &apos;Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,\%th December, 1951.
