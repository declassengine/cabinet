THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY S  GOVERNMENT148Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.2 8C. (51) 36       . .. &apos;.3rd December, 1951CABINETWAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is my responsibility asj Foreign Secretary to advise The King on reccomendatons, for clemencv/ror German war criminals held in British custody in Germany. These number-38  in all. Such recommendations arise in the firstinstance out of a review now being undertaken by the United Kingdom HighCommissioner of all cases falling under his responsibility. This review does not,of course, cover the cases of the major war criminals sentenced by the international tribunal at Nuremberg, who are held under the responsibility of the four Powers.2. The present review has hitherto been governed by the following con-siderations:  - t--(a) When the question was last considered by the previous Cabinet in may the view was expressed that &quot; it should be made clear that the pre-rogative of mercy would be exercised only in a few exceptional cases and that in the ordinary way the sentences imposed on war criminalswould be allowed to run their course.&quot;ib) There has been some uncertainty about what pleas should be admittedwhen making recommendations for clemency; it was difficult to clear up this uncertainty because of the practical bearing of any decision onthe Cabinefs view expressed at (a) above.3. The pleas which have hitherto been regarded as inadmissible have includedpleas based upon the period of custody which war criminals underwent before theywere brought to trial, amounting in some cases to several years. The question I wish my colleagues to consider is whether such pre-trial custody periods should betaken into account.Recommendation4. I recommend that, in regard to war criminals under British control inGermany, the period of pre-trial custody should now be reckoned as countingtowards the sentence imposed in each case at the trial.Argument5. If a decision were taken in this sense, some 30 of our war criminalswould qualify for immediate release, while advantage would accrue to all the rest.The present clemency review would not be directly affected, since the prisonersreleased would be let out not by an exercise of clemency, but rather by an auto-matic revision of their sentences. But the clemency review, would be indirectlyaffected in so far as a number of the prisoners under review-would be released,while others would become eligible for release earlier than would otherwise havebeen the case.6. A decision in the sense suggested would bring us into line with the practiceof the other Occupying Powers. American and French practice is to take pre-trial41519&apos;.&apos; &apos;    &quot;  &apos;
custody into account. It would also be in general accord with practice in theUnited Kingdom. Judges are aware of the length of the period of pre-trial custody,and may take it into account in passing sentence. But, in the sentences imposed onthe war criminals for whom we are responsible, pre-trial custody was not as a ruleso taken into account. The decision I recommend therefore seems to me right onits own merits.7. It also has the following advantage. The contractual settlement which weare now negotiating with the German Federal Republic must include an agreement about war criminals. The question has been discussed by the Allied High Commis-sion and I hope shortly to submit recommendations to my colleagues. Whateversolution is reached we shall wish to be able to say, when the time comes to put it into force, that we have discharged our responsibilities justly. To this end the presentclemency review should be continued.8. A decision to count pre-trial custody towards sentence would both simplify the task of review, by automatically reducing the number of cases to be considered,and assist an eventual settlement of the whole difficult problem, by forestallingpossible reproaches that we had kept prisoners in custody longer than was just.- A.E. - -Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1951.
