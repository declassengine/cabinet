(51)2726th November, 1951CABINETPROGRESS OF REARMAMENT PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Minister of supply the 3-Year.Plan . -.In January 1951, the late Government announced a 3-year rearmament plandesigned to achieve the objects set out in Annex &quot; A;&quot;2. As a result of a preliminary calculation, it was estimated that this pro-gramme, at 1950 prices, would cost about  4,700 million. Production anddevelopment accounted for some  2,000 million. Of this the Ministry of supply is responsible for  1,670 million, made up as follows:  &apos;. ,        ..      .. .                  &apos; -   -            -   .  - ;                                   - (millions)Aircraft      ...     ....      .., :   ...      ....    .... .  ... 570Electronic equipment      ...      ...      ...      ... &apos;.   ... 110Munitions (i.e., other military equipment, weapons and vehicles)  ...      ...      ...      :..      ...              ... 420General stores (civilian type equipment and clothing) 570Total Ministry of Supply programme ..&apos;. ....  1,6703. This 3-year plan was formulated \on the unrealistic assumption that all necessary labour, materials and machine tools would be available when and whererequired. However, apart from the introduction last June of the &quot; D.O.&quot; prefer-ence system for steel and certain non-ferrous metals, armament production hasbeen given no general priority either in regard to materials or labour.. 4. By the summer it was clear that, owing mainly to rising prices, the cost ofthe programme would considerably exceed the estimate of  4,700 million. It wasalso evident that the assumptions about the availability of labour and materials would not be fulfilled, and that the programme would not be completed in fullwithin the 3-year period.Munitions . .     &quot;.&apos; &apos; -5. During 1951 the production of weapons, military equipment and vehicleshas fallen some way behind the programme. This has been due in the main toshortages of materials and to some extent to difficulties in clearing designs.6. The shortage of steel has affected output in many directions. Furtherdelays from this cause should &quot;be reduced when the system of steel allocationscomes into operation in February, provided, of course, that effective priority isgiven to defence work. &quot;7. Except in the case, of ammunition, labour has so far not been a serious problem in munitions production. The reason is that most of the firms concernedalready had the necessary labour, which could be progressively diverted to defenceorders as these replaced civil work.41473
8. The output of tanks has been fairly satisfactory, but difficulties are likelyto arise owing to the shortage of labour in the Coventry and Preston areas, wherethe needs of tank production conflict with those of export industries.9. The item which gives most serious cause for concern is ammunition.Unless the supply of labour in the filling factories can be substantially and rapidlyincreased, the output of vitally needed ammunition, such as the 20 mm., may not reach half the rate forecast in the 3-year programme. Here again difficulty arises from the fact that the two principal factories, Swynnerton and Chorley, have to compete for labour with important export industries.General Stores and Clothing -. 10, Although there are difficulties over certain items, it is probable that therequirements of general stores and clothing will be substantially met over the3-year period.Electronic Equipment11, The production of electronic equipment is not yet properly under way.This is principally due to delays in determining service requirements and to theinclusion in the programme of a large proportion of new types still in the develop-ment stage.12. The total output of the electronic industry is about  90 million a year(at 1950 prices). Defence orders, which are now running at the rate of  20 million,will, by the time the rearmament programme reaches its peak, increase to about 60 million. It is clear, therefore, that, without drastic reductions in civilian work,the capacity of the electronic industry will be insufficient to meet the large require-ments of the Services.13.   Whilst a considerable proportion of the labour required can be obtained. by turning over from civil work to defence contracts within the industry, an increasein the labour force of some thousands will be needed.   Since a high proportionof skilled men will be required, a difficult training problem will arise.14. The most important project in this field is the modernisation and extension of the air defence control and reporting system (&quot; Operation Rotor &quot;).The electronic equipment required is mostly still in the design or development stage.Nevertheless, it is hoped that, provided materials and skilled personnel are available,deliveries will be completed by the end of 1953.Aircraft15. The unsatisfactory progress of aircraft production, particularly of thenewest types, gives cause for anxiety.16. Broadly speaking, the programme is made up of two groups of aircraft:  (a) the older types that were already in production before the start ofrearmament, and(b) the new types of high performance which were then, and in some casesstill are, in the development stage.17, This programme provides for the production of the older types to bestepped up in 1951 and 1952 and to tail off or cease altogether before the end ofthe 3-year period. The production of the new types is to start at various datesduring this period and in most cases is not planned to reach peak levels until 1954or later.-   .18-. While there are some difficulties over design, materials and machine tools,the main limitation on output is the acute shortage of labour. The programmerequires the expansion of the labour force in the aircraft industry from 150,000to 300,000. By now it should have reached 185,000, whereas in fact it has onlyrisen to about 166,000.19. Unless there is a striking improvement in the supply of labour, outputof all types will fall, further and further behind the-programme.: In order toindicate the seriousness of the outlook, I attach at Annex &quot; B &quot; a table showing the shortfall in deliveries of the new types, which must be expected unless effective measures are taken to expand the labour force.
Action Recommended    - . -20. I am, of course, taking such action as is open to me to overcome theeffects of the labour shortage. Sub-contracting is being extended as rapidly aspossible. Firms are being asked to extend their facilities for training labour. Morepart-time employment of women is being encouraged. I propose, also to ask myService colleagues to consider a partial moratorium on changes in aircraft designs.21. These steps will be helpful; but in order to obtain any substantial improvement in the rate of deliveries, action on the following lines is needed:  (a) An appeal to be made by the Prime Minister for maximum effort on defence. work. ,(b) Effective priority to be given to defence orders in the allocation of labour,scarce materials and factory space.(c) A selective Control of Engagement Order to be introduced and TrainingCentres to be expanded, as proposed by the Minister of Labour(C. (51)18).id) Measures to betaken to release labour by curtailing the production ofgoods for home consumption.(e) Priority to be given, within the house-building programme, to the construc-tion of nouses in districts where labour is needed for defence work.(/) Further approach to be made to the United States Government-(i) to ensure that the highest priority continues to be given to machine tools ordered for the United Kingdom;(ii) to secure increased supplies of steel, ore and scrap;(iii) to secure the widening of &quot;end-item aid&quot; to include, accessoriesand components.* p. s.Ministry of Supply,20th November, 1951.ANNEX &quot;A&quot;Objects of the  4,700 Million programme the objects which the  4,700 million programme was designed to achievewere defined as follows:  Navy(a) To take all practicable steps to improve the state of readiness of the fleet in 1951:(b) To complete by the end of 1952 as much as possible of the production which, under the previous  3,600 million plan, it was intended to com-plete by March 1954.(c) To take further steps towards establishing adequate war reserves and tomake some further provision towards the Royal Navy&apos;s commitments in war under the North Atlantic Medium-Term Plan and in other ares which that Plan does not cover.W) To continue the modernisation of units of the Fleet, and to make a starton the replacement of older units. . .
