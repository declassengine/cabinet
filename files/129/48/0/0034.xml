\c&amp; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL &apos;        &quot; &apos;&apos;C.(51) -b4 - - &apos; COPY NO. S3&apos;&quot; &apos; * ---3RD DECEMBER, 1951    . .    : &quot;&apos; - .   &apos;   CABINET    *-: - RAILV/AY FREIGHT, DOCK AND CANAL, CHARGES     &apos; .    memorandum by the Minister of TransportUnder the Transport Act the Commission^ charges will in due course be determined by charges schemes settled by the transport tribunal after,public Inquiry.   The preparation of draft schemes by theCommission and their settlement by the Tribunal will take a long time.The Tribunal are just finishing their inquiry into a draft PassengerCharges Scheme submitted early this year.   It will, however, be aconsiderable time before a draft Freight Charges Scheme can be sub-mitted to and confirmed by the Tribunal.   To meet the position existing in the interval before all the schemes are in operation, Section 82 of theAct enables me to make Regulations authorising the Commission toincrease their charges, where in my opinion this is expedient with a. viewto ensuring a sufficient revenue to meet their obligations under the Act.2. In the recent proceedings before the Tribunal upon the draftpassenger Charges Scheme, the Commission submitted evidence that:-(a) .&apos;. with railway passenger and freight, and dock and canal, chargesat their present level, but allowing for increased revenue fromother charges not subject to the present control of the Tribunal orthe Minister, the Commission would, in 1952, incur a,deficit ofabout  39. 5 millions;(b) this position is due to actual and prospective increases in wage rates and the rising trend of prices;(c) the proposals as to passenger charges contained in the draft scheme would, if confirmed, produce in a full year additional revenue of about.  22. 8 millions still leaving a deficit of about.  16. 5 millions.3. In these circumstances the Commission have applied to me underthe Section for authority to increase, as soon as possible, existing railway freight, dock and canal, charges by 10 per cent subject, generally, to amaximum increase of 10/- per ton in the case of railway freight charges and subject to special increases of about 20 per cent in the charges for small parcels by goods train and 50 per cent in the charges for the carriage of returned empties.   These increases would produce about 22 millions in a future year.4, As required by the Act, I referred the application for the advice of the Permanent Members of the Transport Tribunal, acting as a consultative Committee,, and asked that such advice should be tenderedas soon as possible.  A copy of the Committee ?s Report is annexed.
5, &quot;The Committee felt some difficulty in tendering their advicebefore reaching conclusions on the evidence submitted in connectionwith the Passenger Charges Scheme, but in view of the urgency ofthe matter they decided to do so without public inquiry.   They recommendthat I should authorise as soon as possible the increases applied forexcept that the increase in the charges for smalls and returned emptiesshould, like the increase in other charges, be 10 per cent.   this modification would reduce the estimated yield from  22 millions to 21 millions.6. Tt is clear that the increases, together with such increases in passenger charges as may be authorised under:the scheme settled by the Tribunal, will do little, if anything, more than balance the commissions account in a full year.  As the passenger fare increasescannot operate fully before the end of April next, this balance is unlikely to be achieved in 1952.   Moreover no provision has been made for wipingoff the accumulated deficit, which was about  40 millions at the end of1950 and may well be  5 millions more at the end of 1951, or for establishing a general reserve as required by the Transport Act.7. To meet the present position, therefore, I am satisfied that theCommittee&apos;s recommendations should be accepted and I propose to make regulations accordingly to take effect as from 31st December,   I seekauthority to announce this in the House this Thursday and to circulateat the same time in the Official Report the terms of the Committee&apos;advice.3. I have discussed this matter v/ith the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, who agrees with my proposal.;/ - J.S.M.Ministry of Transport, W. 1.,3RD DECEMBER, 1951.
&apos;;     annex   ..  Memorandum for the Minister of Transport-by the. Permanent Members of t?ie Transport Tribunal-        Acting as a Consultative Committee1. By a letter dated the 23rd November you requested our advice ona proposal made by the British Transport Commission that they should beauthorised under section 82 of the Transport Act, 1947 -(a) to make the increases in railway freight rates and charges.   described in the Commission^ memorandum in the mannerfollowing&quot;proposal,:: -(1) A general increase of 10 per cent (except as hereunderprovided) on existing rates and -charges, includingmiscellaneous charges, in respect to merchandise trafficby goods and passenger trains, subject to a maximum,increase of TO/.- per ton in the case of merchandise bygoods train and perishable traffic by passenger train.(2) An increase of 50 per cent in the existing scale ofadditional charges in respect to small parcels (otherthan returned empties) by goods train (&quot;smalls&quot; bonus).!       This is estimated to be equivalent to an increase ofapproximately 20 per cent on this class of traffic.(3) An increase of 50 per cent in the existing charges for the carriage of returned empties.11(b) to increase by 10 per cent all the harbour, docks, piers, canalsand inland waterways charges now in operation which areregulated by statutory provisions.2, In your letter you informed us that you were impressed with theimportance of taking the earliest practicable steps to prevent the financialposition oc the Commission from becoming unmanageable and asked thatour advice should be tendered as soon as possible.3. If we may be permitted to say so, the request for our advice as amatter of urgency has placed us in some difficulty.4. We are on the point of concluding a public hearing into a passanger Charges Scheme submitted by the Commission.    Ve shall therefore in the reasonably near future have in effect to decide what if an)additional contribution can be expected of passengers in relief of theevident financial necessities of the Commission.    In these circumstances we do not think it would be right for us to enter upon any detailed dis-cussion in this memorandum of the extent of those necessities.5. All that we think it proper to say at this juncture is that as a__^result of the examination of the financial position and prospects of theCommission which the public inquiry has involved and of the additional information in the Commission^ memorandum we are satisfied -.      (a)    that the general considerations advanced by the commission are in substance well founded;
(b) that upon such an estimate as is possible in the circumstancesof the moment the annual deficit of the Commission at the   o. existing levels of freight and passenger charges would prove to be not less tl ian        millions and might well be  40millions:(c) that whatever additional revenue it may be equitable and practicable to obtain from the passenger services can do no more than alleviate the financial position of the Commission:(d) that there is at present no prudent alternative to an increasein freight charges aimed at providing in a full yearadditional revenue of the order of  20 millions:(e) that a general increase of 10 per cent on existing rates and charges is the best available means of meeting theCommission^ necessities,6. We are not satisfied that there is any sufficient justification forimposing what is in effect a special surcharge on the small parcels and returned empties traffic.7. We recommend accordingly that regulations be made as soon aspossible authorising the Commission to make -(a)    the additional charges described under head (1) of thev &quot;Proposals&quot; set out in paragraph 1(a) of this memorandum,subject to the deletion in head (1) of the words &quot;(except ashereunder provided)&quot;, and,-(b)    the additional charges specified in paragraph 1(b) of thismemorandum.(Signed)  HUBERT HULL- A.E. SEWELL..J.C. POCLE3rd December, 1951.\
