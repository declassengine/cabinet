^DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTV5   GOVERNMENT     I&apos;The circulation, of tins paper  has  been   strictly  limited. 4 tpIt is issued for the personal use of        4r, .TOP SECRET Copy No. -2^C.(51) 406TH DECEMBER, 1951CABINET.EGYPT &apos;-   . ,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAn urgent decision is required in connection with Egypt.    I donot want to burden my colleagues unnecessarily with a recital of the events which have led up to this but I attach a brief summary for refer-ence as an Annex to this paper.POSSIBILITIES OPEN TO US2, I would list these possibilities briefly as follows:-(a) Economic sanctions.(i)  Trade.   Egypt requires sterling from us and we importcotton from Egypt.    A recent interdepartmental paper\,now circulated to the Cabinet as C. (51) 35) concludesthat the loss of cotton from and exports to Egypt would cause considerable damage to the United Kingdom&apos;s      ---economy.    As for the Egyptian economy, it would be-    . thrown into hopeless confusion if extreme economic sanctions were imposed for more than a short period.(ii) Restrictions on Oil&apos;traffic from Suez to Cairo.     vVe canblock both road and rail transport of fuel oil from the refinery at Suez to the Delta towns.    This would bringbakeries, sewage plants and other machinery to a stand-still.   . We can also cut off the flow of kerosene, on whichthe population of the Delta depends for cooking, throughthe pipeline from Suez to Cairo.    If we blocked the flow of fuel oil or kerosene or both to the Delta, there is nodoubt that we should cause a rapid and complete dislocation-tion of the Egyptian economy.(b) Separation of the Canal Zone from the rest of Egypt.     We couldeither gradually or immediately take steps which would resultin our taking over responsibility for the administration of the canal Zone including the towns of Port laid, Ismailia and Suez.(c) Cutting of communications to the Egyptian forces in the Gaza&apos; area.   We could stop all supplies passing through the canal zone to the Egyptian forces in Gaza, thus making their position untenable. ;      :
3. Despite their obvious disadvantages, we might in certain circum-stances have to adopt one of these courses, or a combination of some ofthem, in order to bring pressure to bear upon the Egyptian Government,or to secure our own position.    In the last resort, also, we might be obliged to despatch forces to Cairo and Alexandria in order to dominatethose towns.    We should only do this if it were necessary to protect british lives there.    In addition to the fact that each of these measuresmay involve us in a physical commitment of unforeseeable size, theywould all have to be justified in relation to the circumstances existingat the time in Egypt, if we are to retain the support of world opinion.VIEWS OF H.M. AMBASSADOR AT CAIRO AND COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF MIDDLE EAST4. We have recently called for joint recommendations from the ambassador at Cairo and the Commanders-in-Chief Middle East.    Theseare contained in telegrams Nos. 572/CCL and 573/CCL.    Cairo telegramNo. 1084 is also relevant.    The recommendations in short are that, ifthe situation in the Canal Zone has not improved within ten days, v/we should (a) tighten our military control in the Canal Zone and (b) applyeconomic sanctions if other measures fail.    Since then we have receivedfrom the Commanders-in-Chief their telegram No. 578/CCL, whichpoints out that, owing to the deterioration in the situation in the canal zone, the Commanders-in-Chief might have to ask for immediate approvalof the additional powers for tightening up our military control in the Canalareai    These powers in effect amount to powers to detain indefinitely,try, punish (and if necessary execute) Egyptian terrorists in the Canalarea.THE PRQ3LEM5. The question is whether we should authorise the Commanders-in-Chief to assume these powers, bearing in mind the fact that to do so will almost certainly lead eventually to the establishment by us of fullMilitary Government over the Canal Lone area,6. The Chiefs of Staff have pointed out in a recent paper (C.O,S.(51)681) that the administrative implications of imposing Military Governmenton the area v/Ould be &quot;almost intolerable&quot;.    These implications may besummarised as follows:-We might have to provide food for the greater part of thepopulation in the Canal Zone, about 400,000 in number.It would take six weeks to stockpile and ship this food to Egypt.We should have to find.a number of British specialist personnel,e. g. police and technicians for public utilities (I am advised that legislation would be needed for the partial mobilisationnecessary to provide them).V/e might have to occupy a point or points.on the Sweet WaterCanal on the edge of the Delta.7. It is fair to say that the Ambassador has expressed doubt whetherthe Egyptian Government v/ould in fact cut off food supplies from the Canalarea, but he does recommend stockpiling in this country against thepossibility that we might have to feed the inhabitants of the Canal Zone.The Gommariders-in-Chief have also recommended that we should make itclear to the Egyptian Government in advance that we should cut their(a)(b)(c)(d)
communications with their armed forces at Gaza if they failed to providefood for the population.    Nevertheless we cannot be certain that this threat would be effective.    If we now embark upon a course of actionwhich may lead to Military Government in the Zione, we must plan uponthe assumption that: we may be compelled to take the steps set out inparagraph 6 above.8, As regards the economic sanctions which the Ambassador andCommanders-in-Chief have recommended, my colleagues will have notedfrom the paper on economic sanctions already reirred to (C,(51) 35),that it is stated therein that &quot;it is not in our interest to impose suchsanctions unless we can rely upon them to produce quick and satisfactorypolitical results&quot;.    A substantial interference with the flow of oil wouldbe likely to produce such serious disturbances in the Delta that we shouldbe obliged to intervene for the protection of British lives and to sendforces to Cairo and Alexandria.    Other economic sanctions however arenot so likely to be rapid in their effect, and should not be employed for thereasons given in the paper referred to,conclusion, In my judgment the situation is not yet ripe for forcing the fall of the Egyptian Government.    I consider it unlikely, on the information available to me, that King Farouk would at present be prepared to inter-vene on our behalf to the extent of changing his Government.    this estimate is reinforced by the virtual impossibility of our making any concession to him over the Sudan,    Moreover, there do not at presentappear to be any alternatives to the existing Government,    We should thus be faced with a political impasse.10. Furthermore, I think it would be premature now to commit ourselves to a policy which might entail the sealing off of the Canal Zonefor an indefinite period.    While, therefore, I would be prepared toauthorise the Commanders-in-Chief to detain Egyptian terrorists for an indefinite period if necessary (despite the dubious legality of such action),I do not consider that the situation warrants our authorising them to setup courts for the trial and punishment of such terrorists,    I feel that wemust do our utmost to avoid a situation which obliges us to establishMilitary Government in the Canal Zone.recommendations i recommend that - .1 ----- -We should authorise the Commanders-in-Chief to keep Egyptianterrorists in detention for an indefinite period, if in their judgment the situation in the Canal Zone demands this.In view of the probable implications of the assumption by proclamation of powers to try and punish terrorists, the commanders-in-Chief should be informed that we cannot atpresent authorise them to assume such powers.Since we may nevertheless find ourselves obliged, contraryto our present policy, to take steps in the comparativelynear future which may lead to the establishment of military government, my colleagues should consider whether we      .   ... .-.If.(a)(b)
is a. should not urgently put in hand preparations to enable,&apos;. the necessary administrative measures to be taken incase Military Government has to be set up,(d) As soon as these preparations are well in hand, and on the/assumption that the situation in the Canal Zone has notimproved, I should instruct H.M. Ambassador at Cairo tocbnvey a stern warning to the King and a threat that weT   Trriay feel obliged in the near future to take much more drastic measures than we have done hitherto,(e) We should instruct the Ambassador and Commanders-in-Chief that we are not prepared at present to authorise theimposition of economic sanctions.    In particular we shouldnot increase the present restrictions on oil movement fromSuez to Cairo.(f) . We must do our utmost to secure continued support for our policy from our friends, especially the Americans, and understanding of any measures we may have to take for\^ th,5*protection of our forces in the Canal Zone,(g) We should maintain so far as possible our good relationswith the Egyptian armed forces and with King Faroukhimself,(h) We should keep the situation constantly under review.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH DECEMBER, 1951.
PRESENT SITUATION   - .On 15th October last the Egyptian Parliament voted legislationpurporting to abrogate the 1936 Treaty of Alliance with Egypt, and the condominium Agreements relating to the Sudan,    They also rejected the Four-Power proposal^ for. setting up a Middle East Command whichhad been presented.to thera by ourselves, the United States,: France and turkey, . On 6th November we informed the Egyptian Government that :we did not recognise the&apos; abrogation of the. Treaty or^ Agreements and that. we intended fully to maintain our rights under those instruments. * Inaddition we stated that we held the Egyptiar^Governmeiit responsible forany breach of the peace and any damage to life or property which might result from their purported abrogation of these instruments.    We have therefore maintained our position in the Canal Zone, and have reinforcedour troops there by the equivalent of four Brigade Groups,    V/e could ifnecessary move in a further Brigade from Tripoli and one Brigade from cyprus.2. These reinforcements have been made necessary by the deterioration in the situation in the Canal Zone which has taken place since the Egyptian abrogation of the Treaty.    The first thing thathappened was an outbreak of rioting in Ismailia on 15th and 16th Octoberdirected against us, which required the intervention of British troopsowing to the failure of the Egyptian police to act.    This was followed bya series of incidents.    The second thing was the withdrawal of theEgyptian labour force employed by us in the Canal Zone.    This was effected by intimidation, in which the Egyptian police not only connivedbut took an active part.    As a result about 90 per cent of the previouslabour force of approximately 60,000 has ceased to work for us.^Thirdly, there has been outbreak of terrorist activities throughout the canal Zone directed against the British forces and involving sabotage andthe murder of British troops.    This is not at present upon such a scaleas to cause serious dislocation of our activities, but is growing and islikely to have an increasingly adverse effect upon the morale of thetroops.    The Egyptian police have not only failed entirely to suppress it but have connived at it, and on 17th and 18th November they provoked aseries of incidents in Ismailia of such gravity that the G.O.C. BritishTroops was obliged to arrange for the Egyptian police to be disarmedand confined to barracks while the responsibility for the maintenance of order was temporarily taken over by British troops in that town.Since then British families have had to be evacuated.    Further seriousincidents have recently taken place at Suez.    Meanwhile the working ofthe Suez Canal itself has been impeded by the withholding of facilities bythe Egyptians, the withdrawal of labour, and strikes of Egyptiantechnicians.    Although the Suez Canal Company&apos;s services are stilloperating, British forces have had to take over to a considerable extent the operation of the facilities necessary for the passage of ships of all nations through the Canal.    Throughout this period the Egyptian Govern-ment, under cover of the imposition of strict censorship, have conducteda campaign of the grossest mis-representation of the facts and accusationsagainst the conduct of our forces in the Canal Zone.    On 22nd October .we were compelled to impose restrictions on the movement of oilbetween Suez and Cairo.    Although these restrictions were removedbecause of the risk of chaos in the Delta, we have recently authorisedtheir partial resumption as an intermittent measure.
3. While our relations with the Egyptian Government are thereforeextremely bad, we know, that King Farouk is uneasy about the deadlockwhich has been created and dissatisfied with his Government.    Indeed,we had a message from the Egyptian Prime Minister which indicated that he himself was not confident about the position of the Governmentand was uncertain about the eventual outcome of the situation which he himself has so recklessly provoked.    Moreover, our relations with theEgyptian armed forces remain correct, and they have at no time inter-intervened in the dispute.    No doubt they are fully aware of their precarioussituation, since we can at any time cut the lines of communication to themain part of the Egyptian Army in the Gaza area.    Meanwhile there havebeen many indications that the other Arab states are annoyed at theEgyptian rejection of the Four-Power proposals without consulting them,and reluctant to follow the Egyptian lead in this matter.    This rift in theArab League must^of course be causing the Egyptian Government con-siderable anxiety.4, The economic position of Egypt is deteriorating, since her ports,with the exception of Alexandria, are now virtually closed and many cargoesare being diverted elsewhere.    This means a serious loss in customs revenue, on which the Egyptian Government largely depend.    The embassy in Cairo have recently estimated that this loss may already amount to asmuch as 15-20 per cent of the total revenue of the Egyptian Government,Meanwhile, there has been no general boycott of British goods in Egypt andtrade relations between the two countries continue on something like a normal basis.    We have however ceased the export of arms to Egypt.5. In order to complete this brief review the question of the Sudanshould be mentioned.    King Farouk has been proclaimed King of theSudan as well as of Egypt and the Egyptian Parliament has laid down theoutlines of a future Constitution for the Sudan, which gives control offoreign affairs, defence and finance to the Egyptian Government and makes the future Sudanese Ministers responsible to the King of Egypt,    the egyptians have always insisted upon linking the solution of the future ofthe Sudan to the problem of British forces in the Canal Zone, and the Kinghimself takes a personal interest in this question since his prestige as&quot;King of the Sudan&quot; is involved.    We for our part have always insisted that the Sudanese must be free in due course to determine their future status for themselves.       .
