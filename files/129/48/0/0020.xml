DJ0GUM&amp;NT -IS THE-FRQP-ER-T-Y-OF HIS-BR4TANNIG MA-JEST-Y-SS-GOVERNMENT)-CONFIDENTIAL,C.(51) 20 COPY NO0-17TH NOVEMBER, 1951\ -CABINET   ; -   .   &apos;BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION -&apos; CHARTER AND LICENCEMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Charter and Licence of the B.B.C. expire on 31st December,1951, and the term of office of all the Governors comes to an end on thesame day.    It is therefore urgently necessary to decide what action should be taken to continue the Corporation.2. My colleagues will be aware that the Broadcasting committee presided over by Lord Beveridge reported on 15th December, 1950(Cmd. 8116); that the late Government presented a White Paper on theReport in July last (Cmd. 8291); and that debates took place in theHouse of Commons and House of Lords on 19th July and 25th Julyrespectively.    The main discussion centred round the issue of monopoly;the proposed term of 15 years for the new Charter;  the proposal to cut the Parliamentary grant to the B.B.C. to 85% of the net licence revenue,and the proposals respecting Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland.3. The procedure, had there been no change of Government, wouldhave been for the Government to incorporate their final decisions in adraft Charter and in a Licence and Agreement and to present bothdocuments to the House of Commons and House of Lords.4. In view of the proposal that the House should adjourn early inDecember, it would be unwise to hurry final decisions on-the terms of a charter and Licence, and in any event impossible to prepare these documents in time to permit of a debate before the House rises.    i suggest, therefore, that we should inform the House that further time will be required for the consideration of the wide range of topics dis-cussed by the Broadcasting Committee and that we intend to continuethe British Broadcasting Corporation by means of a short Charter andLicence for a limited period, generally on the terms and conditions ofthe existing documents.5. If this proposal is agreed, two questions arise.    The first isthe period of extension.    If my colleagues are of the view that theCorporation should continue on substantially the present basis, I suggestthat the extension should be for six months.    That time should besufficient for us to consider all the issues arising, including the questionwhether, while maintaining the Corporation as the sole broadcasting authority entitled to a grant of Parliament, we wish to breach theirmonopoly to a greater extent than was contemplated by the late Govern-ment, for example, by announcing that we reserved the right to license
other bodies to conduct sponsored broadcasting.    That right existstoday as a matter of law but the Government White Paper of 1946(Cmd. 6852) declared that the B.B.C; would continue to be the onlybody licensed to originate broadcasts in this country.    If, however,still more fundamental questions-, such as a break-up of the B.B.C,are to be considered, we should, I think, require extension for a year,I hope that we can at once rule out this alternative.6, An extension of six months - which I recommend - wouldinvolve a debate in the early part of 1952 and my colleagues will nodoubt consider whether this fits the Parliamentary time-table.&quot; -7, The second question is whether we should for the period&quot; of extension continue to pay the full 100% of net licence revenue to theCorporation, or whether we should forthwith adopt the proposal of thelate Government to pay only 85%.    The difference for the first sixmonths of 1952 would be about  900,000.    I think that there is great advantage in following up without delay the proposal of the previous government and the case for the reduction to 85% is reinforced by thepresent financial position of the country.    In reaching this conclusion have not overlooked the statement made by Mr. W.S. Morrison, leadingfor the then Opposition in the debate of July, that &quot;it would be veryunwise to give the B.B.C. less than the whole of the licence revenue atthis time&quot;, and the possibility that the Opposition might use this state-ment against us (or even use it as a pretext for pressing for a debate).I hope that my colleagues will concur in my conclusion to reduce thegrant to 85% for the extension period.8. An extending Charter and Licence of this kind would not requireformal approval by Parliament as this short term Licence would not come under Standing Order 87.    I am advised that it would be sufficient to announce our intentions in a Statement after Questions and to present thedraft Charter and (executed) Licence as soon as possible to both houses for their information.    There would seem to be little reason why.theOpposition should press for any debate at this stage: if they do, thematter would no doubt be.discussed through the usual channels.9. During the period of grace that I propose that we should giveourselves the most important issues to be dealt with will be the pointmentioned in paragraph (5), the problem of National Councils and theperiod of the new Charter.    On the only points on which it is now necessary for me to seek immediate decisions, I recommend:(a) that any break-up of the B.B.C, should be ruled out,(b) that the Charter and Licence should be extended for sixmonths (paragraph 5), and(c) that the grant be cut to 85% from 1st January, 1952(paragraph (7)).D.  ...Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1,17TH NOVEMBER, 1951. .
