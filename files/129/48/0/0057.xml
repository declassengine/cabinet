IIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1951SECRETC (5i) 5720th December, 1951STERLING BALANCESNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer in accordance with the request of the Cabinet at its meeting on 1st November(CC (51) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 3) I circulate herewith for the information ofmy colleagues an objective account of the sterling balances.Egypt2. We must decide before 31st December whether to honour our undertaking to release to Egypt  10 million (or  15 million according to the state of her freeNo. 1 Account) on 1st January, 1952 (see paragraph 5 of the paper). To refuse the release would certainly be regarded by the Egyptians as the imposition on them of a major economic sanction. We know that they are very much concerned aboutthe possibility that the 1951 Agreement will be abrogated by the United Kingdomand the release withheld. We cannot be certain that if the release is made it will improve our relations with Egypt, but it is clear that to withhold it would resultin a serious deterioration in them. My colleagues will remember that on 7th December (CC (51) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet approved therecommendation of the Foreign Secretary that no economic sanction should betaken against Egypt at present. I think this decision remains the right one and i accordingly recommend that the releases due on 1st January, 1952, should be madein accordance with the Agreement. This will involve no positive action on our part. The Bank of England will merely accept instructions from the National Bankof Egypt to transfer the sum involved from Egypt&apos;s No. 2 to her No. 1 Account.^-:-&apos;.7::--i-:,.. r.

annex the STERLING BALANCESOrigin of the Sterling Balances and their movements since war1. Broadly speaking, the &quot;sterling balances&quot; consist of the net sterlingliabilities of United Kingdom banks and other financial houses to overseas-customers : they include funds held as cover for Dominion and Colonial note issues and the London funds of the Crown Agents for the Colonies. Before the warthe total of such liabilities was about  600 million, of which about  340 million was due to Commonwealth countries. By the end of 1945 they had risen to about 3,700 million. This great increase was mainly due to United Kingdom military expenditure in the countries concerned and to the fact that, owing to our inability to export during the war, we had to pay in sterling and not goods, for our essential imports.2. The table appended to this note shows, at intervals since the war, how theUnited Kingdom sterling liabilities have been distributed geographically by areas,including separate figures for the countries with the outstandingly large balances.3. During 1946 and 1947 the total fell by  91 million. Some countries (India,Pakistan, Egypt) drew freely on their balances, in order to finance deficits in their^balance of payments. In other cases (the Colonies and South America) the balancesgrew, because the countries concerned had favourable trade balances. During 1947,however, the crisis in the United Kingdom balance of payments made it necessaryfor us to secure the agreement of the countries with the largest holdings to a restriction of their right to draw on them. The principal agreements were with india (undivided), Egypt and the South American countries: and these provided forthe blocking of the balances and for the limitation of drawings to agreed annuaiamounts. . In the case of Australia and New Zealand, who had made gifts to theExchequer, there were informal understandings that their balances would not bedrawn down below the then current levels (about  130 million and  70 million)except for certain agreed purposes (e.g., the repatriation of sterling debt). In thecase of the Colonies we relied on their voluntary co-operation not to run theirbalances down.During 1948 and 1949 the total again fell, by  186 million. India, pakistan and Egypt continued to draw on their balances at agreed rates to finance tradedeficits. The Argentine paid out large sums in compensation for the British-ownedrailways she acquired. On the other hand, Australia and West Africa were ableto accumulate sterling as a result of favourable trading balances and, in Australia^case, because of a large inflow of sterling capital.The year 1950 and the first half of 1951 showed a very different trend and thetotal rose by about  750 million. As a result of rising prices of raw materials and generally more favourable trade positions, India&apos;s balances remained practicallystable artd Pakistani increased. Those of Australia and the Colonies increasedby no less than  268 million (or 75 per cent.) and  325 million (or 56 per cent.)respectively. The balances of countries outside the Sterling Area remained, in total,practically stable.But. in recent months the trend has been reversed once more. July showedlittle change on the whole, but during August, September and October&quot; the totalof the balances fell by  30 million,  90 million and  80 million respectively. Owingto the fall in the prices of their main products, coupled with rising import costs,practically all Sterling Area countries except the Colonies found it necessary touse. their, balances to meet trade deficits. In the result, the total of the sterlingliabilities to all Sterling Area countries fell during the four months ended.3.1st October, 1951, by about  180 million. Those to non-Sterling Area countries. remained, in total, little changed.The Blocked Balances - -  -     *.&apos; 4. From 1947 until this year the release of these balances was governed by successive agreements made for one year (or sometimes two years) at a time. the colombo Plan, which involved programmes of expenditure on development by thecountries of South and South-East Asia over six years from. July 1951, made itnecessary to agree with some of the countries concerned how far their blocked
sterling balances should be used to help to finance the trade deficits which are likelyto occur during the period of development. As a result of discussions during 1950and 1951 agreements were reached with India, Pakistan and Ceylon, which effectedfinal settlements of these countries&apos; balances. The main provisions of theagreements are:   &apos; &quot;(a) In the case of India and Pakistan, so much of the blocked sterling as repre-... sents the minimum amount required to be kept as backing for the local currency is to be.transferred from their blocked accounts to their free[accounts; but in each case it is the subject of assurances that there isno intention of.drawing on it and that it will not be drawn on without previous consultation with us. The amounts in question are India. 310 million, and Pakistan  30 million. (Ceylon was offered, hutdeclined, a similar arrangement.)      ^ ?(b) For all three countries, the remaining blocked sterling is to be released inequal annual amounts over six years of the Colombo Plan. The amountsto be so released are: India,  35 million a year; Pakistan,  4 million ayear; Ceylon,  3 million a year.Egypt ,5. From 1947 to this year the release of Egypt&apos;s balances had also beenregulated by successive annual agreements. When it had been agreed to make long-term settlements with India, Pakistan and Ceylon, it was decided to negotiate asettlement with Egypt, which had for some time been pressing for a more permanentarrangement. The agreement which was signed in July 1951 provided, as regardsthe blocked sterling balances:  (a) that  14 million should be converted into gold or dollars at once thishas been done; and: (b) that:out of the remaining blocked balances ( 216 million)  135 million should be released over a period of ten years (which may be extendedto thirteen years) at the rate of  10-15 million a year. The remainder ofthe blocked balance ( 80 million) is to be considered before the endof the agreement period.The Cabinet has already considered the general question of our economic andfinancial relations with Egypt. A decision will be necessary before the end of thismonth whether any steps should be taken to prevent the releases to which Egyptwill otherwise be entitled in 1952 under the agreement of last July. Under that agreement Egypt is entitled to  10 million certainly and perhaps to  15 million on 1st January, 1952. &quot; ..        - &apos;.&apos;6. There are some minor agreements for the release of other blocked sterling balances, but they are insignificant from the point of view of general policy.&quot; &apos; 7. The present position of the blocked balances is, therefore, that we are committed to agreements which effectively settle these balances by providing fortheir ordered release over the next six to ten years.The Free Balances8. The blocked balances subject to restricted annual releases are in fact now a small proportion of the total only some  500 million out of some  4,000 million.The major part of the balances consist of (a) the balances of those countries none of whose balances have been blocked (some  2,650 million); (b) the free balancesaccumulated by &quot; blocked &quot; countries out of unspent releases of past years or asa result of post-1947.trading and financial transactions (some  500 million); and(c) the currency reserves of India and Pakistan, which are nominally free but which those countries have agreed not to draw on ( 340 million).9. The free balances of the members of the Sterling Area which account for some  2,300 million out of those under (a) and (b) above are a fundamentalfeature of the Sterling Area. Such members conduct the great bulk of their over-seas trade and payments in sterling and, for that purpose, require to hold theirexternal reserves in sterling. Their currencies are, formally or informally, linked with sterling and they therefore find it necessary or advantageous to hold sterlingas currency backing. Sterling is also held for special purposes such as pension funds and\ sinking funds. Broadly speaking, the sterling balances of a member are thenecessary cushion which takes the shock of movements in its balance of payments.A41620 &apos; - b 2
In times of surplus it accumulates sterling: at other times it draws on balancesso accumulated to meet its deficits. As has already been shown, the sterling balances of the Sterling Area countries rose appreciably up to June last as a resultof their favourable trade and payments positions. This had considerable advantages for the United Kingdom in that we were able to pay for a large partof our imports in sterling instead of having to provide compensating exports.Clearly, however, the members concerned were content to allow this sterling to accumulate only on the assumption that when their.balance of payments turnedthe other way they would be free to use the sterling to meet their deficits. this they have already: been doing during recent months and it is clear that they will need to continue doing so; Their freedom to draw down their balances in thisway, as and when necessary, is vital to the continued existence and cohesion ofthe Sterling Area.- 10. That is not. to say, however, that the United Kingdom Government is necessarily helpless to influence the rate at which these free balances are drawn on in the future. It would be wrong for us directly to restrict the use of the balancesthemselves; but we shall, in fact, hope to persuade the other members in the sterling Commonwealth, in our forthcoming consultations with- them, to adopt suchpolicies as will result in a reduction of their trade deficits and so of the rate atwhich they will, need to draw on their balances. I shall be submitting recommenda-tions to my colleagues about our policy at the forthcoming meeting of Common-wealth Finance Ministers in due course.The American Loan Agreement (December 1945).11. This Agreement contained a clause stating that the Government of theUnited Kingdom &quot; intends to make agreements with the countries concerned . . . .for an early settlement&quot; of the sterling balances and that we would &quot; make every endeavour to secure the early completion&quot; of arrangements for dividing each country&apos;s accumulated balances into three categories: (a) those to be released atonce and made convertible for current transactions; (b) those to be released by instalments over a period of years beginning in 1951; and (c) balances to be&quot;adjusted&quot; as a contribution to the settlement of war and post-war indebtednessand as a recognition of the benefits to be derived from a settlement of this question.12. Although we made the promised endeavours, we have never been able to achieve the settlement proposed in this clause. Discussions with India, the largestholder concerned, in 1947 emphasised the political impossibility of securing Indianagreement to the cancellation of any part of her balances. (Her main argumentswere that in fact she contributed more than her share of the cost of the war andthat she regarded the balances as external reserves to be used for essential economic development.) Similar discussions were held about the same time with Egypt, wholikewise refused, to agree to any cancellation.13. Since 1947 our policy has been that cancellation must be secured by&apos;agreement and cannot be imposed. The United States Administration have notin fact pressed us to implement the provisions of the Loan Agreement: no doubtthey have recognised our difficulties and have been content with the &quot; blocking &quot;measures we have taken to deal with the situation. Our latest discussions with thenTwere in the spring of 1950, when we were considering the policy of funding most ofthe balances of the Colombo Plan countries over the six years from 1951. We theninformed the Americans of our general plans and suggested to them that anyvoluntary cancellation of balances was only likely if it was in exchange for UnitedStates aid towards development. On the latter point the American reaction was quite negative-any question of United States aid must be settled on the merits of individual countries&apos; needs and not as part of a scheme for dealing with the sterling balances. In the meantime they encouraged us to go ahead with funding. Therehave been no further discussions with the Americans on our general policy and wehave gone, ahead on the lines set out earlier in this note.
