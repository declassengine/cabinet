faS&apos; DO&amp;UMEN-T-4S THE-PROPERT-Y-OS-HIS--BRXTANNIC-MAJEST Y?S GOVERNMENT)SECRETsro. 3-0      .C.(51) 6 - COPY NOCABINETCTrt3&amp;9 NOVEMBER, 1951EFFECT OF IMPORTING AMERICAN coal memorandum by the Minister of supply in considering the proposal to import .j million tons of coal from the United States (C.(51) 5), the Cabinet should be aware of its likelyeffects upon steel production.2. The decision to import 1^ million tons of American coal intothe United Kingdom last year resulted in a shortage of shipping which led to a large loss to us of iron ore shipments.    If we now import\ million tons of coal from the United States and, as before, the shipping is obtained mainly at the expense of iron ore, the loss to us. during 1952might be up to \ million tons of iron ore.    The effect of this would be toreduce steel production during 1952 from the target figure of 16 million ingot tons (which will in any case be difficult to achieve) by some200,000 ingot tons.3. On the assumption that -(a) no cuts are made in the allocation of steel to the defence programme, and(b) that no cuts are made in respect of domestic consumer goods, or capital investment beyond those which are now beingconsidered,the curtailment of steel production must inevitably result in a reductionOf exports from the engineering industries, possibly of the order of some 50 millions.4. In addition, the cutting down of steel allocations would, bylowering production, have a most serious effect upon general efficiency and costs./   &quot; &apos; D.S.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2,5TH NOVEMBER, 1951.&quot;
