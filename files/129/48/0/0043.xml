- V   171TIMS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT.       Printed for the Cabinet. December 1951CONFIDENTIALC. (51) 4314//i December, 1951-  CABINETTHE BUILDING INDUSTRY AND THE HOUSING programme memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe double effect of financial economies and shortage of steel is likely to havea marked effect upon the building industry.2. This at once presents a danger and offers an opportunity. The postpone-ment of starting dates and the widespread talk of a serious restriction of the buildingindustry will make contractors and workmen uneasy. It would be fatal if fearof unemployment caused a slowing up of work or an unwillingness to recruitapprentices. On the other hand, we have a great chance of pressing forward withthose forms of building which do not require any large quantity of steel, and thusare not in competition with defence and other vital requirements.These are house-building, conversions of houses into flats, house-repairing andgeneral repairing. It is vital to make full use of the craftsmen who may become available.3. After discussion with the Cabinet Building Committee, the Minister ofWorks and I put forward these proposals:  4. I ask authority to build new houses, with the necessary housing services,at the rate of 300,000 houses a year (Great Britain figures). I should hope to reachthis result by stages, viz.:-1952        ......... 230.0001953        ...     ...     ...     ...     260,000; -1954        ...     ...     ... -    ...     300,000If I can do better, I will.5. This would make 800,000 in the first three years of the Government^ life.I have already put these proposals to the Investment Programmes Committee.If this 3-year plan is approved, the Minister of Works can begin to plannecessary materials and fitments on a steadily expanding basis.6. The shortage of steel for building work has caused us to review the arrange-ments for house conversion and building maintenance.The Minister of Works finds that the licensing system in force is inflexible.The value of the work which he may license is now restricted to 80 per cent, of theamount authorised in 1949. Since then costs have risen, and there are seriousarrears. Thus the amount is insufficient to provide conversion into flats and recon-reconditioning of houses to the extent that is desirable.--7; -He-therefore asks for a restoration of the 20 per cent, cut on the 1949figure. This would form a reserve against which licences would only be given wherethere is a surplus of building resources and after consultation with the Departmentsconcerned so as not to impinge upon approved building programmes, including new houses. -8. I have consulted the Secretary of State for Scotland, whoagrees with theseproposals.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, SWA,14//i December, 1951.41580Copy No.28
