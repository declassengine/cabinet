this document&apos; is the property  of  his   britannic  majkstvs -government&quot;&quot;7 - -16Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1951SECRET &apos;      &quot; Copy No,C.(51)4167/i December, 1951 . .   &apos;     .&quot;.28&quot;CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1951-52  session memorandum by the Minister of Health .I attach a draft legislative programme for the present Session prepared by theLegislation Committee. .   ;:The probable number of days available for legislative business in the Houseof Commons is as follows: -(i) From January to Easter 20 days.(ii) From Easter to Whitsun 9 days.(iii) From Whitsun to the summer recess-4 days.   ..This excludes the time likely to be required for the Finance Bill, which may be asubstantial one.Besides the Bills in this programme, time may have to be found for essentiallegislation arising out of the current review of the economic situation. other measures may be required to replace emergency legislation. It must be borne inmind that the Committee stage of practically every Bill will have to be taken in committee of the whole House, owing to the small majority that the Governmenthave in Standing Committees.None of the important Bills (save possibly those relating to the review ofexpenditure) will be ready for introduction at the end of the Recess. The Legis-lation Committee have, therefore, left in the programme a number of relativelyunimportant Bills which will be required in the first two or three weeks after the recess. They have excluded almost everything else which is not.of the first importance and which cannot be ready for introduction in that period. This will go some way to ensure that the passage of the important Bills is not impeded byother legislation. But I must warn my colleagues that there will not be time even for important Bills which are not ready very soon after Parliament reassembles.If they cannot be ready then, we shall have to defer them until we meet after the summer Recess or until the Session of 1952-53. .I ask the Cabinet : (1) To approve the draft legislative programme annexed;(2) To authorise the Legislation Committee to add to the programmelater in the Session any Bills which are urgently required; and todelete any Bills the preparation of which is unduly delayed.H. C.Ministry of Health, S. W. I,6th December, 1951.41542
