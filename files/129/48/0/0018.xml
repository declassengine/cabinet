&apos;ernmentCKIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF MIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1951SECRET Copy No. 28C (51) 18    &apos;. . :;: - &apos; .15r/i November, 1951 \CABINET______MAN-POWERMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service. I attach a memorandum on man-power giving (I) the facts of the present situa-tion, (II) the steps already taken, and (III) the further measures proposed.2. The situation disclosed is a serious one. We are very short of man-power,particularly of skilled workers, and the additional resources available over the next two years are inadequate. If the present shortage of steel is overcome, man-power will become our basic shortage. The steps already taken are not sufficient toprovide the additional labour required for the defence and export programmes andfor essential civilian production. Further measures must therefore be taken.3. Less important production for the home market must be cut down in orderto make available workers required for essential production.4. The main man-power problems are to ensure the best possible distributionof our labour force, to secure its most efficient use and to improve its quality.I propose (1) A Regulation of Engagement Order to ensure that all workers come to theEmployment Exchanges for a jobThis would (a) enable the Exchanges to inform workers of the important vacancies andtry to persuade them to take them;(b) help to prevent workers drifting away to unimportant jobs;&apos;(c) go a long way towards preventing employers taking on workers unneces-sarily; and(d) greatly diminish the poaching of workers by employers.The Order would be enforced through the employer, who would be liable to prose-cution if he engaged a worker otherwise than through an Employment Exchange.There would be no penalties on workers.(2) A revival of the system of Technical Labour Supply InspectorsThis would (a) Expose and help to prevent the extravagant use of labour, particularly of skilled labour; and(b) enable the demands of employers to be examined and prevent labourbeing supplied where it is not really needed.(3) A comprehensive examination by each industry of their arrangements fortraining , -      .This would involve a review by each industry of (a) Apprenticeship and other schemes for training young persons, including theperiod of training and the age limits on starting and finishing training;(b) training arrangements for adults on entering industry;  .(c) training arrangements for adults already in employment, with particular^reference to upgradine training and the training of supervisors.41454   . -;,   * ;. . , b
5. I believe that these measures are essential. It will be necessary for theT.U.C. and the British Employers&apos; Confederation to be consulted on these proposals.I shall hope to obtain their agreement and I ask for authority to open negotiationswith them at once..     &apos; W. M.&apos;. Ministry of Labour and National Service, SWA,. -     &apos;.\5th.November, 1951.MAN-POWERPART I.-THE FACTS OF THE MAN-POWER SITUATIONRecent Changes in employment. There are more people in employment to-day than at any previous date inpeace-time. The total working population is about a million higher than in 1939and is still growing. In the last 12 months it increased by nearly 270,000 (1 percent.). Unemployment is very low and forms no substantial reserve of labour.2.. The most vital sectors of our economy to-day are the basic industries and services (of which coal and rail transport present the most serious man-powerproblem) and manufacturing industry (within which the engineering and aircraftgroups are the most important). The following figures show the man-power move-ments in those industries for the preceding 12 months:  Per cent.Total Manufacturing industry increased by ...      ...      -f 183,000   4- 2.

With,the exception of railway transport (although the position there hasrecently shown some improvement) these figures show a movement in the right direction, but when we turn to look at the present demands and at future prospectsthe problems ar eserious and urgent.The Present Position.. 4. In spite of the increased numbers at work, and of a slight decrease in thedemands of industries producing mainly for consumption, the total of vacancies noti-fied to Employment Exchanges which were outstanding at the end of September was410,500; 51,000 higher than a year ago. Of the total vacancies for adults (290,000),.94,000, or over 32 per cent., were identified as First Preference* an increase of65 per cent, over a year ago. Of these 25,000 were identified as part of the defence programme, a rise of 16,000 since the beginning of the year. In the four weekspreceding 26th September, 1951, it was only possible to place 22,700 adult workersin First Preference vacancies, of which 5,000 were in defence vacancies.5. Of the total of 410,000 vacancies, the number in metal manufacture,engineering and vehicles amounted to 105,000, and in the very important aircraft industry to 8,700.6. One of the most serious shortages is skilled engineering workers. Thenumber of outstanding vacancies in the principal skilled engineering occupations has* First preference vacancies are those identified as being connected with work which is of thehighest national importance, he&apos;., certain named industries and services, e.g., agriculture, cOal-mining, cotton-spinning, iron and steel, electrical generating plant, railway operating services andvacancies on defence or export work. &apos;   _.
increased from 18,000 to 34,000 in the last .12 months. There is practically nounemployment amongst skilled men.. -7. In the railways the outstanding vacancies are for 23,000 workers and in coal-mining for 8,500 workers. The National Coal Board has estimated that a totalof 15,000 more workers are required in the coal-mines by the end of the year, butthere is no hope of providing this number.8. Not all these outstanding vacancies represent net additional demands for labour since many of them are on account of normal turnover and will be filledin a relatively short time from workers leaving other jobs. On the other hand,employers do not notify all their vacancies to the Exchanges and to that extent they are an understatement of the shortage. In particular, the Ministry of Supplyestimate that the aircraft industry at present is about 20,000 workers short of thenumbers which it should have employed had the. planned programme been maintained.Future Demands9. Turning to the future demand, the defence programme requires the. employ-ment of between 400,000 and 500,000 additional workers on defence production inthe manufacturing industries, most of them between mid-1951 and mid-1953.120,000 are required by March 1952 according to production plans, and of theseabout 44,000 are for the aircraft programme and about 7,000 for the Royal OrdnanceFactories. H.M. Forces require in the next two years an increase of some75,000. The export industries in the main require to retain their existing labour force and do not need an increase, except the engineering industry, where the limiting factors on increased export may be both raw materials and man-power. Forthe basic industries and services the demand is smaller in numbers but difficult to fill and of fundamental importance to the whole defence and export programme.The total demand for extra workers may, therefore, be altogether between 500,000and 600,000 for defence, H.M. Forces and essential industries and services.This does not mean that the full number of. workers will be required physically totransfer from one factory to another since a proportion will switch to defence pro-duction inside the works. But in any case the numbers required for the aircraft programme amounting to 85,000 to 90,000 extra workers and those required forthe Royal Ordnance Factories, some 18,000 workers, will have to be suppliedthrough the engagement of additional workers by the firms concerned.Sources of Labour Supply10. On the other side of the balance sheet it is necessary to consider thefollowing possible sources of labour supply:  (a) a reduction in unemployment;(b) any further increase in the total working population; and(c) any movement of labour from other production and services.11. First, the level of unemployment throughout 1951 has been lower than during any year since 1945 and there is practically no reserve of labour there to fill the gap between demand and supply.12. Second, there has been an average increase of 140,000 per year in the totalworking population over the past three years. This consists mainly of personspostponing retirement, pensioners returning to work, and married women who donot normally work, taking employment. It would be unwise to count on a con-tinuing increase in the total working population at the rate of the last two orthree years, and I do not think that we should put the total addition for the periodmid-1951 to mid-1953 above 200,000.13. The third source of labour supply is labour becoming available from less essential production either by a.voluntary transfer of resources to defence, exportor other essential work, or as a result of raw material shortages. I exclude hererelease of labour brought about by deliberate curtailment of activity in order to-release labour. Voluntary movement by individual employers and workers towardsimportant work would increase if the public were given a strong enough lead andsense of urgency.  The work of the Employment Exchanges in influencing the choice41454 -   -   b 2
of workers Who come to the Exchanges in the course of normal turnover would be assisted by such a lead, though it is unlikely to influence their choice unless theconditions of employment of the work also compare reasonably well. It is difficultto assess the size of the contribution which can be expected from this source, since it will be influenced by decisions on many aspects of Government economic andfiscal policy. The shortage of steel in particular will affect the engineering industries,on which 70 per cent, of the rearmament programme falls, and should, therefore,assist the process of transfer of labour to the defence programme.  .^r^,j.The Importance of the Local Problem14. An examination of national figures only is, however, misleading becausedemand and supply vary in intensity in different parts of the country. It is only byexamining the incidence of the defence programme in different areas that a fullappreciation of the nature and magnitude of the labour problems can be obtained.The difficulties created by the inevitable concentration in certain areas are clearlybrought out by detailed examinations which are being undertaken of certain areas where the difficulties of labour supply for the defence programme and other vitalproduction are marked. The main areas so far identified are Coventry, the Preston/Chorjey/Blackburn area; Bristol and Gloucester; Chelmsford; the Potteries.15. These facts emphasise three important points First, that unl^s theadministration of such measures as may be taken to reduce production is flexible,the maximum amount of labour will not be released where it is urgently needed,and too much may be released in areas where the labour might be frittered away,or indeed unemployed. The second point is that even where this is done to themaximum extent compatible with reasonable administration, it will still leaveunsolved the labour supply problems of certain areas of particularly heavy demandwhere defence and export clash. Third, that there will have to be a considerablemovement of labour from one job to another in the process of meeting the demandsof the defence programme. Where this is so there is always a considerable wastageof labour in the process which must be minimised as far as possible.Summary of Part I16.  To summarise, therefore:  (a) there is an additional demand over the next two years of between 500,000and 600,000 workers for defence, H.M. Forces and essential industries and services, and this at a time when the general pressure of demand for labour is very high;(b) towards the end of the period there may be some small decrease in thenumbers unemployed when the re-deployment of labour is complete and some increase in the total working population which may amountto 200,000;&apos; (c) there should also be some transfer of labour from less essential production as raw material shortages or measures to reduce the demand on produc-tion begin to take effect and, if public feeling is aroused, some increasein voluntary movement from less essential employment to defence,export and other essential production;(d) the incidence of the d    uid falls unevenly between different parts of thecountry and thus intensifies the difficulty of ensuring that all theresources of labour available can be concentrated to meet the essential ----.....-demands;(e) no mere arithmetical closing of-the gap will &quot;solve the labour supply. problem.7        ,        PART II.-MEASURES  ALREADY TAKEN-v.-- 17. On.different occasions during the last year, the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil was consulted on the steps which both sides of industry might take to assist in the effective deployment of labour for carrying out the Rearmament Programme.A number of proposals were agreed and have been sent by the Council to its constituent members.  A letter was also sent to certain National Joint Industrial
Councils asking them to give these recommendations careful consideration. Ofthese the most important are-(a) The practicability of some extension of overtime as a means of increasingproduction;.ib) the part-time employment and training of women on semi-skillea processes,;(c) the development of schemes of upgrading and training to offset the scarcity of skilled workers. &apos;In suitable cases, it was further suggested, that the. training which industry could:provide itself might be supplemerted in Government Training Centres (G.T.C.)on the lines which proved successful in the last war.18. The response of industry to these recommendations has been encouraging.In many firms satisfactory schemes of upgrading and training have been introduced and, in accordance with an agreement now reached with the engineering industry at national level, local arrangements are being made for admitting a limited numberof able bodied workers to classes in G.T.C.S. providing, training in some of thescarcity skilled occupations.19. Suitable arrangements have also been made for dealing with labourredundancies when they arise. Employers have been asked to give Local offices of the Ministry timely notice of the number and type of workers that they expectthey will shortly no longer require, and workers who are about to be dischargedhave been encouraged to register with Local Offices before they actually becomeunemployed. These arrangements are designed to assist workers to pass from onejob to another without an intervening period of unemployment.20. As work on the Defence Programme builds up to its peak the scarcity oflabour of the right type is going to be increasingly felt. To meet this problem the steps so far taken, including schemes for upgrading and training, are by themselvesinadequate.  More drastic measures are now required.PART III.-PROPOSED FURTHER MEASURES21. The only effective way of making available the workers required for thedefence and exports programmes and essential civilian production is by cutting down other less important production for the home market. By whatever methodsthis may be done it will be further necessary to ensure that defence and other pro-duction gets the benefit of the workers that are released and that labour is effectivelyand economically used. I shall wish, at the right time, to urge that measures chosenfor reducing less essential production are operated so as to release labour in areas where it is wanted and to avoid throwing them out of work where suitable alter-native employment is not available. But whatever steps are taken to release labour I am convinced that they must be supported by complementary measures on theman-power side to ensure that the labour goes where it is required. The redeploy-ment of labour is not a simple process. By no means all of the workers who may be discharged from their present employment will be suitable for filling vacanciesconnected with defence and other essential production, and they may drift intounimportant jobs. What is wanted is an opportunity to guide all workers becoming available for employment into work with firms genuinely in need of additional labour where their capacities will not be wasted. At the same time, it is necessaryto secure the most efficient use of our existing labour force and to improve itsquality.  &apos;Regulation of Engagement Order22. During and after the war various Restriction and Control of EngagementOrders made it illegal for an employer and a worker to enter upon an engagement,for employment except with the permission of the Ministry of Labour. an employer, therefore, could only obtain his workers and workers could only obtainemployment through an Employment Exchange. While penalties were imposedfor non-compliance, the main sanction behind the Order was the use of the powerof direction. ,   :     &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;    \        :        &apos; .    -23. The only certain and fully.effective method of ensuring that the labourreleased by cuts in production or otherwise goes where it is wanted would be by
a similar Control of Engagement Order coupled with the power of direction, of individuals. In present circumstances, however, the use of powers of direction is out of the question, but a Regulation of Engagement Order without power of direction, and operated on the following lines, would go some distance towardssolving the problem. &quot;24. The Order would place an obligation upon an employer not to obtainhis workers otherwise than through an Employment Exchange. In practice thiswould compel workers to obtain their jobs through an Exchange because otherwisean employer could not legally engage them. The only penalty would be thatimposed on the employer. Power would be taken in the Order to exclude certain parts of the country, so that, if experience showed that the Order was not necessaryin some areas, these areas could be excluded from its operation. -Agriculture and coal-mining would be excluded, as would registered dock workers, merchant seamen and fishermen. .....^ .25. The main object of the Order would be to make all workers seekingemployment come to the Employment Exchanges. This would enable the Exchangesto inform workers of the important vacancies and try to persuade them to take them. The Exchanges would thus be able to go a long way in preventing employers who are making an extravagant use of their labour from taking on additionalworkers and in ensuring that workers do not drift away into unimportant employ-merit. The Order would also reduce substantially the amount of poaching ofworkers by employers that is at present going on. Experience during the war showed that an Order of this kind was the only effective method of achieving this.26. I would make it clear from the start that there is no intention of compellingworkers to accept employment which they were unwilling to take. On coming to Exchanges to seek employment they would be told plainly what were the most.important jobs suitable for them and urged in the national interest to agree tobe submitted to one or other of them. If a worker could not be persuaded to takeone of the jobs pffeerd to him in defence or export production, he would then be permitted to take the employment for which he asked (except in the case where we felt a firm was fully manned).27. This method of administering the Order would enable EmploymentExchanges to perform their proper functions and would encourage workers to think of an Exchange as a place where they would be told and given good advice aboutsuitable opportunities for employment while still remaining free to choose their jobs.Labour Supply Inspection28. I am proposing to revive, on a limited scale, a system of labour supplyinspection on the lines of what was done during the war. The duties of thetechnical labour supply inspectors will be to visit selected firms and obtain informa-tion about the ways in which they are using their labour and, if vacancies for particular kinds of workers have been notified to Local Offices, to ascertain howfar these additional workers are really needed and the extent to which the require-ments could be met by the firm from its own resources. They will examine whetherskilled labour is being extravagantly used or engaged on unimportant work andwhether under-empioyment exists. Employers might then be invited to considerthe recommendations made by the Inspectors and to take appropriate action tocarry them out. : ..29. A system of Labour Supply Inspection will enable the Ministry of labour to decline to supply labour where it is not really needed. It will not, however, of itself, ensure that employers discharge the workers they do not require. If an employer is unco-operative, it will be necessary to bring pressure to bear upon him and I have no doubt that an effective instrument for this purpose would be to cutdown his supplies of raw material.Training ,30. Many apprenticeship and other training schemes for young persons areout of date. With modern intensive methods of training the period of apprentice-ship could in many cases be reduced. Also, at present only young persons under 21
771can be apprentices; this again is out of date and, as in the United States, adultsshould be admitted to apprenticeship schemes without an upper age limit.31. Training arrangements for adults entering industry, are. frequentlyinadequate and need to be reviewed by each industry.32. If industries are to improve the quality of their existing labour force, theymust modernise their arrangements for training adults already in employment, par-ticularly the training of supervisors and the schemes for upgrading training. recent developments make it necessary that, in addition to examining their training in production methods and processes, industries should review their training in suchsubjects as industrial relations, works study, works information and communications.33. I propose to ask each important industry to undertake a comprehensiveexamination of their arrangements for training with a view to improving thequality of their labour.
