CABINET    &apos;      .        v &quot;     ,    &quot;ASSOCIATION&apos;OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITY. Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs in the communique issued&apos;at the close of the .talks which the PrimeMinister and I had with members of the French Government in Paris on the17th and 10th December, it was stated that&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will associate themselves as closely as possible with the European Defence Community in all stages of. its political and military development.The United Kingdom forces under the direction of&apos;the supreme allied Commander in Europe will be linked with those of theEuropean Defence Community for training, supply and operations by land, sea and air. &quot;2. The French, German, Italian and three Benelux Foreign ministers are meeting in &quot;Paris from the 27th December onwards in an. attempt to resolve their differences about the European Defence Community.   assuming that they succeed and that an agreement is in sight, it will be desirable for usto define in more detail the form of our association, v/ith the European defence community.   The suggestions set out in the Annex to this payer have beenagreed between the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff.   The next step would be to put these suggestions to the French Government and to say that,if agreeable to them and the other Governments participating in the paris conference, His majesty&apos;s Government would be disposed to formulate these suggestions in a declaration which might at a suitable moment be made public.The suitable moment would probably be after the signature of the six-Poweragreement and before its submission for ratification to the six nationalParliaments concerned.3. I ask for authority from my colleagues to make an approach on theselines at an appropriate moment to the French Government, if the results ofthe present six-Power meeting in Paris warrant it.. -;:,;.&apos;; -       - A.E.    .    &apos;.    ..

RElATJONS^BETWEEN THE SUROFEAN DEFENCECOMlylUNTTY (B.llfcc.),(ir ESTA3LISHED)&quot;AND THEUNITED KINGDOMKis Majesty&apos;s Government might offer to take the following steps:-1. To associate themselves with any suitable machinery that may be set in order to supervise the general political common interests of the E.D.C.and the United Kingdom in means of European defence;2. To associate themselves with any suitable machinery that may beset up for permanent consultation between the United Kingdom Chiefs ofStaff and the equivalent military authorities on the E.D. C.;3. &apos; To undertake that the United Kingdom forces on the Continent shall,subject only to the requirements of SACSUR, operate as closely as possible with the E,D. C. forces, and shall be tied up with them as far as possiblein matters of training, administration, supply, etc. ;To accept at once individuals, units or formations, of the E.D.C.for training with British formations in Germany and elsewhere and, in addition,to lend British officers and units, where this is administratively possible, toE.D. C, formations.   This might well be easier to develop in the Air Forcethan in the Army;  for example it may well be practicable to integrateEuropean Air&apos; Force Wings into British tactical Air Force groups;  v/we should be ready to examine this possibility;5. To declare that in war SACEUR has authority to allot -Britishformations as be thinks best in the light of the military situation at the time;this authority includes that of placing British formations under command of aE.D.C. Commander if convenient.   To declare further that in peace we wouldmake Britisia formations temporarily available for training with european defence Forces under the overall command of SACEUR;6. To declare that it is the intention of the United Kingdom to maintainarmed forces on the Continent for such time as she deemed necessaryhaving regard to the requirements of the European Defence Community andthe United Kingdom!s special responsibilities in Germany.ANNEX
