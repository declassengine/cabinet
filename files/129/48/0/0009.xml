fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC :; MA.IESTY?Sv. GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.- .C (51) 98th November, 1951CABINETTREATY OF PEACE WITH JAPAN: legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will be aware that the Treaty of Peace signed with Japan at san Francisco on 8th September contains, in addition to obligations laid uponthe Japanese Government, certain provisions requiring action by the Governmentsof the Allied Powers parties to the Treaty.I propose that the legislation thus entailed by the Treaty in the United kingdom should take the same form as that adopted to give effect to the Treaties of Peacewith Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, namely a short enabling Actempowering His Majesty to make such arrangements, establish such offices, make such Orders in Council, and do such things as appear to Him necessary for carryingout the Treaty. The detailed legislation required would then be effected by orders in Council under the Act.I cannot give an exact date by which there will have been deposited thoseratifications by Allied Powers parties to the Treaty which are necessary before theTreaty can come into force. It is desirable, however, that if possible the Bill shouldbe passed through all its stages before the Christmas Recess. It would then bepossible for it to receive the Royal Assent not later than January 1952.I invite my colleagues to take note of this paper.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,8th November,1951.41418
