TmsjOCtJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMFPrinted far the Cabinet.  December 1951 &quot; J.&apos; CONFIDENTIAL------  ^        :&quot;  *       ;   - Copy No.28C.(51)37       &apos; ^ *  ^ -    fSthDecember, 1951       - &apos;\  .   - : ! &apos;      &apos; I-.&apos;     * .&quot;&apos;    *CABINETTHE UNITED STATES LOAN AND THE &quot; WAIVER&quot;Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.. The first payments of interest and amortisation on the United States and canadian Credits of 1946 are due on 31st December, 1951. The amounts involved are:-. . -.  Interest     Amortisation    Total million        million      millionUnited States Credit     ...     26-8    .   .15-8 42-6Lend-Lease Settlement  ...     &quot; 4-3 2 5 6-8Canadian Credit ...      ...       8-0 4-8 12-839 1 23 1 62-22. The amortisation is payable in any circumstances but. under the LoanAgreements, we have a right to the waiver of the interest payments on three con-ditions, which are the same for both the United States and the Canadian Loans.The conditions necessary to secure the waiver in respect of the 1951 payments are:- . &apos;(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government has to state unilaterally that &quot; a waiver isnecessary in view of the present and prospective conditions of inter-national exchange and the level of its gold and foreign exchangereserves &quot; (Section 5 (a)):(b) the International Monetary Fund has to certify that our earnings in 1950were insufficient to purchase the pre-war volume of imports (section(6)); and(c) a complicated and obscure provision designed to secure that the totalreleases in 1951 of the sterling balances accumulated during the war are reduced to a certain proportion of the releases in 1950 (Section6 (hi)).3. We could certainly fulfil the first condition, (a) above. We think we cansatisfy the second condition, (b), although there might be some arguments on the.statistics. On the third condition, about the sterling balances, it is difficult to know where we stand among various possible interpretations; but it seems likely thatany interpretation which the Americans would accept would be so restrictiveas to embarrass us in future years with those holders of balances with whom wehave long-term agreements. Thus, our technical right to claim the waiver is notcompletely sound. Moreover we are admittedly with the tacit consent of the americans in breach of some of our other obligations under the Agreement,namely, those relating to convertibility and non-discrimination. It is clear therefore that we could not confidently claim the waiver as of right if American opinion were hostile on any of these various points. Mr. Snyder confirmed that we should have difficulty in establishing our technical case.We must decide before the end of December whether to claim the waiver ofthis year&apos;s interest payments or not.41532
2 &apos;.... - i.4.  The considerations which would justify our claiming the waiver are:-(a) the very serious worsening of our balance of payments position and the pressing need to husband our rapidly dwindling reserves; and(b) the incongruity of meeting these payments at the same time as we arev     asking much larger sums-in-aid from the United States;5.  On the other hand, the arguments against claiming the waiver are:-(a) non-payment of the interest would have an adverse effect on Congressionaland public opinion in the United States where comparisons would be suggested with the fate of the 1914-18 War Loans;(b) having definitely asked for United States aid, we must do all we can to. secure the maximum amount and most effective method for such aid,. both of which objectives require the utmost possible goodwill and active help from the United States Administration;(c) payment would make for confidence abroad in our determination to seeourselves through our present difficulties, and would be. a suitableprelude to the Prime Ministers visit to Washington.6. My recent discussions with Mr. Snyder in Rome.made it clear that while he did not wish to be put in the position of advising us not to claim the waiver,he hoped that we would pay this next instalment, because he felt, to use his ownwords, that opinion in his country &quot; would like to see us pay our debt beforeasking for further credit.&quot; Mr. Abbott also told me that the Canadian Govern-ment would prefer to see us pay the interest on the Canadian credit this year,whatever we decided about the United States credit.7. I recommend therefore that we should hot claim the waiver on either theUnited States or the Canadian credits, but should pay the interest and the amortisation-sation due by 31st December of this year. (This need not affect our freedom ofaction in future.) If my colleagues agree with this recommendation, I will consult with the Foreign Secretary, and any others concerned, how and when the decision can best be announced.(Signed)        R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th December, 1951.
