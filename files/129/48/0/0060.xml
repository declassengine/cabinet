C.(51) 60   -    &quot;* -        COPY NC.f24TH DECEMBER, 1.951. - &quot;-   - : v. -.   CABINET-A-v     y&apos;   &apos; FOOD IMPORTS IN 1952 &quot;. Memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Minister of food to meet the immediate financial emergency, the Chancellor of theExchequer has had to impose cuts on the imports of food of  170 millions.We recognised and accepted the necessity for this: but we must ask theCabinet to affirm the view that this is an emergency measure and one that must be of as short duration as possible.2. Every effort will be made to provide the maximum quantities of grain and meat and fruit from our own soil.    We are dependent upon othercountries for at least half of our food - and, of course, our trade with thesecountries depends on our importing as well as exporting.3.        .    We do not believe that the country can for long be contented andvigorous on the present and reduced import programme&apos;of food.. There is much that to our way of thinking is wrong with our presentfoodpolicy. % &apos;4. First, our present policy Sets definite limits upon the food we are able to get, which is not as much as the country needs:  we are fixing buyingprices for some products, e. g. meat, butter and cheese, which are belowworld prices, and hoping that we shall be able to get enough to meet ourslender rations mainly from our Dominions in return for long term contracts,5. The result if not good, and in the end does not produce the- goods we need..    We maintain large staffs to carry out a policy of rationing - meanwhilewhen open general licences are granted we find private traders able to buyfoods and to sell at prices which are certainly assisted by our subsidy policy.6. We believe that we must disentangle the present system of Govern-ment buying, taking it stage by stage according.to the conditions of supplyand our capacity to finance a full diet free from Government control.7. The following proposals indicate some of the steps we might take as a beginning:- - - . &apos;.. .-(i)     The Ministry should submit a plan for derationing tea.    Thepresent overall consumption of tea is about 2. l/3 ozs. per person&apos;-&apos;-&apos;/ per week on the average.    We should probably require 3 ozs, ina free market.   - \ &apos; ,.We believe that supplies are available in the sterling area if we areprepared to pay higher prices. \ The present subsidy on tea is  15millions a year - 8^d per lb.     To achieve a free market this wouldhave to go.    We believe that in the short run there would be a^his. document is the-property-of his britannic majesty&apos;s-ggvernment$s e c r e t. -      v&apos;^&apos;:-.,   &apos; &quot;      &apos;..       -   &apos;  - .
considerable rise in prices but that the demand for the better qualityteas would absorb a considerable part of the extra cost and that thelower qualities would not rise in price proportionately.We would have to increase our imports of tea by possibly80 millions to 100 millions lbs. per year, at a cost, includinghigher prices in the short run for present supplies, of about 40 -  50 millions.(ii)    We believe that we could increase our meat supplies by allowing the meat traders to buy meat offals in a free market overseas.Such offal would not be cheap in the early stages of the scheme, but within a year we should find the prices reduced - and maybe from thisstart we could get back to competitive buying for meat supplies other&apos;.   than offal.Such offals would be an additional supply and, of course, unrationed,&apos;.&quot; The Chancellor could fix the figure to be made available for this- purpose.    We cannot get more meat without paying for it.We have reason to suppose that some of the countries that have- favoured Government selling organisations for meat, would welcome-this halfway step towards a free market.(iii)      The present system of sugar rationing with special organisation for giving bonuses is expensive and irritating, both to the public andto the Government.    There is probably enough sugar in the world forus to. give up rationing, if v/e were allowed to import what we need:initially something like 850,000 tons would be needed from dollar sources, at a cost of some  36 millions.    Not only could we dispense with sugar rationing but also with sweet rationing.    All sugar confectionery-stationery should be free from both price control and rationing and\   farced to find the proper economic price: that doubtless would reducethe demand.The abandonment of rationing for tea, sugar and confectionerywould save labour centrally and locally,(iv)    We want to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the position regardingfeeding stuffs.    These are generally in short supply.    Before the warmerchants used to import about 8 million tons a year;  this was at a.  .   time when we could buy from other countries all the meat arid eggs and poultry we wanted.    Now when we are very short of these things we. import only 3f million tons of feeding stuffs as such.  This reduction-&quot;&apos;  it must be noted occurs when we are unable to buy as much meat and eggs as we need even if we had the currency to pay for them.    TheTreasury fix the amount of the feeding stuffs pool - which includes :home-grown feeding stuffs - at 5-g million tons, and thus make it inevitable that our home production of meat and eggs will be less    . .than the maximum our land is capable of producing.We can considerably improve on our present pig production .andwe can add to our supplies _of.pou.ltry._and eggs if we can buy morefeeding stuffs.We&quot; could get some extra quantities of feeding stuffs both from. :   dollar sources, if we had the currency, and from non-dollar sourcesat high prices - the available quantities over the next twelve monthsare estimated at about 500,000 tons.

Concurrently we are making every effort to grow more feedingstuffs at home,. -.(v)    The Ministry should work out plans in consultation with the. : Agricultural Departments for derationing eggs and cheese,8,      We do not ignore the difficulties, particularly in the short run, in thefield of prices, wages, subsidies, both to consumers and home producers,and purchasing power.    But we submit these views to our colleagues asan indication of our approach to the problems of food ,supply and with a plea &apos;for some financial latitude to enable us to buy more food, to&apos; release thepeople from some of the present controls and to fulfiL our Election promisesregarding food policy, &apos;. .-&apos;&apos; &apos; W.LL.G.24TH DECEMBER, 1951
