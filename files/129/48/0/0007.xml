THE kings SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT6th November, 1951My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:It is a matter of sincere regret to Me that I cannot address you in person onthis Opening of a new Parliament. I have been sustained and strengthened throughMy illness by the prayers and the sympathy of all My peoples.It has given Me great satisfaction that The Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by her husband, has been able to undertake her projected journey to Canada and the ,United States of America, and I have been deeply moved by the warmth of the reception accorded both to her and to the Duke of Edinburgh.The Queen and Tare deeply touched by the sympathy and understanding shown by My peoples in Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon on learning that We had, forthe second time, been prevented by My illness from carrying out Our plan to visitthem. Happily My elder daughter and her husband will make this journey in Ourstead; and they ardently look forward to their visit to these and other Common-wealth countries through which they will pass in the course of their journey.My Ministers will ever be anxious to maintain the intimate and precious ties of friendship and understanding which exist between all the peoples of the Commrm-.wealth and Empire.My Government will make it their first duty to ensure our national safety and,in concert with the other members of the Commonwealth, the United States ofAmerica and our European partners, will share in a supreme effort to build a moretranquil and prosperous world. They will take the necessary measures to strengthen our defences both in trained men and in equipment, to re-establish the Home Guardand to develop Civil Defence.My Government will faithfully support the United Nations as the Worldinstrument for peace and security. They will continue to play their part in Koreawith the.aim of restoring peace and well-being.My Ministers will try to repair the injuries our rights and interests have suffered in Persia.My Government regard the abrogation by the Egyptian Government of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936 and the Sudan Condominium Agree-ments of 1899 as illegal and without validity. They are resolved, in conjunctionwith the Governments of the United States, France and Turkey, to press forward with their proposals for joint defence arrangements in the Middle East. In themeantime they will maintain their position in the Canal Zone under the terms ofthe 1936 Treaty and will safeguard the international highway. Nothing can beallowed to interfere with the rights of the Sudanese to decide for themselves thefuture status of their country.The text of the Japanese Peace Treaty signed at San Francisco on the 8th ofSeptember will be presented to you before ratification. Legislation will beintroduced to give effect to certain provisions of the Treaty.My Government will introduce legislation to regulate the position of commonwealth and foreign armed forces who are stationed in this country.Members of the House of Commons :The estimates for the public services will be laid before you.My Lords and Members of the Housejqf Commons:First steps will be taken to fulfil the plans of My Ministers for the manage-ment of Scottish affairs.I have approved new arrangements to bring added strength to the counsels ofMy Government upon the special problems and interests of Wales.
My Government view with grave concern the economic situation of the UnitedKingdom about which a full disclosure must be made to the naltiym. The recentdeterioration in the balance of payments causes increasing anxiety and must beurgently remedied in order to restore the fullest confidence in. the purchasing power,of the pound, so that we may continue to be able to obtain from overseas thesupplies necessary to maintain employment, and an increasingly high level ofproduction. The measures fa this end must include drastic action to reduce the growing inflation in our economy, which threatens the maintenance of our defence programme and which, if unchecked, must cause a continuing rise in the cOst ofliving. My Government regard this problem as overshadowing all other domesticmatters. They are giving it urgent examination and wijf announce their conclusions and make proposals to Parliament in the immediate future. They will make a. searching.enquiry into Government expenditure with a view to reducing it wherever possible. While pressing on With domestic remedies they will also invite the otherGovernments of the Commonwealth to confer together on action which should betaken in concert to remedy the adverse balance of payments.My Government will seek to promote flexibility in those industries which havebeen brought under public management and to stimulate free enterprise by givingit a fuller share in our economic activity. They will be mindful of the greatdemands on our productive capacity, and will consider all methods for creatingthat spirit of partnership between management and workers on which industrialharmony and a higher level of productivity must depend.My Government view with concern the serious shortage of labour, particularly of skilled labour, which has handicapped production in a number of essential industries. They will review, in consultation with representatives of those con-cerned, the possibilities of making available more labour for those industries and of ensuring the best use of the existing labour force.A Bill will be placed before you to annul the Iron and Steel Act with a viewto the reorganisation of the industry under free enterprise but with an adequatemeasure of public supervision. .Proposals will be made to facilitate the extension of private road haulageactivities.A measure will be laid before you for strengthening and widening the activitiesof the Monopolies Commission.You will be&quot; asked to authorise for a period the continuation in force ofcertain emergency enactments and defence regulations which are due to expirenext month. My Ministers will, however, review the whole subject with the aim of reducing the number of these controls and regulations and, wherever possible,embodying those which must be kept in legislation requiring annual renewal byParliament.My Government will do their utmost to stimulate the building of new houses for My people, using to the fullest extent both public and private enterprise. their housing policy will have regard to the desire of many people to own their homes and to the special needs of the elderly.In their policy towards the social services My Government will pursue the aim off ensuring efficiency and providing value for money spent..  My Ministers will vigorously encourage production of food by the basic industries of agi.culture, horticulture and fisheries.Further progress will be made with the consolidation of the statute law.Other measures will be laid before you in due course.I pray that the blessing of Almighty.
