(a) the custody of -(b) the exercise of clemency towards and(c) the extradition ofwar criminals is a matter which must form part of the contractual settlement with Germany.    The three Western Governments have therefore to decide what instructions are to be sent to Bonn as the basis of negotiations with theGerman Government. .2, The war criminals concerned are those held in the three western zones and do hot include for this purpose those sentenced by the International-Military.Tribunal at Nuremberg and now confined under quadripartite control in 3erlin. .........-3. The present figure of war criminals in the three Western Zones are british. 192&apos; (of whom 26 are serving sentences of 21 years and 19 sentences of 20 years), United States \.80, French 196.Recommendations -I recommend that:-(i)     The German Federal Government should accept responsibility for the custody of the war criminals.    It would appoint a representative to an advisory Clemency Tribunal.    It is suggested that the other two members should be a neutral and an allied representative appointed by the Governmentresponsible for the trial of the criminal whose case the Board was consider-ing.    This tribunal would decide all questions of clemency concerning all war criminals imprisoned in the Federal Republic.    It would be authorised to take into account all relevant circumstances  bearing upon the justice of the sentences particularly for the purpose of introducing the greatest possible measure of uniformity.    It would not, however, be competent to question thecorrectness of thejejonviciion. .   The Federal Government would undertakeresponsibility for seeing that the criminals served the sentences in accordancewith the decisions of the Tribunal.   -&apos;*&apos;.&apos;.*(ii) .  If, however, contrary to present indications this solution provedunacceptable, a proposal could be made for the continued detention of war criminals under the control of an international body, which would be responsibility-ible for clemency.    As regards custody, the responsibilities of the inter-national body would be worked out in negotiation with the Germans,    Thiswould raise greater practical difficulties than solution (i).
Ill(iii) The present clemency review of the sentences passed on the war criminals in the British Zone should in either case continue as hitherto,pending the conclusion of an agreement with the Federal Government.(iv)    The extradition of war criminals should be brought to an end assoon as possible,5,      0 As regards 1(a) and (b) (Custody and Clemency) the possible coursesare set out below:-(i)    the continued detention of war criminals in the Federal Republicunder Allied control.    This was the solution advocated byMr,Morrison in a short discussion with Mr. Acheson andM, E-chutnan at Washington in September last, when he suggestedreconsideration after an interval of 3 years.3ut it is highly unlikely that the Germans would accept it and itwould be difficult as well as impolitic for us to try to enforce it,more especially as the Federal Chancellor has been assured thatsupreme authority will only be retained in certain fields which donot include the position of war criminals.(ii)     The removal of war criminals from Germany.    The obvious advan-tages are (a) certainty that the sentences will be duly served and(b) the removal from the Federal Government of a source of weak-ness and internal controversy on a highly contentious topic.But there would be an immediate and very inopportune outcry inGermany just at a time when the whole contractual settlement came up for Parliamentary approval.    This would be based on our patent&apos;      intention to disregard German public opinion on the subject.    Itwould also be necessary to introduce legislation here (and in theUni&apos;:ed States and France).    This might well engender considerableheat in Parliament and would certainly come up against practicaldifficulties.    (N.3.    This solution was discussed and rejected inthe case of Italian war criminals.)(iii)     The continued detention of war criminals in the German federal republic but under the control of an international body set up forthe purpose.    This proposal might be more acceptable to Germanopinion than (i) or (ii) and it is possible that neutral Governments:  would be willing to co-operate by nominating individuals to the controlling body, which would be responsible both for custody andfor clemency.    Even without governmental co-operation, suitableindividuals might be found.But the plan might be badly received in Germany and it is not certainthat neutral Governments or suitable individuals would agree to. share in so unattractive a responsibility.(iv) The adoption of the same procedure as is contained in Article 11 of theTreaty of Peace with Japan, whereby Japan agreed to accept thejudgments-and carry out the sentences, power to exercise clemencybeing retained by the Government or Governments which imposedtheoriginal sentence in each case, the power only to be exercised on therecommendation of the Japanese^Governmsnt.&apos;   But the Germans are in a much stronger bargaining position than theJapanese because we are (a)   demanding a German military contri-bution to Western defence and (b) expecting them to continue to
cover the costs of Allied forces in Germany.    Therefore the viewsof German ex-Service Associations have to be taken into account by any German Government,    It is certain that the Federal Govern-mont would insist upon more favourable terms as essential if it: were successfully to carry out its responsibility for continuedcustody.(v)    The adoption of some procedure similar to but more conciliatoryand ^ace-saving1 than (iv), whereby the Germans would retainresponsibility for custody but would be invited to participate in theexercise of clemency.    The proposal is that an Advisory Clemency.   Tribunal should be established with neutral, German and Alliedrepresentation, this last to be appointed by the Government responsibility-ible for the original trial of the criminal whose case was underconsideration by the Tribunal.The legal position would be that the power of clemency would residede jure in the German Government but de facto in the AdvisoryTribunal.    It would be necessary to obtain the German Govern-departments undertaking to keep the criminals in safe custody untilthe.   end of their sentence, subject to the recommendations of theTribunal, which the German Government must agree to implement.6. Informal discussions indicate that the Federal Chancellor would be disposed to accept this solution ((v)) on the assumption tnat the neutral memberwould have the casting vote..    Such a solution should (i) satisfy German publicopinion that the criminals still in prison should stay there and so enable theGerman Government to keep them there;  (ii) relieve me of any presentresponsibility as Foreign Secretary for clemency recommendations and soremove the question from internal controversy here.    3ut certain sections of3ritish public opinion might criticise an arrangement under w ich the lasty/ord rested with a neutral, however impartial.    If exception were taken to anyparticular decision of the Tribunal, which would presumably follow the proce-dure of a majority vote, criticism would be likely to focus upon the neutralmember rather than upon the British member, who would be assumed to have formed the minority..7. I am advised that His Majesty&apos;s Government have the power to handover to the German Federal Government the responsibility for the custody ofGerman war criminals by virtue of the Royal Prerogative in the realm of. Foreign Affairs.,   The Italian and Japanese Peace Treaties provide ore-cedents.    The power of clemency must legally vest in the German Federal. Government since that Government would have the custody.8.. There remains (c) Extradition.    Under its Basic Law, the federal government may not grant extradition of German nationals.    Such extra-dition has therefore bee   effected by the Occupying Powers themselves.Under the contractual settlement^i^^he^ederal^Republicj^e extraditionof war criminals must cease.A.E.Foreign Office, S.V/.1,: 18TH DECEMBER, 1951.
