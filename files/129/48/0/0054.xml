Alf13TI-I DECEMBER, 1951    ;CA3INETGERMAN WAR CRIMINALS:&apos;.-  POSSIBLE RELEASES BEFORE CHRISTMAS&apos;Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in C.(51) 36 of 3rd December I recommended that &quot;the period of pre-Trial custody should now be reckoned as counting towards the sentenceimposed in each case at the trial&quot;.    This proposal was accepted.by theCabinet (C.C,(51) 15th Conclusions, Minute 5) subject to verification thatpre-trial custody had already been taken into account in assessing sentence.2. There are three ways in which pre-trial custody may be consideredby a Court or on a subsequent review!(i)   &apos; it may be &quot;borne in mind&quot;, i. e. the Court may be informed ofthe period of custody but may decide to disregard it;&quot;&apos;(ii)&quot;&quot;:&apos;Tt may be &quot;taken into account&quot;, i.e. the Court may give somecredit for it in fixing the sentence;(iii)     it may be &quot;reckoned towards sentence&quot;, i. e. set off in itsentirety against the sentence which would otherwise havebeen passed. . ...3. I now find that at least in some cases War Office Military Courtsdid in fact &quot;bear in mind&quot; the period of pre-trial custody.    There is,however, normally no record on the proceedings to show whether it was &quot;takeninto account&quot; and, if so, to what extent.    It would be so difficult as to beimpossible at this stage to ascertain what happened in each particular case,but it is safe to say that there must have been many cases where pre-trialcustody was either &quot;borne in mind&quot; or &quot;taken into account&quot;, but NOT&quot;reckoned as counting towards sentence&quot;.4. I therefore now propose to &quot;reckon as counting towards sentence&quot;   .in all cases a period v/hich, I am informed, can be accurately fixed in eachcase, equivalent to the period of pre-trial custody.5. Iam informed that some 40 war criminals will thus qualify for release.;:. - &apos;.     ;&apos;. &quot;        /&apos; &quot;di       -  If the principle which the Cabinet has approved is right and at thesame time it is impossible in practice to except from its operation cases towhich it may have already been applied, I consider that it must be made amatter of general application even at the cost of extending a double benefitto a fortunate few. : s -- &apos; &quot;   ..  - &apos;     .
