fillS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS   GOVERNMESECRET CopyjNp.C (51) 56 ^   &apos; &apos;20th December, 1951 -----28CABINETINTERIM REPORT OF THE STEEL committee memorandum by the Minister of health the Steel Committee submit to the Cabinet this interim report on the progress which they have made in preparing the plan for the return of the iron and steelindustry to private enterprise.2. The Minister of Supply has discussed the problem with representatives ofthe British Iron and Sfeel Federation and believes that proposals on the lines hereset out would be acceptable to them. The Minister is also consulting the T.U.C.,the Iron and Steel Corporation, the Iron and Steel Consumers&apos; Council and theJoint Iron Council on various specific issues, but discussion with them has not yetbeen completed.3. The Bank of England are now engaged on a detailed study of the problems involved in marketing the securities and a report from the Governor of the Bankis expected in the near future. The Federation are confident that the majority ofthe securities can be sold to private enterprise without loss; we think, however,that the difficulties of this, though we have not yet examined them fully, are likelyto be greater than the Federation expect.4.  In the meantime, the Committee consider that the following provisions should be included in an Iron and Steel Bill on which drafting has begun.Realisation5. The Iron and Steel Corporation should be abolished, ownership of the steel companies having been transferred as soon as possible -fMiais&amp;T-ei-Supply) ^to a Realisation and Management Agency. It should be possible to set up the agency in about a month after the passage of the. Bill. This Agency would as rapidly as possible dispose of the ownership of the companies, acting as a holding company until it had done so.Supervision of the industry. A Statutory Board should be set up to supervise the iron and steel industryin its widest sense, covering not only that part which is now nationalised, but allthe main activities of the industry. The Board should include, in addition to independent members, representatives of the Iron and Steel Federation, of thetrade unions and of consumers. It would have the duty of promoting the efficient and economical supply of iron and steel in quantities and qualities and at pricesbest calculated to serve the public interest..7. The Board should be empowered to lay down maximum permitted prices to be observed by steel producers. All steel-producing companies should be placed by statute under a contractual obligation towards the Board to observe thesemaxima, the obligation being enforceable by civil proceedings taken by the Board-    41618 &quot;.   - -
8. In addition the Minister of Supply should have an overriding right, afterconsultation with the Board, to vary by Statutory Order, subject to affirmative ornegative resolution procedure in Parliament, the prices fixed by the Board. Itwould be prudent for tactical reasons to give this power to the Minister permanently,;though we do not expect that in normal times, when there is a reasonable balance between supply and demand, it would be much used. The widely representativenature of the Board, including as it would users of steel, should normally provide an adequate safeguard against excessive prices. The prices fixed by the board would thus be subject as a.rule to Parliamentary review only to the extent that theMinister could be asked at any time why he had not exercised his powers of intervention..9. These normal arrangements for steel prices to be supervised primarily bythe Board, but with Ministerial powers held in reserve to prevent excessive profitsbeing made either generally or in particular sections of the industry, would not in themselves suffice for conditions of shortage such as those at present existing, sincecontrol by the Board would affect only prices charged by the steel-producingcompanies and would not govern prices charged by other dealers or prevent thedevelopment of a black market. We therefore contemplate that during any periodof shortage of steel (as at present) the Minister would make full use of his reserve powers to fix by Statutory Order prices which would take the place of prices fixed by the Board. The use of these.Ministerial powers would supersede the present statutory control exercised under the Supplies and Services Act. Prices fixed by statutory Order would, of course, be applicable not only to the producingcompanies but to all sellers of steel; and breach of them, whether by the companiesor by anyone else, would be a criminal offence.Development and Expansion10. In order that the Board may supervise the development of the industry,the Bill should provide for prior consultation with them before any major schemesof capital investment by way of extensions or modernisation are put in hand. Butthe real problem is that of ensuring that schemes of development or modernisationwhich are desirable are in fact carried out. We have considered the possibility of seeking to enforce the carrying out of such schemes by the companies wherever they were regarded by the Board or by an arbitrator as commercially reasonable;but we have come to the conclusion that no practicable method can be devised toenforce compliance by the companies with directions given by the Board to carryout such schemes.11. We suggest, therefore, that the Board should be given power to recommend to the industry as a whole or to individual companies such schemes of modernisationor. development as they may consider desirable for the promotion of their objectsin the efficient and economical supply of iron and steel. The Bill should provide that in the event of a company or companies declining unreasonably to co-operate with the Board in the execution of proposals designed to improve the efficiency of the industry, the Board might report the matter to the Minister recommendingsuch action by him as they might think appropriate. It would then be for theGovernment to decide whether, by legislative action or otherwise, to adopt those recommendations.12. Provision should also be made for the Minister, either on the recom-mendation of the Board or of his own motion, to arrange for the execution at public expense (wholly or in part) of schemes of development desired by him inthe national interest (e.g. for defence or social reasons) but which no company was willing to undertake on its own account without assistance. Such schemesmight be on the site of an existing company, in which case that company would carry out and manage the extension; if they were on a new site a suitable existingcompany might be employed to erect and manage the new works or a new publicly owned company might be created for the purpose. In order to protect public funds from unreasonable demands in cases where existing companies were assisted orremunerated from them, provision should be made for the determination by anarbitrator of fair and reasonable terms of assistance or remuneration in theparticular circumstances of each case.
-   23ftCommon Services13. The Board should be empowered (i) to promote research, training and education;(ii) if it considered the common services provided by the industry in suchmatters as the procurement of raw materials and of imported steel to be inadequate, itself to intervene and arrange for improved services tobe provided;(iii) to raise a levy on theindustry to meet its expenses arising out of (i) or (ii)or otherwise. \ ,H.
