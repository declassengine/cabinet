Present production of most of them is at an &quot;all-timehigh,&quot; partly as the result of the efforts devoted to Colonial development during and since the war, partly under the stimulus of the need to earn or save dollars andpartly as a natural response.to rising prices. Nevertheless, it is possible that supplies to the United Kingdom of a few such materials can be increased even inthe short term. Paragraph 6 of this paper gives a list of these materials and moreextended notes on them are contained in Appendix II. There are also some other materials of which the supply could be increased in the longer term. these commodities are listed in paragraph 7 of this paper, and more extended notes ohthem are contained in Appendix III. The remaining products of the colonial empire fall into one of two classes. Either they are already produced in greaterquantities than the United Kingdom requires, or the prospect of increasing suppliesof them is remote. All the more important commodities in the first of these two classes and a selection of those contained in the second class (in principle thosecommodities of which we should particularly like to get Colonial supplies) are: listed in paragraph 8, notes on them being contained in Appendix IV.2. These lists are, of course, based on our present knowledge,&apos; there is always the possibility of new mineral deposits being discovered or new crops being established, but neither of these processes could lead to very early results.3. I have also deliberately excluded from this paper any mention of the needfor increasing the production of Colonial products for purposes other thanincreasing the supply to this country, for example increasing the dollar earnings of the sterling area.4. I have touched only lightly on the possibility of diverting to this countrysupplies which now go elsewhere. The possibility of action of this kind has beenpursued very vigorously during the last few years. The bulk of the Colonialmaterials in which this country is deficient now comes here. The remainder mostlygoes to countries where it earns dollars for the sterling area or to countries, mostlyin Western Europe, where it earns us good will. Some diversion from thesedestinations might in some cases be possible, if it were thought to be on balancedesirable, and if consumers here were prepared to pay the Colonial suppliers asgood a price as their foreign customers, but it is not likely to affect any large volumeof goods. . -5. Before I set out the three lists to which I have referred above, I should like to call attention to what can, perhaps, best be called the conditions precedentto the expansion in the supply of such goods to this country. -(a) First, in some cases, particularly in the expansion of the production ofagricultural products, it will be necessary to maintain and even expandthe technical and advisory services of the Governments concerned.Peasant production plays a large part in Colonial agriculture and if, forexample, the African farmer is to produce more cotton, he must be41428 &apos; n
1  &apos; &apos; 2 ;/.;-given better planting material and advice on how to use it. This is partof the ordinary functions of the Colonial Office and Colonial Govern-ments, and I need say no more about it.(b) Second, Colonial Governments must be able to obtain the necessary.   materials (steel, cement, &amp;c), and capital equipment to make the improvements and expansions to roads, railways, harbours, powerinstallations, and so on, which are necessary to enable the increasedvolume of goods to be handled. I shall present to my colleagues aseparate paper in which I will dear with this subject and the cognatesubjects mentioned in sub-paragraphs id) and (/) below, against the background of the balance of payments position of the Colonies, whichare in substantial surplus both overall and on dollar account.(c) Third, as a corollary to this, the Governments and public authorities con-cerned must be given access to the money market to the extent thatthis is necessary, to supplement their own resources, and thus enablethem to finance these purchases. I would hope to be able to settle withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer any points which arise under this heading.id) Fourth, to the extent that expanded production is dependent on privateenterprise, the individuals and corporations concerned (mining com-panies, plantation companies, and the like) must be given facilities to procure the machinery and other capital goods which they need to enlarge their undertakings.. (e) Fifth, as a corollary to this, some changes may be required in our fiscalsystem to encourage the investment of new money in the Colonies.This is obviously a subject which I shall in the first instance have todiscuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.if) Sixth, the producer cannot be expected to increase his efforts if at the endof it all he cannot use the fruit of his labours to buy more of what heneeds. It will be necessary, therefore, to ensure that his wants are care-fully studied by exporters and that, if the desired goods are scarce,adequate quantities are made available to him.6. The following is a list of the commodities of which there is some prospectof increasing the supply to this country in the short term (Appendix II):  Copper.-A substantial increase in supplies from Northern Rhodesia maybe expected in the next year or two if more coal can be obtained from SouthernRhodesia.Cotton. There are fairly large possibilities of increasing supplies from east and (to a less extent) West Africa.Manganese. Some modest increase in production in the Gold Coast canbe hoped for and some existing exports could be diverted to this country if itsquality demands were less exacting.Petroleum. Production is still increasing in Borneo and Sarawak and thereafe some possibilities of developing new sources of production, particularlyin Nigeria.Pyrites. There are possibilities of some modest expansion in Cyprus andsome additional supplies will shortly be obtained by diversion from othercountries.Sugar. The output of sugar in the Colonies is steadily rising and the endis not yet in sight.Timber.-The possibility of bringing larger quantities of Colonial timbersto this country depends chiefly on persuading the users to accept Colonial hard-woods in place of the European and North American softwoods to which they-are accustomed, and on expanding transport and saw-milling facilities in WestAfrica.: Vegetable Oils and Oilseeds. A considerable increase in production is. still possible, as a result mainly of improved production techniques, provided-     transport difficulties in Nigeria can be overcome.7. The following, is a list of the commodities of which there is some prospectof increasing the supply to this country in the medium or long term.(Appendix III):-Aluminium. No aluminium is at present produced in the Colonies, but- massive quantities of the raw material, bauxite, exist, and a very large project
for erecting a hydro-electric installation and an aluminium smelter in the gold coast is in an advanced stage of preparation. The smelter could not, however,come into production in less than about eight years.Bananas. Supplies from Jamaica should be back to the pre-hurricanelevel within about a year. For further increases in supplies we shall have to lookrather to other British Caribbean territories and the British Trust Territory ofthe Cameroons.Hides and Skins-These commodities are by-products and any increasein output is dependent on an increase in livestock populations and outlets for meat and other products. The process is likely to be a fairly slow one.. Iron Ore. Increases in the supply to the United Kingdom are dependentprincipally on the development of a known but rather remote mineralised area in Sierra Leone, with considerable consequential capital investment.Jute and Jute Substitutes. These are new crops for the Colonies anddevelopment will inevitably be slow.. Lead and Zinc. Present output of these minerals in the Colonies is relatively small. Other deposits are known or suspected but their develop-ment will be expensive and slow.Pulping Materials. The commodities, normally used for this purpose (softwoods) hardly exist in the Colonies. An increase in supplies to this countryis dependent partly on softwood plantings and partly on proving the utilityof materials hitherto not used for these purposes. The outlook is not verypromising.Tea. There is already some tea production in East and Central africa and Malaya, but any increase in the supply of qualities acceptable to the UnitedKingdom market is dependent upon the production and distribution of suitabledisease-free planting material, a rather slow process.Tobacco-The Colonies already supply nearly all the pipe tobacco smokedin this country and, owing to a change in public taste, the demand for this is going down rather than up. Development of the production of the increasinglypopular cigarette tobacco of acceptable quality is a slow process.Tungsten. Small deposits are known to exist and others may be found,but output hitherto has been small compared to the needs of the UnitedKingdom.  A small but useful increase is to be expected from Uganda.8. The following is a list of the principal commodities of which it is unnecessary, or apparently, impossible, to increase the supply to this country(Appendix IV):-Cereals. On balance the Colonies are importers of rice and wheat andmore or less self-sufficient in coarse grains. Prospects of increasing productionmore quickly than the increase in demand are not good.Coal. The best that the Colonies where coal is mined can hope to do,on the basis of present information, is to meet the needs of themselves and adjacent British territories. Even this is uncertain.Cocoa, Coffee, Rubber, Sisal, Tin, Diamonds. Colonial productionexceeds United Kingdom requirements. This does not, of course, mean thatincrease of &quot;production is not desirable for other purposes, e.g., dollar earning.Nickel, Natural Sulphur. These have never been produced in the Colonies. and known deposits are negligible.Meat. There are considerable prospects of increased production, butcurrent local demands are much in excess of current supplies and rising at sucha pace that it is very doubtful whether an export surplus will ever emerge. .9. To sum up, I see some prospect of an increase in the supply of eight ornine important food-stuffs and raw materials to this country in the relatively short,term, and some prospect of increasing the supply of another eight or nine importantfood-stuffs and raw materials in the medium and long term. I have pointed outthat this increase is dependent in most cases on certain conditions being fulfilledand I ask my colleagues to give me all the help they can in ensuring that they are fulfilled.  &quot;-------------O.

Pyrites.Cotton. Sugar.Manganese. . Timber.Petroleum. Vegetable Oils and Oilseeds.CopperNorthern Rhodesia is the third largest producer of copper, ranking after theUnited States and Chile. Output in Northern Rhodesia amounted to 276,000 tonsin 1950. It is expected to reach 306,000 tons in 1951, of which the United kingdom will get 281.000 tons, the balance going to South Africa and Sweden under long-standing arrangements. If they get adequate supplies of coal the copper companiesestimate that they will be able to produce about 350,000 tons of copper in 1952.Coal supplies are obtained from the Wankie Colliery in Southern Rhodesia andhave hitherto been inadequate. Plans have, however, been made to increase theoutput of the colliery and to improve the transport of coal to the Copper Belt.Considerable expansion of copper production facilities is taking place at theNorthern Rhodesia mines and, provided that coal supplies and transport are adequate, the output of copper should in about three years&apos; time be adequate tomeet all the requirement of the United Kingdom.&apos; Copper concentrates are produced in Cyprus. The output is about 20,000 tonsa year and owing to the lack of reserves it is unlikely that this output will beincreased.The Rio Tinto Company in association with the Frobisher Company ofCanada plans to develop copper deposits at Kilembe in. Western Uganda and tosmelt the concentrates locally. They estimate that production will be about 15,000to 20,000 tons of copper a year; but it will be four or five years before this figure is reached. The construction of - 150 miles of railway to the mine has been commenced.
&apos; Cotton ;/ -   &quot;Colonial cotton production is in the region of 500,000 bales (of 400 lb.) perannum, of which, East Africa accounts for some 400,000 bales and Nigeria for75,000. In these territories there are opportunities for large expansion ofproduction. -Production is limited by erratic rainfall, indifferent soils, pests and diseases,backward agricultural techniques and underdeveloped transportation systems.Trie Governments concerned and the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation arestriving to improve yields and acreage under cotton by introducing improved strains,fertilisers, disinfection of seed and improved peasant cultivation methods. Newareas are being developed by the building of roads and ginneries and the widerdistribution of seed.About half of the. Colonial production comes to the United Kingdom, thebulk of the remainder being sold to India under an arrangement first made duringthe war. An increasing proportion of the production is likely to be absorbed bylocal spinning and weaving industries.ManganeseNext to Russia the Gold Coast is now the world&apos;s largest producer. Exportsof Gold Coast manganese in 1950 amounted to 711,000 tons; production was thenrunning at the rate of 750,000 tons a year. As a result of representations made tothe operating company they agreed to increase production as much as possible. Itis now running at the rate of 850,000 tons a year and they hope to increase it to900,000 tons. There has recently been difficulty in obtaining supplies of coal from Nigeria. Shipments from South Africa, which were suspended, have nowbeen resumed and the coal situation is at present satisfactory. The operatingcompany, although British, is controlled from the United States. Nevertheless, thecompany has hitherto given the United Kingdom a fair share of output and it isexpected that this country will also receive a satisfactory share of any increase in production. There is another small manganese mine in the Gold Coast but in 1950it exported only about 4,000 tons. It has recently been acquired by a new company which hopes to increase production substantially.Deposits of rather low-grade manganese in Malaya were worked by theJapanese companies before the war and the ore was exported to Japan. Thesemines appear to have been practically worked out. When it is possible to resumeprospecting in Malaya other deposits of manganese may be discovered.Manganese is also known to exist in British Guiana, Fiji and the BritishSolomon Islands Protectorate and these deposits are now being examined.PetroleumThe only Colonial production of oil is in Trinidad, Brunei and Sarawak.Production in Brunei has doubled since the war and this territory has now replacedTrinidad as the largest Colonial producer. In 1950 the production was 4 million tons in Brunei, 2  million tons in Trinidad and 60,000 tons in Sarawak.It is doubtful whether there will be any increase in production from landareas in Trinidad; recently licences have been issued for prospecting in the marineareas and there is a possibility of oil being found there. Prospecting is alsocontinuing in Brunei and Sarawak.Considerable prospecting for oil has been carried out in the Colonial territoriesby the Anglo-Iranian and Shell Companies both before and since the war. Sofar the only promising results have been obtained in Nigeria, where drilling wascommenced by these two companies jointly in September. American E.C.A.geologists working in co-operation with Kenya Government geologists have foundan oil structure in the Northern Frontier Province. This has stimulated interestin the oil possibilities of the East African territories and the Shell and Anglo-IranianCompanies have applied for exploration licences in Kenya, Tanganyika and&quot; Zanzibar. The Uganda Government Geological Survey have been drilling for oilnear Lake Albert and it is proposed to invite one of the larger oil companies tocontinue this Work.&apos;The Gulf Oil Corporation of the United States has been given oil prospectingrights in Barbados and British Honduras and is now conducting a survey in these territories. .
PyritesThere is a considerable production in Cyprus of pyrites of an average gradeof 48 per cent, sulphur. Exports from Cyprus in 1950 amounted to 480,000 tons,which was a record. It is unlikely that it will be possible to improve on this figurevery much unless new deposits are discovered. Prospecting is now taking place.The bulk of the Cyprus production goes to traditional markets in Europe, principallyFrance, where there are plants for the extraction of sulphur. The United Kingdomalso takes a small quantity and as the programme of the conversion of sulphurplants in the United Kingdom to burn pyrites proceeds imports of pyrites will beincreased. The Ministry of Materials has arranged with the operating companies in Cyprus for imports of 120,000 tons a year.There are also deposits of pyrites in Kenya and Tanganyika, but the long haulto the coast and the heavy freight on this bulky cargo would make export to theUnited Kingdom uneconomic. It may be possible, when railway communications are developed, to use these deposits for African requirements.SugarColonial exports, which before the war were rather less than 1 million tons ayear, are now in round figures li million tons, of which about 60 per cent, comes from the West Indies, a third from Mauritius and a twelfth from Fiji. The UnitedKingdom Government undertook to purchase the whole of ^he.Commonwealthexports from 1948 to 1952, inclusive. An Agreement, to become fully operativein 1953, was negotiated in principle in 1949-50 between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Commonwealth sugar producers, under which for several years thegreater part of the Commonwealth exports is to be purchased by the UnitedKingdom at negotiated prices, and the Commonwealth production is for the present to be limited, in the expectation Of a new International Sugar Agreement, to2,375,000 tons. It was felt that unless a limit was set to production there wouldbe no chance Of securing an international sugar agreement. The export limitagreed upon was well above the current level of production and much higher thanthe export limit under the 1937 International Sugar Agreement, in the case of theColonies, more than 60 per cent, higher. It was considered that unless there wasroom for a little foreign sugar in the United Kingdom market the countries partici-pating in the Commonwealth Agreement would not be able to enter into negotia-tions for a new International Sugar Agreement. The limit of 2,375,000 tons isthe sum of the United Kingdom&apos;s estimated domestic sugar consumption for1953 (less the production of beet sugar in the United Kingdom and 225,000 tonsreserved for foreign sugar) and Canada&apos;s estimated import of cane sugar. TheColonial export limits under these arrangements total 1,575,000 tons (west indies and British Guiana 900,000; Mauritius 470,000; Fiji 170,000; british honduras 25,000: East Africa 10,000). At the time of the negotiations an inter-national agreement seemed very desirable, since there was a real fear of a worldsurplus of sugar. That fear has not altogether disappeared but it has becomeconsiderably more remote. The Commonwealth as a whole is about half a million tons short of the total Commonwealth export limit, but the main producing areasin the Colonies are expected to reach their limits within a few years, and one ortwo of them, notably Mauritius, are already very near their individual quotas.Discussion on a number of matters affecting the Commonwealth Sugar Agree-ment are about to begin with representatives of all the Commonwealth producers.TimberColonial exports of timber are small in comparison with United Kingdomrequirements (in 1949 Colonialexports were little more than 10 per cent, of UnitedKingdom imports). Colonial output of softwood, which the United Kingdommainly requires, is negligible and will remain so for many years since indigenousCaribbean forests are becoming exhausted and extensive plantings of exotic soft-woods now being made in East Africa will not produce large exports of marketablelumber for twenty or thirty years.Nevertheless the growing exports of Colonial hardwoods and their increasedsubstitution for softwoods in the United Kingdom markets which has been broughtabout by the need to conserve dollars gives ground for confidence that a small but still substantial contribution to the alleviation of the United Kingdom&apos;s -timberdifficulties can be made by the Colonies.
About 50 per cent, of Colonial hardwoods come to the United Kingdom, theremainder being sold for dollars or to nearer and natural economic markets.Increased production especially in West AfrtJa, the main source of United kingdom imports of Colonial hardwood, depends on better transport facilities and increasedSawmill capacity. Attention must also, be paid to quality and grading^From the consumers&apos; point of view, Colonial timbers as.a substitute for dollarsoftwoods suffer from being dearer (increased production should remedy this tosome Extent);, little is known of the qualities of many Varieties, some are hard towork, and others susceptible to insect attack or technically infer?gr in.other respectsfor structural purposes. The research qn Colonial timbers carried out by the ForestProducts Research laboratory has to be accelerated and building methods and speci-fications adapted to the hitherto untried uses of hardwoods.Oil Seeds and Vegetable OilsCurrent exports from the Colonies in terms of oil equivalent are over 750,000tons annually. This compares with an average of 729,000 tons in the five years before the war. That present exports are no higher is due partly to increased use and local processing&apos;for food, partly to the decline in production in the western pacific arising from war damage and shortage of labour, and partly to drought in nigeria which resulted in very poor crops in each of the last two seasons.The main producing areas are West Africa which contributes about 70 percent, of the Colonies&apos; total, Malaya and the Western Pacific, and the bulk of the exportable surplus of these territories, together with coconut oil from Zanzibar andsome oil seeds from East Africa, are purchased by the Ministry of Food, mostly .under long-term contracts. Supplies from the Colonies now represent nearly 55 percent, of the total United Kingdom imports of oil seeds and vegetable oils.There are Marketing Boards in West Africa and in some of the Western Pacificterritories.. In West Africa considerable sums have been accumulated by the Boardsfor purposes of stabilisation, research and the development of the industries.Amongst the steps being taken to increase production and the efficiency of theindustries are, research into pests and diseases; fertiliser trials in Nigeria; the intro-duction of improved types of palm and.varietal trial plantings of groundnuts in all areas; and the increasing use of mechanical aids to cultivation and processing. in nigeria and Sierra Leone the introduction of &quot;Pioneer Oil Mills &quot; in. the principalgrowing areas is resulting in the production of more palm oil of a quality farsuperiorto that produced from an equivalent quantity of fruit by traditional handmethods. These measures should result in substantial increases in production overthe next few years if supplies of consumer goods can be augmented, railway equip-ment delivered to time and labour relations on the railways improved. Lack ofshipping has also been a cause of anxiety recently.APPENDIX IIINotes on Commodities of which Supplies to the United Kingdom canPossibly be Increased in the Medium or Long Term. Aluminium.Bananas.Hides and Skins.Iron Ore.&apos;.. Jute and Jute Substitutes.&apos;,  Lead. &apos;.-..,-./,,.--Aluminium. Bauxite, the raw material aluminium, is worked in British Guiana by a sub-sidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of Canada to supply their plants in West-Africa, and in the Gold Coast by the British Aluminium Company to supply theirplants in the United Kingdom. American and Canadian companies are developingbauxite deposits in Jamaica.Pulping Materials.&apos; Tea.Tobacco.Tungsten.Zinc - -
There are further large deposits of bauxite in the Gold Coast where it wouldbe possible to generate sufficient power from the Volta River to manufacture about200,000 tons of aluminium a year. Production at the rate of about 80,000 tons per year in the first instance would start in about eight years&apos; time. negotiations are proceeding with Aluminium Limited of Montreal and the British AluminiumCompany with regard to the financing of the project, and the question will bereferred to Ministers shortly.In North Borneo there is sufficient water power to generate current for theproduction of about 130,000 tons of aluminium a year. So far, adequate suppliesof bauxite to maintain an aluminium plant of this capacity have not been discoveredin North Borneo or Sarawak, but prospecting work is being continued. There are adequate supplies of bauxite in Malaya and Indonesia. It has, however, beendecided, that, for strategic and other reasons, the Vclta River Scheme in the gold coast is preferable to the North Borneo Scheme.There are also large deposits of bauxite and possibilities of water power in nyasaland and these are being examined by the British Aluminium Company andthe consulting engineers to the local Government.BananasAs the result of disease and a severe hurricane in 1933-34, the production inJamaica, which had before the war been the world&apos;s largest exporter, fell offsharply and only began to recover in 1947. In 1949 about 73,000 tons wereexported. The Ministry of Food has a long-term contract to purchase all theColony&apos;s exports if offered. The hurricane of 1951 destroyed the greater part of thebanana crop, but it is expected that production will be restored within the next year.Attempts are being made to establish a large-scale export trade,in a variety ofbanana which is resistant to Panama disease. Exports from the British Cameroonsare about 55,000 tons a year. Post-war exports have all been to the UnitedKingdom, where the Ministry of Food has been the sole purchaser. Attempts arebeing made to restore the banana industry in Dominica and to establish a significantexporting industry in British Honduras.Hides and SkinsColonial exports have in recent years made a considerable contribution to theincreased world demand for hides and skins. The rate of slaughter of native cattle,which is not entirely determined by economic motives, is, however, a limiting factor.In 1950 exports from East Africa were valued at above  4 million and from the somali land Protectorate at about  J million. Exports from Nigeria were worthmore than  6 million, nearly half in respect of untanned goat skins, of whichappreciable quantities are sold to the dollar area.Iron Ore .Iron ore is produced in Sierra Leone, Malaya and Hong Kong.In Sierra Leone the lumpy ore at Marampa will be worked out by 1953. Thereare, however, large deposits of powder ore which has to be concentrated in sierra leone before shipment. It has then to be sintered&quot; before being fed to the blastfurnaces. Until recently sintering capacity in the United Kingdom was limited andthe company developing the Marampa deposit had to seek markets for their powderore elsewhere. They have contracted to supply consumers in the United Statesand Germany, but the former will only take powder ore if they receive a pro-portion of lumpy ore. The company have therefore to divide their diminishingsupplies of lumpy ore with the United States and the United Kingdom. TheUnited Kingdom is now getting about 600,000 tons and the company have promised to&quot; see whether they can increase this figure by 30,000 tons for the current year.Shipment of ore has been made to Germany since the mine was opened and thecompany are loath to break off this long-standing connection. The companycannot ship more than i-J million tons of ore per year owing to railway and portlimitations and this limit has been almost reached.There is another deposit of high-grade iron ore at Tonkolili in Sierra Leoneover which the company operating at Marampa have rights. They are now making plans for the development of this deposit and are in negotiation with british Iron and Steel Corporation (Ores) Limited for a long-term contract. Thecapital investment in this new development would be over  10 million and it will41428 c
be necessary to extend the existing railway line from&quot; Mafampa to Tonkplili, a distance of about 80 miles.Iron ore was worked by Japanese companies in Malaya before the war andexported to Japan. Output reached as much as 2 million tons a year. Work hasbeen resumed and projects are on foot to expand production but financial economicmarket, as also that in Hong Kong, is Japan, and it is doubtful whether it wouldbe economic to import it into the United Kingdom.Large deposits of iron ore in Nigeria were investigated by the Bethlehem steel corporation of the United States a few years ago, but the corporation decidedthat it would not be economic to develop them. There are also deposits ofmagnetite and haematite in Northern Rhodesia, Tanganyika and Uganda; these arebeing investigated with a view to development if possible.Jute and Other Soft FibresJute has not so far been produced in the Colonies, and there is only a limitedproduction of substitute soft fibres. Recently, however, the possibility of estab-lishing an alternative source of jute to India and Pakistan has been examined and colonial Governments have been conducting growing trials while the Colonial office has undertaken research on mechanised harvesting and fibre production. Thereappear to be prospects of successfully growing jute on a commercial scale in british guiana and the establishment of a pilot project is at present under discussion withthe Dundee jute industry. Even if the pilot project should prove successful it wouldtake some years to achieve commercial production and fairly heavy capital invest-ment would be needed, since labour is too scarce in the Colonies to permit peasantproduction as in India and Pakistan, and Colonial production would have to bemechanised Since the same problem of mechanised production arises for substi-tute fibres, work is being mainly concentrated on jute in view of its superiority.-lead lead is being produced at present in Northern Rhodesia, Hong Kong and tanganyka, but the quantities are relatively small.In Northern Rhodesia it is produced as a lead-zinc ore with a preponderance of zinc. Production in 1950 amounted to 13,685 tons. As in the case of zinc, thereis little likelihood of any appreciable increase in output owing to the lack of reserves.There is a small production of lead in Hong Kong. In 1939 it amounted to over ,000 tons of ore but up-to-date figures are not available.A lead mine has been developed at Mpanda in Western Tanganyika and theGovernment have built a railway extension of over 100 miles from the CentralRailway to the mine at a cost of about  1 million. The results of development at the mine have been so far disappointing and the output has been very small. the operating company has been negotiating with the Economic Co-operation Adminis-tration for some time with a view to obtaining a loan for development purposes.The American Smelting and Refining Company in co-operation with theNational Mining Corporation of the United Kingdom are investigating lead-zincdeposits in Nigeria, and they have tentatively agreed with the Nigerian Governmentthe terms of a mining lease. Prospecting is still being carried on and the latest information is that it is doubtful whether this will be as large a proposition as was expected.  See also the reference under zinc.Pulping MaterialsPulping materials are used for paper, fibre boards and for the production ofcellulose for rayon manufacture. They are produced from timber or plants.suchas reed, bamboo, papyrus, sugar cane, &amp;c.wood pulp for paper has hitherto been made exclusively from softwoods.Tropical hardwoods which are shorter fibred are technically inferior and occur inmixed stands and not like pines in homogeneous forests. The French claim to haveovercome the technical difficulties of dealing with mixed stands of hardwood, but have not so far substantiated this claim with details. They are being pressed todivulge this. Research has been carried out in this country by the Colonial ProductsAdvisory Bureau and the Forest Products Research Laboratory, but so far resultshave not been promising. -Careful and detailed enquiries have been made into the use of bamboo, papyrus,&amp;c, for paper pulp, but so far it has not proved possible to put forward an economicproposition.
. Sugar cane waste (bagasse) is usually required as fuel for sugar factories, butin Trinidad, where oil fuel is available, bagasse is manufactured into wallboard.The production of cellulose for rayon from fast-growing tropical softwoodsappears a more promising proposition and it may well be possible to develop sucha project in East Africa.Tea   . \Colonial exports are insignificant in relation to world trade, but efforts arebeing made to expand production in East and Central Africa, which are the mostimportant producing areas. Considerable quantities of East African teas go to north American, while cheaper grades are sold in adjacent African, territories. an institution has been set up for tea research in East Africa. No rapid expansion ofthe industry on a large scale can be expected, since, in addition to the time the croptakes to mature, the problems of improving quantity, of developing adequate supplies of good and disease-free planting material, and of overcoming the shortageof labour must take time.TobaccoNyasaland, the principal Colonial exporter, produces pipe tobacco. production has increased greatly since before the war, but a&quot; recent decline in the United King-dom demand as a result of high duties is likely to result in a fall of production.Northern Rhodesia produces flue-cured cigarette tobacco. Exports haveincreased from 1 million lbs. a few years ago to about 10 million lbs. in 1951, theprincipal markets are the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia.North Borneo has been exporting cigar wrapper leaf to the United Kingdomsince 1949. Total exports in 1950 amounted to  230,000. Cyprus exports somecigarettes and cigarette leaf to the United Kingdom and there is a small butexpanding market for Cyprus latakia in the Unifed States.Taking advantage of the prohibition of imports of Cuban cigars into the UnitedKingdom during and after the war, Jamaica considerably expanded its cigar industry.Exports of cigars to the United Kingdom from Jamaica increased from 250,000 in1939 to nearly 26 million cigars in 1947. This was more than the market couldabsorb and heavy stocks accumulated here; moreover in 1947 and 1948 the UnitedKingdom import duty was greatly increased. As a result there has been a consider-able slump, and exports of Jamaican cigars to the United Kingdom are now running at about 11 million a year. Under the recently concluded Anglo-Cuban trade agreement limited quantities of Cuban cigars to the value of $500,000 per annumare to be admitted to the United Kingdom during 1952 and 1953 and may wellreplace an equivalent number of Jamaican cigars.TungstenThe only Colonial territories in which tungsten ores are produced at presentare Uganda and Malaya. The deposits in these territories appear to be compara-tively small. Output in Uganda is about 130 tons a year and in Malaya between20 and 30 tons. The possibilities of increasing production in Uganda are nowbeing investigated in co-operation with the Ministry of Supply, who have offeredproducers a long-term contract.ZincThe only Colonial production of zinc is in Northern Rhodesia, where it is minedwith lead and vanadium ores. Production has increased from 10,000 tons in 1938to about 23,000 tons a year at present. Any further appreciable increase in production seems unlikely as recent prospecting work has proved disappointing.Most of. the output goes to the Union of South Africa.There are considerable deposits of lead-zinc in Nigeria and agreement hasrecently been reached for the grant of a mining lease of the deposits to a syndicatein which the American Smelting and Refining Company and the National MiningCorporation (a United Kingdom company) are the chief shareholders. Prospectingof the deposits is still continuing and it is not yet possible to say what the resultswill be.41428

The production of these grains for export to the United Kingdom as animal feeding-stuffs has not been thought possible,since (1) the present supplies are used almost entirely for human consumption;(2) further expansion of production could only be at the expense of other crops;(3) investment of capital to increase production would have to be covered by anuncompetitive purchase price, which the potential exports have been consideredtoo small to justify.CoalThere are deposits of low-grade coal in a number of Colonial territories butproduction is confined to Nigeria and Malaya, and it is unlikely that Colonial coalswill ever be competitive in world markets. Their development as sources of localfuel is being examined in Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Sarawak and North Borneo.CocoaThe sterling area is a net exporter of cocoa, which is a very large dollar earner.Last year sales of cocoa to the dollar area were valued at approximatelyU.S. $100 million. The total current exports of the Colonies are about 360,000 tons,of which all except some 10,000 comes from the Gold Coast and Nigeria, wherethe principal limiting factor is swollen shoot disease, new planting having justabout enabled the level of production to be maintained.

the retail price would lead to consumer resistance in the United Kingdom. Someof the United Kingdom purchases are resold for dollars. There are considerablesales of East African coffee on the free market both to the dollar area and Europe.DiamondsDiamonds are produced in Tanganyika, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone andBriliSii Guiana in that order of importance. Supplies of industrial diamonds are more than adequate for the needs of the United Kingdom but the increases in production to be expected from Tanganyika and the Gold Coast- should earnvaluable hard currency.Meat &apos;The Colonial Empire is as a whole deficient in supplies of animal protein.There seems to be no prospect even in the long term of obtaining appreciablesupplies of meat for the United Kingdom except from East and Central Africa.But carcase meat cannot be imported from those territories because of the prevalence of-rinderpest. Canned meat and under certain conditions pig meatcan be imported and these industries are at present being developed on acomparatively small scale in Tanganyika and Kenya.NickelUp to the present no nickel has been produced in Colonial territories. a low grade deposit was discovered in Tanganyika in 1945, but it would probablybe difficult to concentrate the ore. The International Nickel Company is nowprospecting for nickel in Tanganyika over an area of 1,720 square miles.SulphurThere are no appreciable deposits of natural sulphur in the Colonial territories.A deposit in the New Hebrides was recently examined by a mining geologistfrom Australia. His report was disappointing. He said that there was not morethan about 10,000 tons and the working of the deposit would be most difficult.There are other minor occurrences of natural sulphur in the Colonies but it is very doubtful whether it would be possible to work them economically.RubberMalayan rubber and that from other Colonial territories in South-East Asiaare the Colonial Empire&apos;s most important dollar earner, and supplies are far more than adequate to meet the needs of the United Kingdom itself. maintenance and expansion of output depends on restoration of law and order in Malaya andaccelerated replanting particularly of small-holdings with high-yielding trees. Suchreplanting is essential also if natural rubber is to compete with synthetic and stillgive a reasonable return to the producer.Sisal and Hard FibresColonial (East African) production of sisal is far more than adequate to meetthe United Kingdom requirements; large quantities are also exported to europe and to the United States and Japan. Production is expected to increase steadilybut slowly as current new plantings come into production.Tin &apos;       ----- ------    :Malaya and Nigeria together produce about 40 per cent, of world outputwhich is about three times the amount required by the United Kingdom.  In order. to maintain production the first need is an increased measure of law and orderin Malaya so that prospecting&quot; &quot;can be resumed and the much depleted reservesrestored. :
