The paper raises crucial questions which my colleagues will wish to have an early opportunity to consider.2. The position reached in tripartite negotiations described in the annexedmemorandum may be summarised as follows.Summary Statement of problem. We are committed with our Allies to the policy of trying to secure, by negotiation with the German Federal Government, an adequate German military contribution to the European Army for the defence of Western Europe:4. Financial and economic necessities preclude us from accepting any additional burden to our present  4,700 million defence programme. This means in practice not only that we are not prepared to contribute financially to the costof raising a German army, but also that we must continue to insist that our essentialDM, expenditure on defence in Germany is paid for by the Germans.5. The efforts which our representatives have been making to reconcile theseconflicting considerations by obtaining French and United States agreement to abasis of negotiation with the Germans which avoids raising the possibility of a financial gap resulting from German rearmament are foredoomed to failure. AGerman contribution on the scale recommended by SHAPE and accepted by theEuropean Army conference is bound sooner or later to give rise to such a gap.As shown in paragraphs 10-13 of the Annex, the size of the gap might be of theorder of  700 million (DM. 8 thousand million) up to mid-1954.6. Given our critical financial and economic position, there appear in prac-tice to be only three ways in which this gap can be filled: -(i) by the Americans; .   .(ii) by a substantially smaller German military contribution;(iii) by a reduction of our defence effort, either in Germany or elsewhere,in such a way as to relieve our balance of paymentsor by a combination of all three.7.

Information of the type they require will only be forth-coming after the proposed negotiations with the Germans..   41432 . R Copy No.23
9. They could not tackle it at all until their exercise with respect to theN.A.T.O. countries is completed in December. But any substantial delay inbeginning negotiations with the Germans on this crucial issue may prejudice thewhole of our proposed contractual relationship with the Federal Republic.10.. Since we are unlikely to reach early agreement on how the financial gapshould be filled, we should have to begin negotiations with the problem of the gap unresolved between the Allies. This course would have the followingdisadvantages: -(i) Even if we reserve our position vis-a-vis our &quot;Allies about making any increased financial contribution to defence ourselves, we shall almost certainly be led into a situation in which we are involved in some further financial commitment.. ^(ii) It would leave the way open for the Germans to maintain, which they maywell do in any event, that they should pay for their forces and wefor ours.(iii) It would commit us vis-a-vis the Germans to accepting SHAPE&apos;s force. requirements, regardless of their financial consequences.11. Against these disadvantages must be set the risks of not going forward at an early date with the negotiations with the Germans. For the reasons set outin paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 above, it is only by negotiating with the Germans thatwe shall be able to put full pressure on both the Americans and the Germans tomake the maximum financial contribution and so be ,.yi a. ^position to assess the potential magnitude of our own liabilities.Recommendations12. Any recommendations on procedure turn, however, on whether mycolleagues would in the last resort prefer either (i) to reduce our own forces in Germany or economise elsewhere in our defence programme in a manner which would relieve our balance ofpayments; or(ii) to depart from our present policy of declining to accept any additionaldefence burdens or any additional external burdens; or(iii) to see the German military contribution very substantially reduced belowthe figures recommended by SHA PE.13. Each of these courses is clearly open to the gravest objection. Course (i)would mean a major, readjustment and reduction of our own defence effort.Course (ii) appears out of the question, since, on account of the crisis in our balanceof payments, even our present defence programme is endangered. Course (iii)would create serious political difficulties with both the Americans and the Germans,endanger the whole contractual settlement with Germany and put at risk thewhole concept of European defence, to which the German contribution is the key.Moreover, there is no guarantee that the Germans would agree that their resourcesreleased by cutting back the German forces contribution would become availablefor the support of Allied forces.14.  / recommend that (a) if my colleagues share my view that course (iii) would be unacceptable,we should endeavour to secure agreement to proceed to negotiate with the Germans at an early date.  In this event I should propose to.    take the opportunity at the forthcoming meeting of the three Foreign-   Ministers on 21st November to make it clear that our agreement toentering into these negotiations with the problem of the gap unresolvedI does not mean that we shall at any time be prepared to accept anyV additional financial burden;lb) if my colleagues consider the risks in course (iii) above must be taken,we should at once make our position clear to our Allies and toSHAPE and endeavour to secure agreement on a radical scaling down of the JGerman contribution.&apos; - ------    ..

, . - &apos; &apos; ANNEX -.;    GERMAN   FINANCIAL   CONTRIBUTION   TO   DEFENCE&apos;.-   &apos;      Report by Mutual Aid CommitthI? -Historical Background , &apos;.&apos;-.&apos; -At the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom andthe United States, in September 1951&apos;, at which.it was agreed that-the german federal Republic should, make :a contribution to-&apos;Western - Defence within the&apos;framework of the proposed European Defence Community (E.D.C.), it.was decMed -that officials of the three Governments should meet; in order to prepare recom- -mendations on the financial questions raised by-the making of a German denfence contribution, as a-preliminary to negotiations by the High Commission with theGerman Federal Government. It was laid down that the basic assumption of the examination was that it should provide for a use of German resources for defence to an extent comparable to that of other principal Western. countries, including their expenditure outside Europe.2.&quot; A German defence contribution will raise for the German Federal Govern-ment the same sort of financial problems as confront the United Kingdom andthe other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) countries, but there is thespecial circumstances in the German case that, substantial Allied forces are located in Germany. The local costs of these forces have up to date been met, as occupation costs, by Germany and not by the Allied countries themselves, and We and theFrench at least have so far proceeded on the assumption that although the levelof these costs would under a contractual relationship with Germany have to beagreed upon with the Federal Government, they would continue to be so met.The problem, therefore, which faced the Tripartite Group on Germany which hasbeen meeting in London, was to get a German contribution to defence which would cover both its own contribution to the European Defence Community and the localcosts of Allied forces in Germany.3. The instructions given to the United Kingdom Delegation to the TripartiteGroup were based on the decision that our present programme of expenditure on defence is a maximum, and that if a total German financial contribution worked out on the basis referred to above proved to be inadequate to cover both allied and German costs, the United Kingdom could not bear any part of this gap. Inorder to minimise the risk of such a gap arising, it was agreed that we should accept that drastic economies would have to be applied to our own local costs in Germany,and if necessary that those costs which were not truly related to our defence effort should be transferred to our own budget, e.g., we should transfer expenditure not strictly related to defence which arises from the activities of the Embassy as successorto the British element of the High Commission. It was hoped that at any rateduring the initial period of building up German forces the total expenditure which germany could afford to allot to defence would cover both Allied and Germancosts, on the assumption that military equipment would be supplied free fromabroad as end-item aid.Obstacles to Progress4. Progress in the Tripartite Group has been slower than expected, notonly because of the different financial positions of the three Allies which necessarilymeant that the United Kingdom and French Delegations have had to show considerable caution in the approach to a final assessment of what is possible,but also because various activities have been occurring elsewhere which have hada bearing on the discussions and have interfered with the time-table. these were:- ---&apos;-.    - - - -(a) The examination of the political and economic capabilities of the N.AT.O.countries to make the maximum contribution to Western defence,which is being carried out in Paris by the Temporary Council Com-mittee (T.C.C.) of N.AT.O., under the supervision of its tripartiteExecutive Bureau. - ..(b) The Conference on the setting up of a European Defence Community, in Paris, consisting of representatives of France, Italy, Belgium, Luxcm-bourg, Netherlands and Germany.41432   ...&quot;       .  ,   ;-;-&apos;&apos; . B2
:(c) The tripartite consideration in London of the security controls to bei, , maintained on the German armaments industry, which has resulted inHi : the preparation of recommendations to the three Governments whichi would greatly extend the range of military equipment that Germany, .   . is to be allowed to make. -   1v 5. The, first of these, the review of the capabilities of all N.A.T.O. countries,has affected consideration of the German contribution to defence because theExecutive Bureau required to know what forces Germany could contribute and how they and the Allied forces in Germany would be financed in order to fit theseinto the totarpicture which the T.C.C. is required to present to the North atlantic council. Trie Executive Bureau, therefore, asked the Paris Conference on theEuropean Army in collaboration with Supreme Headquarters (S.H.A.P.E.) to pre-pare an estimate of a possible German military force in the period up to 30th June,1954, and asked Supreme Headquarters, in consultation with the T.C.C.&apos;s ownScreening and Costing Staff, to work out the estimated cost by twelve-monthperiods up to that date. Simultaneously, the Executive Bureau asked the TripartiteGroup in London what in its view the total defence expenditure of the german federal Republic should be, on the assumption that it was making the maximum possible defence contribution consistent with its economic and political capabilities,together with the estimated cost of maintaining Allied forces in the federal republic. The Paris Conference on the European Army reached agreement withS.H.A.P.E. that the basis of its conclusions should be the building up of 12 german divisions, an Air Force of 1,158 front-line aircraft and a small naval contingent by30th June, 1954, and S.H.A.P.E., together with the T.C.C. Screening and CostingStaff, worked out the total cost of this force up to the same date. The TripartiteGroup in. London for its part made a calculation of what in its view the maximumfinancial,burden on the German Federal Republic for defence could be in 1952-53and 1953-54, and the expected local cost of Allied forces in Germany in these twoyears, and sent the figures to the Executive Bureau. They had to point out, how-ever, that until there had been tripartite negotiations with the Federal Government,no estimate of Germany&apos;s political and economic capacity to incur expenditure on defence had, any real validity. The figures arrived at are discussed further in para-graph 10 and following paragraphs below.6. The second of the three activities referred to in paragraph 4 above, thediscussions in the Paris Conference on the European Army, has affected the work ofthe Tripartite Group because the French Delegation has felt it necessary to goslow on a number of issues and to raise difficulties about reaching any conclusionsuntil the exact character of a German contribution to the European Defence Com-munity could be worked out. The French Government proposes to commit to theE.D.C. all its forces in Europe other than those required to support its overseasforces together with certain base troops, and it is not prepared to agree to german forces any larger than those committed by the French. Thus the French Govern-ment wishes the German financial contribution to the E.D.C. to be as large as,though no larger than, its own, and to be made in the form of a lump sum annual contribution to a common budget of the E.D.C. Under this common budget therewould no longer be separate German or French costs. The French hope is that bythese arrangements and by the extensive use of free equipment from the UnitedStates the Germans would help to finance the French Army. This conceptiontogether with the complete uncertainty which prevails either on what this commonbudget would look like or on the amount of the contribution the French Govern-ment would like to see the Germans make to the E.D.C., has impeded progress inLondon.7. The third development referred to in paragraph 4, the preparation of newrecommendations&apos; on security controls on the German armaments industry, islikely, if these are approved, to have far-reaching effects not only on the wholearmament production position in Europe and so on the possibility of providing the N.A.T.O. forces with the equipment they need, but also specifically on the costto the Federal Government of building up German forces. The more germany can produce its own equipment the less it will need to receive from abroad. Thiswill reduce the pressure on the. supplies of equipment available for N.A.T.O.countries, but it means that the building up of German forces will make Iarg;r,demands on the German financial resources available for defence and so leave lefor the support of the Allied forces in Germany.
8* Finally, it should be noted that in addition to the uncertainties produced by the various simultaneous activities referred to above, there is the general uncer-tainty which affects Germany as much as the other N.A.T.O. countries of what willbe the distribution of American aid in support of the defence programme. Untilthe T.C.C. examination of the defence efforts of all NA.T.Ov countries has been&apos;, concluded the United States Government will not make any decisions in regardto the distribution of aid; the United States Delegation to the Tripartite group in London have made it clear that there could be no question of their Governmentdeciding on what aid would be available for Germany until, much further&apos; progress has been made ort the whole question and, in particular, until progress has beenmade in the tripartite negotiations with the Federal Government, in the course ofwhich it wiir become clearer how great an effort the Germans themselves areprepared to make. &quot;&apos;. &apos;&apos; .&apos; :9. It will be seen from this account that there are few certain elements in thewhole situation. Nevertheless, the discussions which have so far taken place makeit clear that a problem of very great magnitude is emerging. ;The Central Dilemma &quot;.&apos;&apos;;&apos;&apos;&quot; -10. The calculation by the Tripartite Group of the total financial contributionto defence which could be asked of the Federal Government amounted to.:.-1952-53-DM. 12-5 thousand million     \ (a) Periods are from July to1953-54-DM. 15-15-5 thousand million J June-the N.A.T.O. year.Total      DM. 27-5-28 thousand million   (b) Prices are those at October1951 (adjustments will be needed to correct to expectedprices at time of expenditure):(Note DM. 1,000 million is roughly  85 million)These figures compare with expected expenditure in the current financial year April1951-March 1952 of DM. 7-5 thousand million for Allied costs alone; this shows the magnitude of the effort the Germans would have to make, one&apos; which in viewof their federal structure and the shortcomings of their fiscal system, they will have great difficulties in making, even if the Federal Government is wholehearted inmaking it, an assumption which cannot be tested until negotiations with it have begun. . &apos;     &quot;.       .&apos;11. The figures were worked out before the preparation of the new recom-. mendations on security controls on the German armaments industry; if therecommendations on the latter are approved, the German defence contribution would be able to include a substantially larger industrial effort than was foreseen,which through its demands on raw materials and its interference with Germanexport trade would have an effect, possibly a substantial one, on the German balanceof payments position. The extent of this effect could not, however, be measuredwithout German collaboration, and whether it would interfere with Germany&apos;sspending the above sums on defence or not would turn on future American decisions regarding the provision of economic aid. While, therefore, these figures may notbe finally adopted, they cannot be improved upon at the present stage. ;12. With regard to the local costs of Allied forces in Germany of thecharacter which are at present being met by the Germans, it is estimated that these will be about:-1952-53 DM. 8 thousand million 1 Also in the N.A.T.O. year July-June,1953-54--DM. 9 -..&apos;,,&apos;      ,        J   and at present prices,   ......,These figures are being subjected in the Tripartite Group&apos;to a detailed examination in order to reduce expenditure&apos;to an essential minimum and also to eliminate items which are not true defence costs and so can no longer be defended as properlychargeable to the Germans. Until this examination has been completed more precise figures cannot be given, but those above show the order of rftagnitude ofAllied local costs in Germany. They include the local costs of French and Belgianforces in Germany which, according to the E.D.C. intention, would in due course be met riot directly by the Germans but indirectlv through the common&apos; budget of the E.D.C. &apos;       &quot; q-    .
l&apos;--ft3i--: Using these figures, ithe following sums would be left to meet the costof German forces:      .    ,- c ::--      ---------     -* .-1952-53;&apos; DM.&apos;4-5 thousand million.     &apos; &apos;.   &apos;. 1953-54:  DM.6 to^ 6;5 Thousand million. .; .&apos; Total:  DM. 10-5 to 11 thousand million. &apos;On the other hand, the estimate of the cost of building up the German forces of12divisions and,1,158 front-line aircraft by 30th June, 1954, compiled by SHAPEtogether with the T.C.C. Screening and Costing Staff, referred to in paragraph 5above, gives a total expenditure in the. two years of the equivalent of aboutDM. 50 thousand million and on a very conservative estimate of the amount of equipment that could be produced in Germany if the security controls recommen-dations are approved and assuming that the balance was.supplied free, at least halfof this total, say DM. 26 thousand million, would be jrpent in Germany and would therefore fall on the German budget. Even if thelecurity controls recommen-dations were not approved and most military equipment were supplied free fromabroad, the local cost of the German forces would, on the figures referred to,amount to DM. 19 thousand million. On this most favourable assumption therewill still be a gap over the period of DM. 8,000 million or roughly  700 million. Thefigures are not considered to be wholly realistic, since they are based on assumptions about when the programme could start, the availability of equipment and the ability of the German building industry to put up the necessary installations in time to accommodate the forces; they are being further examined with a view to producingrevised figures, but whatever adjustments are made it will be impossible to escape the conclusion that the cost to the Federal Government of the German forces will exceed the sums available after Allied local costs have been met. Whether this gapwill occur by June 1953, is still uncertain, but there can be absolutely no doubt thatit will occur during 1953-54.14. It is already clear, therefore, that the total German financial contributionto defence will not be adequate to cover both Allied local costs and the local costs of establishing German armed forces, and some means will have to be found ofdealing with the gap.  The alternatives are:   .(a) Part&apos; of&apos; the. Allied costs or of German expenditure might be met by theAllies. .&apos;(b) The target for the German armed forces should be reduced.(c) Part of the Allied forces should be withdrawn from Germany as the german forces build up or the Allied defence effort elsewhere should be curtailed.(d) A combination of these methods might be used..15. As the whole basis of the French plan, which is known to the Germans,is that the German forces should be in fixed relationship to the French forceswithin the E.D.C., it is very unlikely that the Federal Government would accept any smaller target than that now proposed, of which (including the cost) it has beenmade aware through the European Defence Community, and the attempt to persuade it to do so might well seriously affect the ability of the Allies to keep theFederal Government on its present course of joining the Western camp. The factthat German forces were being kept down in order to enable Germany to pay for allied forces in Germany would provide material for the German Opposition towhich Dr. Adenauer would have no reply. On the other hand, the United kingdom has set its face against bearing any part of its local defence costs in Germany,because to do so would require it to exceed its existing defence programme whichis already straining its economic resources to the limit as &quot;well as adding to itsvery serious balance of payments difficulties. The United States Government isprobably prepared to pay part of its defence costs in Germany and to supply acertain amount of equipment free, but it seems extremely unlikely that it wouldbe ready to do so on such a scale as would leave enough money from Germansources to meet the costs of the other Allies. Acceptance of the necessity of with-drawing Allied forces from Germany as the German forces were built up, evenif this withdrawal were confined only to the British and French forces,&quot; would clearly have very serious military and political implications, as would the curtail-reassessment  of any other part of the defence effort. A combination of the various methodswould entail the disadvantages of each of them to a lesser degree.
Problems for Solution .&apos;--16.  It is difficult to expect Governments to take final decisions on this veryserious and complex question until the facts have been more fully examined. There, is, however, thejmmediate necessity of choosing the procedure for going forward in the examination of the problem, the solution to which would be influenced bya knowledge c5f how Governments are likely.to react when more positive facts arelaid before them.&apos; We must decide whether we begin discussing.with the German^Federal Government. their financial contribution to defence, before we knowwhether a solution can be found to the problem of the potential excess burden on. German^ referred to above. &quot; /     v -     &apos;:17. On political, grounds, it b most desirable that the working out of our.general contractual relationship with Germany, on which the negotiations betweenthe Allied High Commission and the Federal Government are already covering a wide field, should not be held up because of the delay in approaching them on this financial question. Everything which delays the concluding of the new contractualrelationship adds to the difficulties of the Federal Government in Germany and tothe Allied difficulties in securing a satisfactory form of agreement. From themilitary point of view, anything which delays the conclusion of a military agreementwith the Germans and the beginning of the establishment of German forces is to bedeplored. Finally, the figures for a German financial contribution to defence andfor the cost of building up German forces must all have a strong element of unrealityabout them until they have been discussed with the Germans themselves, who aloneknow what their difficulties are. The United States Delegation to the TripartiteGroup is pressing strongly that we should enter discussions with the federal government at a very early date, even though many elements in the problem facingus are unknown..18. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that to adopt this course andbegin negotiations with Germany has risks. It is true that the three governments are already committed to the building up of a German military force within theE.D.C., though the United Kingdom is not formally committed to the size of .that force recommended by the Standing Group of N.A.T.O. and the E.D.C.They will, however, commit themselves still further, more particularly as regardsthe size of the force, by entering into negotiations about finance. These negotiations are not likely to reveal that the estimates, made by the Tripartite Group are over-favourable to the Allies, having regard to the very great increase in the defence effort they have assumed that Germany should make, and they are likely to bring out more strongly the German reluctance to bear the whole or even part of theAllied local costs. We do not know how any excess burden on Germany resultingfrom the presence of Allied forces in Germany as well as German forces will bedealt with. We do not know how much American aid will be available, how itwill be distributed, and whether more aid for Germany will mean less for us. Wecannot feel confident of the outcome on these issues if we embark on earlynegotiations with the Germans. On the other hand, it is only in the course ofsuch negotiations that we shall discover where we stand on these questions.19. Thus it is necessary to know whether Ministers see objection to ourentering into negotiations with the Germans at an early date and in advance ofa clear agreement between the three Governments on the measures that would betaken to deal with any excess when it arises, even though the delay in beginningthe negotiations may hold up the whole programme in Germany and increase thepolitical risks of our failing to reach eventual agreement with the federal government.
