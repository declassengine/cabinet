THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S-GOVERNMENT)secret. (51) 33RD NOVEMBER, 1951ECONOMYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In my paper C. (51) 1,1 said that I wanted to inform theHouse, in my speech in the. Debate on the Address, of the general lines on which I have asked my colleagues to review their expenditure.2. I now ask my colleagues to approve the lines of theattached statement and to give me their full support in the campaign for economy, in the ways suggested.   I shall keep inconstant touch with them and shall give them all the help inmy power,R.A.B...........Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.,COPY NO,\BINET
One of our most important tasks in combating inflation isto reduce Government expenditure.   It is the classical function of theChancellor of the Exchequer to see to this, and this is an aspect of the Treasury&apos;s functions to which I shall devote particular attention.   With my colleagues&apos; help I hope to be successful.After only ten days in office, it would be a sign of levity in me toproduce a complete programme of retrenchment.   These things affectthe whole country; they need careful thought and must be concerted.We shall lose no time, and we shall announce our measures as soon aswe have determined them ;  the results of our work can be judged asa whole when the Estimates for next year are laid before the House.Meantime I should like to tell the House how my colleagues and I have already set on foot the radical review of all government expenditure which we consider necessary.   Some critics have suggestedthat a Committee should be set up of outside investigators.   I do not favour this course.   Economy is not a prescription to be imposed from outside, and I do not want my colleagues to be put in the position ofdefendants, bound to protect their Departments against attack.   They havealready promised me their co-operation.   The Treasury, of course,can and will make many suggesi&amp;ms &apos;where savings can be made;  buteach Minister, perhaps, is in the best position to enforco savings overthe whole field of his Department, and to instil the sense of economyinto all his officials.   We shall work together on this as a teamwhich it is the Chancellor&apos;s task to lead and to direct.   It must bemy special duty to ensure that all play their part in the common effort and that the drive to secure savings is pursued with the same intensityand the same sense of urgency in all Departments.We are at the time of year when each Department preparesits estimates for the coming year and presents them to the Treasury.It is the time when the expenditure of Departments, and the numberof their staff, is examined as a whole.   This examination will be thebasis of our work.   I have asked my colleagues, and they have agreed,each of them personally to ensure that their estimates as submittedto.the Treasury are cut to the lowest possible figure.   I shall play mypart in helping them to do so;  and together we shall ensure that inthe Estimates submitted to Parliament all waste and unnecessaryexpenditure is cut out and less essential services are deferred orslowed down wherever possible.We shall pay particular attention to capital expenditure, andto the reduction of any activities which are keeping in Governmentemploy those kinds of man-power which are most needed elsewhere.We shall watch those services in which the Governments expenditure is not directly or closely governed in Whitehall.   I have in mind, to give only one example, local government services on which we pay grant.Expenditure here is often increased not by conscious and major acts of Governmental policy, but by the frequent admonitions to expandand improve which are given by the Departments concerned, working inrecent years in an atmosphere where economy had a low priority.   Weshall review the thousand and one instructions, regulations and manuals .of advice which go out from Whitehall so as to see that there, too, thesame principle of reasoned economy is observed.I must wait till my review of the draft estimates is completed before I am in a position to decide whether sufficient savings have beenmade.   Hon. Members may rest assured that, if they are not enough, we will do whatever else is needed to put our affairs once more on a sound basis. -
