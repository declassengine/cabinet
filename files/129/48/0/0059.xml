.     , General DescriptionThe Country1. The territory of the Federation of Malaya is not large, about the size ofEngland without Wales: the population is about that of Wales without England.2. The country is divided from north to south by a dorsal range rising in places to 7,000 feet. Three-quarters of the whole area of the country is coveredwith dense jungle. Little light penetrates to the jungle where it is thickest. Becauseof this the aboriginal who lives in the jungle is stunted; and, to give anotherexample, the Malayan, elephant is a much smaller animal than the Indian. A manwould have to be fit and tough to cut his way through the jungle at a greater rate than five miles between dawn and dusk.3. No-one can fail to notice the splendid roads which interlace the country,particularly in the west. They are testimonials to British rule. Often the junglecomes down to the verge of the roads. Roads crossing the spinal barrier fromwest to east are few.4. The last geographical feature worthy of mention is the numerous rivers:their waters are discoloured by the erosion of the rich soil and alluvial.5. Broadly speaking, there are no seasons; the temperature does not risemuch above 90 degrees; it rains a little almost every day, a lot once a week and still more during the monsoons; the humidity is high. Europeans easily stand the climate for about two years at a time without losing energy or health, but it is a mistake to prolong any tour of duty beyond two years without leave.6. Rubber (the most important industry) is grown all over the Federation,but the rich tin alluvials in the plains, caused by the erosion of the central range,are almost all found on the western side of the main watershed.The People7. The population is mainly Malay, Chinese and Indian (chiefly Tamils),though there are smaller communities of Cingalese and Eurasians. The numbers are approximately as follows: -Malays ...              ...     ...&quot; 2,500,000Chinese......      ...     ... 2,000,000Indians&apos;............. 500,000Others ... -   .....-.     ... 70,000, &apos; 5,070,000   -The European population to-day is about 10,000. It is very rarely that a Europeanremains in the country when he retires. Before the war the Malays, who at onetime or another have all come from the territories now constituting Indonesia, were regarded as indigenous; while the Chinese and Indian communities were regardedas immigrants, most of whom would at some time in their lives return to their nativelands. There are, however, considerable Chinese communities in Penang andMalacca (and in Singapore) who are proud to call themselves &quot; King&apos;s Chinese.&quot;They have been in Malaya for many generations, are British subjects (ferventlyloyal and devoted to the Crown) and can speak only English. They are deeplyanxious not to have their British citizenship diluted, so to speak, by inclusion in any United Malaya. They would not tolerate separation from the BritishCommonwealth.8. The Malays are for the most part farmers, growing rice and vegetables and producing rubber, copra, palm-oil.and oil-seed and small quantities of pineapple.They are rarely found in commerce and industry.9. The Indians, mostly Tamils, provide a good deal of the unskilled labour of the country, many tapping rubber and a few working in the dredging orhydraulicing of tin.10. The Chinese, on the other hand, are found in all the activities of thecountry in rubber and tin, as common labourers, as agriculturalists, as proprietorsMALAYA
of rubber estates (20 per cent, of the rubber on smallholdings and 17 per cent, ofthat on estates is Chinese owned) and of the mines (40 per cent, of the productionof tin is Chinese owned), as merchants, as contractors, as shopkeepers (of whom they constitute much the greater part), as bankers and as traders. - Every year theygain greater economic strength and increase their hold over the wealth of thecountry.There are many rich Chinese in the Federation, highly sophisticated, urbane,shrewd, politically aloof and inscrutable. They are mostly absentee land-lords with no following in the villages or among the mass of their fellow-countrymen.Many live in Singapore, where their touch with the Chinese in the plantations ormines of the Federation is still more distant. It is amusing and stimulating to argueor negotiate with them but they are generally politicians without constituencies,,leaders without followers, remote from the problem, trimming adroitly, readysometimes with advice and almost always with criticism, but not prepared to leador even to exhort.The Constitutional Pattern11. Even before the war the constitutional and administrative position in malaya was complex: immediately after the war an attempt was made to simplifyit by the creation of the Malayan Union. This, however, met with such opposition from the Malays that it was rescinded (perhaps too readily), and replaced by thepresent Federation Agreement, under which the Malays have greater executive authority than before the war, at any rate in the former Federated States.- 12. In many important matters, such as defence, internal security, economicand financial policy, labour policy and immigration, both legislative and executive authority rests with the Federal Government. In other matters, including health,education, agriculture and land, all executive authority and a measure of legislative authority rests with the nine State and two Settlement Governments,* althoughthe Federal Government retains legislative authority over all questions of common concern.13. Both the Federal and the State Governments have Legislative and Execu-tive Councils. The Federal Legislative Council (with a large unofficial majority)consists entirely of nominated members, as do all the other Legislative and Execu-tive Councils.14. In April this year a Member system t of Government was introduced,under which the responsibility for the different Departments of Government was divided between nine Members (excluding the High Commissioner, the chief secretary and the Financial Secretary), of whom six are unofficials. In each state the chief executive (Mentri Besar) is a Malay nominated by the Ruler.15. In the Federal sphere no expenditure outside the provision, of the annualbudget may be incurred without&apos; the authority of the Finance Committee which,under the Financial Secretary, consists entirely of unofficials.16. The position of the British in.Malaya is based upon treaties with the malay Rulers. The influence of the British has now in fact to be exercised bypersuasion rather than direction. Their power is nevertheless very great and inthe last resort their influence prevails. Apart from this, and the limited repre-sentation of the other races on the various Councils, political power is in the handsof the Malays. It is exercised through the Rulers and Mentri Besars in the Statesand through the Malay preponderence on all Councils. The High Commissionerhas the usual reserved power to override his Legislative and Executive Councils inthe interests of public order and good government.17. Thus, partly from the heterogeneous nature of the population, andpartly because of the existence of the Malay Rulers, a political pattern has beenformed ill-adapted to the needs of a small country at any time, least of all at a timeof political convulsion and emergency. The most striking way in which the com-complexity of this pattern can be expressed is to say that the Federal Government has very often to work through eleven other Governments. .* The States are Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangorand Trengganu.   The Settlements are Malacca and Penang and Province Wellesley.f This curious nomenclature describes the half-way stage to a Cabinet or Ministerial system.41643 &apos;    &apos; *-9
v 18.. We cannot now re-shuffle all the cards. Some, but not all, of the adminis-.strative tangle to which I shall refer in the course of this paper is due to thesecauses, but the administration, like the country, is covered with jungle.Political Organisations ^7 /j^-O&apos;19. The most important Malay political body is the United Malay NationalOrganisation (U.M.N.O.), whose President was until recently Dato on n*, then themost influential figure in Malayan politics. In September this year, however,after breaking with U.M.N.O., he formed the Independence of Malaya Party(I.M.P.) and thereby lost nearly all of his Malay support. U.M.N.O. aims at&quot; Malaya for the Malays &quot; and has consistently stood for preservation of the&quot; special position &quot; of the Malays under the Federation Agreement. This position is reflected, for example, in the admission of all Malays to Federal Citizenship,whereas not more than one-third of the Chinese qualify for it.20. I.M.P. marks a clean break with the tradition of racial separation inMalayan politics and has as its slogan &quot; Unity, Freedom, Independence andEquality for All.&quot; Dato on n has said that it aims at independence within ten yearsand he refuses to commit himself on the question whether an independent Malayawould remain within the Commonwealth. I.M.P. has been strongly supported bythe Chinese and Indians but has found little favour among the Malays. Dato Onnis a volatile but clever politician. By European standards he is at worst unreliableand at best fitful. Despite his loss of Malay support he is still a force in the land.I have had two long talks with him and I am fairly sure that he favours theinclusion of a united Malaya in the British Commonwealth. He is certainly readyto say so in private.21. The main Chinese political party, the Malayan Chinese Association, aimsat acquiring for the Chinese equal rights in the Federation. It represents in themain only the middle classes and has little influence on the great body of theChinese peasant population. Its President, Dato Tan Cheng Lock, is a garrulousold man whose philosophy is woolly, though his intentions are good.22. The role of the Indian parties, the Malayan Indian Congress and theFederation of Indian Organisations, has never been clearly defined, and internaldissensions have so far prevented the development of any effective Indian politicalpolicy.: 23. The only European organisations which need to be mentioned are thoserepresenting the planters and miners. Their aims are industrial rather thanpolitical and they are chiefly preoccupied with restoring conditions in which their members can once more carry on their businesses undeterred by the threat of violence. .    &apos;The EmergencyThe Enemy24. The history of the Emergency is too recent to make it worth while toretrace it: we are concerned with the problem as it is posed to-day. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the Emergency is almost entirely concentrated in theFederation and is outside the Colony of Singapore. The Singapore police have theusual task of watching and suppressing subversion and Communist cells. There isno military and hardly any para-military problem in Singapore.25. If the present situation had to be summed up in a sentence it would run:&quot; You cannot win the war without the help of the population, and the Chinesepopulation in particular, and you cannot get the support of the population withoutat least beginning to win the war.&quot; It is therefore clear that we must organisea much heavier and more concentrated impact upon the enemy and key up the machine at once.26. It is, however, necessary that the word &quot; enemy should be defined. TheCommunist organisation is headed by a Secretary-General, with two or three staff officers. It is not known, but it is believed, that this central body is located some-where in Pahang. The war is waged with two instruments, propaganda and armed forces. The Min Yuen, or People&apos;s Movement (probably numbering about 10,000)is used for both: the armed bandits are recruited from them in the villages and it* &quot; Dato &quot; is an honorific title.
is the Mm Yuen who penetrate the Resettlement Areas, the schools, the villages      jjc \and the Trade Unions with Communist doctrine.   They also find supplies for the armed forces and undertake small ambushes.27. i The Communist organisation is widely decentralised. It works throughState units and is again devolved down to Districts and even to villages. The armed forces themselves are divided into twelve or thirteen regiments. Regimental Head-quarters usually operate at the State level. The operational unit is seldom much larger than 10 or 12 men up to a platoon. They used to undertake larger operationsbut these have apparently been abandoned because of the heavy losses which theyentailed. The total estimated strength of the armed bandits is &quot;between 3,000 and5,000 but, owing to the paucity of information, it is not clear how much of this force is committed to active fighting and how much is held in reserve.28. It is the general opinion that Communist efficiency has greatly improved and that a formidable instrument, both for propaganda and for war, has beenforged. Propaganda again is an &quot; overcoat &quot; term: some of it is driven home byharrying the population at the point of a gun, the rest of it by peaceful andinsidious means. One of the most serious features of the whole problem is the -amount of protection money and payment in kind which are being made dailyto the bandits. On the one hand, the rich Chinese are known to be paying large sums of money to prevent their estates and mines from being attacked; on the other,the Chinese labourer is passing food and clothing or stolen rubber and tin to thebandits through the wire of the Resettlement Areas or directly in the fields orjungle generally from fear but sometimes from sympathy. The European com-panies and single Europeans are not paying directly, but I fear that many know that indirectly they are receiving protection in this way. - For example, the shell company has a large fleet fleet of oil tanker lorries: they are seldom, if ever,attacked. The reason appears to be that the retailer who depends for his livelihoodon selling the oil is paying the protection money.29. Such is the present picture of the enemy tactics but,&apos; if we are successful in increasing our victories over the bandits, the Communists may well elect to gounderground. Thus, in parallel with the &quot; military &apos;? impact mentioned at thebeginning of this section, we must quickly forge much more effective weapons forthe warfare of ideas. .The Role of the Army - -30. I have everywhere been impressed by the efficiency and bearing of theBritish troops and their commanders. Throughout the Federation they are engagedin joint operations with the police and civil authorities and are fighting a tryingcampaign with great courage and efficiency. The National Service men are provingthemselves first class, both in combat with the enemy and in their resilience tothe climate. Morale is uniformly high. The armed forces are contributing to the campaign against the bandits almost all that can be expected of them.31. Except in certain small and remote districts along the Siamese frontier,they have prevented the enemy from gaining military control of areas outside the jungle. They have broken his larger offensive in Johore and elsewhere and haveforced him to operate in platoons or smaller units. If the present pressure of theBritish forces is not relaxed, Communist military action can at least be containedwithin this reduced compass.32. This is vital, but it must be recognised that the war has now nearly reached a deadlock. - In spite of the considerable casualties inflicted upon the bandits theiroperational strength remains virtually constant.33. This deadlock must be broken. Part of my main proposals concerns thecreation of trained Police Forces and Home Guards. For this training, Police and special Constables will have to be withdrawn; and during their absence the army will have to bear a serious additional burden of static defence. I have discussed this matter with the Commander-in-Chief Land Forces, Far East, who combinesoutstanding military ability with a firm grasp of the political situation, both in singapore and Malaya as a whole. I have obtained from him an assurance of hisfullest co-operation during this difficult transitional period. I believe that, once the training and re-training of the Police and para-military forces have been com-pleted, police action, including the better provision of information, will rendermilitary action gradually more effective and, I hope, ultimately unnecessary.
Measure Proposed and reasons the Chain of Command and Responsibility l*c34. This in ray view has been unsound: the idea of having, in effect, twoheads at the summit, one for military operations and the other for civil administra-tion, in a condition of affairs that differs from both war and peace, must inevitably lead either to conflict between the authorities or to long drawn-out discussions to reach an accommodation and compromise between two points of view. In myopinion the most effective single measure to be taken is the unification and concen-tration of command and responsibility in one man.35. A note on the civil administration is necessary here. Partly from the highly complicated political jigsaw puzzle through or around which it must work,partly from its pre-war traditions of conscientious but unhurried administration,partly from over-centralisation in the Poona-like society of Kuala Lumpur, partly from the host of new problems which almost daily crowd in upon an overstrainedservice, a Government machine has grown up of which I am critical.36. Owing to this strain inexperienced Government officers are sent straightout on to the ground and a good District Officer is worth more than a battalion.The central authority thus finds it necessary to issue more and more directions.In this way the central authority becomes itself desk-bound, clogged with paper and remote. I was told by one man in a district which I reached from KualaLumpur in forty-five minutes by Auster, that I was almost the only man fromKuala Lumper (apart from the High Commissioner and the Director of Opera-tions) whom he had seen since the Emergency began.37. A cold wind must blow some of the paper out of these Government offices.Only an experienced, forceful and ruthless administrator will succeed in creating a system equal to its task. That system must be closely knit, muscular, quick andinstant; delay must be abhorrent; action not distasteful.38. I must add that the Malayan Civil Service includes many men of greatability, knowledge and energy, devoted to their work. It is not in the main thematerial but the system which is at fault.39. It early became quite clear to me that, if one man was to&apos; be entrusted with both civil and military responsibilities, it would be necessary to appoint a deputy High Commissioner to handle the great bulk of the civil administration.Otherwise, the head man would quickly be immersed in the paper jungle and never be able to turn his attention to the real jungle and its menace.40. Unfortunately, an amendment of the Federation Agreement is involved,but I have succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the Rulers to this. TheirHighnesses are suspicious of any alteration and, for reasons into which I need not enter, negotiations with them were extremely delicate.Deputy Director of Operations. . - -41. If any alterations are required in the directive appointing the deputy director of Operations (the present document appointing the Director of operations would appear adequate), they should be made only after discussions between thenew High Commissioner and General Lockhart.42. The &quot; G &quot; Branch of the Deputy Director of Operations can and shouldbe small, but a Director of Intelligence and an intelligence staff (as far as possibledrawn from military and police headquarters) should be added. Through them the deputy Director of Operations would be able to direct, co-ordinate and distributeintelligence derived from the two main sources the police and military intelligencebranches.  The present structure is noticeably faulty at this point.43. I recommend, therefore, the appointment of one man, to be styled HighCommissioner and Director of Operations, with a Deputy Director of operations on one side and a Deputy High Commissioner on the other., &apos; 44. I have carefully studied whether there should be an extension of thearea of the High Commissioner^ responsibility so as to include other territories,and where his headquarters should be. I must strongly advise that his responsi-bility should be confined to the Federation and that his headquarters should bein Kuala Lumpur.
W 45. The Malays are fearful that the increasing Chinese population, and theirgrowing hold on the wealth and economy of the country, will&quot; soon destroy thepresent political strength of their race. All the Rulers, who are by no means a negligible force and are entrenched behind the Federation Agreement, would bebitterly opposed to such a step.46. On the other hand, the Chinese in Singapore are to-day apprehensive ofbeing drawn into a bigger unit in which their future might be determined byMalays. Furthermore, they are hardly involved in the Emergency. If this spiritof isolation is smug, it is at least deeply ingrained.&quot;47. Finally, not only is Kuala Lumpur the seat of civil government: it isalso nearest to the centre of the fighting . The Deputy Director of Operations musthave his headquarters there. If the necessary cohesion is to be gained there can,in my opinion, be no doubt that the High Commissioner must also have his head-quarters at Kuala Lumpur.Federal War Council and Cabinet48. The proposed appointment of a High Commissioner, charged with bothcivil and &quot; military &quot; responsibilities, and the other measures which I have described,should ensure quick and ultimately decisive action in the Emergency. We must avoid the risk of this &quot; cutting edge &quot; being blunted by the complex of Councils and committees which exists in the Federation to-day. The Federal and State Legisla-tive and Executive Councils are normal and necessary parts of the constitutionalmachinary prescribed in the Federation Agreement, and there can be no questionof making any radical changes in their functions or composition.49. The Federal War Council, on the other hand, is an &quot; Emergency &quot; growth and I have devoted some thought to its place in the general pattern in particular to the possibility of reducing the number of these bodies by combining the WarCouncil with the Executive Council. This Council has grown to its present sizeas a result of a demand from the various principal communities to be associatedwith the higher direction of the war. Even though, as at present constituted, it isan impossibly cumbrous body for practical purposes, it serves two very useful ends.On the one hand it satisfies, at any rate partially, the aspirations of the leaders ofthe various communities; and on the other hand it associates them with whatmust frequently.be distasteful measures. I am satisfied that at present there areinsuperable political difficulties in. the way of increasing the membership of theExecutive Council to embrace that of the War Council, or of reducing the member-ship of that Council to the number, prescribed for the Executive Council. I haveagreed that this Council should remain as a separate body. I have, however,arranged that an inner &quot; War Cabinet&quot; should be set up, consisting of the HighCommissioner, his Civil and Operational Deputies, the Chief Secretary and fourprominent Asiatics. The remaining members of the Council can usefully beemployed on other Committees to deal with such matters as man-power, education,resettlement, &amp;c. -50. I am also satisfied that the devolution to State War Executive Committeeshas proved itself. I have met the members of three of these Committees and havebeen impressed by their keenness and capacity for gearing the military and civilianefforts in their respective States.Police51. Urgent and drastic action is called for. The Emergency is in essence a police rather than a military task. More troops would add little to the impact.While some of the Police are being drawn back from the ground for training moretroops would doubtless be useful, but I am satisfied that this difficulty can be sur-mounted by temporary measures and by stepping up the present operations for ashort time in the areas principally affected.52. The figures for Johore are typical. At the beginning of 195.1 it was estimated that there were 780 armed bandits in the State; during the year altogether309 armed bandits and Min Yuen have been killed or captured or have surrendered;to-day there are estimated to be still 750 armed bandits in the field.
53. In short,.I do not recommend any increase in tropps but concur in theBritish Defence Coordination Committee (Far East) Summary S.E.A.C.O.S. 242 of15th November, paragraph 16:  &quot; There must therefore be no further reduction in the total number of armyunits in Malaya before the Spring of 1953 at the earliest. After that any reduction must depend on the success or otherwise of the campaign over thenext twelve months. The Spring of 1953 is selected as a date as it is necessaryto plan far ahead and an unexpected reduction in troops at short notice hasrepercussions throughout the country as plans are readjusted. We are especiallyconcerned with the recent change of tactics of the bandits in attacking convoyswhich must make additional demands on armoured car units and a requirement for a considerable increase in armoured personnel carrying vehicles.&quot;54. The organisation of the Police is in utter disorder and even the RegularForce is inefficient. For example, soon after my arrival I tried to obtain boththe &quot;state&quot; (or numerical composition) of the Force on the one hand and itsdeployment on the other. After cross-examination I could obtain no satisfactoryanswer under either heading. No detailed allocation of establishment has been laid down below State level; the Chief Police Officer in each State has a free hand to make what use he wishes of the officers and men posted to him. It is difficultto believe that in the absence of authorised establishments there can be rationalplanning of expansion or that the needs in man-power can be gauged, requests for additional officers and technicians, justified and priority for building programmes(particularly permanent buildings) decided.55. I have now been supplied with the following figures.&apos;, They give an accurate general picture, but in detail they must be accepted with reserve:  Officers 1948     December 1951&apos; &apos; &apos; Gazetted Officers ...      ...      ...        150 561. Inspectors (Asian) ......        188 614Police Lieutenants (European)   ... ... &apos;     743Other Ranks - Regulars    ...    . .........      9,888 . 19,704Special Constables        ......        ... 38,466 .56. Of the Special Constables approximately 24,000 are employed on estatesand mines and on guards. The remainder are used to augment the normal Policeformations of all kinds and the Jungle Companies (3,500 strong). Some 2,300Auxiliary Police are organised to perform voluntary part-time duty. The regular police are also concerned with the arming and training of part of another largeforce of part-time Police (amounting now to about 100,000) and Home Guards.Officering, training, housing and supplying have fallen behind indeed, they arenow out of all relation to this expansion.57. Owing to the Emergency this huge Force has been totally committed andin a haphazard manner. For example, the total density of officers over the wholeForce, including the large staff employed at headquarters, the Asian Inspectors andthe newly-engaged European Police Lieutenants, is roughly 1 in 30 of the full-timeforce. On the other hand, the density of officers in the 24,000 Special Constablesperforming duties on estates and mines is apparently only 1 in 480. Again, of the561 Gazetted Officers only 170 can be regarded as fully trained and the PoliceLieutenants are not trained Police Officers in any sense: few of them know the language. In the Army it is considered desirable to have a larger density of officersin untrained than in trained forces.- This does not mean that the Special Con-stabulary should, even when untrained, have more officers than the Regular police force; but they should certainly have many more than at present or than will berequired when they have been trained.58. As well as being unled, the Special Constabulary are almost entirelyuntrained: they are mere levies.59. Unfortunately, there is another very serious aspect of the disorganisation of the Police. The Government has wide emergency powers of mass arrest anddetention without trial.   No doubt these powers must sometimes be used, but a
properly organised and trained Police Force should be able to focus arrest on theguilty and reduce the numbers detained on suspicion without trial.60. The figures are at present profoundly disquieting. A guess is that perhaps 200,000 persons have been so detained for less than 28 days. It is known that 25,000 persons have been detained for 28 days or more. Of these less than 800have been prosecuted. After deportation and release there are still 6.000 detainedwithout trial. A trained Police Force should be able to make great, even startling,reductions in these numbers.61. I propose, therefore, to relieve the.Commissioner of Police, who is agallant officer but without the necessary grasp of organisation in these exceptional circumstances, and to replace him with the best that can be found. I have already arranged for a thorough examination of all possible sources from which a replace-ment can be drawn.  The Home Office are being most helpful in this search.      .;62. When the new Commissioner has been appointed I shall arrange for theRegular Police Force and the C.I.D.-to be treated as one distinct Force, and forthe Special Constabulary to be separately organised. Both Forces will be com-manded by the Commissioner of Police.63.   My proposals for the Home Guard follow.Home Guard64. It is axiomatic that we must gain the support and help of the Chinesepopulation and involve them much more deeply in the struggle.65. One of the great weaknesses to-day, which is unfortunately bound to persist for a long time, is that the Police-both the Regular Force and the special constabulary are overwhelmingly Malay, while the bandits and those whom theyare terrorising are overwhelmingly Chinese.* In the face of this handicap it ishard to gain the confidence of the population, to increase the flow of intelligence and to concert the proper counter-measures.66. The Chinese will not volunteer since they at present enjoy high wagesand good opportunities for trade and are not attracted, as are the Malays, by therates of pay in the Regular Police Force. They are not satisfied that the Britishwill stay in Malaya; they harbour some patriotism towards the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment even if they are not themselves Communists; and they feel markedmen if they voluntarily join any section of the Police. When conscription was firstintroduced many young Chinese liable for service took to the jungle or left thecountry.67. I am, however, satisfied from the success which has attended directioninto the Regular Police this year that the Chinese can with equal success be directedinto a Home Guard if the role of that Force is the protection of Chinese lives and property in the towns and of the Resettlement Areas into which their countrymenhave been concentrated outside the towns. I would hazard the guess that theywill serve loyally. Some risks will attend arming these guards but I am sure thatthey must be accepted.68. The formation of a Chinese Home Guard should, however, be looked upon only as a first step to trying to gain much more Chinese support and toenlisting much larger numbers of them in the Police.69. Although a beginning has been made there is at present no discernibleframework or organisation of the Home Guard. I have discussed the matter withthe Deputy Director of Operations and have suggested the name of an officer already in the country for the post of Inspector-General. The Deputy Director of Opera-tions is busy examining the measures necessary to expand the Home Guard and make it into a coherent force under his hand. Only those serving full time willbe paid.Protection of Resettlement Areas70. This subject has already largely been covered under the headings &quot; Police &quot;and &quot; Home Guard,&quot; but I am arranging that better wire fences and better lighting* Out of a total of 38,466 Special Constables only 1,860 are Chinese. Since the Emergencybegan 2,578 bandits have been killed: of these 2,409 were Chinese.-     41643 C
of the perimeter of these areas should be regarded as urgent. I saw a well wiredand lighted fence at Pertang in Negri Sembilan: it is ironical that this village, whichis notorious for a sullen population in sympathy with the bandits, should be betterprotected than many of the areas which are far more favourable to our causeEducation71. There is no compulsory primary education-in Malaya although theGovernment is already committed to the principle. The cost would be about$20 million per annum, say,  2,140,000.72. More serious than the money required is the strain on man-power and materials involved in this programme. Nevertheless, there is scope for ingenuityand I. am satisfied that the Government of the Federation should act rapidly. Ishall try to animate it and produce action.73. It would, in my opinion, be wrong to regard the effect of primary educa-tion only as a long-term weapon in the war of ideas. Children coming back fromschool convert their parents to&apos; our way of thinking instances could be cited-and provide some answer to the propaganda being whispered to them from the jungle.74. Again, a most important feature of primary education is to bring theraces together while they are children and to teach them a common language.75. In the long-term war of ideas, which we must win if we are to see a peaceful country and one which can some day be entrusted with self-government within the British Commonwealth, it is obvious that education and the impartialadministration of the law must take first place....... . ,..Malayan Civil Service76. The high standard of local administration set by District Officers and themembers of the professional departments, such as the Medical, Education and engineering Departments, is in danger.77. The housing shortage is disastrous. I found an officer with his wife andtwo children, recently returned from leave, who had been posted to a new district and would have had to live over a Chinese shop (where trade was thought to extend beyond inanimate commodities) if the British Adviser had not crowded them intohis own house. These conditions are widespread and when better known in Englandwill make recruitment almost impossible. :     . . &apos;.    78.   Again, armed with a pay code unsuited to to-day&apos;s conditions, the Estab-lishment Officers have fought a successful rearguard action.  Exasperation over the&apos; rigid attitude adopted by the central authority is spreading. Recruitment is sluggishand there are now some 500 unfilled vacancies in the Service.79. The high cost of living and of sending children home for education make sit imperative to revise the system of expatriate allowances.80. Finally, there are doubts whether the British will remain long enough in the country to provide a career for young men. I tried in the broadcast whichI made in Singapore to reassure opinion upon this.81. Further measures covering the whole Colonial Service, such as inter-change of officers and guaranteed employment and pensions, are in hand but must take some time to complete since they will involve all Colonial Governments.82. Reverting to the local problems, I insisted that a Board should be set upto study the necessary changes. It is directed to report to me by 31st January andis now&apos; at work. &apos;   . &apos; . &apos; .&apos;-&apos; 83. I need hardly add how vital is this problem. If the Service disintegratesunder our hands: and it is no exaggeration to say that that might happen then the chances of achieving any of our long-term aims would indeed be finally,destroyed.  , -General Conclusions84., It appears to me that the objective of one day building a united Malayannation within the British Commonwealth and Empire should not be abandoned. I
believe that. the. -ever-improving communications of our century-Singapore,-will soon be less than 24 hours, by Comet from London-the rapidity with which news,and propaganda can now be spread, arid above all&apos;the,.increasing education andliteracy of all people rriake it impossible to hold any other policy than the creationof new Dominions, self-Governing but part of the Commonwealth owing allegiance to the Crown.j 85.,: Fifty million islanders shorn of so much of their economic power can nolonger by themselves expect to hold dominion over palm and pine on the nineteenth century model of power and paternalism which made us the greatest nation in theworld. We may regain our pinnacle of fame and power by the pursuit of this new policy.86. Nevertheless, in Malaya to-day there is only one reason to expect thatwe can achieve a united nation. All the others are at present against us. the factors against the idea in this plural and heterogeneous society are formidable. the malays&apos;are a simple, agricultural people, the Chinese a sophisticated one withcenturies of experience upon which to draw. They are at once agricultural, com-mercial and industrial and will continue to gain a bigger hold on the wealth ofthe country. Of all the religions likely to appeal to a Chinaman the Muslim faithis, perhaps, the last. Under its code he could not open his shop or work his mineon Fridays but must needs pray. The consequent loss of profit and increase inoverheads is unacceptable to his realistic temperament. His staple and favouritediet, pork, would be taboo. Again, of the Chinese who are not Communists manyhave a patriotic sentiment for China, some for the Chinese People&apos;s Republic andothers for the Kuo Min Tang.87. These are the fundamental difficulties: the immediate obstacles are hardlyless. To-day 95 per cent, of the bandits are Chinese, while more than 90 per cent,of the police are Malays. Apart from the British influence, political power is inthe hands of the Malays and economic power is increasingly passing to the Chinese.Nor is the broad pattern-two million Chinese, two and a half million Malays and half a million Indians so simple as it sounds. The States of Kelantan and Kedah,for example, contain one-third of the whole Malay population. These States look to the British to keep Malaya for the Malays. In Johore, half the population isChinese, half Malay and other races.  Their voice is less clear.88. On the other hand, the one favourable factor is the absence of anyobdurate hostility between the two races like that between Jew and Arab. In smallbodies, on the Executive and Legislative Councils, in the Universities, the racesmix easily and without constraint. Both set high store on good manners and havea predilection to smile rather than to frown.89. These are indeed slender foundations upon which to build and it is easy to feet that we might not be vouchsafed the time. Genuine partnership between theraces will, in my opinion, take more than a generation and can come about then only if inter-racial schools are quick&apos;y established.90. In these plural societies the policy of our predecessors of using self-government as an instrument for creating unity is an example of politicalimmaturity amounting to folly.91. In plural societies self-government must be the expression, not the instrument of unity. If a young man and a young woman of different races werehighly suspicious of one another, we should hardly oblige them to marry byordinance and expect harmony. Even when they love one another, marriage isnot invariably a guarantee of harmony, or even of continuity. In seeking to create a Dominion like Canada, in which the British Protestant and the French Catholicare ruled by a single government, there is the ever-present danger of creating aPalestine in which unitary government tends only to increase the fissiparous forcesat work.92. These fears haunt the various races; none of them in their heart of heartswish to see us go. They still believe in British justice. We must not break down their belief. The King&apos;s Chinese and the Malay States openly express these senti-ments in fervent phrases. Other Chinese imply it. All know that we are their hopeand stand-by. -
&apos; 93.&apos; I say, therefore, that we must persist. I believe that with patience andwisdom there is a reasonable chance if we are given the time of reaching our- goal, a united Malayan nation within the British Commonwealth and Empire.94. To go too quickly now to impose self-government, would be to condemnthe whole country to confusion, and almost certainly to civil war, and to throw the malays into the arms of the Indonesians. We must adapt the old saw of one ofthe wisest political peoples of their day: &quot; Festina lente.&quot;

TEXT OF BROADCAST IN SINGAPORE ON 11TH DECEMBERrg5I--------1.     I have tried to see as much as I couldduring the short time that I have been in thecountry.   It has to &quot;be a short time becauseaction is required at once.   I have been in theStates of Johore, Pahang, Selangor, NegriSembilan and Perak and in the Settlement ofPenang and now I am back in Singapore.   I havegiven the problem of the Emergency intense study.2.    First of all, let me express my admirationfor the courage of the many ordinary people,Malay, Chinese and.Indian, growing rice, tappingrubber or mining tin, who go about their dailylife not knowing what may befall thern.   Amidthem all the Europeans have set their own splendidexample of continuing courage.   Nor can anyone who has recently been in touch with what I may call !?the front line&quot; help saying a word of grat-itude to the women, who are steadfastly sufferingall these anxieties and dangers.3,     I have tried, as far as possible, to seeeverybody that I could.   I have seen representative-ives of all the communities.   I have talked toDistrict Officers, planters and miners,policemen, soldiers, Resettlement Officers and home Guards.   I have listened to many voices.But the problems are many and there is no oneanswer.4c     I have seen something of the British, Gurkhaand Malay troops and their commanders, the royal navy and the Royal Air Force with its Australiancontingent.5.    This is warfare which makes heavy demands upon troops, especially those used to northernclimes.   Yet day by day they are showing to theinhabitants of this country and to the world an example of discipline, courage and humour.   TheNational Service man has proved himself beyondall expectation.6,    In short, I have been engaged, so to speak,upon reconnaissance.   This must be followed byplans and olans must be followed by immediate action.   When I get home I shall address a Statedocument to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet
to obtain their agreement and their help.   i must therefore excuse myself from going intodetail now hut there is much that I can say,I shall report that the main headings underwhich the immediate problem should be attackedare these.7.    First, the over-all direction of our forces,military and civil, against the enemy.   It is not an easy problem.   Let me put it this way.   Waris a matter of violence; &apos;the art of administration is a matter of reflection and of check and counter-check.   These two widely differentactivities have to be geared so that they move in concert and express themselves in immediateimpact upon the enemy.   I cannot go into themeasures which I shall propose to secure thisend,- They will not be long delayed.8.    Second, the re-organisation and training ofthe Police is urgent.   They are doing a stout-hearted job in face of trial and difficultiesbut we must now achieve a much higher state oftraining in the Special Constabulary and create a Reserve of trained police.  .....9.    Third, Education   Too many do not have a clear enough idea of what they are fighting for.They must be taught, and one of the ways inwhich it can be done is by pressing forward with the project for compulsory primaryeducation.   It is not only the war of arms that must be won:   education must help&apos; us to win thewar of ideas.   Of course, the effects ofeducation are most striking in the long termbut even at the beginning the children who go back to their parents from school are livingevidence of another way of life to set against that which is being whispered to them from thujungle.10.   Fourth, a much higher measure of protectionof the resettlement areas must bee achieved, andachieved quickly.11.   Fifth, the organisation of a Home Guard.We must move now to enlist in thie Home Guard alarge number of Chinese in the towns and in the resettlement Areas to defend their homes andtheir fellow countrymen.   I have seen such a home guard working in Pahang and I am encouraged tothink, from this small instance, that the objectcan be achieved.
12.   Sixth, we must tackle the problem of the&quot;    &apos; -great strain under which the Civil. Service isat present suffering.   We must review their terms of service and strive to maintain thehigh standards which have always &quot;been set.We must recruit the best here and at home.13.   These are the main subjects upon which wemust concentrate our attention and our energies.There is a host of smaller but highly importantdetails which we must tacklo at the same timeBMy report to the Cabinet will contain a massiveappendix.   I cannot go through all the subjectsbut can mention only a few upon which action must be taken at once.   For example, armouredvehicles.   There must be sufficient armouredvehicles to enable the civil authorities, thePolice, the planters and miners to move aboutupon their duties in vehicles which enable themto hit back if they are attacked.   I cannotsubscribe to the theory that protecting a manfrom rifle-fire reduces his fighting spirit.Another subject is the officering of the MalayRegiment.   This will require consultation with my colleagues.   There is also the important matter of increasing - and rapidly increasing -the number of Government officers who can speakMalay and Chinese.   There is the question of theappropriate weapons for issue to planters and miners.   The propaganda system appears torequire careful scrutiny.   These are a fewinstances among many.14.   On my return to England I shall wish to bekept in close touch with all these-important matters, and shall closely watch their development.15,   In solving these problems we must look for help to the great Colony of Singapore.   We must look to all races here, and particularly to theenlightened and educated Chinese.   We must look to those who are proud to call themselves the .f&apos;King&apos;s Chinese1&apos;, who have been here for manygenerations and whose descendants will be livinghere long after the present problems are forgotten.16.   I have already said that this1 is a war ofideas as well as of arms.   We have to see thatour philosophy opens up to the peoples of Malayathe prospect of a finer and freer life-than thatwhich our enemies are now trying to instil.
17.   The ideal for which all communities in theFederation of Malaya must strive is a unitedMalayan nation.   When this has &quot;been achievedthat nation will carry the responsibilities andenjoy the advantages of self-government.   Then,we confidently hope, Malaya will add strength to the British Commonwealth, the greatestassociation of free peoples of v/hich historytells.18*   Political advancement, economic development,social services and amenities are rungs in theladder.   Today, however, we have to placeemphasis on the immediate menace.   We must ask who are the enemies of those ideals?   Whoare the enemies of political advancement?  Whatis delaying progress towards it?   The answer isCommunism.   The answer is the terrorists.   the answer is the Min Yuen and those who, partly from fear and partly from sympathy, create apassive hut no less serious obstacle tovictory.   All these in greater or lesser degree&quot;betray our ideal and upon them we must unitein visiting, under the law, the full severitywhich their betrayal merits.   Only so willvictory he gained.19.   Without victory and a state of law andorder, which it alone can bring, politicaladvancement becomes a hollow mockery to everyone and not least to the worker in field,in mine and in factory.   The first duty of everygovernment in every country is to ensure andprotect liberty.   Freedom from fear is thefirst human liberty.20.   The pursuit of the ideal of a unitedMalaya will demand great political wisdom andthe exercise of those rarest of human virtues,patience and forbearance.21.   The British believe that they have a mission in Malaya and they will not lay it aside until they are convinced that terrorism has been killed and buried and that a true partnership of all communities can lead to true and stable self-government.   The road to this partnership will certainly be long - it may well be very long -and it runs through jungle and ravine.   But we will protect it, we will stay, we will never quituntil our aims - and they are common to allraces - have been achieved.22.   I believe, too, that when self-governmenthas been attained, the British have a place and
a part to play in Malaya together with their fellow-citizens of the other races.   Let allBritons know, therefore, that there is a futureopen to them in Malaya - first, in bringing aboutthe partnership of all the communities, and thereafter in the united and self-governingMalaya which will emerge,23,   In conclusion, I want to turn back tothe subject of the Emergency,   I cannotpromise you speedy success.   I can - and do -promise you speedy action.   Only v/ith yourhelp can the war be won but I end by sayingthat if we act together my confidence and myfaith is that.law and order and freedom fromfear can be regained and restored.
3.   A Federal War Council was set up in April, 1950,under the .Chairmanship of the Director of Operations,the other members being the Chief Secretary, the G. 0. C. ,Appendix IIIFEDERAL AND STATE COJNCILS, ETC.1.   Federal Legislative Council.The Federal Legislative Council has 75 members,of whom 14 are officials, 9 are the Presidents of the -Councils of State of each of the nine Malay States,2 are representatives of the Settlement Councils ofPenang and Malacca and 50 are unofficials.   the unofficial members are all nominated.   They areselected to represent different- interests - employers,labour, industry, commerce, etc.   The racial composition of the Council Is at present:-34 Malays      (3 officials, 9 Presidents ofState Councils, 22 unofficials)17 British    (10 officials, 7 unofficials)16 Chinese    (1 official, 15 unofficials)5 Indians2 Ceylonese1 Eurasian.(Note:   When a Deputy High Commissioner is appointedit is the intention that he will normally preside overthe Legislative Council, thus relieving the HighCommissioner of this duty).2.   The Federal Executive Council.This Council consists of the High Commissioner,three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), fourother official members (one of whom, the Member.for home Affairs, is a Malay) and seven unofficial members(at present two Malaya, two Chinese, one European, oneIndian and one Ceylonese).   It has recently been decidedto increase the membership of the Council from 14 to not more than 19.
the A.O. C. , the Commissioner of Police, the Secretaryfor Defence and the R.N. Liaison Officer (when required). .Its functions were to he to decide on operationalpolicy and to put it into effect.&apos;In October, 1950, the Council was expanded by theaddition of two Malay unofficials (Keeper of the rulers&apos; Seal and Dato-on n), a Chinese unofficial (DatoTan Cheng Lock) and a European unofficial (Mr. .G.D. Treble,a Pahang planter).   At the&apos; same time the High Commissionerassumed the Chairmanship.After the death of Sir Henry Gurney in October,1951, there was an insistent demand for the expansionof the Council to include much wider representation ofthe various communities and interests.   It now consists of all the members of Executive Council (except one wholives&apos; in Penang), together with a few extra unofficial members - representatives of all communities particularly affected by the Emergency - making a total of 20.   its functions have necessarily changed with its change ofcharacter and it is now purely advisory on important matters of war. policy. .For this reason the ServiceChiefs (including the Commissioner of Police) are nolonger members, their executive responsibility beingrepresented by the Director of Operations.   its composition, by races, is at present as follows:-Officials              Unofficials(including &quot;Members&quot;)   _-Europeans 8                              3Malays 1                             3Chinese &apos;                            3Indian 1Ceylonese 14.   State and Settlement Legislative and executive Councils.____In each State and Settlement there are legislative and Executive Councils (the former with unofficialmajorities) roughly reflecting the composition, but on a smaller scale and with necessary local variations, ofthe corresponding Federal bodies.
5.   State War Executive Committees.These &quot;bodies were set up in 1950 at the instanceof the Director of Operations to facilitate the carrying out of his instructions and to avoid theunacceptable delays which were inevitable when action was taken through the normal civil authorities.   Theyconsist of the Mentri Besar, British Adviser, ChiefPolice Officer and senior military officer in the area,each of &quot;whom is responsible for executive action inhis own sphere.6.   District War Executive CommitteesSimilar bodies have been set up in Districts orPolice circles (which cover several Districts).   Theircomposition varies but the basic membership includes the District Officer, the Officer Commanding the police and the local Military Commander.7.   The War Executive Committees thus provide a directchain of command from the Director of Operations downto District level.
ARMOURED VEHICLES FOR THE police the &quot;procurement&quot; of armoured vehicles hasnot heen properly organised and requests had heenmade for vehicles which, I fear, will proveunsuitable.   The orders were also too small.Accordingly I gave instructions that a Committeeshould be set up to go into this question.   TheCommittee contained representatives of the civil administration, Police, and Army.    Its report is attached.report-     TYPES &apos;Armoured vehicles are needed solely for protection against roadside ambushes.   For thisthree types are required:-(i) for carrying numbers of men travellingon dangerous roads or when called outon operations;(ii) for escorting soft vehicles;   and(iii) for carrying individual officerstravelling on duty in dangerousareas.2.     SPECIFICATIONSIdeal specifications of these three types of vehicles would be:- &apos;(i) Troop-Carrying VehiclesFully armoured to carry driver and10 men.   Quick and easy means of exit.Ports from which small&apos; arms can befired.   Weight not to exceed 51- tonsin order that vehicles may negotiatebad roads and weak bridges.(ii) Escort VehiclesFully armoured. Accornmodation fordriver and two men. Revolving turretand L.M.G. mounting.
(iii) Vehicles for carrying individual officersFully armoured.   Accommodation fordriver and two men.   Required for allpurpose travel and should thereforeprovide a modicum of comfort.All the above should he fitted with run-flattyres and he provided with a full scaling of spare parts.3.     NUMBERS REQUIRED       . .The following numbers are based on optimumrequirements and take no account of limitingfactors of finance or availability of vehicles:-(i) Troop Carrying Vehicles.......... 0902Scale of issue: 1 to each Police Stationwith 20 men and over,2 to each District H.Q,3 to each Contingent H.Q.4 to each Jungle Company.10$ reserve.(i i) jEHs c q 3?ij VGiMi cX gs 0 0000*000 9 g o o o 9 o o 0 206Scale of issue: 2 to each District H.Q.2 to each Contingent H.Q.10$ reserve.Note:This number is not required for present purposes but envisages the need for escortingcivil food convoys if food control measuresprove successful.(iii) Individual Transport Vehicles502Scale of issue: 1 to each O.C.

4*     AVAILABILITY   -It is realised that it may not he possible -to obtain vehicles answering all the specificationsgiven in paragraph 2.   For instance it would notbe possible to obtain a fully armoured vehiclecapable of carrying 11 men and weighing only 5?tons.   The aim must therefore be to procure themost suitable vehicles available which offer thebest delivery dates.5.    The ideal vehicle would be one which is capable of performing all 3 duties efficiently.In this respect consideration has been given tomodifying a G.M.C.   A.P.C. by armouring the topand back of the driver&apos;s cab and installing an armoured casing in the rear of the vehicleSufficient to give protection to one man andfrom which he can fire an L.M.G.&apos;6.    This type of vehicle would not, however,offer as high a standard of efficiency as havingone type of vehicle to be used as a troop-carrier and another type-capable of being usedin the dual role of an escort vehicle and forthe transportation of individuals, as thespecifications of these last two types of vehicles are very similar.7.    The most suitable type of vehicle availablefor use as a troop-carrying vehicle is the G.M.C.A.P.C. suitably modified.   Modificationsrequired are armouring of the roof and rear of the driver&apos;s cab and raising the sides andrear of the back of the vehicle 12!! witharmour plate.150 of these vehicles are now. in the countryand will be modified as required.   341 are on order and should be modified before beingshipped.A further 411 will be needed to meet the full requirements stated above.   If they are notavailable in the United Kingdom enquiries will benecessary in Canada, where they are or have beenmanufactured.8.    The most suitable type of vehicle known atpresent that could be used in the dual role ofan escort vehicle and for the transportation of individuals is probably the G.M.C. Scout Car.
It is not known whether they.are in fact available or still in production but enquiries should alsobe made in Canada about this type of vehicle.The Police have at present only 26 (FordLynx) of this type of vehicle.   On the above figures 682 are therefore required but if adual purpose vehicle could be obtained, thetotal requirements could probably be reduced.9.    Other vehicles which have been consideredare:-(a) Humber Scout Cars, .These are unsuitableas no spares areavailable.(b) Daimler Scout Cars)These vehicles carry -Ford Lynx )only a driver and other and need to be modified to providetop protection and aturret.   Sparesposition of Ford Lynxis unknown.&apos;(c) Morris Armoured ScoutCars. These are mechanicallyunsound and thespares position is unsatisfactory.(d) &apos;!0XLEY:1 type ona Ford V8 Chassis. It is considered thatin order to armourthis vehicle effectively,the weight of armourwould be too much forthe chassis andsuspension.   However,if tests on the prototype prove to be satisfactory thisvehicle could beconsidered to providetransportation for individuals^ but would not be satisfactory&apos; as an escort vehicle.
(e) Armoured Land RoversThe weight of armour is too much for the carrying and tractivecapacity of the vehicle.(f) Saloons convertedb:r partial armouringap used by Estate- and Mines managers.The intensive use towhich Police vehiclesare put would entail .constant mechanicalbreakdowns, since thesevehicles are not built to carry armour and the weight imposes too great a strain.10.     MAINTENANCEAs armoured vehicles require moremaintenance than soft vehicles, an increase of armoured vehicles for the Police Force on thescale suggested will impose a very heavy strain indeed on Police maintenance facilities.A variety of makes of vehicles should thereforebe avoided, if possible.   The provision of GMCAPCs and GMC Scout Cars would be the idealsolution from this point of view since they arethe same vehicle mechanically and bothmaintenance and supply of spare parts would be greatly simplified.&quot;11.     SUMMARY(a) 341 GMC APCs now on order require modification before being shipped.   Afurther 411 GMC APCs suitably modifiedare required.   These vehicles are considered the most suitable as troopcarriers.(b) 180 further vehicles are required forescort duties.(c) 502 vehicles are required for trans-portation of individuals.(d) GMC Scout Cars will satisfy (b) and (c)above if available.
(e) If GMC APCs and GMC Scout Cars are notavailable either in the United Kingdom orin Canada in sufficient numbers, vehiclesshould be provided which would meetrequired specifications as nearly aspossible such as the Ford Lynx (if sparesare available) for escort duties and the&quot;OXLEY&quot; (if proved satisfactory in tests)or any similar vehicle for transportingindividuals.(f) All vehicles should be fitted withrun flat tyres and have a full scaling of spares.(g) Results of enquiries into costs andavailability may entail modification of programme.16th December, 1951.
ARMS, CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT URGENTLY REQUIREDBY THE POLICE AND OBTAINABLE ONLY FROM THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA0Requirements1. 1,000,000 yardsKhaki cellularshirting or twillor Khaki drill.2. 12,000 carbinesMole and4,000,000 rounds.300 ammunition.Re as ons why unobtainablefrom sterling sources.Estimated consumption of Khakiclothing in 1952 is:-787,000 yds. cellular shirting846,000 yds. Khaki Drill.Indian mills axe the normalsuppliers but delivery pro- -spects from. India are badbecause of internal -cliff i-culties.   alternative sources of supply have beenfound which should largelysatisfy Khaki drill require-ments during 1952, and enquiries are now being madein the United Kingdom aboutthe supply of cellularshirting, or of twill orKhaki drill in lieu.   IfKhaki cellular shirtingcannot be obtained in theUnited Kingdom it may benecessary to order up to amillion yards of it in theUnited States.These weapons have proved to be ideal for jungle warfare,being easily handled and giving a high rate of accurate fire.Supplies can be obtainedonly from the United Statesof America.   The numbersasked for will be sufficientto enable demands of estatesand mines for this type ofweapon to be met.
Requirements500 Pump Guns and125,000 rounds ofsteel platedaimiunition.Re as ons why,unobtainab1efrom sterling sources.These guns are - consideredan essential part of PoliceJungle Company equipment.They would greatly increasefire power of Coys, Theycan be obtained only fromthe ItSoA,
EARTH-SHIFTING equipment.     .20 caterpillar tractors (10 Type D.7 and 10Type D.B.) have &quot;been ordered from the CaterpillarTractor Company Ltd. of the United States.   these orders received the support of two American Missions(the Griffin and Melby Missions) which visitedMalaya in 1950.   The tractors were originally neededbecause the building of new roads and improvementof existing ones was a very urgent economic necessityin Malaya; and the Economic Cooperation Administrationhave endorsed the supply of the tractors on economic grounds.   Owing, however, to the needs of the UnitedStates re-armament programme, supply cannot be metunless these tractors are given operational priorityby the Defence Department (a &quot;D.O. rating&quot;.)2.     The urgency of the construction of new roadsin Malaya is now military, and economic considerations are secondary.   Unless the road-building programmecan be pushed ahead (for which the tractors are essential) the campaign against the Communists willbe seriously impeded.   Among vital projects which arean immediate military need are:-(a) Mountain roads to set up V.H.F. wireless stations for the Police network. This network, comprising18 stations in all, will link the huge numberof Police Stations built and under constructionas part of the plan for defeating the Communists.They are situated on mountains - and over 50miles of new mountain roads are required.Because of lack of plant only one or two ofthese roads have so far been completed0(b) Approach roads to Resettlement Areas.   several hundred miles of road are required for squatterresettlement schemes.   Many miles are already being built but, because of lack of plant, thebulk remain to be started.   The resettlementschemes are the vital core of the &quot;Briggs Plan&quot;,and unless these areas are linked with the maincommunication arteries it will remain very diffi-cult indeed to supervise and protect them.(c) Operational Trunk Roads.   Over 100 miles of operational roads suitable for military vehicles in all. weathers are required.   For lack of plantmost of these roads have not yet been started.The Temerloh-Maran Road, for example, reduces
the distance from east to west coast by 72miles.   This road is necessary not only forlong-term strategic purposes but also for thepresent Emergency.   Another road, 65 mileslong, will open up the Malay-Siam border to&apos;military and police traffic and greatly facilitate the control of this vital frontier, across whichterrorists can at present pass into the relativesanctuary of Siam,3.     The War Office and Foreign Office are taking this matter up vigorously but if they are unsuccessfulit is hoped that the Prime Minister will agree topress the matter at the highest level.   An assurance could be given to the Americans that this equipment,if supplied, would be used in the first place only for work of immediate importance to the anti-communistcampaign.4. Other road-making equipment now in Malaya ordue to arrive there shortly will be quite uselessunless these tractors can be supplied.5.     It is also urgent for the prosecution of the anti-communist campaign that more tracks should be driven through the jungle.   For this additionalequipment will be necessary.   I am arranging to havethese means examined and will as soon as possiblesubmit proposals for obtaining the requiredequipment.
CHEMICAL DEFOLIATION OF ROADSIDE JUNGLE1.     It is agreed on all hands that the risks ofambush by bandits can be greatly reduced by defolia-tion of roadside jungle.   A certain amount of thisis already being done by hand but the process isslow and costly and the vegetation quickly grov/sagain.   Chemical defoliation would, it is believed,be much more effective.2.     Experiments on a small scale have been carriedout using two recently discovered hormone weedkillers (2. 4r-D and 2, 4, 5-T) with Sodium tri-chloracetate in various combinations.3.    Tests began on the 17th September, 1951, bymeans of hand sprays, and within ten days thefoliage was dead.   Three months later no significantregeneration had taken place and the original growthsare generally dead.   Current observations stronglysupport the view that there will not be regenerationof any plant growth sufficient t o provide, cover for the enemy for six months, and probably for one year, after treatment.4.    For the most effective treatment the current costs of the chemicals involved is equivalent to $190.00( 22) per acre.   On the assumption that it will bedesirable to clear roadsides to a depth of 100 yardson either side ^72.7 acres per mile) the cost of thechemicals per mile of road will be $13,780 ( 1607).With further experimental work it is believed that thedose can probably be reduced to give a cost of chemicalsof $55.00 ( 6) per acre, or $4 000 ( 133) per mile of road.   The cost of cutting by nand varies between$300 - $450 per acre for three slashings a year depending on the denseness of the growth.   A shorter distancethan 100 yards may have to be accepted.   The savings aretherefore massive.5.     On the 14th December attempts were made to use a&quot;TIFA&quot; fogging machine for practical roadside tests.This is the only spraying equipment available in thecountry but it proved unsuitable because the solutionemulsified.   Other possible measures are being explored.6,    Messrs. Imperial Chemical Industries, Malaya, Ltd,
have conducted the foregoing experiments and theyreport that a combination of chemicals has now been .found which will meet the purpose.,   While thesechemicals have been successfully applied by hand theadvantages to be derived by this method of control bychemicals can be fully realized only by means of large-scale mechanical methods of application.   It is nowtherefore an engineering problem.   LCI. Ltd. and plant Protection Ltd. in England have been kept fully informed by I. C. I. (Malaya) and they have been askedto carry out trials of all types of spraying equipment.7.     There are three main uses for this chemical methodof control:-(a) rail and roadside clearance in dangerous areas;(likely ambush positions); Ii(b) clearance of perimeters of resettlement areas,]etc.;   and(c) destruction of crops grown by, or for, thebandits  in remote jungle areas.(a) and (b) require mechanical means of applicationthough (b) can possibly be done by hand spraying.   For(c) the Federation Government has ordered&apos; through LCI.(Malaya) Ltd. two sets of Spray rigs for use in Austeraircraft.   This is the only purpose yet in mind for application by aircraft.   Earliest date of delivery isFebruary/March, 1952, and despatch by air has been requested.8.   Summary.(a) A suitable combination of chemicals has beenfound and supplies are available from sterlingsources.(b) The cost of chemicals (taking no account of thegbst of application) compares favourably with ithe cost of slashing by hand.i(c) Mechanical methods for large-scale applicationhave not yet been determined. This is now themain problem.(d) LCI. Ltd. and Plant Protection Ltd. havedetails of experiments carried out and havebeen requested (through LCI. , Malaya) tocarry out researoh for suitable mechanicalequipment.
Language Teaching1.     As part of their training in order to qualify for confirmation, officers of the Malayan Civil Serviceand gazetted officers of the Malayan Police service are normally required to nass examinations in Malay,Chinese or Tamil within 2! to 3 years of appointment.20     During the past three years officers of the malayan Police Service have been confirmed in theirappointments on the recommendation of the commissioner of Police, Federation of Malaya, or the Commissioner ofPolice, Singapore, whether they have passed the prescribedexaminations in language or not, since it has been held that in Emergency conditions they do not have opportunities for study.3.     Of the 194 Malayan Civil Service officers recruited from 1946 to 1951 inclusive, 114 have passed the testin one or other of the prescribed languages.   Of the519 Police Officers recruited during the same period,163 have passed lower standard Malay.4.     The figures in the preceding paragraph include all officers serving in both the Federation of Malaya and singapore, since the Malayan Establishment providesexpatriate officers for both territories, and officers on the common establishment are liable for service in either administration.5,     Officers selected to learn a Chinese dialect are normally sent to China for 18 months to 2 years.   Since1946 28 Malayan Civil Service cadets and one AssistantSuperintendent of Police (on probation) have been sentto China.   Of these, 9 Malayan Civil Service cadetsand the Police Officer are still there.6,     Two intensive courses in colloquial Cantonese andHokkien were organised at Cameron Highlands in July/August, 1951.   Each course takes 12 officers and lasts6 months.   20 Police and 4 Malayan Civil Service officersattended the first two courses, and the same numbers are to attend the second two courses, which are due to begin in January/February, 1952.,7o     Evening classes in Malay were started in KualaLumpur in June, 1951, to teach Police Officers stationed in the neighbourhood.   These elasses will be continued in 1952.8.     Cadets appointed since January, 1950, have inmost cases been required to undertake full-time duties
in the field and have not had normal opportunities for study.   The majority of those appointed in 1950have, however, now been released from special Emergency&apos;duties, and steps must be taken to ensure that theremainder, after serving 9 to 12 months in Emergencyposts, have suitable opportunities for taking up the study of both language and law.9&quot;     Police Lieutenants, being temporary officers, arenot required by their terms of service to pass anyexaminations.   Of the 837 recruited up to date, 112 have passed some examination in Malay.   This, is not enough,however, and I have therefore arranged for examinationof the possibility of awarding bonuses to them as an inducement to learn Malay.
T-BJ-or ^r\,271 ^APPENDIX IX- ;INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND RELATED COUNTER-MEASUPE8I INTELLIGENCE services a.   Intelligence against the enemy the importance of intelligence in the Malayancampaign cannot be exaggerated.   Every policeoperation is in large measure an intelligence task and the Malayan campaign is in essence a policeoperation.   In a country covered with dense jungle,where evasion is easy and contact with the enemycannot be made without secret information, it isessential that intelligence should be gained fromthe Communist forces without their knowing.   Intelli-gence, therefore, to use semi-technical language,&apos;must be &quot;live&quot; as well as &quot;blown&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;.   Itmust come from sources whose &quot;pumping&quot; is unknownto the Communists.At present, the opposite occurs.   The bulkof our reliable information is obtained not fromagents or police friends or contacts but insteadfrom corpses, prisoners of war and captured docu-ments.   This process builds up an interestingacademic or even strategic picture.   It would be most useful in fighting regular troops-in formalbattle, but it is of much less value against a mobile, intelligent and localised guerilla force,The provision of more &quot;live&quot; as opposed to&quot;blown&quot;&apos; or &quot;dead&quot; information must be the task of the Police Force.   In this, until recent months,they have failed.   They have been handicapped by post-war reorganisation, shortage of Asiatic officers,expansion of the Uniformed Force and the strikingfact that more than 90 per cent of the enemy areChinese while 95 per cent of the Police are Malay.In addition, the C.I.D. Special Branch formerlyoperating from Singapore and serving both singapore and the Federation has on two different occasionsbeen separated from the main Police Forces, withunfortunate results.   The reorganisation of theFederation Police C.I.D. by Sir William Jenkin,although starting with the handicap of having fewif any agents and contacts, and its re-integrationwith the main Federation Police Force, seem to
have established a firmer framework and alreadymilitary commanders report an increased flow ofinformation.Nevertheless,-it would be foolish to expect any profound improvement even with an increased andmore efficient C.I.D. until the basic police trainingof all ranks of the regular, uniformed police isimproved.   It is mainly on the uniformed pdicethat C.I.D. counter-measures must be based.Without the firm base of a Police Force in close touch with the people, penetration of enemy organi-sations becomes most difficult.   In Malaya, little or no deep penetration of the enemy has been achieved.To-day, many of the regular Police Force, far from being policemen capable of carrying out their shareof investigations and of acquiring intimate localknowledge, are little more than static, para-militaryguards - which throws an extra burden on the C.I.D.In addition, weaknesses exist in the intelligencefiling system at lower levels.   Thus.little is done at police stations to identify and arrest thousands of wanted persons classified by the C.I.D. as activeCommunists.Improvements are likely to take some little time to achieve.   Meanwhile, as the efficiency ofpolice intelligence improves   intelligence can andis being collected in the following ways.(a) aggressive patrolling by police and military;(b) Police round-ups and security checks;(c) aggressive patrolling by jungle squads and companies;(d) deep patrolling by Malay Scouts;(e) reconnaissance by air; and(f) interrogation of suspects and captured bandits.&apos; It should also be possible for the C.I.D.to concentrate on specific targets in certain areas.At the moment a special C.I.D. investigation is beinglaunched against the Min Yuen.   This investigation,however, is still in the course of being planned.It should also be possible to appoint special investi-gation teams .aimed at certain individuals - that is,to hunt down individual men from Communist higher
formations through their families, properties,sweethearts, etc.   This will be undertaken shortly.Re commendati ons; -(1) more Chinese must be recruited or directedfor all. Regular branches of the Police and given chances of promotion;(2)   more training in basic police and intelligencemethods must be given to all police branchesirrespective of race;(3)   the question of new techniques for penetratingthe jungle by aerial photography should be examined;(4)   the gaining of intelligence from the aboriginaltribes should be investigated; and(5)   the training of agents should be acceleratedwhere this is possible and they should beused against specific targets under 0..I.D.arrangements.B.   Security of our own ForcesBecause over 150,000 persons have been absorbed into the Security Forces, some risks in recruitmenthave been taken without proper screening.   Effortsmust therefore be made to tighten up our own security arrangements.   If the Malayan Communist Party atany time succeeded in bringing about a civil warin certain regions, many unforeseen misfortuneswould befall us.   The growing efficiency of the enemymust be combated more vigorously on our home ground.Recent disquieting incidents have been the suspectedpurloining of ammunition from lighters in Singapore;the sale of arms by Special Constables and Home Guards;the penetration of Home Guards by the Min Yuen;the treachery of a Sakai chief tracker; the disclosure of a Communist cell in King&apos;s House, Kuala Lumpur; aid&apos; the infiltration into the Chinese schools of Communistteachers and literature.   At every level and in everyService Department normal security precautions mustbe tightened up.Re c ommendati on:-A conference should be held of the chiefs ofthe Services and Police and the heads of the Government
Departments concerned to consider the problem and set up suitable machinery in Kuala Lumpur and in singapore to deal with internal security of our own forces.   Trade Union organisations should be con-suited, at a later stage.C.   Use and Control of Intelligence by Field ForcesAt lower levels this is largely a matter ofharmonious relations between soldiers and policemen,These in general seem to exist.   C.I.D. personnel and intelligence files are usually available to themilitary down to battalion level.   At the centre,however, a more purposeful use might be made of intelligence.   The Deputy Director of operations should establish an Intelligence staff to deal withthe various aspects of intelligence and guide the intelligence campaign in the direction which hisplan demands.   This is, perhaps, all the more necessary owing to the slender resources available.He should be able to issue general directives to theC.I.D., Internal Security Forces, &quot;black&quot; propaganda and subversive organisations as they grow up under his command.   For this purpose he should be given a Directory of Military Intelligence or Director ofthe Intelligence Bureau.   Whether this man should bea soldier or a policeman is immaterial, thoughthe balance might be in favour of a policeman.Re c recommendations:-(a) that a Director of the Intelligence Bureaube appointed to the Deputy Director of operations; and(b) that the main Operations and Information Roombe located at the headquarters of the deputy director of Operations.D.   Auxiliary Intelligence Instruments1.   Propaganda and Information Department(Information Department, Film Unit, Public and press Relations, Radio, etc.)This Department is in a confusion of dividedloyalties and responsibilities and must be entirely reorganised under one head.   At present it is inefficient.   The vernacular press is
inill served by it.   The Film Unit, whilstpossessing 63 mobile vans and a film studio,has so far failed to produce any propagandafilms of importance.   Because Dato on n is the member in Charge of these services, reorganisationmay prove difficult, but such is the importanceof this weapon that means must be found for undertaking complete reorganisation under onechief who is a trained propagandist.2.   Special Emergency Information DepartmentThis deals with psychological warfare andis under the control of the Deputy Directorof Operations,   It does good work in straightpropaganda.   It is short of staff, makes useof Chinese Affairs Department staff half-time at lower levels or borrows staff from theInformation Department proper,3.   &quot;Black&quot; or Counterfeit Propaganda DepartmentThis Department hardly exists, but could douseful work.   Its chief concern is the sporadicproduction at long intervals of a bogus Communistnewspaper.   The Department is very much under-staffed.   Occasional hours are devoted to it by the head of the Special Emergency InformationDepartment.   It employs one Chinese cyclostylerfull-time and enjoys the part time co-operationof one Chinese literary expert,4.   Subversive Activities (Military)This Department existed for a short time but was abandoned. It could do useful work with suitable staff.Recommendations:-(a) the whole information and propaganda machinemust be drastically reorganised and put under one head, who is a propagandist;(b) the film studio must be reorganised for theproduction of local propaganda films;(c) the present Special Information section should perhaps be removed from the Deputy Directorof Operations to the general Propaganda and information Department while the new chief of
the whole Propaganda Department creates an efficient liaison between himself and the deputy Director of Operations; and(d)   the Black Propaganda Department and theSubversive Activities Section should be in-creased, given expert chiefs and placed underthe control of the Director of the IntelligenceBureau to the Deputy Director of Operations.CONCLUSIONUntil the Regular Police are re-trained aspolicemen and until all Police Branches have acomplement of Chinese personnel, progress in intelli-gence work will remain patchy and haphazard.   Atpresent it is only the information got from the bodies of dead bandits or from prisoners whichsaves the face of our Intelligence Services.   Ifthe Malayan Communist Party decided to becomeclandestine and concentrate on political action,the intelligence canvas would be blank indeed.The existing instrument of police intelligenceis inadequate.   It must be dev&amp;oped,II SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIESIt is suggested that a special subversivesection should be set up under the Deputy Directorof Operations, with one or two units in the field.For political as well as security reasons it isimportant that such a section should be secret and under his personal control,Re commendations:- -(a) a subversive section to be placed under the direct command of the Deputy Director of Operations;(b) the Deputy Director of Operations to submit an establishment for such a section; and(c) suitable persons to be recruited for it in malaya and the United Kingdom,
-   27?Ill DECEPTION TACTICSOne of the major assets of the Communistsis undoubtedly their local intelligence services.This strength might he turned against them, andtheir own intelligence network used to feed themwith false information.   This can be done onlyin the Districts as the enemy have now streamlinedtheir command down to companies and platoons.This disadvantage is. however, almost outweighed by the fact that in the nature of things banditmaquis or guerilla forces are vulnerable to rumourand liable to exhaust themselves in the panic towhich that leads.Deception should be organised with the chiefobjects of:-(I)   discrediting the bandits&apos; sources of intelli-gence in the Min Yuen by the infusion ofinformation soon proved to be false or value-less; and(2)   harrying the bandits by spreading signs andrumours which will, force them to keep on the move.These steps may not result in killing banditsbut by intensive deception the morale of individualunits in desperately tough country can be profoundlyshaken if they are constantly kept on the move.Re commenda,ti ons: -(a) that this matter be considered by the deputy director of Operations;(b) that, if he is agreeable, a small, expertcadre from the United Kingdom be put under his command; and(c) that a school for local army and police officersbe opened at his Headquarters.
TEEMS OF EMPLOYMENT OF BRITISH OFFICERSAND OTHER RANKS POSTED OR SECONDED FOR&quot;SEEvTCE&quot;with&quot;THE MALAY REGIMENT-1.     The type of British officer so far being obtained for the Malay Regiment is not up to the standardrequired to maintain British prestige.   It hasbeen represented to me that this situation has arisen as a result of difficulties in the conditions on which British officers are assigned for dutywith the Regiment.2.     At my request I was given the annexed memorandumon the question at issue between the federation government and the War Office.5.     This discloses a system which should notbe accepted.   It is therefore necessary that thewhole matter should be urgently re-examined and Ipropose to discuss it with the Secretary of Statefor War early in the New Year.
MEMORANDUMlo     It is accepted by the War Office that thesystem of posting British personnel to the MalayN Regiment is not sound.   As long ago as November,1949, the Colonial Office said &quot;Though the WarOffice have power to post officers and men com-pulsorily for service under Colonial Governmentsthey are not prepared to make a regular practiceof this, but only to do it temporarily to preventthe breakdown of a Force through lack of volunteers.The present rates of additional pay have not beenin operation very long.   If they do not producesufficient volunteers it will be necessary to reviewthem irrespective of whether officers and men are provided by formal secondment or on loan as atpresent.&quot;2.     The Regiment is at present about 40 officersbelow strength and no officers are yet availablefor the 6th Battalion or for any further expansionbeyond that Battalion.   Special additional pay hasrecently been authorised to encourage officers to volunteer.   This additional pay, which will pre-sumably be subject to United Kingdom tax:, was authorised without&apos; reference to the federation government and there are a number of points whichare not clear.   G.H.Q. FARELF have been asked tostate how they propose to interpret the War Officeinstructions.3,     Other points which affect the position are:-(a)   Secondment or posting.   The War Office seemto have abandoned the idea of secondment,presumably because there are few if anyofficers prepared to be seconded on presentterms of service.   The Federation has alwayspressed for definite secondment terms whichwould assure the Federation of the servicesof officers for definite periods and alsoincidentally permit the introduction ofcertain obligations on the part of theofficer.   For example, before the warofficers were required to qualify in Malaywithin a given period.   There appears to beno reason why a clause should not be includedin terms of secondment to the effect thatnormal British service conditions would applyshould circumstances at any future time
necessitate the assumption of responsibilityfor the Malay Regiment by the Army Council.(b) Income Tax.   If secondment terms were re-introducedofficers would be paid directly by the federation government and liable to pay the local and notUnited Kingdom income tax.   In May, 1949, theFederation reluctantly agreed to accept theproposal that British personnel serving withthe Regiment should draw their emoluments fromBritish Army funds and should be liable topay United Kingdom income tax.(c) Housing.   Apart from the severe shortage of accommodation (Government or Army) which inany case deters officers from volunteering,there is a fundamental divergence of opinion between the War Office and the federation government as regards the housing arrangements.The Federation view is that officers should pay the Federation Government rate for the class of quarters occupied.   The Wan Officefear (quite unnecessarily in present circum-stances) that this will mean the granting ofpreferential treatment to officers and other ranks   serving with the Malay Regiment over those serving with British Regiments.   TheWar Office therefore consider that &quot;to avoidcomplications likely to arise&quot; entitlement to quarters should be based so fan as ispossible on British Army scales and rentcharged at current British Army rates forunfurnished quarters.   In practice theFederation view has been adopted.(d) Passages.   Although in the original conditionsof service put forward by the Federation Govern-ment in August, 1948, it was proposed thatBritish personnel should be granted free passagesfor themselves and their families in accordancewith regulations in force for other british army personnel serving in Malaya, the Commandanthas recently recommended that British personnelposted or seconded for service with the Regimentshould be permitted to travel to and from malaya by civilian passenger steamers.   It isunderstood that the War Office rarely grantthis privilege to officers and other ranks whowould normally travel by troop-ship because a passage by troop-ship is cheaper than one bypassenger liner.
(e) Leave.   The Federation has proposed that theGovernment leave regulations applicable toexpatriate officers should Toe applied to. British Army personnel serving with the Regiment,!The War Office is not prepared to accept this,stating that &quot;it would be detrimental to theindividual^ health if he were permitted to-  accumulate terminal leave at the expenseof his annual leave&quot;.(f) Inter-tour leave pay..   Early this year theWar Office informed G.H.Q. FARELF that officers who wished to return.*for a second tour mustrevert to the home stablishment with effect from the date of embarkation from Malaya.Prior to this ruling officers who proceededon leave between tours were retained on the- pool establishment of the Regiment.   Thispermitted them to continue to draw languagepay, additional pay, pay of temporary rankif held and, for a period of 61 days, localoverseas allowance.   Under the War Officeruling, such officers lose language pay,additional pay and local overseas allowancewith effect from the date of embarkation andmay only, as a concession, receive pay of temporary rank for 61 days from the same date.It is believed that instructions have beenissued permitting officers serving with theRWAFF to draw additional allowances during periods of inter-tour leave.
DETENTION AND REPATRIATION1.   The Federation Emergency Regulations providefor detention under two separate sections,,   UnderSection 17(1) individuals may Toe detained for aperiod not exceeding two years.   Anyone detainedunder this Section has the right to object to the detention order.   If he does so his case is con-sidered by a Committee of Review.   People detainedunder this Section may also ask for their cases tobe reviewed by the Chief Secretary after they havebeen in detention for 18 months.2.   Under Section 17D detention orders can be madecovering all the inhabitants of a stated area, or one or more of those inhabitants as may be named,if the High Commissioner believes them to be guilty of having helped the terrorists, or of having failedto disclose information to the police.   There is no right of appeal against detention orders made underthis Section.3.    Persons detained under either Section may bedeported from the Federation, provided that they arenot Federal citizens or British subjects born in malaya.4.     The numbers of persons detained under theseSections are:-Reg.17(1)   Reg. 17D     Total(a) Total number of personsdetained for more than28 days at any time since the start of theEmergency 25,641    10,118      35,759(b) Total number repatriatedto China &quot; 11,261 879      12,140(c) Total number still de-tained (December 1951)        6,341      2,263       8,604Of the 25,641 persons detained under Regulation 17(1),22,667 were Chinese, 1,753 Malays and 1,099 Indians.5. At my second meeting with the Conference of Rulerson the 16th December it was agreed that up to 5,000
detained persons might be sent to an island off thecoast of North Borneo,   It is accepted that theycannot stay in North Borneo permanently and mustultimately be re-absorbed in Malaya or repatriatedto China,   Their final disposal may cause difficulty and the establishment of camps in North Borneo willbe expensive, but it is considered necessary toaccept these disadvantages to give some satisfaction to the Malays, who have pressed strongly for theremoval from Malaya of as many Chinese as can beexpelled.   A survey team will, be sent to make thenecessary arrangements in North Borneo,6.     I have repeatedly impressed upon the authoritiesin Malaya the need for using- either Section 17(1)or Section 17D only with the greatest circumspection,I am addressing a memorandum on this, subject to theOfficer Administering the Government of the federation and shall impress upon him the great need forreleasing with the utmost speed those who, after examination, are found to be guiltless.   Section 17Dmay no doubt have to be used occasionally but it isa measure of Draconian severity and the authorities must be very sure of their ground before applyingit.
-    284APPENDIX XIIMANPOWER AND NATIONALSERVICEI append a memorandum which I have had fromthe Government of the Federation of Malaya.I am not satisfied that the present systemworks satisfactorily.   I am told that, under thefirst National Service Bill, the Police were swampedwith directed men and that the call-up was thereforestopped.   This has of course led to inexplicableanomalies and injustices.I am addressing a note to the federation government to ascertain whether my information on this is correct and whether, if more men arelikely to be called up than are required, theGovernment will consider introducing some kind ofballot.a
MEMORANDUM-1. Under the Emergency Regulations men aged 18to 23 inclusive are at present directed into theFederation Police Force.2.    Monthly requirements, based on police training facilities, have been met throughout 1951.   Therehas been a concurrent increase in the voluntary recruitment of Malays.   Prevention of widespreadevasion, chiefly by Chinese, has proved impossiblebecause registration was not introduced simultaneously in all. parts of the Federation, let alone Singapore,and because certificates of registration were notissued.3.     The scheme will run down early in 1952, when,it is estimated, 5?000 men will have been directed,including 2?5O0 Chinese, against the initial request for 6,000 (i.e. to give one Chinese in ten in the Bo lice,)4.     In concert with the Singapore Government,which has agreed that the Federation^ Comptrollerof Manpower should in war be Comptroller for Singapore,too, twin National Service Bills are now being drafted,which will provide for registration of all men aged18 to 54, and for direction for (a) Local Forces,(b) Police Force, (c) civil defence forces, (d) labour.5.    There will, be-no mention in the Bills of exemption of aliens.   This is essential since a high proportionof the Chinese population are neither British subjectsnor Federal citizens.   Exemption of aliens fromparticular types of service flows from the legislationgoverning the Forces: and similar procedures concerning,for example, U.S. citizens and Dominion subjects,will be ironed out administratively, as has been donesuccessfully over direction into the Federation police force.6.    Industry of all races has been consulted and advisory Manpower Committees set up.   They will report to the Malayan Manpower Sub-Committee, whichis also responsible for examining bids for manpower.Present information suggests that Malaya may be unable to meet Service requirements for Europeanofficers, skilled men and technicians.7.   The new legislation will be introduced into the legislatures early in 1952 and the machine tested
over two age groups, to meet requirements in theFederation for further police and in Singapore forthe Local Forces,80    Major legislative difficulties which mayhe possible or solution only by Defence Regulationsare (a) direction in one territory for service in the. other and (b) direction into His MajestyfsForces otherwise than by the expedient of initialdirection into the Local Forces.9.     The major practical difficulty is preventionof evasion,   It would become minor with Chineseco-operation, which the Chinese allege would be forthcoming if (a) police pay was increased and(b) after completion of service a directed manautomatically became a Federal citizen0
Tax Evasion1.     There is widespread evasion of income tax in malaya, mainly because of the peculiarities of Chineseaccounting and book-keeping and of the shortage of expert income tax staff.   The main burden of.taxationtherefore falls&apos; upon the European commercial and official community and the Chinese pay far less than their due share.   The result is that the whole systemof taxation is in danger of being brought into comtempt.The political dangers of this are obvious.2.    It is estimated that at least 20$ of trading profitsescape tax by reason of deliberate evasion,and thefigure may well be much higher.&apos;3,     Evasion by the Chinese is roughly of two types:-(1)   The simple type, which probably includes90$of Chinese traders.   Here the trader, whoprobably does not know his actual profit,under-states his income without any deliberateintention to defraud.   His conception of income is what is left after he has lived outof his business.(2)   The second type of evader is the wealthierChinese trader.   This type, with an income of anything over  6,000 a year, practisesdeliberate evasion of a kind most difficultto detect.4.     The only way of dealing with the latter type is tohave a staff of qualified experts engaged full-time onthe investigation of these complex cases.   Successfulprosecutions would no doubt have a salutary effect on other persons engaged in similar malpractices, butthorough investigation of the affairs of such a tax-payer may extend over many months.   At present, there&apos;seems very little prospect of engaging permanent officers for this work but a start could be made by sending asmall team of experts to Malaya for long enough to give such advice as would make it possible to bring two orthree exemplary prosecutions.   The formation of such ateam is now being taken up urgently with the treasury and the Board of Inland Revenue.
FINANCIAL DEVOLUTION1*    Under the Federation of Malaya Agreementof 1948 there is already considerable financialdevolution by the Federal Government to StateGovernments,   This is accompanied by annual blockgrants from Federal revenue,2*    Further devolution of financial responsibility to local authorities would, however, help inthe prosecution of the campaign against the banditsand at my request arrangements for it are now being examined by the Federation Government,
EXTENSION OF SERVICE BEYOND RETIRING AGE.     ...1.     The age at which an officer in government service is required to retire is 55 years.   Thereare probably a number of competent officers who wouldbe willing to continue to serve beyond that age andwho would still be sufficiently fit and active todo good work.2.    The Federation Government has been asked toexamine the possibility of encouraging selected officers to continue to serve after they have reached the ageof compulsory retirement.3.     I have also asked the Federation Governmentto comb out of office jobs as many trained and experienced officers as possible for work&quot;on the ground&quot;.
