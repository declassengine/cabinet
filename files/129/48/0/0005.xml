23JilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF- HIS BRITANNIC MA;ESTY*S-GOVERNMENT)secret.(51) 5 - COPY NO.  n3RD NOVEMBER, 1951CABINETCOALNote by the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and Power ^I attach a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Powerabout the dangers facing us on coal this winter.    As we feared, andas is now evident, we have been left a most difficult legacy throughthe neglect to build up coal stocks during the summer to a reasonablysafe level.    At the present level there is a.definite possibility of failure this winter to meet coal requirements over the whole field.More especially on the present level of house coal stocks there is,I am afraid, a certainty of a breakdown in supplies to the publicunless urgent measures are taken to import coal.I consider that it should be possible to arrange even at thislate date for an import of \ million tons.    I recommend that thisshould be done.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,-      3RD NOVEMBER, 1951.
Memorandum by the Minister bf Fuel and Power .The coal situation facing us this winter is exceedingly grave,2,&apos; I am advisecTTihat the minimum safe level of coal stocks is 19million tons at the end of the coal summer, that is, at 31st October, butthe stock level is now only about 17 million tons..   This level is.rather^-higher than last year&apos;s but last year&apos;s level was much too lowland,   - .although we were spared a really severe winter/disaster was only justavoided by -  &apos;      . .     -     &amp;(a) cutting^exports durjng the winter by 3 million tons,(b) importing over 1 million tons of coal from the United Statesand(c) a quite exceptional last-minute effort from the miners.Moreover inland consumption is still rising.    So far this year it hasbeen 6. 34 million tons more than last year.3. Coal exports are now so low that we can expect no appreciablehelp from a further reduction..   On the other hand, I find that practicallynothing has been done to secure imports of coal.    Apart from the smallcontribution from India there is at present nothing in sight, although Iunderstand that the National Coal Board and my Ministry have throughoutthe summer been urging that American coal should be obtained.4. The situation is particularly dangerous on &quot;house coal&quot;, i. e.the larger sizes needed by householders.    The coal merchants beganlast winter with over 2 million tons in stock, and even at that level therewas a serious shortage of coal before the end of the winter.    Duringlast January and February many people were unable for weeks on end toget any coal at all.5. In spite of warnings from both the Merchants1 Federation andthe Domestic Coal Consumers&apos; Council that action should be taken tobuild up stocks, the merchants&apos; stocks of house coal amount now only to just over 1 million tons, that is, half last year&apos;s inadequate level.    It is certain that unless vigorous measures are taken immediately there willbe a breakdown of supplies after Christmas, although more coal hasbeen delivered to householders this summer.   -6. Industry is at present reasonably well stocked with coal, and Ipropose in the coming weeks to transfer some of the industrial coal to domestic consumers.    I would let industry have from 90% to 95% ofits full requirements and factories should be able to get by on this, butthere may be some slight dislocation.    Unfortunately, industrial coalbeing mainly in small sizes (&quot;slack&quot;) is not really suitable for use by itself in the ordinary domestic fire grate, and in addition, inland transport difficulties are likely to limit the quantity that can be thustransferred in the next few months to about ^ million tons,7, This will not nearly bridge the gap and, if the house coal situation is to be saved, we must obtain coal from the United States.This ought to have been done during the summer, for had the importsbeen started then the shipping and other difficulties would riot have been so serious as they must be now.
8, I recommend that without delay we should authorise theNational Coal Board to purchase all the American coal that can beobtained and transported between now and the end of March,    I realise that difficulties will arise both on shipping and on interferencewith other import programmes, and that it may not be feasible at thislate date to arrange for an import of more than f million tons, .9. Under present arrangements, our need to import Americancoal has to be reported to the Organisation for European economic co-operation; any bid for the first quarter of 1952 is due to be madeon Monday, 5th November,    I recommend that we should ask for\ million tons.    Imports at this level might just see us through pro-vided conditions during the winter are not unduly difficult.G.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,3RD NOVEMBER, 1951.
