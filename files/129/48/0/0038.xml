confidential (51) 38blh December, 1951Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1951Copy No. 2 2CABINETCOUNSELLORS OF STATENote by-the Lord chancellor the King has informed the Prime Minister that he hopes to go abroad for about eight weeks next Spring. If he does so, it will be necessary to appointCounsellors of State to act. in his absence. The only persons qualified by the regency Act, 1937, to be appointed Counsellors of State are The Queen, PrincessElizabeth, Princess Margaret, the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess Royal. Atthe time of The King&apos;s proposed absence Princess Elizabeth will be on her Common-wealth tour, and The King will naturally wish The Queen and Princess Margaretto accompany him. It follows that of those qualified to be appointed Counsellorsof State only the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess Royal will be in the UnitedKingdom. There is some doubt whether the functions delegated under the RegencyAct can be exercised by one only of the persons appointed to be Counsellors ofState, and I have reached the conclusion that, unless the doubt were removed by legislation, it would be unsafe to assume that they can. If only two Counsellorsof State were appointed, there would therefore be a risk that by the incapacityof one of them the conduct of business would be impeded.I have discussed this matter with the Lord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary,the Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland. It may be suggested that the difficulties I have outlined could be met by reconstituting theCouncil of State in its old form, under which the Great Officers of State, such asthe Archbishop of Canterbury, could be appointed Counsellors. But the Common-wealth Secretary is sure that the other Commonwealth countries would take&apos; thei strongest exception to the transaction of their affairs by anyone other than a royal Counsellor, and in our view this objection is conclusive.I We do not think it desirable to provide by amending legislation for the exerciseof delegated functions by one Counsellor only. The difficulty can therefore bemet only by legislation directed to increasing the number of persons qualified toact as Counsellors This v/ould be short and of a non-controversial kind. An Actqualifying Queen Mary for the period The King is away would meet both these requirements: moreover, We can think of no other course likely to give such livelysatisfaction to His Majesty&apos;s subjects both here and overseas. It should be possibleto pass an Act of this sort through both Houses of Parliament within one day.The Commonwealth Secretary would inform the other Commonwealth Govern-Mts by telegram at the time the legislation was introduced: he considers thatit would not be necessary to consult them beforehand. It follows that a finaldecision about introducing amending legislation need not be taken until a week or so before the Easter Recess. We consider that there would be advantage indeferring the decision until then, since in view of Queen Mary&apos;s age we cannot be certain that she will continue in good enough health to act as a Counsellor of State.K we find that she is unable to do so we shall have to reconsider the whole matter.1 There will still be time to introduce some other form of amending legislation if that course is thought best. ...    .1     I invite the Cabinet to endorse our view that the position should be reviewed1 shortly before the Easter Recess, and that until then no action need be taken.I     lord Chancellors Office,. S.W.1, .6th December, 1951.41543
