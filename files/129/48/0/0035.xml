CABINETEGYPTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum on egypt which has been prepared by an interdepartmental working party.2. This memorandum will be referred to in a Cabinet Paper on policy towardsEgypt which I shall shortly circulate.;    /.... &apos;    A. E.   -Foreign Office, SWA,3rd December, 1951..     ANNEX .EGYPTCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE official working party . An official Working Party has considered the implications of economic sanctions by the United Kingdom against Egypt and vice versa. Its conclusions and recommendations are as follows:  ConclusionsAdvantages of Anglo-Egyptian trade . The economies of the United Kingdom and Egypt are largely comple-mentary. The maintenance of good relations is therefore of great mutual advantage and the results of a breach could be extremely grave for both sides. At present, theUnited Kingdom secures - &quot;      .     -(a) supplies of sterling cotton essential for the export trade, particularly dollarmarkets, and for the maintenance of employment. The type of cottonproduced in Egypt is unobtainable elsewhere, except in the Sudan,where the size of the crop cannot be relied on (* paragraphs 1.1 and 12);(b) a ready market both in the short and long terms for a wide range of exports, including a fair proportion of consumer goods, which it isimportant to preserve - from -German and Japanese competition. 1      (* paragraphs 9 and 10);(c) the advantages resulting from Egypt&apos;s wide use of sterling (* paragraph 29).* Paragraph references are to the Working Party&apos;s memorandum printed below..41526    .. B
Egypt secures (a) the right, which is of imrnense value to her, to use sterling freely in hertrade with most other countries (* paragraph 28);(b) the right to pay sterling for a quantity of dollar oil (* paragraph 8 (iii) (b).);\c) an assured market for about a quarter of her cotton exports, which she would find it difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to place else-where (* paragraph 26 (i));(d) assurance of the regular release of the sterling balances she acquired duringthe war (* paragraph 8 (iii) (a)).Principal Sanctions on Either Side3. The crucial economic sanctions which might be imposed are (a) on theEgyptian side, the denial of cotton to the United Kingdom, and (b) on the UnitedKingdom side, the denial of oil (which is the quickest operating and most widelyfelt of the sanctions at our disposal) and severe restrictions on Egypt&apos;s use of sterling. Neither side can therefore expect with impunity to introduce extrememeasures.4. The Egyptians could at present take serious action against the Sudan in thefinancial field, but the risks which they themselves would run of losing influence inthe Sudan and of retaliation by His Majesty&apos;s Government in consequence wouldprobably be sufficient to deter them from doing so (* paragraphs 15-18).5. It is unlikely that the Egyptians will use overt interference in theadministration of the Suez Canal Company as a weapon against His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Non-co-operation is already causing interruption to traffic whichcould lead to serious economic difficulties both for the United Kingdom and othercountries (* paragraphs 19-25).Effects of Sanctions6. The loss of cotton from, and exports to, Egypt would cause considerable damage to the United Kingdom&apos;s economy. As for the Egyptian economy, itwould be thrown into hopeless confusion if extreme economic sanctions were imposed for more than a short period. It is not, therefore, in our interest to imposesuch sanctions unless we can rely upon them to produce quick and satisfactorypolitical results. Injudiciously applied, they may only serve to strengthen theposition of the present Egyptian Government (* paragraph 3) and so have precisely the opposite effect.7. Imposition of the sanctions would also entail wider consequences, mainly of long-term significance: -&quot;(a) While His Majesty&apos;s Government have previously found it necessary to employ economic measures for defensive purposes only, as in the caseof Persia, they have not yet used this weapon for punitive purposes. Todo so would represent an important departure in policy.ib) The efficacy of our financial sanctions against Egypt would be much increased if they included measures which interfered with Indian tradewith Egypt. But such action would undoubtedly have an adverse effecton Anglo-Indian relations of considerable long-term significance. this consideration also applies, though in a smaller degree, to Egyptiantrade with other countries.recommendations.   It is therefore recommended  .(a) &quot;that, before any economic sanctions are applied to Egypt, the decision todo so should be reviewed by His Majesty&apos;s. Government in the light ofthe above facts; .(b) that, until then, we should avoid any action, whether in the Canal Zone,... .     the remainder of Egypt,-or the Sudan, which might be sufficient to.     provoke the Egyptians on their side to begin economic sanctions. Suchaction includes the imposition of oil sanctions, on which Ministers may;  wish to discuss existing instructions (* paragraph 27 (a)) with the Chiefs. of. Staff in the light of this report.* Paragraph references are to the Working Party*s memorandum printed below.
MEMORANDUM BY THE OFFICIAL WORKING party .-Purpose of the paper. To consider the implications of economic sanctions by the United Kingdomagainst Egypt and vice versa. .-----II,-Present Political Situation and  His Majesty&apos;s Governments  Attitudetowards: (A) Egypt and the Canal; (B) The Sudan.    (A) Egypt and the Canal :* *2. His Majesty&apos;s Governments ultimate policy in Egypt is to reach anagreement with an Egyptian Government which will enable us to keep in Egypt anoperative base to serve the Middle East Command. It seems unlikely that thepresent Government can ever retrace its steps so far as to be in a position to peacha reasonable settlement with us. The aim is, therefore, to work for a change ofGovernment, or at least for changes in the present Government.3. Meanwhile, the initiative must not be lost to the Egyptians. This means that we must firmly maintain the position of our forces in the Canal Zone, and leavethe Egyptians in no doubt of our determination to do so. At the present time,however, drastic action against the Egyptians which goes beyond this purpose mayonly serve to defeat it, by consolidating Egyptian opinion behind the Governmentand by-alienating friendly countries, especially the United States.4. For these reasons, apart from economic or financial considerations, it isthe present intention to avoid any action which might lead to widespreaddisturbances in the Delta towns and eventually force us to reoccupy the Delta. Itis necessary, however, to be prepared from time to time to take such measures asmay (a) cause the Egyptians to refrain from giving us trouble (by making themacutely aware of what we could do if were were so minded), and (b) discredit theEgyptian Government in the eyes of the people. Moreover, it may even benecessary to consider the use of sanctions at the right moment, to push over theEgyptian Government. We should avoid any action likely to alienate either theKing, on whom we must count to use his influence to bring about a Governmentdisposed to seek a settlement with us, or the Egyptian armed forces.(B) The Sudan3. His Majesty&apos;s Governments basic policy in the Sudan is to build up astrong and stable system of government, and ultimately to transfer power to aGovernment friendly to this country. Until this can be done His Majesty\s Govern-ment must maintain their controlling interest in the Sudan, which is derived fromthe Condominium Agreement of 1899. Since we must retain Sudanese goodwill,arid since this will only be possible if the programme of self-government is considerably accelerated, it.seems likely that it will be necessary to bring into force,before the end of 1952, a Constitution according a very large measure of self-govern-ment to the country. Arrangements for working out this Constitution are in hand.6. Once the Sudan has achieved full self-government, it is the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that they should be free to decide their future status,i.e., whether or not they should be associated in some way with Egypt or theBritish Commonwealth.7. In pursuance of this policy the Governor-General has declared his intention to accelerate the advance of the Sudan towards self-government, andreaffirmed the right of the Sudanese people ultimately to determine their future status. His Majesty&apos;s Government have in recent statements indicated their support for the Gpvernor-General&apos;s declaration.HI.-Existing Financial and Trade Arrangements8.  Financial-Om existing financial arrangements with Egypt are:  (i) A Sterling Payments Agreement expiring on 31st December, 1951, andsubject to renewal by agreement, providing that trade between Egyptarid the sterling area shall be carried on in sterling.\     (ii) An arrangement under which Egypt became a member of the TransferableV Account Area, i.e., one of the countries who with our agreement andA subject to certain obligations conduct trade in sterling.   Under anV Exchange of Letters attached to the Sterling Payments Agreement Egypt\ 41526   &apos; . - b 2 &apos;
has been given assurances that we will facilitate the widest possible useof her sterling. The value to her of membership of the TransferableAccount Area is shown by the volume of her transactions in the area which amount to at least  100 million a year,(iii) A Sterling Releases Agreement, which was signed on 1st July, 1951, inaccordance with the general policy of making arrangements for the;: controlled release, over a period of years, of the sterling balances whichhad been blocked after the war. The main provisions of the Agreement...&quot; were:-(a) the release in 1951 of the sum of  25 million against which theUnited Kingdom made available  14 million worth of UnitedStates dollars, followed by the release of  10-15 million in eachof the 9 years 1952 to 1960.(b) An arrangement under which Egypt pays in sterling for supplies ofpetroleum products up to a total of  11 million a year, whether.     from British or American Companies, in each of the 10 years----        1951 to 1960. This is a purely financial arrangement and doesnot guarantee to Egypt any physical supplies of oil.9. Trade. United Kingdom trade with Egypt is based on mutual requirements,the United Kingdom purchasing large quantities of Egyptian cotton from each cropand Egypt purchasing annually capital and consumer goods of United Kingdommanufacture for the needs of her expanding economy. We have no trade agreementwith Egypt and no import licensing restrictions are placed by Egypt on the entry of goods from the sterling and transferable account areas. We buy Egyptian cottonin the open market in competition with other consumers&apos;: but apart from cottonwe purchase very little except onions.10. In the export field the United Kingdom has long-established trade con-connections with the Egyptian market, but since the war the ultra-nationalisticcharacter of successive Egyptian Governments has made the position of british firms established in Egypt very difficult. The pattern of our export trade with egypt (other than oil) is fairly evenly distributed over the whole range of Britishmanufactures, machinery, vehicles and woollen goods being the largest items.United Kingdom exporters have close links with Egypt since they supply about20 per cent, of Egypt&apos;s total imports. Payments so far have presented little difficulty and shipping facilities are reasonably good. United Kingdom exports to Egypthave steadily expanded since the.war from  22 million in 1947 to  42-5 million in1950. It should be noted that under present circumstances some tightening of theExport Credit Guarantee Departments terms for cover for Egypt may be necessaryin the near future. Although any decision made by the advisory council of theDepartment to refuse or curtail credit for Egypt would stem from commercial considerations, the impression might be gained in Egypt that such restrictions were a form of sanctions.  This, however, seems unavoidable.iy. Importance to United Kingdom of Egyptian Cotton11. The United Kingdom is Egypfs best customer for cotton, buying about25 per cent, of each year&apos;s exports. Since payments are made in sterling, and egyptian cotton is of high quality (the only other source of supply of comparablegrades being the Sudan) the volume of our purchases has been maintained in spiteof the high prices which have ruled in Egypt&apos;s cotton market since 1948. about one-third (i.e., some 140,000 tons) of the United Kingdom&apos;s total import programme(480,000 tons) of raw cotton comes from Egypt and the Sudan. There is very littlescope for the replacement of these cottons which are medium.and long staplegrowths used for the fine cloths which form the bulk of our exports to the UnitedStates. If, indeed, supplies from both Egypt and the Sudan were to be cut offcompletely there would, after a period, be unemployment in Lancashire, particu-larly in the Bolton area. The Egyptian cottons which make up nearly two-thirds of Lancashire^ normal consumption of &quot; Egyptian &quot; types are just beginning tocome on to the market, and the Raw Cotton Commission^ stocks of eygptian cotton are therefore at their lowest point for the year (although in fact they arerather above the normal level for this point in the season). On the other hand, the sudanese crop for 1951, which was an abnormally good one, has just finishedmoving and the Raw Cotton Commission is therefore holding relatively heavystocks of Sudanese growths.
12. If the import of Egyptian cotton were suddenly to cease the Raw cotton commission^ stocks, except of certain types needed by the hosiery industry, wouldprobably suffice to meet the industry&apos;s requirements until the end of the year (1951).Provided supplies were still forthcoming from the 1952 Sudan crop it should bepossible to keep the industry running without further purchases of Egyptian cottonfor a further three to six months, i.e., till the middle of 1952. Towards the end ofthis period (Le., in the second quarter of 1952) there would certainly be loss of quality and to some extent of quantity of output. Thereafter unemployment wouldbe unavoidable, its extent depending on the size of the next Sudanese crop (atpresent expected to be low) and the proportion of it which the Raw cotton commission were able to secure. -13. The sterling area requirements of Egyptian cotton are small, with,however, the significant exception of India, which takes about 16 per cent, of the crop. -V-Forecast of Sterling Area Balance of Payments with Egypt, 1951-5214. An attempt has been made in the Appendix to forecast the balance ofpayments of the sterling area with Egypt in the period July 1951 to June 1952 onthe assumption that trade proceeds normally. On the more dubious items thebalance has perhaps been tipped in our favour. This would suggest a smallidentified sterling area deficit (about  1 million) with Egypt in the second half of1951, followed by small surplus (about  3- 4 million) in the first half of 1952.Taking account of advance payments, it is expected that about  21 million UnitedKingdom payments for cotton will have been made by the end of December,leaving  14 million in the first half of next year. Total Egyptian sterling balancesat 30th June; 1951, were  287 million ( 242 million at 30th September) and areexpected to be about  250 million at the end of this year and to fall to some  230million by 30th June, 1952. The principal factors expected to cause this large fallnotwithstanding the small identified sterling area surplus on current account for1951-52 are the sale of some  17 million of dollars to Egypt in the second half ofthis year for sterling and net Egyptian transfers to third countries forecast in1951-52 at  40 million.VI-Sudanese-Egyptian Financial Problems15. There are certain financial problems affecting the Sudan which maywell have an important influence on the relations of the Sudan and of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with Egypt.16.  The two most important points are:  (a) The Sudan uses Egyptian currency, of which some  E. 16 million isbelieved to be in circulation at the present time.(b) The Sudanese sterling balances are held in a London Account of theNational Bank of Egypt which appears at the moment to be in a positionto transfer to Egyptian Account some  29 million of the Sudanese totalsterling holdings (most of the remainder being in the form of securities),without the prior knowledge of the Bank of England, or, indeed, theSudan Government. So unwarranted and fraudulent a step would normally be unthinkable. It is just conceivable, however, that theNational Bank of Egypt which, haying recently been nationalised, is nowsubject to overriding political control, might be compelled to effect thetransfer. The position would then be that the Sudan would be entitledto hold about  E. 29 million in Egyptian currency instead of the equivalent amount of transferable sterling in London.17. Ways and means of frustrating any Egyptian intentions in this field arealready under urgent consideration with the Sudan Government. The Sudanwould prefer to do no more than arrange, as a precautionary measure, for a gradualchangeover of their balances from the National Bank of Egypt to a British Bank;but as a reply to drastic action by Egypt there are further measures which could betaken e.g., the temporary exclusion of the Sudan from the transferable accountarea! It seems unlikely, however, that the Egyptian Government would wish tointerfere with the Sudanese sterling balances at the present time since such a step--(i) might well provoke retaliatory financial measures by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment;41526 &apos; b 3 .
/- &apos;       *.(ii) would lead to Sudanese loss of confidence in Egypt as the custodian oftheir resources and might even lead to the introduction of a new,non-Egyptian currency in the Sudan;(Hi) might provoke the Sudan Government to interfere with Egypfs supplyof Nile water.18. From the Sudan&apos;s point of view a change of currency has for some time been-desirable on the general ground that they should not remain dependent on a currency over the management of which they have no control. The replacement \of Egyptian currency would, however, be so important a move that it is unlikely to be&quot;taken except on political grounds. In considering such a measure the UnitedKingdom and Sudan Governments will need to bear in mind:  (a) The possible refusal of the Egyptians to redeem the disused currency andthe consequent need to provide cover for the new currency.(b) The dangers of taking any such step before it has ensured&apos; the safety of itssterling resources. &quot;(c) The improbability that the Egyptians would wish, for political reasons, to restrict the supplies of Egyptian currency to the Sudan.(d) The impossibility of introducing a new currency, even in the form of a noteissue only, for nine months at least.Haang regard to all the circumstances, it would seem unlikely that either the Sudan or Egypt would wish to make any move in the near future which would provoke major action by the other side or by His Majesty&apos;s Government in thefinancial sphere.VII. Suez Canal Company and Shipping in the Canal19. The Suez Canal Company, although administered from Paris, is registered in Egypt. As the chief users of the Canal we are vitally concerned with its adminis-tration and therefore with the future of the present company and the problem of a successor organisation. Nationalisation of the company would be intolerable asit would mean submitting the administration of the Canal to Egyptian politics.There is not at the moment, however, any indication that the Egyptian Governmenthave in mind to take any action aimed at the status of the company: they do notappear to have any idea of denying that the Canal is an international waterwayand that the first duty of the Canal Compny is to keep it open.20. They have, so far, made no attempt to issue direct instructions to thecompany. They might eventually instruct the company to withhold all assistancefrom British shipping attempting to pass through the Canal customs facilities havealready been withheld from ships carrying War Department cargo. It is true thatif the company ignored any such instructions this might prejudice their positionin Egypt in the future; but up to the present the company have taken the line thatit is their function to keep traffic moving without discrimination as to flag. In anycase, in the unlikely event of the company feeling bound to accede, at leasttemporarily, to the Egyptian demands, the Royal Navy could handle the british ships.21. It is not considered likely that Egyptians will endeavour to embarrass the United Kingdom by insisting on special arrangements for payments of canal dues by United Kingdom shipping. To dollar-invoice the United Kingdom alone would be discriminatory and contrary to the terms of the Concession: and the egyptians are no more likely to try to compel a policy of universal dollar-invoicingthan to close the Canal, since the interests of so many nations would be involved.22. But the Egyptian Government can exercise and are exercising a far more effective sanction than any direct instructions to the company, by encouraging thewithdrawal of Egyptian labour working for the British in any way, including theservicing of British ships. Intimidation has been used to stimulate the patriotismof the Egyptian worker and the Egyptian Government have also made it clearthat if the company appealed for help in the event of insufficient labour to run the canal they would get no response. In fact, the running of the Canal has alreadybeen seriously disorganised by strikes and withdrawal of intimidated labour. TheRoyal Navy have been forced to assist in the berthing of ships, of all nationalities,and to organise transit of the Canal by convoys, one each way on alternate days.
The lines have been obliged to cease accepting cargo for discharge at Canal portsas there is so little surety of labour to handle it and all War Department cargo hasto be handled by the Services. For the same reasons ships can no longer be sure of ge^jng stores, water or bunkers. ..23.  So far the resultant shipping delays have not been too serious, being,on the whole, not more than 24^hours; but ^creasing labour troubles could easily ,leadI to delays of the utmost seriousness.:m -J &apos;.      ; .24. They would be particularly grave in the case of tankers. Nearly three-quarters of the north bound cargo in the Suez Canal is petroleum and most of itis crude oil for&quot; European refineries. These refineries now supply the- bulk? of western Europe&apos;s requirements for inland consumption; and ;are-dependent as tosome eighty per cent, of their capacity on crude oil irorri the Middle East. Theyare, moreover, at present being stretched beyond their rated capacity to fill the gap created by the loss of Abadan. If tanker traffic in the Canal were seriouslyslowed down, not only would supplies of petroleum products to European marketsbe disorganised, but the balance of payments might also be affected. While presentdelays in clearing the Canal are not yet causing dislocation at refineries, they maywell do so if they become worse. If the present tanker traffic had to be divertedfor any extended period, an additional 240 15,000-ton tankers, equivalent to 15-20 .per cent, of the world tanker fleet, would be required. Under present conditionswhen world tanker tonnage is fully employed there is no possibility of obtaining the bulk of the 240 tankers required and such small proportion as could be charteredcould only be obtained at very high dollar rates.25. In adopting the policy they have done over Egyptian labour in the canal zone the Egyptian Government have in fact put into operation an economicsanction. The exertions of the Services, and a certain influx of labour from Cyprus,for the moment are keeping shipping moving. But there is a very real possibility that continuing withdrawal of Egyptian labour, combined with terrorist activitiesagainst shipping companies&apos; staffs and their families or the withdrawal of residents&apos;permits from European employees, may make it necessary, if shipping is not to bebrought to a standstill, to take over the whole administration of the Canal as amilitary operation, and to set up an emergency organisation to assist the Navy in handling the transitting of ships of all flags.VIII.-Action Open to Egypt26. So far the Egyptians have confined themselves mainly to measures (e.g.,non-co-operation) directed against His Majesty&apos;s Armed Forces in Egypt. But therehave lately been threats of official measures in a wider field (e.g., the dismissal ofBritish technicians) and of &quot; spontaneous &quot; unofficial moves, which might well be just as important (e.g., the public boycotting of British goods). Should the positiondeteriorate further the following measures would be open to the Egyptian Govern-ment as overt means of bringing pressure to bear on the United Kingdom:; (i) Egypt might refuse to allow the export of cotton to the United Kingdom(see paragraph IV above), or refuse to allow its sale to us except for united States dollars. Such a measure would have repercussions for egypt herself, i.e., in falling cotton prices and consequent public dis-content and, perhaps, in adding to the existing strain on the EgyptianTreasury, which might be called upon to buy up the crop. The problemfacing Egypt of finding other, markets for about one-quarter of hercotton exports wpuld however probably not be insurmountable, as itis likely that there would be a sufficient demand from Europe and India.Prices would however fall and there would be a considerable loss to theEgyptian balance of payments. If the United Kingdom retaliated by imposing financial restrictions and thereby prevented Egypt fromreceiving sterling in payment for her exports Egypt would be driven to dispose of her cotton as best she could, perhaps on a barter basis. Inview of the demand for non-dollar cotton she would probably be suc-cessful in the long rurt, but she would certainly encounter great difficul-ties in effecting a complete change-over from sterling to barter.Particular difficulty would for instance arise in the case of India, which takes about  20 million worth of cotton and exports only some  6 million
of goods. An important long-term effect of an interruption in Egyptscotton trade is that she might increase cereal production in order tomake herself self-sufficient in food supply at the expense of her cotton* acreage.(ii) Egypt might institute a boycott on United Kingdom goods.  We allocatedsome 2,500 tons of tinplate and 37,000 tons of coal to Egypt in 1951, but apart from these Egypt receives no special consideration as a market for United Kingdom goods, but the market is favoured by exporters andthe loss of it would be a serious blow to our export drive. Any inter-- ference with normal trade would allow continental and japanese competition full play and make it difficult for us to recover our pre-&apos;dominant place in the market. It would in addition produce a seriousinbalance in our balance of payments with Egypt.(iii) Egypt might cancel residence visas for United kingdom commercial-personnel. There is a fairly large British commercial community in thecountry and its disappearance would be serious for our establishedtrade. In particular British shipping organisations in the Canal portswould be paralysed if residence visas were withdrawn, forcing shipping companies&apos; European staffs to leave the country.(iv) The Egyptians might take discriminatory action against United kingdom interests in Egypt (e.g., Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd., and Britishfinancial institutions and commercial houses). Such action might takea number of forms, and in view of the extent of British investment inEgypt might be most serious in. both the short and longer terms.IX.-^Action Open to the United KingdomOil and Trade27. (a) The military authorities have already for a period partially enforcedthe physical sanction of the denial of oil, but this sanction has been liftedsince 6th November when their authority to apply it was temporarilyrescinded. This particular sanction would fall on all sections of thepopulation and particularly on the poorer classes who would thus be deprived of Kerosene, their essential fuel. If the sanction includedaviation spirit, the effect would also fall on international air servicesstaging through Cairo, unless means could be found of maintainingexceptionally the supply of aviation spirit to the air ports. Twenty-three. foreign air lines would be affected and revenues of the order of 2 million per annum would be lost to British aviation.(b).We could refuse to allow British companies to sell oil to Egypt. This would deprive the Egyptians of possibly two-thirds of their requirements of oil,and even if they were prepared to spend dollars to fill the gap, it is not certain that American companies would have sufficient oil available.It must, however, be borne in mind in this connexion that the Egyptiansmight make the position of the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd. (the Shellsubsidiary, which is already experiencing great difficulties at the handsof the Egyptian Government) quite intolerable if we were to interferewith oil supplies. The British investment in the Egyptian oil industryamounts to some  35-40 million. There is a danger that oil sanctionsmay provoke Egypt to nationalise those valuable assets:(c) We could prevent the export to Egypt of scarce goods (e.g., steel, tinplateand coal), or even place a general embargo on exports: but the first-. course would damage the Egyptian economy only slightly, and thesecond would probably cause more harm to us than to Egypt.Financial28. Apart from the withholding of oil supplies His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsbiggest weapons are financial. We might take any of, or a combination of, thefollowing steps: (a) The suspension of the Sterling Releases Agreement, which the Egyptiansvalue highly, both because of the releases themselves and the petroleum products article.(b) The removal of Egypt from the Transferable Account Area, which would.  involve a breach of the undertakings attached to the Sterling Payments
Agreement. These undertakings, however, will expire on 31st Decem-- ber, 1951, unless renewed by agreement between, ourselves and the-Egyptians. This would leave her free to trade in sterling with the sterling area, but would mean that sterling transfers to and from othercountries would become subject to the permission of the Bank ofEngland.(c) If we then refused to allow Egypt to use sterling in making payments eitherto or from third countries it would create grave difficulties for her.She would have to fall back on barter, or renegotiate all her PaymentsAgreements in order to find an acceptable means of settlement otherthan sterling. The measure of the difficulties in which Egypt would findherself is shown by the fact that in 1950 inward transfers amounted to 38 million and outward transfers to  67 million. In 1951 the differencemay reach  40 million.(*/) We might make a Statutory Order, the effect of which would be to subjectall Egyptian payments, including payments to and from the sterling area,to Bank of England permission. By withholding permission for certainpayments, to or from the sterling area, we could intensify the difficulties for Egypt outlined above.(e) We might take the extreme step of blocking Egypt&apos;s No. 1 Accounts (her&quot;free&quot; sterling), which would prevent Egypt from making or receivingany payments in sterling whatsoever. -: 29. The imposition of any of these sanctions would provoke counter measureson the Egyptian side. It must be borne in mind that these measures could haveharmful effects on ourselves and other purchasers of Egyptian cotton, and inparticular might have a deleterious effect (a) on our relation with India, (b) on thestanding of sterling as an international currency. Moreover, once we had takenthese steps Egypt might never again be a willing holder or user of sterling, and diffi-culties over our purchases of cotton might well be perpetuated. Finally, a ban ontransfers of sterling from third countries to Egypt might have a serious direct effecton the United Kingdom balance of payments with E.P.U., while a ban on transfersfrom Egypt could affect all United Kingdom exports by, for example, deprivingChile of an important proportion of her sterling earnings.X-Political Effects in Egypt30.&quot; &quot;The impact of such financial and economic measures as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may take against Egypt will, with the important exception of oilsanctions, at first fall mainly upon the upper and middle classes. These people are for the most part more concerned with their own pockets than with feelings ofpatriotism; and would probably exert considerable political pressure in favour of asettlement with His Majesty&apos;s Government if they thought that sanctions of thiskind would otherwise be imposed. Once they had been imposed, however, it wouldnot be long before the country was thrown into a state of considerable economicdisorganisation, which would cause appreciable unemployment, and so affect the poor more directly. The Egyptian Government would cash in on the resultingdiscontent and would probably on balance be strengthened in power. The imposition-tion of oil sanctions, which have a direct effect upon all sections of the popu-lation, would produce a similar result in a very short time. Only complete economicdisintegration of the country would then be likely to bring about the downfall of theGovernment.
