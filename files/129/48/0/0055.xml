-  DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OF I-I4S BRITANNIC MAi; ES T Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(51) 55----- COPY NO. ^ ft19TH DECEMBER. 1951&apos;     CA3IHETRURAL ELECTRIFICATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesI must bring to the notice of mv colleagues the adverse effectsthat v/ill certainly follow if the proposal by the Chancellor inC.(51) 52 to suspend all rural electrification is accepted.The decision in this sense which was taken by the previous government was not publicly announced but its existence became knownas the result of a circular from the British Electricity Authority to area Boards and it was the subject of much adverse comment in the farming Press.As soon as I took office I received written representations fromthe President of the National Farmers&apos; Union protesting strongly, in theinterests of food production, against the unfairness of selecting rural areas for special restrictions.   He has since reinforced these representations in an interview with me.   I am convinced that dis-crimination against agriculture will have adverse repercussions uponagricultural production and the most unfortunate psychological effectsupon the farming community at a time when we want them to make freshefforts to increase our supplies of food in the face of many difficulties.While I quite recognise that the general state of our resourcesis bound to limit severely the amount of rural electrification that will bepossible over the next few years I would urge my colleagues to agreethat some new work may proceed in rural areas and that the AreaElectricity Boards be given the necessary discretion.   I also ask for authority to inform the agricultural industry at the appropriate time that the discrimination of our predecessors against rural areas will not be endorsed by this Government.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 5. W. 1.,. 19TH DECEMBER, 1951.. V. &apos; &quot;
