Plan for the economic development of South and South-East Asia. The Planoriginally took shape at the meeting of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers in January1950. Detailed plans for development were worked out by the commonwealth countries in the area at a meeting in London in September 1950, and are now. being actively carried out.2. It is important in the struggle of ideas in Asia to persuade the people ofthe region that their true interests are best served by continued association with thefree world. To this end it is necessary, amongst other things, to convince them thatthe Western Powers are sincerely and actively interested in helping them to improve their living standards, and the Colombo Plan has been our main effort in thisdirection. The Plan has played and can continue to play a considerable part in bringing home to the United States Administration and public the urgent necessityfor economic assistance to this area.4. The importance of the Plan as a means of fostering the commonwealth connection and, in particular, relations between the old and the new commonwealth countries, is a strong argument for the United Kingdom to continue to play, and tobe seen to play, a major role in working for its success. The initiative in the Plancame from the Commonwealth and its centre of gravity is, and will obviouslyremain, in the Indian sub-continent. Any patent weakening of United Kingdominitiative or support would reduce United Kingdom influence in the commonwealth countries in particular, and in the area of South and South-East Asia in general.5: No meeting has been held since February 1951. To sustain the impetus ofthe Plan, it seems essential to hold the next meeting at Ministerial level. This isclearly expected by the countries concerned. To suggest anything less at this stage would tend to create discouragement and disappointment among the countries inthe area. 0 :V       . &apos;6. We have approved the detailed recommendations set out in paragraph 22of the attached memorandum and action is proceeding accordingly.-\   (Initialled)&apos; -:.A.

-V.:,7-V::,;;-&apos;^annex.: CriLOMBO PLANHistory of Colombo Plan      -. -1. The Colombo Plan originated with the meeting of dom.monweaXlh foreign ministers in Colombo in January 1950, when agreement wai reached on the. vital&apos; importance o&apos;f the economic development of South&apos; and, South-East Asia in-themaintenance of the political stability of the countries in that area, and in the growth of ah expanding world econorpy based on-multilateral trade. The region withwhich the Plan is concerned includes India, Pakistan, Ceylon; the Federation of malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak, Burma, Siam, Indo-ChinaVIndonesia and the Philippines and contains about one-quarter of the world&apos;s popu-lation. Although the region is rich in natural resources, economic development hasnot in the past kept pace with the increasing pressure of population, and many millions of people live at the barest subsistence level. The rapid political develop-ments in the area since the war have made it urgently necessary that the newGovernments should promote the economic improvement which is essential to theirsocial stability and the strengthening of their free institutions.2. After the Colombo Conference a process of Commonwealth Consultationwas begun with the purpose of making the most effective attack on the problem,and of focussing world attention on the needs and difficulties of the area. TheCommonwealth Governments took the initiative because three-quarters of thepeople in the area live in countries which are members of the Commonwealth andthe whole area is one with which Commonwealth Governments have close politicaland economic ties. But it was contemplated from the start that non-Common-wealth Governments in the area should be invited to participate on equal terms in whatever Plan could be devised to lead to international action; it was recognisedalso that the resources for the effective development of the area were more than theCommonwealth itself could provide, and that it would be necessary to seek theco-operation of other countries.3. The Colombo meeting had agreed on the establishment of a consultative committee to co-ordinate action under the Plan and the first meeting of the Com-mittee was held in Sydney in May 1950. It was attended by Ministers from everyCommonwealth Government except South Africa, which felt unable to participate.: because of its preoccupation with African affairs, but asked to be kept fully informed of developments; the United Kingdom was represented by the Paymaster-General(Lord Macdonald). It was agreed at this meeting that the. first step was to assess the extent of the problem. Each country in the area was therefore invited toprepare a six-year development programme for incorporation in a report to bedrawn up at a second.meeting of the Consultative Committee in London. In fact,none of the non-Commonwealth countries invited prepared programmes in time forthe meeting, and indeed most of them have still not decided whether to join thePlan. (See paragraph 14 below.) It was also agreed in principle at the SydneyMeeting to set up a Technical Co-operation scheme to increase the supply of technical assistance to the area. Commonwealth Governments represented on theCommittee agreed to provide finance for technical co-operation to the extent of 8 million over the three years beginning 1st July, 1950, the United. Kingdom sharebeing fixed subsequently at up to  2-8 million. ......4. The second meeting of the Consultative Committee was held in London-in September 1950. It was attended by representatives of the Governments ofAustralia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the United Kingdomand its Dependent Territories in the area; the Governments of the Associated Statesof Indo-China (Cambodia, Labs and Viet-Nam) and the Government of Thailandsent delegations to a joint meeting with the members of the Consultative Committeeearly in October, which was also attended by observers from Burma and Indonesia.The main work of the meeting was the production of the Report referred to in thepreceding paragraph, which was approved by member Governments and published in the United Kingdom in November 1950 as a White Paper. *  The meeting also* Cmd. 8080.
Total m.1,8681,084recommended a constitution for the Technical Co-operation Scheme, includingthe establishment of a Bureau in Colombo to act as a clearing house for offers and requests for technical assistance. This has since been set Up, under a UnitedKingdom Director, Mr. G. M. Wilson.5, The Report of the Committee, in addition to a general review of the history and objectives of the Plan, contains details of the development programmes pro-duced by the Commonwealth countries in the area-India, Pakistan and Ceylon,the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak. The total costof these programmes was estimated at  1,868 million, of which  1,084 million would be required in the form of external capital; the breakdown is as follows: -- Malaya-: &apos; .-   .:-        . r- and. british india        Pakistan      Ceylon Borneo m.            m.    .      m.  m.Cost of programme   ...     1,379        280        102 107External finance required      818        145         60 61&apos;.6. India has now substituted a five-year Plan costing  1,345 million for heroriginal six-year programme costing  1,379 million. The new Plan is divided into two sections, the former consisting of essential projects amounting to  1,120 million;the latter of desirable projects making up the remaining  225 million. The first part is to be financed by internal capital to the extent of  841 million and by externalcontributions already promised, leaving a balance of about  217 million for whichthe Indians will, if necessary, resort to deficit financing. The second part of thePlan can only be carried out if additional external finance becomes available.Pakistan has now produced a two-year programme, consisting of priority projectsfrom her original programme, and amounting to about  50 million. This excludesseveral Colombo projects which are already under way.7. It had. always been our hope to persuade the United States Government tojoin the Plan, since they alone could fill the gap between total requirements for external assistance and the amount which the Commonwealth donor countries could offer. The United States Government was therefore kept informed of the progressof the London meeting and shortly afterwards they accepted a formal invitation totake part in the work of the Consultative Commitee. The United States Adminis-tration, for reasons connected with the difficulty of securing appropriations from congress, has shown anxiety lest their participation should commit them toendorsing particular development programmes, figures fOr the aid required, orpriorities in the allocation of aid. However, the Committee has always in itsreports avoided implying any such endorsement on the part of the donor countrieseither severally or collectively, and the American anxieties on this score have notprevented their participation in the work of the Committee. It is of interest to note that since the report on the Plan was published the United States Administra-. tion have for the first time asked Congress to appropriate funds specifically intended for South and South-East Asia, and they have now secured a substantial sum (seeparagraph 11 below). -8. There was a third meeting of the Consultative Committee in Colomboin February 1951, at the official level, to review the situation generally following the publication of the Report on the Colombo Plan, and to make recommendations to Governments regarding future procedure for continuing consultation amongstthe Governments participating in the Plan. It was attended by the seven interestedCommonwealth Governments, and by the United States, Cambodia and Viet-Namas members. Observers were sent from Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines andThailand; and by invitation there was a representative of the International Bank.The conclusions of this meeting are summarised in paragraphs 9 and 17, and theproposed arrangements for the next meeting are being submitted to Ministers forapproval in paragraphs 18-22 below.9. It was generally agreed at the London meeting that it would not bedesirable to channel the provision of aid through any central allocating organisation(such as O.E.E.C.), and that negotiations for the provision of aid should be handledbilaterally between donor and recipient Governments. . The United Kingdom,however, at the third meeting proposed the establishment of a small secretariat to41609   &apos; . b 2.
maintain continuity between meetings of the Consultative Committee and to facili-tate the exchange of information. The proposal was accepted in principle, butthe Committee thought it would be premature to set up the secretariat&quot;at that stage.The matter will therefore fall to be considered at the next meeting of the Committeeand the. United Kingdom policy on this subject will in due course be considered when the briefs are prepared for that meeting.External Finance: Needs and Commitments10, At the September 1950 meeting of the Consultative Committee theChancellor of the Exchequer offered a United Kingdom contribution for the six-year period of about  330 million, consisting of sterling releases. Colonial Develop-ment and Welfare Funds for United Kingdom South-East Asian territories, &amp;c.;and  30 million for non-Commonwealth countries. The figures were not quoted in the Conference, but were given privately to Commonwealth delegates. On28th November; 1950, Mr. Gaitskell announced in the House that the UnitedKingdom contribution, including the repayment of sterling balances, &quot; may amountto. well over  300 million.&quot; Agreement has now been reached with India, pakistan and Ceylon for total sterling releases of  252 million over the six years. All thesereleases have been announced to Parliament-. We have stated in the ColomboReport, paragraph 31, that it is not the present intention of the United KingdomGovernment, in view of their, special responsibility for Malaya, Singapore, north borneo and Sarawak, to seek finance from other Governments in.respect of these territories, apart from assistance available under present arrangements; and theChancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House on 28th November, 1950, thatwe should ouselves provide any external finance required by these territories forthe execution of their development plans.11. In addition to the United Kingdom contribution, the following promises of assistance have been received: -(a) Australia has offered  25 million over six years, of which  7 million aproxi-mately is for 1951-52.(b) Canada is to give $25 million in 1951-52.(c) New Zealand has made a provisional offer of  1 million a year for threeyears, to.be reviewed at the end of 1951-52.(d) The United States Administration has obtained an appropriation of$237 million for assistance to South-East Asia (including Formosa)under the mutual -Security Programme against their original request for$375 million. We do not know how much of this will accrue to Colombocountries, but out of the original appropriation the Administration wereintending that about $80 million should go to the Indian sub-continent.In addition, the United States Government in May this year extendeda loan of $190 million to India for the purchase of wheat and other commodities for famine relief.(e) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has alreadylent to India $60 million and is negotiating with Pakistan for a similaramount; In addition, a loan.of $25 million has gone to Siam.12. This does not measure up very well against our original hopes for the external financing of the Programme (that about  400 million should come fromthe Commonwealth and the remainder, to wit about  600 million, from the UnitedStates and International Bank). However, the original estimates and the ColomboReport were based on the pessimistic outlook of.September 1950; for instance,the assumption was that rubber prices would remain at about Is. per lb. Althoughprices have declined from the peak figures reached earlier in the year, they arestill for the most part substantially above the levels prevailing in September 1950,and there has been a marked change of emphasis since the inception of the Plan,when.the greatest limitation on development was shortage of finance. Stockpiling,rearmament and the consequent round of world. inflation have resulted in bigincreases in the prices of the area&apos;s primary products and big increases in their sterling balances. External finance is ng longer the main problem. To the extent that Government revenues benefit by means of export duties, &amp;c, and that thereis more money in private hands which can be tapped by taxation and internalGovernment loans, there is considerably more internal finance available for develop-government. In spite of the rather disappointing nature of the contributions announced,and in spite of increased costs, it is unlikely that at any rate for 1951-52 the
execution of the development programmes of the Commonwealth countries in thearea, with the possible exception of India, will be hindered by lack of money. the basic difficulty which the countries are likely to encounter, and which is causingthem some apprehension at present, is that of ensuring a regular supply of capital goods for the fulfilment of their plans. Hitherto, difficulties in the supply of suchequipment from the United Kingdom have not been encountered except in a fewisolated cases. But the competing demands of the defence programme, the homeinvestment programme and export requirements will make it increasingly likely thatwe shall only be able to sustain the necessary level of supplies at the expense of someequally desirable recipient. \Non-Commonwealth Participation in the Plan13. Countries outside South-East Asia. It has always been hoped eventually to enlist support for the Plan from the potential donor countries outside the area which are not members of the Commonwealth. The position of the United states has been discussed in paragraph 7 above. In addition, the Governments of bothFrance and the Netherlands have formally expressed their desire to take part inthe Plan. We favour this in principal since they could contribute to its success.The question was discussed at the meeting in Colombo last February. However,partly because the Asian Commonwealth countries were reluctant to agree to french or Dutch participation, and partly because it was thought that to bring them in at this stage might deter the non-Commonwealth countries of South-east asia which have not yet joined the Plan (in particular Indonesia) from doing so,it was agreed.that the French and Dutch should not at that stage be invited tojoin the Plan. The position was explained informally to the Governments of Franceand the Netherlands, who understand the difficulties. It may be necessary toconsider this matter again at the next meeting of the Consultative Committee (seeparagraph 22) and the United Kingdom policy in this event will be considered atthe appropriate time.14. Countries in South-East Asia. All the non-Commonwealth countries of :South-East Asia Burma, Siam, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Associate States ofIndo-China (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) have been invited to join the Plan,but so far only the three Associate States have decided to do so. The rest havehung back for a variety of reasons reluctance to align themselves too closely withthe West, fear of compromising their new won independence, and because someof them are already receiving from the United States of America and the Inter-national Bank about as much aid as they are physically and administratively capableof absorbing.15. Since the Plan was published last year, the rise in commodity prices hasmuch improved the respective balances of payments of those countries which havenot yet joined the Plan, and most of them are now accumulating sterling. Unless,therefore, they increase greatly the tempo of their present development plans, or unless world prices move against them, they are unlikely in the near future to have any urgent or well-founded claim for United Kingdom assistance, should they nowjoin the Plan.       .16. Separate considerations apply to Indo-China. All three AssociatedStates have actually joined the Plan, and Vietnam recently produced a development programme. The question of aid to Vietnam is at present under consideration,and if necessary a separate submission will be made to Ministers in due course.Arrangements for Next Meeting of Consultative Committee17. At the meeting of the Consultative Committee held at official level inColombo last February it was recommended inter alia: (1) that a further meeting of the Committee (at Ministerial level) should be convened as soon as practicable;&apos; -&apos;. (2) that the Committee.should meet by mutual agreement whenever necessary,.   and at least once a year; and(3) that the Committee should publish an annual report and such other reports.       Y. . as may be necessary. &apos;-.18. In July last United Kingdom Ministers agreed that, our aim should be tohold a Ministerial meeting of the Consultative Committee &quot;at about the tum\ofthe year to approve the draft report, which would be put into final shape bAa
short working party of officials immediately before the Ministerial meeting.&quot; Onthe initiative of the United Kingdom, which had held the Chair at the lastMinisterial meeting this idea was communicated to the other Governmentsconcerned, who accepted our suggestions that the meeting should be held eitherimmediately before or immediately after the proposed meeting of commonwealth finance Ministers. The United Kingdom also offered to circulate suggestionsregarding the preparation of the actual report.19. Our own ideas, which have been accepted in the main, are that the chiefobjects of the report would be to state progress, to provide an up-to-date re-assess-reassessment  in the light of changes in economic circumstances, and to obtain from the recipient countries details of their, actual plans and requests over the first two yearsof the Planperiod commencing July 1951.. -The last of these would provide a basis on which donor countries, in particular the United States, could formulate theirown estimates for assistance needed. The United Kingdom has circulated drafts of a synopsis for the report and of a questionnaire designed to elicit the necessary information, and these drafts have been substantially accepted.\ 20. Decisions as to the venue and timing now to be suggested for the meetinghave to be taken. Certain of the Governments concerned have already expressedthe view that the meeting should be held in the Colombo Plan area, i.e., at Colombo,Delhi, Karachi or Singapore. Other Governments for various reasons would preferthis meeting to be held, as we originally had in mind, in London, consecutivelywith the meeting of Finance Ministers. We now consider that the latter alternative is impracticable for a number of reasons, principally the preoccupation that therewill be with the very serious financial questions to be discussed in January. Thegeneral advantages of having the meeting in the area are obvious the Plan does,after all, concern Asia; furthermore, we know that a meeting in the area is themore likely to command American support. The proposal for a meeting in thearea, at a date later than the Finance Ministers&apos; meeting, therefore holds the field.The Finance Minister of Pakistan has already suggested Karachi as venue and itis considered that we need look no further; indeed, it would be difficult to ignorethis suggestion. .:. j.21. The timing of the^meeting must be arranged to avoid clashing with-A- (a) the Commonwealth financial talks being held in London from 8th tov.     20th January approximately;(b) a meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East(E.C.A.F.E.) being held at Rangoon from 29th January to 9th February,.      which some of the officials dealing with Colombo Plan matters will beV : attending; and(c) the Colombo Plan Exhibition being held in Colombo from mid-february to mid-March 1952, during which period it would be impossible for theMinister and officials dealing with Colombo Plan matters in Ceylon tobe absent from the capital.22. It is therefore recommended that the United Kingdom should suggest tothe other members of the Consultative Committee (a) that the offer by Pakistan of Karachi as venue for the meeting should beaccepted;(6) that the Ministerial meeting should commence on about 24th March, 1952;(e) that a preparatory meeting of officials should begin about a fortnight beforethe Ministerial meeting; the actual date would depend on the amountof preliminary work on drafting the report that could be done in...      advance, by the United Kingdom or any other country;(d) that the International Bank be invited to participate and the non-Common-wealth countries in the area who have been invited to join the ColomboPlan (Burma, Indonesia, Siam and the. Philippines), but have not yetdone so, should be invited to send observers;(e) that the agenda for consideration should include the following:  .-    (i) Preparation of the Annual Report\ (A draft chapter for the Annual Report on the operation of theA Technical Co-operation Scheme is being prepared by the council for Technical Co-operation in Colombo.)
-    21B(ii) Role of the International Bank(This item is included with the object of allowing the bank&apos;representatives to give some indication not only of the amountOf assistance which the bank can provide, but also of the bank&apos;general outlook and policy, and of the conditions which itnormally expects in connection with its loans.)(iii) Future Organisation for Continuing Consultations,  (See paragraph 9 above.) &quot;(iv) Liaison with the Economic Commission for Asia and the far east (E.C.A.F.E.)\ (The Executive Secretary of E.C.A.F.E. has suggested informallythat an observer from that organisation should be invited to -future meetings of the Consultative Committee. Members of theCommittee have expressed widely differing views on this question and it is proposed that it can best be discussed at the forthcoming.    Meeting.)(v) The Colombo Plan Exhibition(The Government of Ceylon announced at the Meeting of theCommittee in February 1951 their willingness to convene aColombo Plan Exhibition in Colombo during February 1952.The majority of the countries who are members of the Committeewill be participating. It is considered that an opportunity shouldbe given to the Ceylon Government at the next Meeting to report...&apos; to the Committee on the Exhibition.)The position of non-Commonwealth countries as regards the Plan will call fordiscussion. It has been thought best that this should be dealt with informallybetween delegations rather than in open discussion.
