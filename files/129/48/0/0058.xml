This Agreement was renewed for three years, up to1954, very shortly before the change of Government.(b) Whether we should renew the Empire Settlement Acts, under which theSecretary of State is empowered to make contributions to empire settlement schemes up to a maximum of  1,500,000 a year. These Actsare.due to expire in May next.I annex a note setting out the facts and points at issue (Annex A).2. Assisted Passage Agreement.-My own view is that, Under existing conditions, it is difficult to defend spending large sums of public money on helpingsome of the most productive elements in the country to leave it. It seems to methat this position is quite consistent v/ith holding that migration from this countrywithin the Commonwealth is desirable and. should be encouraged. To put the pointshortly, one can agree that the under-populated areas of the Commonwealth require a blood transfusion, which can best be supplied from this densely populated island;but there seems no reason why part of the cost of the operation should be paidby the impoverished donor.3. Reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that we should terminate, atany rate for the time being, our contribution to this scheme: the only remainingscheme of its kind, since emigration to other Commonwealth countries now proceedswithout any United Kingdom financial assistance. However, this step should notin practice affect migration to Australia, since the Australians made it clear, duringthe late negotiations over the renewal of the Agreement, that in that event they wouldtake over our liability themselves..4. In all the circumstances I recommend that we should ask the Australians,on the ground of the deterioration of our financial position since the agreement was renewed, to release us entirely from our financial obligations under the Agree-ment as from the end of this financial year, I ask my colleagues to authorise meto open negotiations with the Australians on this basis and to report the result tothe Cabinet. . \-; 5. Empire Settlement Acts-For the reasons explained in the annexed note(Annex A), I recommend that, whether or not We continue to contribute financiallyto the Australian Passage Scheme, a one-clause Bill shoulfjrbe passed during thepresent session extending the Empire Settlement Acts for five years, i.e., until 1957;and that the Legislation Committee should be authorised to make arrangementsaccordingly. - \. &apos; I.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.

ANNEX AASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA AND renewal of EMPIRE SETTLEMENT ACTS, 1922 AND 1937The Empire Settlement Acts, 1922 and 1937, empower the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations to make contributions to Empire Settlement schemesup to a maximum of  1,500,000 a year, these Acts are due to expire on31st May, 1952. /2. Assisted Passage Agreement.-Apart from certain minor schemes withvoluntary organisations for child migration, costing about  40,000 a year, our onlycommitment under the Acts is the Assisted Passage Agreement with the australian government, which has been in force since 1947. Under this Agreement the migrantpays  10, the United Kingdom Government (since 1950)  25, and the australian government the balance of the cost of the migranfs passage, which works out atan average of  156 per adult. The Agreement was recently renewed for three years ending 31st March, 1954, subject to a maximum United Kingdom expenditure of 500,000 in any one year. In practice this maximum will always be reached unless there is an unexpected falling off in migration to Australia (see the table at Annex Bshowing the number of migrants and United Kingdom expenditure under theAgreement to the present date).3. The main reason for the decision to renew the Agreement was the unfavourable impression which non-renewal would have produced on Australianpublic opinion. This was the point to which the Australians themselves attachedmost importance. They were anxious for a renewal of the Agreement not so much on financial grounds as because they felt that, whatever might be said in public,a withdrawal of United Kingdom financial assistance would inevitably be construed as meaning that we were no longer in favour of migration.4. Instructions have now been issued that next year&apos;s Estimates must bereduced as far as possible even if this involves the re-negotiation of an Agreement.At the same time the Australians have notified us that in future, in selectingmigrants for assisted passages, they propose to concentrate on single men who areskilled workers in the engineering, electrical and metal trades and, if possible, on coal miners. This marks a fundamental change in the spirit in which the Agree-ment has previously been administered. Hitherto, it has always been understoodthat the Australians would take a fair cross-section of our population.5. In these circumstances the question arises whether we should ask the australians, on the ground of the deterioration in our financial position, to releaseus entirely from our obligations under the Agreement as from the end of this financial year, or whether we should seek their consent to a reduction of ourliability from  500,000 to, say  250,000 per annum. In view of the urgent needfor economy the former course seems preferable and it is suggested that negotiations should be opened with the Australians on that basis.6. Renewal of Empire Settlement Acts. We are advised that it would notbe-possible, without fresh statutory authority, for the Secretary of State to carryout his financial obligations under the Australian Agreement beyond 31st May, .1952,when the Empire Settlement Acts are due to expire. If our contribution to theAustralian Scheme were suspended, it would still be desirable to renew the Actson the following grounds:  . (a) the Acts have been in force for thirty years and to allow them to lapse would- be likely to arouse a good deal of public criticism;(b) renewal would leave the door open for a resumption of United Kingdomassistance to Commonwealth migration should it be considered desirableto do so when financial conditions improve. To that extent it might be..   expected to facilitate the acceptance both here and in Australia ofthe suspension of our contribution to the Australian scheme;(c) irrespective of what is decided on the Assisted Passage Scheme^, it will-probably be desirable to continue our support to the existing childmigration schemes (see paragraph 2). In that case we are advised that the. extension of the Empire Settlement Acts would be required as an annual charge over a period of years Would be involved.

In that case we are advised that the extension of the Empire Settlement Acts would be required as an annual charge over a period of years would be involved.
7. Period of Extension-The 1922 Act was given a life of fifteen years which was prolonged for another fifteen years by the Act of 1937. Before com-mitting ourselves to a further long-term extension of11 the policy of subsidisingmigration we need to give thought to the whole question of our future migrationEoucy.  There is no time for this before the Acts expire and in any case this isardly the moment for going into the matter fundamentally. In the circumstances it is suggested that the Acts should be extended for five years.8. Amount of United Kingdom Liability. The balance of advantage seems to lie in allowing the existing limit of  1,500,000 to stand. Any change, which would presumably have to be downward, would invite questions and criticisms&apos;&apos; More-over, the question is really academic since in practice any payments on account of migration will be limited by our own parlous financial condition, and not by anymaximum imposed by the Acts.9.  Recommendations. To sum up, it is suggested that (a) in view of the deterioration in our financial condition since the assisted passage Agreement was renewed last summer, we should-ask the.V Australians to release us from the whole of our financial liabilities underthe Agreement as from the end of this financial year;(b) whether or not we continue to contribute financially to the AustralianPassage Scheme, a one-clause Bill should be passed during the present session extending the Empire Settlement Acts for five years, i.e.,- until 1957.NUMBER OF ASSISTED MIGRANTS AND UNITED KINGDOMEXPENDITURE UNDER THE ASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENTWITH AUSTRALIAANNEX BFinancialYearNumber of     United KingdomMigrants      .
