Attendances during 1951 totalled 8 million.. Checks on three days showed that 70-80 per cent, were Londoners, 18-25 percent, provincials, and 1  -5 per cent, tourists.3. If the Festival Gardens are to continue I recommend: -(i) Opening from 2-30 p.m. to 10-30 p.m.   Man-power is saved by working only one shift.(ii) Closing on Sundays in accordance with the decision of the lastParliament..4. On these assumptions the Board of Festival Gardens have given me thefollowing rough estimates of the financial results for the next five years:  --\      (i) Maintenance and operating costs     ...     ... 365,000 p.a... V    (ii) Capital expenditure    ..........     ... 150,000    -- \   (iii) Revenue on the basis of one-half of the atten-danccs in 1951        ...     ......... 620,000 p.a.(iv) Profit over the next two years charging (ii) tothis period    ...                      ...... 360,000.(v) Profit over five years (against indebtedness of 1,162,000)    ...     ...     ...     ... .    ..... 1,225,0004142
&apos; 2  ,.v -5. I can take no responsibility for these estimates. The  150,000 for capitalexpenditure is said to be required mainly for purposes which do not call for building materials. -6. As far as I can judge the London public want the Festival Gardens tocontinue.On 31st July the London County Council resolved that if . &quot; a continuation should be decided upon the Council would not raise objectionto enabling legislation to permit an extension of not more than five years, but. . . . that there should be an experimental period of two years after the&quot;conclusion of the Festival before any decision is taken for or against apermanent continuance and that the consent of the Council should be requiredto any extension beyond two years.&quot;7.  I recommend that the Cabinet give authority to-inform the London County Council and the public that, in view of the demandfor the continuance of the Festival Pleasure Gardens and the estimate of theBoard of the Festival Gardens that a substantial part of the loan capital canbe repaid out of profits, the Government have decided to continue the FestivalPleasure Gardens, and that legislation to enable this to be done for a period up to five years, subject to closing down at the.end of two years should theGovernment and the London County Council so desire, will be introduced assoon as possible.D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,&apos;     Sth November, 1951.
