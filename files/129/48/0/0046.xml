Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the suggestion of the Pakistania Ambassador in Washington .the. Yice President of the International Bank, Mr. Garner^ informed .Dr. Mussadiq on 10th November that the Bank would be willing to try tomake temporary arrangements for the operation of.the Persian oil. industry pending a final settlement, if invited to do so by both parties tothe dispute.2, Dr. Mussadiq, though non-commital, expressed willingness to explore this idea and asked that it should be put to His JVIajesty&apos;s Govern-ment.    Mr. Garner has since given us a memorandum, elaborating hisideas and has discussed it with myself and my colleagues of the PersiaCommittee,    We have given him a memorandum (agreed with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) commenting on his proposals.    We emphasised that any such arrangements as those contemplated by the Bank must be without prejudice to the legal rights of both parties in any final settle-ment and that our memorandum and any subsequent discussions on itwere designed to assist the Bank in working out a plan:  the Bank itself  .would have to decide whether it constituted a suitable basis for negotia-tions with the Persians.3. At.the Bank&apos;s request we have given them all the informationthey require about the Persian oil industry and the effect which anyinterim arrangements might have on His Majesty&apos;s Governments case before the International Court of Justice.    In response to a personalrequest from the President, of the Bank, I have arranged for a Directorof the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to go to Washington to assist the bank&apos;staff in elucidating the material we have sent them.4.      :    I understand that Mr. Garner hopes to be in a position to formulate specific proposals in early January.    These proposals.arelikely to provide, inter alia, for the Bank to have complete freedom toappoint a management with full authority over the production andrefining sides of the industry.    This management, whose head wouldprobably be of &quot;neutral&quot; nationality, would be responsible for recruitingthe Operating group to run the industry.    The bulk of the foreignoperating staff would probably have to be provided by the Anglo-iranian oil Company.    Profits would be split on a 50/50 basis between the persians and those foreign interests supplying the operating and .marketing facilities, which, in effect, would be primarily the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. . . \v    5. Such a scheme would appear to protect the essential interestsof His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.    Itmay be more difficult for. the bank to convince the Persians that it also
A.E.    .(i)(iii)Foreign Office, 5.W.1,     .: 17TH DECEMBER, 1951.protects their essential interests.    The Shah has apparently placed hishopes on the Bank^s intervention to save him from having to take direct action against Mussadiq.    The public statements of the Persian Govern-ment, however, are not propitious.    In a recent speech in the MajlisMussadiq, referring to his discussions with Mr. Garner, intimated thatthe Bank would only be intervening to help Persia finance her industryand sell her oil, not to control or manage it as trustee for the parties.It is too early yet, however, to say that Mussadiq has adopted a firmattitude.    It is essential that the independent role of the Bank in thismatter should be publicly emphasised at every opportunity.6. If the Bank decides to submit specific proposals, the greatest care will have to be taken to ensure that their presentation and timingdo not strengthen Mussadiq&apos;s political position which has recently been considerably weakened.    It would help him to restore it if he couldrepresent that he was in negotiations over the oil question.    I therefore recommend that:in public we should be well advised to maintain silence andapparent indifference to the fate of Persian oil, while in private we should do all we can to assist and encourage theBank in drawing up a plan.Any specific proposals from the Bank should, in the firstinstance, be communicated to the Persian and BritishAmbassadors in Washington, requesting written statementsfrom their Governments that they accept them as a basis for negotiations. ;JHis Majesty&apos;s Governments reply to such proposals shouldnot be published until a satisfactory reply has been receivedfrom Mussadiq, and our public comment should be confined to a statement that the proposals were being seriously con-sidered but the outcome must depend on whether the PersianGovernment accepts the proposal as a basis for discussion.
