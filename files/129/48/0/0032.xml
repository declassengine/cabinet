S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1951Copy No.   j^QCABINETUNITED europe note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence!It may simplify discussion if I set forth briefly my own view and the line i have followed so far.1. At Zurich in 1946 I appealed to France to take the lead in Europe by making friends with the Germans, &quot; burying the thousand-year quarrel,&quot; &amp;c. Thiscaused a shock at the time but progress has been continual. I always recognisedthat, as Germany is potentially so much stronger than France, militarily and economically, Britain and if possible the United States should be associated with united Europe, to make an even balance and to promote the United EuropeMovement.2. As year by year the project advanced, the Federal Movement in manyEuropean countries who participated became prominent. It has in the last twoyears lost much of its original force. The American mind jumps much too lightlyover its many difficulties. I am not opposed to a European Federation including(eventually) the countries behind the Iron Curtain, provided that this comes aboutnaturally and gradually. But I never thought that Britain or the British Common-wealths should, either individually or collectively, become an integral part of a european Federation, and have never given the slightest support to the idea. Weshould not, however, obstruct but rather favour the movement to closer european unity and try to get the United States&apos; support in.this work.3. There can be no effective defence of Western Europe without the Germans.As things developed my idea has always been as follows: There is the N.A.T.O.Army. Inside the N.A.T.O. Army there is the European Army, and inside theEuropean Army there is the German Army. The European Army should be formed by all the European parties to N.A.T.O. plus Germany, &quot;dedicating&quot; from theirown national armies their quota of divisions to the Army now under GeneralEisenhowers command. Originally at Strasbourg in 1950 the Germans did not press for a national army. On the contrary they declared themselves ready to41494SECRET    .29//i November, 1951
join a European Army without having a national army. The opportunity was lost and there, seems very little doubt that Germany will have to have a certain limitednational army from which to &quot;dedicate.&quot; The size and strength of this army, andits manufacture of weapons, would have to be agreed with the victorious Powersof the late war. In any case the recruiting arrangements for covering the Germanquota would have involved a considerable machinery:4. In the European Army all dedicated quotas of participating nations wouldbe treated with strict honourable military equality. The national characteristicsshould be preserved up to the divisional level, special, arrangements being made,about the &quot; tail,&quot; heavy weapons, &amp;c. I should doubt very much the military spiritof a &quot; sludgy amalgam &quot; of volunteers or conscripts to&apos;defend the E.D.C. or other similar organisations. The national spirit must animate all troops up to and including the divisional level. On this basis and within these limits national pridemay be made to promote and serve international strength.5. France does not seem to be playing her proper part in these arrangements.France is not France without &quot; L&apos;Armee Francaise.&quot; I warned MM. Pleven andMonnet several times that &quot; a Pleven Army &quot; would not go down in France. TheFrench seem to be trying to get France defended by Europe. Their proposed con-tribution for 1952 of five, rising to ten, divisions is pitiful, even making allowances for the fact that they are still trying to hold their Oriental Empire. They have no grounds of complaint against us who have already dedicated four divisions toGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s Command. - We must not lose all consciousness of ourinsular position. I noticed some time ago the faulty structure of the present Frencharrangements, and in particular how the few combatant divisional formations theyhave will be deprived of all training efficiency by the vast mass of recruits annuallyflowing in upon thern.6. On the economic side, I welcome the Schuman Coal and Steel Plan as astep in the reconciliation of France and Germany, and as probably renderinganother Franco-German war physically impossible. I never contemplated Britainjoining in this plan on the same terms as Continental partners. We should, however,have joined in all the discussions, and had we done so not only a better plan wouldprobably have emerged, but our own interests would have been watched at every stage. Our attitude towards further economic developments on the Schuman linesresembles that which we adopt about the European Army. We help, we dedicate,we play a part, but we are not merged and do not forfeit our insular or Common-wealth-wide character. I should resist any American pressure to treat Britain as onthe same footing as the European States, none of whom have the advantages of theChannel and who were consequently conquered.7. Our first object is the unity and the consolidation of the British Common-wealths and what is left of the former British Empire. Our second, the &quot; fraternalassociation &quot; of the English-speaking world; and third. United Europe, to which weare a separate closely- and specially-related ally and friend.&apos;V.- w. s. c10 Downing Street, S.W. I,29th November, 1951.
