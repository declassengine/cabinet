IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS government cp(70) 4924 September 1970PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: TELECOMMUNICATIONS, posts and broadcasting memorandum by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications1. The Poet Office has a turnover of  1000 million and an annualcapital investment programme of around  450 million rising to 550 million in the next 5 years.TELECOMMUNICATIONS2.        The telecommunications business accounts for 90 per cent of thecapital investment programme.    It is expanding fast (at about 10 per cent per annum) and has for years had difficulty in meeting the demands put on it.    In particular, the capital programme is restricted by the capacityof the manufacturers of exchange equipment who claim that their performancehas suffered because of past cuts in capital expenditure (stop-go);    Asubstantial cut in the capital programme for telecommunications, whichis, for these reasons already less than adequate, would have serious consequences in terms of lengthening waiting lists for the telephone andcongestion of the system.    Thus a cut of 5 per cent, which would reducecapital expenditure by  25 million a year from 1972-73 would probablylead to a waiting list of 500, 000 (the post-war peak in 1949 was 460, 000)by the end of 1973-74, and congestion on the trunk routes would becomeserious.    It would not be possible to shield any part of the community(eg. the business sector) from these effects.    There would be revenuelosses even in the short term, partly offsetting the savings in capitalexpenditure, and there would probably have to be a very sharp Increase in tariffs to damp down demand if complete breakdown were to be avoided.(Increasing the cut from 5 per cent to 10 per cent would intensify thesedisadvantages and would be largely counterproductive because the additional revenue loss induced would wipe out much of the additional savings).3.        It does not make much sense to cut back the profitable telephone service so long as people are queueing to have it and anxious to pay for it,but a moderate tariff increase (say 10 per cent or 12 per cent on average)in about July 1972 (2 years after the last Increases) could yield about1COPY NO       J4CABINET
 60 million a year over and above what is required to meet the presenttarget rate of return of 10 per cent on net assets.    This would lift the rateof return from 10 per cent to something between 10 per cent and 12 per cent,which would still be modest in relation to the return that would be made bya commercial enterprise in a like expansionist situation.    It would be a proper use of the price mechanism to ease the pressure on demand.    there could indeed be a marginal saving of capital expenditure, say of 10 million a year, in consequence of decelerating the rate of demandgrowth.    Over the period from July 1972 until April 1975 the extra revenueproduced, together with capital savings by this measure would be in the region of  200 million or more.    The Post Office^ borrowings from theNational Loans Fund would be reduced accordingly.    At the same time the extra revenue paid by telephone users in the form of increased rentals and call charges (and connection charges) would reduce their demand on generalresources.POSTS4.        The postal investment programme is relatively small, rising from 36 million in 1971-72 to  52 million in 1974-75.    The programme is devotedto modernisation and mechanisation, of which the postal services are sorelyin need.   Thxise measures are essential to the success of the Post OfficeTsefforts to improve productivity and in consequence the net savings from anycut in the capital programme would be small.    I should not, therefore, bein favour of this but the proposals now approved for increasing postal tariffswill help the receipts side of our accounts to the tune of over  120 million a year.POST OFF ICE TS UNPROFITABLE ACTIVITIES AND HIVING OFF5.        I have been giving some thought to the possibilities of terminatingunprofitable Post Office activities and hiving off activities to the private sector.    The only important unprofitable activity is telegrams.    the inland telegram service Is losing about  2^ million a year.    It is dyingfrom natural causes but to stop it Immediately would cause a public outcry.The Post Office could reduce the loss by increasing charges and this should probably be done on a suitable occasion.    The same applies to theinternational telegram service which also loses about  3 million a year.To discontinue It would cause international complications.    The service is growing: It should be possible to make it viable by means of tariff changesnegotiated internationally.6.        As regards hiving off, v/e have to consider the Giro and the NationalData Processing Service (NDPS).    The Giro lost  6 million in 19S9-70J thePost Office expect it to lose a further  5 million this financial year butthink that by 1973-74 it will break even.    The Giro was represented by theformer Government as a modernisation of the Post Officets traditional roleas a money handler.    Even before Giro it collected, paid out and transferredthousands of million pounds annually of public and private funds.    It operates2
by using the Post Office^ facilities and there is nothing that could be handedover to a private operator.    The option before us is to continue Giro, orcurtail or stop it.    The Giro competes with the banks, allegedly on fairterms.    I am going into the prospects with the Post Office but I am not yet ready to make recommendations.7.        There remains the NDPS.    The Post Officers data processingactivities are, in the main, undertaken in aid of the Postal and telecommunications businesses; and it is natural as well as encouragesefficiency that they should sell any spare computer capacity with which theymay find themselves from time to time.    The NDPS, however, at presentcompetes with the private computer bureaux and incurs a small amount ofcapital expenditure on this optional business.    This optional investment isvery profitable however and cutting it down would be likely to be offset in1974-75 to a large extent by loss of revenue.    Moreover, the data processing side of the Post Office would loose something cf its commercialmotivation and the competitive spur which comes from competing withoutsiders.    The Post Office has been playing a lead in this field; itstraining facilities are highly developed and there would quite likely be an overall national loss if its activities were curtailed.   Again, there is no possibility here (as with the hotels of British Railways) of handing over agoing concern to the private sector.    I should not be in favour of curtailingthis useful activity on the part of the Post Office, which has the effect ofincreasing competition in this field.8.        I shall&apos; be discussing further with the Treasury the future of cable and Wireless, of which the shares are at present held by the Treasury.This could be a candidate for &quot;denationalisation&quot; although I understand thata change in status might involve some difficulties in the Commonwealth andother countries concerned, at whose behest the Company was originally&quot;nationalised&quot;,BROADCASTING9.        The capital expenditure programmes of the British broadcasting corporation (3BC) and Independent Television Authority (ITA) amount toalmost  50 million over the period 1972-73 to 1974-75.    I have concluded,after consulting them, that it would be possible for them to make savings inthese programmes of slightly more than 5 per cent ( 1. 7 million BBC and 0.9 million ITA).    Here however I should note that two offsetting itemsmay arise.    We shall need to provide about  2 million for the setting up ofthe supervising authority for commercial radio.   And again, following aReport due next month by the National Board for Prices and Incomes on theITV companies1&apos; finances, we may well be faced with a need to considerreducing the levy payable by the companies.3
CONCLUSION10.       Apart from the contributions which will come from the increases in postal tariffs we have already approved (over  120 million a year) themain effect of my proposals will be to yield upwards of  70 million a year from July 1972 as the result of adopting economic principles of pricing fortelecommunications.    If my colleagues agree, the details would remain tobe worked out with the Post Office (who, I understand, would be willing toaccept a higher target rate of return than the present 10 per cent so as to yield increases in revenue of the order required).C J c ministry of Posts and Telecommunications SE123 September 1970(it4
