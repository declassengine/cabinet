(secret)EFFECT OP THE CURRENT PUBLIC EXPENDITURE review on GOVERNMENT RESEARCH AND development .    This note gives a brief factual account of the likely effect ofthe present public expenditure review on the Government&apos;s research anddevelopment (R and D) programme.   It has been prepared in the light ofthe current bilateral negotiations between departmental Ministers andthe Chief Secretary of the Treasury;   and on information from officials.Base-line figures for Government R and D used here are taken fromSCT(70) 3, which is a report prepared by officials using data derivedfrom departmental submissions for the 1970 Public Expenditure Survey.(Because SCT(70) 3 uses a slightly different classification system fromthat used by PESC, the figures given below do not always correspondexactly with those appearing in the Public Expenditure Situation Reportof 6 July 1970.)2. Estimated Government expenditure on R and D in some years of interest,in money terms, and as a percentage of total Public Expenditure was, on thebasis of SCT(70) 3, as follows -TABLE I(  million at 1970 Survey Prices)	1968-69	1971-72	1974-75Government R and D expenditure	about 601	538	526Percentage of total Public Expenditure devoted to R and D	2.95%	2M%	2.21%These figures, and the break-down in the attached Table II, contain no provision for as yet unapproved industrial (&quot;Category II&quot;) projects of theMinistry of Technology such as the BAC 311 (although allowance is made for1&apos;(secret)
(secret)such projects in the PESO Report at an estimated expenditure rising to 40 million in 1974-75) because it is difficult to estimate their R and D content.The total Government expenditure on R and D should be seen in the context oftotal national R and D expenditure of very roughly  1,000 million a year - or about 2.7 per cent of the GNP, a proportion which   has remained substantiallyconstant since 1962.PRESENT POSITION3.     The present position as it affects the three Departments which between themaccount for about 90 per cent of total Government R and D expenditure isconsidered below;   these 3 Departments are the Ministry of Defence, the Ministryof Technology and the Department of Education and Science.     Thereafter,consideration is given to the ten or so executive Departments with relatively small research programmes which together account for the remaining 10 per cent.MINISTRY OP DEFENCE4.     As part of their review of defence expenditure, the Ministry of Defence are considering the implications of reducing R and D expenditure by  4 million, 10 million and  17 million respectively in 1972-73 and 1973-74 and 1974-75.The relationship of these savings to the rest of the defence programme, and their size and composition, have not yet been firmly established.MINISTRY OP TECHNOLOGY5.     The Minister of Technology has been asked to make savings of  100 million in1974-75 in his Ministry&apos;s Vote expenditure.     But how much of this will fall onR and D, and how much on other expenditure, the Department cannot say at thisstage.     It should however be noted some of the Ministry&apos;s expenditure on R and Dis in aid of the executive functions of other Departments, including research on air traffic control/vand noise for the Board of Trade and on pollutionfor the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE6,    The Secretary of State for Education and Science has agreed with the chief secretary that expenditure on the PESO block &quot;Research Councils etc&quot; should be cut by  2 million in 1971-72 rising to  5 million (or about 4 per cent of thetotal block) in 1974-75.    This was on the understanding that a pro rata shareof the reduction (namely  59,000 in 1971-72, rising to  141,000 in 1974-75)2(secret)
(secret)would fall on Scottish agricultural research, which comes under the Secretary ofState for Scotland - see the following paragraph.     The Secretary of State for education and Science has not yet decided what proportion of the cuts falling on herDepartment1s Votes should be borne by the Social Science Research Council;   norhas she decided, pending advice from the Council for Scientific Policy, how theremainder would fall individually on the Agricultural, Medical, Natural environment and Science Research Councils (expenditure on which together comprises the &quot;CivilScience Budget&quot;).     It should be noted that a substantial amount of the work ofsome of the Research Councils (particularly the ARC and the MRC) is closely related to the executive functions of certain Departments.CIVIL EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS7. The following civil Departments with relatively small R and D expenditure insupport of their executive functions were asked to state the effect of the public expenditure review on their R and D programmes.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood (MAPP)Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS)Department of Education and Science (Education only)Department of Health and Social SecurityHome office ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentMinistry of Overseas DevelopmentMinistry of Public Building and WorksBoard of trade ministry of TransportWith the exception of MAFF and DAFS, all reported that their R and D programmes would not be affected.    MAFF said that they could make no statement yet aboutpossible cuts in their R and D work because these would be consequent on broaderdecisions which had yet to be taken.     DAFS said that their expenditure on R and d would be unaffected except for Scottish agricultural research, which theSecretary of State for Scotland was still discussing with the Chief Secretary(see previous paragraph).8,     The present state of play is summarised in the last two columns of Table II,
