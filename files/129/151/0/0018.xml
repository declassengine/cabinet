document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government cp(70)43 COPY NO       5422 September 1970CABINETPROPOSED NEW DESIGN council memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeBACKGROUND1. The Council of Industrial Design (COID) was established in 1944with the object of promoting by all practical means improvement in the design of the products of British industry.    It has stood the test of time,making an increasing impact in the design field and receiving steadily increasing support from industry for its activities.    Other countries have followed our example by establishing similar bodies; men prominentin the design field have been willing to accept appointment to the Counciland have given generously of their time and talents; its activities have contributed greatly to the marked improvement of the internationalstanding of the United Kingdom in the design field over the last 25 years.It currently costs some  800,000 to run, of which  300,000 comes fromcharges for services provided and  500,000 from Government grant-in-aid.2.        The main emphasis of the Councils work has been on industrial asagainst engineering design.    There has been no equivalent body chargedwith fostering the improvement of standards in the later field, although many believed that one was necessary.    In 1963 the Committee onEngineering Design set up by Lord Hailsham stressed the vital importanceof engineering design and concluded that insufficient importance was givento design by managements; in consequence, many United Kingdomengineering products were being out-classed in performance, reliabilityand sales appeal.    In 1968 a Working Party of the Council of EngineeringInstitutions recommended that a new Council should be established, to takeover the present activities of the COID and to build on to its organisation  strong engineering design activity.    The previous Administrationannounced in Parliament in April 1969 that they accepted this recommen-dation in principle and independent consultants were then engaged to review the existing activities of the COID and to advise on questions pertinent tothe establishment of a successor Council.    Their report has now been reviewed by a Steering Group, composed of representatives of myDepartment, the Ministry of Technology, COID and the Council of engineering Institutions and detailed proposals have been put forward for the early establishment of the new Council,1
3,        La short the proposition is that the total activity of the new council should be expanded over a period of five years to double that of the COID,with Government assistance rising from the present  -^ million to 1 million a year.    In order to keep costs down to this level, the effort devoted to industrial design would have to be reduced somewhatso that, at the end of the five years, engineering design activities would constitute about two-thirds of the total,4. The PESC estimates for 1971-72 already include provision for theestablishment of the new Council,,5, Both the Minister of Technology and I are convinced that we should,subject to further detailed scrutiny of the proposals in consultation with treasury Ministers, now approve the establishment of the new Counciland announce this decision.    Treasury Ministers oppose our taking onthis new commitment at this time,CASE FOR THE NEW DESIGN COUNCIL6, The main considerations areS-a. Why expand engineering design activity?Greater effort is needed to encourage more talented engineersto make their careers in design, to improve the training of designersand to malce management more aware of the vital importance of the design function in their businesses.    Expenditure in this field istherefore a valuable investment in the future prosperity of someof our most important growing industries,,    The most effective and economic way of pursuing this aim is to graft this work onto the existing COID, with all its fund of experience, rather thanestablish a separate organisation,b. Why should industry itself not pay the full cost?As with existing COID activities, some considerable part of thetotal cost will in fact be paid by industry enjoying the benefit of specific services - e, g, charges for the display of goods atexhibitions, fees for courses and for designer training, publicationsbought etc.    Many of the activities, however, will be educationalin the widest sense and cannot in practice be provided on a directfull repayment basis - examples are, awards for good design,careers advice, promoting designer training, promotional visits to firms etc.It might also be thought that the Council should seek donations from individual firms towards the cost of its general activities.    Thereare two difficulties here; first, the value of the Council is sowidely diffused that few firms, and particularly those most needing
the benefit of its activities, would be prepared to support ifcj  and second, by accepting donations from individual firms the Councilv/ould prejudice its ability to set high design standards in the goods which it displays in its exhibitions and includes in its index of gooddesign.c.      Could the job be done at a substantially lower cost?The proposals are considered to provide the minimum level of activity necessary for an effective impact on standards of engineering design.    It is estimated that there are some50 engineering designers for every other industrial designerin the country, and about 16 times as many at graduate level.At the same time, each of the main engineering specialisationshas design problems peculiar to itself.    Any substantial scalingdown of the proposals for engineering design would result in anineffective organisation which would not command the support ofthe Council of Engineering Institutions or of other interested bodies,conclusion.        The Minister of Technology and I are both convinced that theseproposals represent a most desirable, and relatively small, investment in our future prosperity which v/ill pay high dividends, and one which wemust accept even in our present difficulties.   Both the Council of engineering Institutions and the Confederation of British industry have made clear to us their strong support.8. I accordingly invite my colleagues to approve the reorganisation of the Council of Industrial Design into proposed Design Council withoutdelay, at a cost to public funds which will amount to an additionalmillion per year when it is fully operative, this approval not to preclude further consideration of the detail of the proposals to determine whether some marginal saving in total costs may not be made.M A C NBoard of Trade SW121 September 19703
