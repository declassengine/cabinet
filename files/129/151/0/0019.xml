DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE BRITISH CONTRIBUTION TO development memorandum by the Minister of Overseas DevelopmentINTRODUCTIONIn the light of the Cabinets discussions on 14 and 15 September,I am reluctant to make recommendations which may lead to increasedpublic expenditure; but it is necessary for us now to reach decisions about the Governments attitude to the Second Development Decade, to beinaugurated next month at the Special Session of the General assembly which the Prime Minister will attend,2,     The position is that the British Government in 1964 accepted thefirst United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD I)target of 1 per cent of national income for financial resource flows to developing countries.    At the Second UNCTAD in 1968 the target was raised to 1 per cent of Gross National Product (GNP), comprisingofficial flows, private investment and export credits.    The target was accepted by the Governments of developed countries, in most cases with no date attached.    The Labour Government accepted it without date on a&quot;best endeavours&quot; basis and subject to a reservation about our balance ofpayments.3.     During the early 1960s we achieved on average the target of1 per cent GNP.    Official resource flows varied between 0.5 per cent and 0. 59 per cent of GNP.    Under the Labour Government this percentagegradually declined to 0, 39 per cent (see Annex).    Last year an unusualcombination of high export credits and high investment restored the totalflow almost to 1 per cent of GNP.    In November the Labour government undertook to achieve the 1 per cent target not later than 1980, and said itmight be achieved soon after 19?5 if private flows were high.4.     The future prospects for net private resource flows haverecently been analysed by officials.    In the mid-1970s they are likely tobe less than 0. 5 per cent.    If so, it will be impossible to get back to the1 per cent target, with official flows also below 0. 5 per cent.CP(70) 44COPY NO22 September 1970CABINET1
THE PEARSON REPORT AND THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT DECADE5.     The Pearson Report last year called on dcnor countries to achieve this 1 per cent target by 1975 at latest? and by 1980 at latest a new target of 0. 7 per cent for official development assistance.    At the25th Anniversary Session of the United Nations Genera] Assembly next month the Second Development Decade will be inaugurated by theadoption of a &quot;strategy document&quot;.    This deals with a variety of matters,including trade and shipping as well as aid, but the developing countriesregard the question of commitments to increased flows by specified datesas fundamental.     The document is likely to recommend the attainment,at least by 1975, of the 1 per cent target for total resource flows andalso (in a form not yet settled) a substantial target for official develop-ment assistance.    If we cannot accept these targets we shall have to declare our reservations, and the Prime Ministers speech at theAssembly will be awaited with special interest.OUR PRESENT POSITION6,   (i)   In opposition, v/e criticised the inadequacy of the labour government^ proposals, and implied that our performancewould be much improved.(ii)   In our election manifesto, we accepted the UNCTAD targetand undertook to increase the British programme as national prosperity returned.(iii)   The Queen&apos;s Speech committed the Government to an expanding aid programme.THE BRITISH INTEREST7.     I believe it is important, for the following reasons, that weshould accept this major concept of the Second Development Decade -the attainment of the 1 per cent target not later than 1975;-(i)    Ten of the sixteen &quot;developed&quot; countries, including france,Germany, Japan and Italy, have already reached 1 per cent, or are prepared to commit themselves to do so by 1975.    the americans are unlikely to accept any date for reaching the target; but their position is unique.    By scorning the targetdate, we should isolate ourselves from major donors likeFrance, Germany and Japan.(ii)    If we stood aside from such a commitment, it might appearthat we were going back on our pledge at UNCTAD II, andwould imply a lack of confidence in our future economicperformance.2
(iii) Our unwillingness to improve on our present performance might cause other countries to have second thoughts, and thus put at risk the whole impetus of the Decade,(iv) A general increase in aid will help Britain.    The commonwealth countries are a large part of the developing world, and much ofany general increase is bound to flow to them.    British aid is less than 7 per cent of total aid flows, but our share in the tradewith developing countries is 9 per cent.(v) The average per capita income of the growing populations inthe developing countries should increase by about 3, 5 per centannually if the major donors (including Britain) achieve the1 per cent target in the mid-1970s.    With anything smaller,the gap in standards between the developed and the developingworld will widen still further.OFFICIAL FLOWS8,     The Treasury proposals for the next four years are as follows2971/2   W2/3   WS/4   1974/5 m         m         m  m*net at constant prices 206 214 234 255in gross cash 245 2 65 3 00 340as a % of GNP on currentforecasts , 39 .39 .41 .44Before the Cabinet&apos;s discussions on 14 and 15 September, I had it inmind to propose the following figures, to bring progressively within reach the percentage of 0. 5 per cent for official flows in the financialyear 1975/6.1971/2    1972/3     1973/4   1974/5 m  m  m  m*net at constant prices 215 229        248        273in gross cash 255 281 316        362as a % of GNP .41        .42        . 44        , 47*Net at constant prices -. the sum available each year less capitalrepayments due from past aid loans deflated to allow for projectedprice increases.Gross cash - the sum available in cash each year, the purchasingpower of which may be affected by price changes from year to year.3
PROPOSALS9.     I do not now think it right to press these figures, but I ask theCabinet to agree to the following proposals :-(i)    At the General Assembly, the Prime Minister should pledgeour best endeavours to reach the 1 per cent target by 1975,with a substantial element of official aid in our total flows;and, to give effect to this, I propose that -(ii)    an interdepartmental Working Party of officials be asked toexamine ways of stimulating private investment in the developing countries, so that positive steps could be taken towards the target without throwing a heavy burden on theExchequer;(iii) the Treasury proposals for official flows for the years1971/2 and 1972/2 should be accepted;(iv) the Treasury proposals for the years 1973/4 and 1974/5 shouldprovisionally stand but should be subject to an assessment inthe year 1972/3, both of the effectiveness of measures to stimulate private investment and the extent of official flowsnecessary to achieve the 1 per cent target;(v)    as a result of that assessment, the figures for the years1973/4 and 1974/5 should if necessary be revised, in orderto make likely the attainment of the 1 per cent target in theyear 1975/6.iiTltesQ proposals would not eats.se the staff *aqtiJj?em&amp;-ni9 of my Departmentto increase.R WMinistry of Overseas Development SWl18 September 19704
