OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 35 COPY NO  5 429 July 1970CABINETFUTURE OF THE OPEN UNIVERSITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science . At the meeting of Cabinet held on 23 July 1970 the Chief secretary and I were asked 1. to examine urgently the possibility of reducing the firstintake of students to the Open University, and report the position at themeeting on 30 July; and II. to consider the possibility of making additionalreductions In expenditure, and report the outcome by mid-September.2.        We had a discussion on 20 July, and considered the following alternative possibilities, via:a. Keeping the annual intake at 25,000, the figure announced inMarch this year.b. Reducing the annual intake from 25, 000 to 15, 000.We were unable to reach agreement, and we considered a third possibilityviz. immediate closure of the Open University.3.        The financial implications of each of these three courses are set outin Appendix A, which is agreed between us.    As we were unable to reach agreement we have set out our respective views in separate papers.4,        With reference to the possibility of making additional reductions in expenditure with a view to reporting by mid-September, we came to theconclusion that this possibility, other than on the basis of intake, was slight,and for present purposes not worth pursuing.M H t department of Education and Science Wl29 July 1970
APPENDIX a financial implications(a)    Ctudent intake of 25.000Grant-in-aid already notified by the Department to theUniversity, covering the period up to December 19735 isas follows:-F.Y.         1970-71      1971-72 1972-73     1973-74- m              m  m              mRecurrent          4             6.2 7.3            8.capital              1.8            .8Total 5.8 7.0 7.3 8.4(The grant for 1970-71 has been authorised by Parliament,but not the grant for later years).To this would be added further capital expenditure over this period estimated at  4.2m. Peak expenditure wouldnot be reached until 1975? and might then level out at&quot;about  11m a year.(b)    Student intake of 15.Q0QThe basic costs of the University remain virtually constant,whatever the number of students, and a reduction in theannual intake will not produce a proportionate reductionin total expenditure.    A reducation to 15,000 could produce an annual saving of about  1.6m by 1973-74-,  1.9m in1974-75. and more later on.   In the first year or two, thereal, as distinct from theoretical, savings would 7(fbe less than  1m, because equipment and course materialhave already been ordered for 25,000 students.1.
(c)   Closure of the Open UniversityExpenditure to date on the Open University is approximately  3m, but grant-in-aid approved byParliament for 1968-69 to 1970-71! amounts to nearly  7m.The University authorities have necessarily under-taken heavy financial commitments which the Governmentwould have to meet either directly or by way ofcompensation.    The main commitments are:-(a)    Contract with the BBCj..(bjj    contracts with the staff;(c) arrangements and contracts with manufacturers and publishers for producing books andcourse materials, and(d) arrangements and contracts with variouseducational bodies and institutions for the lease of premises to serve as regional centres and local study centres.If the project were abandoned, it is estimated that a totalof  8m or more, including compensation, would have been    1,spent with little to show for it, except buildings on the sivalued at   1.4m.
