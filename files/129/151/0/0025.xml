[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT54CP(70) 50 COPY NO---24 September 1970CABINETA POLICY FOR THE ARTSMemorandum by the Paymaster general. Our Election Manifesto contained the following passage:-   &quot;we will continue to give full financial support and encouragement to the Arts.The Arts Council will be strengthened so that it can take a more active role in stimulating regional co-operation and in establishing effective regionalarts associations.    Local authorities will be encouraged to play a largerrole in patronage of the Arts.    We recognise the vital importance ofprivate patronage.    We will devote special attention to those areas ofartistic life such as museums and music colleges which face particularlyacute problems&quot;.2,        Our policy for the Arts will have to be developed in a variety of directions.    This may not require much direct subvention.    More skilfuluse can be made of the mass communications, particularly television, inorder to raise the quality of the programmes and activities in which largenumbers of people can participate.    Where more money is needed, it must come both from public funds and private sources.    Public funds could beused more often to stimulate private subventions, which will have the effectof reducing claims on public expenditure and result in more people talcing adirect interest in the Arts0    Taking an interest in the Arts, like voluntary service in general, is Conservative policy and the experience of othercountries shows that this is greatly stimulated by quite modest tax reliefs.3.        I need time to develop my policies in such a way that they can be properly costed and set in the context of a forward-looking programme.Nevertheless, there are some measures we must take in 1971-72 even tohold the position which we have inherited.ARTS COUNCIL4.        The most immediate problem is the financial situation of the arts council, which has reached a state of crisis.    During the past five years the Council has done.much good work, but it has taken on commitmentswithout being in a pofeition to count the cost for future years.    The resultI 1I CONFIDENTIAL
is that, if it is to avoid retrenchment to a degree that would make itimpossible to claim we had fulfilled our own pledges, it now needs more money over the next few years thasathe previous Government had promised.The Arts Council have asked for  12,8 million for 1971-72,    I have beeninto the matter with care and I am satisfied that the minimum grantnecessary to maintain the worthwhile activities now supported by the arts Council is  11,84 million for recurrent and capital expenditure.This figure is in cash terms (1971 prices); those in Tables I and II areat 1970 prices,5,        I am determined to get a grip on the situation which the arts council has allowed to develop,    Sadler s Wells by the end of 1969-70had accumulated a deficit of the order of  220, 000 in spite of the factthat the previous Government, in liquidating the accumulated indebtednessof Sadlers Wells, the Royal Opera House and the National Theatre gave a clear warning that this must not happen again.    In addition, the WelshNational Opera Company had a deficit of  57.000,    These deficits wouldbe extinguished in the grant I propose in paragraph 4,    I shall insist onstricter planning and control by the Council in future.    They will be askedto calculate more realistically the recurrent costs of commitments whichthey have taken on, and when they accept a new obligation they must see itis properly budgeted for.    The fulfilment of these requirements will infuture be a condition of their annual grant.6,        Thus, even to make time will involve additional expenditure in1971-72,    This is without any allowance for repairing the comparativeneglect of museums and galleries, which do not come under the arts council, and no more could be done for the Arts in the regions despite the Governments explicit pledge to increase assistance, unless the arts council were able to divert resources from existing commitments,7,        Now for positive policy measures.    As I have said, I need time todevelop a coherent policy for the Arts and this paper, therefore, does no more than indicate firmly the additional resources needed in 1971-72together with tentative estimates for the years thereafter up to 1974-75,Table I in Annex I shows the existing PESC forecasts, and Table II theadditional sums needed for 1971-72,LIBRARIES8,        I have not attempted in this paper to deal with my responsibilities for libraries,    I am, however, circulating separately a paper on theprinciple of charging for the use of public libraries and in a few weeks,I will be presenting to my colleagues a draft of a White Paper on theestablishment of a British Library, which would administer the mostimportant national library institutions, including the Library of the british museum,
NEW NATIONAL CAPITAL PROJECTS9. Such important new projects as the building of a Scottish OperaHouse, the building of a National Theatre for Wales, and the extensionof the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden will be the subjects of aseparate paper.    The total cost of these projects will not fall in fullon central Government funds (eg Edinburgh Corporation have asked the Government for a grant approximately half the cost of the OperaHouse) but for the convenience of my colleagues I have attached at annex 2, a preliminary breakdown of the incidence of costs on thecapital works programme if a decision were taken to proceed withthese three major projects of national importance.    Provision forEdinburgh Opera House is already included in the PESC forecast preparedby the Secretary of State for Scotland but all these projects cannot be metwithin the existing forecasts of expenditure without the abandonment ofexisting policy for the Arts,NATIONAL MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES10.       The 12-year building programme for national galleries and museumsmajor capital works has now run half its course.    It is clear that the fundsremaining for the reet of the 12-year period are not sufficient for theessential requirements of the museums and galleries almost all of whichhave projects in the pipeline.    The figures in Annex 1 allow for an increaseof some  2 million in 1972-73.    I shall review the situation as a matter of urgency, in conjunction with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and wales and the Minister of Public Building and Works,11,        The national mueeums and galleries have an urgent need to showbetter the collections they already have and to meet the demands fromscholars and research workers and from the public for education and information.    These museums and galleries, strengthened in this way,would be asked to help provincial institutions by loan of collections, advice and training staff.    The provision and selection of materials for loansrequires adequate storage space and the reserve collections to be fullycatalogued.    A large backlog of minor v/orks needs to be removed beforemuch more can be done either to improve services on the spot or to help the provinces.    A start should be made in 1971-72 towards reducing thebacklog in the expectation that the arrears would be cleared within threeyears.    Providing a service to meet the current and growing demands fromthe public also requires more staff, and there is a very strong case for additional expenditure on wages and salaries in 1971-72 and succeedingyears.12.       In conjunction with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and wales am looking at the possibility of instituting entrance charges at museums and galleries, and the prospects for a much greater devolution of authorityto the national institutions with the aim of making some of their activities,eg publications, self-supporting in a commercial sense,
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT13.       So far I have dealt with national institutions.    I now turn to theequally important question of regional activities which we must alsodevelop and strengthen^    Private support, not forgetting donationsfrom industry, for regional arts associations could be stimulated ifwe can prime the pump in a variety of ways.    The attraction of the regional associations is that they discover local initiative and support.The associations, which differ widely in their stage of development and effectiveness, do not cover the whole country.    The existing associationswill have to be strengthened and the gaps filled.    If the associations canbe helped to produce long-term plans for developing the Arts in theirregion, it will make it easier to raise the generally low level of support from local authorities, industry and other private sources,14.       The Housing the Arts in the Regions Fund operated by the arts council has been highly successful, existing particularly in stimulating the provision of new arts buildings and the improvement of buildings.Under this Fund the Council provide up to 50 per cent of the cost of anew development, the rest being met from private and local authorityfunds.    There is a real danger that the Fund might have to be suspendedunless the commitment ration is raised from the present level of  500,000a year unchanged since 1966.   I, therefore, propose that the ration shouldbe  750,000 in 1971-72 and  1 million in 1972-73 and thereafter with the consequent increases in capital expenditure by the Arts Council shown inTable II.15.       Provincial museums and galleries, a small number of which areexcellent, which have long been the &quot;poor cousins&quot; of the Arts world,could become important centres for the artistic life of the neighbourhoodand the movement already under way to collect and display the materialsrelating to local activities could be increased.    At present, staff displayspace, facilities for children and amenities are inadequate almosteverywhere.    At the moment there is no specific incentive for encouraging the development of these museums and galleries and we should start a housing the museums fund analogous to the Housing the Arts Fund,    Anincrease in the grants in aid of purchases by local museums is not at thisstage as urgent as help to show better the material they already possessor could be loaned by other museums,16.       The British Film Institute, whose regional film theatres showingthe film as an Art form are very popular, deserve extra support,17,       The Arts Council has put up an imaginative scheme for a theatreinvestment fund designed to reinvigorate the commercial theatre,particularly in the provinces, by backing new productions of quality,with a preference for those which would go on tour.    The scheme requiresfurther study, but the intention is that the fund itself would be made up of 0,1 million from the Arts Council and  0,15 million from private resources.
SURVEYS18.       We have not at present enough adequate facts and figures about thedemand for the Arts to produce a considered policy on how to improve themarket for them.    I need to put in hand some wide-ranging surveys,market research and other studies, as have been so intensively carriedout in Sweden, so that our future support, both national and regional,can be firmly based on adequate statistics,CONCLUSION19.       I would hope that these proposals for additional expenditure,amounting to  1. 6 million, will not lead to greatly increased demands on central Government funds in succeeding years, and this expectationis based on the belief that substantial sums from private sources and perhaps from local authorities can be attracted,20,      I invite my colleagues to agree that the amount forecast for expenditure on the Arts in 1971-72 should be increased by  1,6 million to sustain the first steps towards the creation of a distinctive policy forthe Arts based on the undertaking made in the Conservative Manifesto,EDepartment of Education and Science Wl23 September 1970
