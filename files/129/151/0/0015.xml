CONCORDE1, At its meeting on 30 July (CM(70) 11th Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet decided to consider civil aircraft projects further in September.This paper deals with Concorde.TECHNICAL PROSPECTS2.        The target performance for the aircraft on entry into service in 1974is a payload of 20,000 lb cruising at twice the speed of sound (M s 2) betweenParis and New York.    Two years after entry into service the target payloadis 25, 000 lb under the same conditions.3. The prototype Concorde has now flown at just over if times the speed of sound.    Within this limit the handling has been good, as have the take-off and landing characteristics.    Reliability has been better than expected,-4. Despite this encouraging picture, the target performance at entry into service can only be achieved by the provision of a new nozzle which will cost at least  30 million and on which only initial development work to theend of September 1970 has so far been authorised.    There are still areasof great uncertainty in performance - accounting for nolecs fchanj; 8, 0001b ofpayload - and these will not be significantly reduced until the results offlight at M s 2 have been assessed.    This is not now likely to be beforeearly 1971 by which time the margin of uncertainty about the aircraft1 soverall performance should have been reduced to jr. 3-4, 000 lbs.    Theseremaining uncertainties will be progressively reduced over the period1971-74.NOISE5.        All airlines are worried about the acceptability of Concorde at majorairports.    At entry into service the aircraft should, though this is not yetcertain, meet the present limits at Heathrow and New York (Kennedy).But the rules at the latter may well be made more stringent by the timeConcorde enters service and there will equally be pressures on theGovernment to tighten those at Heathrow.    British Aircraft Corporation(BAG) expect Air France and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC)to ask for guarantees before they place orders that they will be allowed to operate from Heathrow and Kennedy Airports in 1974 and subsequently.Guarantees in these terms could not be given though we do expect by march 1971 to be reasonably clear whether Concorde will comply with thepresent lirnitsj if it does, and subject to the point about United States noiserestrictions in paragraph 18 below, it is reasonable to hope that it will be exempted from any additional restrictions and that this will meet the positionof the airlines.1
SONIC BOOM6. The United States, together with a number of European countries,have already Indicated their intention of banning commercial supersonicflying over their national territory.    Concorde^ commercial prospects and sales forecasts have therefore been based on the assumption that alloverland supersonic flying will be banned.COMMERCIAL, PROSPECTS7.        The Anglo-French Concorde Economic Prospects Committee(CEPC) completed in May a further study of the market and of commercial prospects.    The French and United Kingdom members of the Committeewere in reasonably close agreement on the range of possible sales.    TheUnited Kingdom members considered that sales were likely to be between50 and 150 at a price of $28 million in January 1970 prices (the price onwhich all subsequent calculations in this paper are based).    The Frenchmembers of the Committee put the range at 85 to 155.    Where the two sidesdiffer is in their judgment about where, within this range, the number of sales is most likely to fall.    The United Kingdom members considered it more likely to be in the lower half (50 to 100) while the French believe thatthe most likely figure for actual sales is 130.8.        Airline reactions, including those of United States airlines, so farare unenthusiastlc.    boac&apos;s assessment is that for a small network of 5routes, which would require 5 aircraft, they would be considerably lesswell-off with a mixed fleet of Concordes and Boeing 747s than with anall-747 fleet, particularly in the initial years.    They estimate that operationof Concorde will reduce their profitability by about  3 million per aircraft in 1975-76, falling to a little over  1 million per aircraft in 1979-80,   Theirassumptions are open to argument at this stage but their evidence certainlypoints to an overall worsening of their financial position if they operateConcorde and would tend to confirm the lower end of the estimates made bythe United Kingdom members of the CEPC.    BOAC are prepared to operateConcorde provided arrangements are made to ensure that their overallposition is not thereby worsened.    If the project goes ahead, therefore,the Government will have to be prepared to negotiate, before orders are placed, a subsidy for BOAC or other financial terms on which they will agree to operate Concorde.    The grant of a subsidy to BOAC or to air France would become known, and would prejudice sales prospects toother airlines.    However, it is reasonable to expect that the other airlineswould feel compelled to buy in order to remain competitive.    Option holdersare not required to convert the options into purchases until 6 months afterBOAC and Air France have purchased: their decisions are not expected tobe made before the spring of 1971, so firm information about furtherpurchases may not be available until towards the end of 1971.    Until BOACand Air France have signed contracts9 the intention of other prospectivepurchasers will remain obscure.2
DEVELOPMENT COSTS9. The current estimate of total (British and French) development costs including the cost of the new nozzle is  800- 850 million atJanuary 1970 prices,,    This will have to be revised upwards unlessthe results of flight tests at M 3 2 are significantly better than is now expected,ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT10,       British and French officials agree that there is no chance of getting back any of the  480 million spent or committed to the end ofJune 1970 by the tv/o Governments,    Taking into account only future expenditure on development and production, and disccmting future costs and receipts to present value at 10 per cent, then within the ranges of salesprospects (50-150) and development costs ( 800- 850 million) discussedabove, the excess of discounted costs to the United Kingdom over benefitsranges between  103 million and  177 millions, the &quot;Implied preference&quot;between 14 per cent and 61 per cent, and the United Kingdom Governmentsdiscounted loss on future development expenditure between  75 million and 125 million,    (These figures make no allowance for any increase in development costs beyond  850 million nor for any operating subsidyor lowered return from BOAC),    (A fuller aseessment is set out in the annex),LEGAL POSITIONllt        The French maintain that by virtue of the Agreement of 1962termination of the project can only be in agreement between the twopartners.    The British view is that following the correspondence in1968 between Mr, Benn and M, Chamant v/e are now proceeding on a stage-by-stage basis, with each Governments commitment limited towhat is agreed for each stage.    We told the French earlier this yearthat we regarded our commitment as extending only to the end of June 1970,12,       It would be prudent to work on the assumption that if we were towithdraw from Concorde unilaterally the French would take the matter to the International Court,    When the Law Officers advised on the legal position in July, their opinion was that if the French did so the Court wouldbe more likely to find in our favour than against us, but that if the Courtdid find against us the damages awarded would most probably amount to between  40 million and  60 million? the possibility of damages of up to 230 million (this being the total amount spent by the French on the projectso far) could not be excluded,FRENCH COMMITMENT TO THE PROJECT13,       Although it is clear that the French Treasury has been increasingly concerned about the costs of Concorde, and has beenbringing pressure to bear inside the French Government, there has
been no apparent indication that the French Government as a whole isweakening in its commitment to the project.    The French continue toconsider that we should await the results from the tests at M s 2 and review the situation thereafter.INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE FOR AND AGAINSTCONCORDE14.       While there is no economic case for continuing with the project,we are in a treaty relationship with the French and, even if we can argue that we are now legally free to withdraw, such action in the face of theirwish to continue the project would be represented as a breach of faith whichcould be expected to have wide repercussions both on our relations with theFrench and on our wider international reputation.    In particular, a case inthe International Court on this issue could be damaging to our relationswith France in the two or three years before a decision was reached andto our international standing if the judgment were unfavourable.15.       The hostility aroused in Paris by the unilateral cancellation of concorde would be likely to spill over into our negotiations to join theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.),,    The French would be able to argue that this demonstrated our undependability as future members ofthe Community and our insistence on our own narrow financial interestsabove all else.    It would be particularly easy for the French to attack usin this way if we withdrew unilaterally even before the tests at M 3 2 had shown what the aircraft could do.    If the results of the tests were as now expected the French could still advance the same argument.    We would however then be in a position to argue that we had given the aircraft everychance to prove itself technically,16.       It would be possible to argue that Concorde had become purely aprestige project (the French agree with us that it is bound to show a loss in economic terms), that its commercial prospects were very poor and thatit was not in our interests or those of the Community that our economiesshould be burdened with projects of this nature.    In the circumstances,v/e could also argue the French refusal to agree to terminate the projectv/as unreasonable.    However, in the light of recent advice from the postsconcerned, we have no reason to believe that these arguments would cutany ice with the French at this stage.    They would not be alone among the eec countries in considering a unilateral decision as evidence of ourunreliability as a partner.    This in turn could affect the attitude of theother e.c. countries to the negotiations for our accession.    On the otherhand, it is reasonable to assume that the French Governments attitude toour accession to the e.c., and a fortiori that of the other Governments,will be determined by a much wider assessment of where the balance oftheir interest lies than the fate of one project however great its individualimportance.
THE AMERICAN SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT (SST)17.       The United States Administration appears committed to developmentof the Boeing 2707 and has declared its willingness to finance the bulk ofthe development programme.    The Boeing 2707 will be larger (about 280seats as compared with 130 for Concorde), faster and noisier than Concorde.The programme has attracted strong opposition on economic and&quot;environmental&quot; grounds.    Y/hen the SST appropriation for the UnitedStates fiscal year 1971 comes up for approval in the Senate, probably inSeptember, voting is expected to be close, though the appropriation isgenerally expected to pass,18,       Concorde and the Boeing 2707 are to some extent mutually supporting1.If Concorde were cancelled it would strenthen the anti-supersonic lobby inthe United States and make easier a decision to drop or postponeindefinitely the American aircraft,,    A decision to cancel the Bossing 2707would almost certainly make the operation of Concorde more difficult, sincethe United States Administration would no longer have any incentive to side with SST manufacturers on the question of noise,19o       Concorde is now so far advanced that there would be littlepossibility of collaboration between Boeing, BAG and SNIAS in its development.    If Concorde is a technical success, and the AmericanGovernment decides to continue with the development of a bigger andfaster aeroplane, some possibility of collaboration might emerge in thefuture, but there is no basis at present on which to start exploring any ofthese possibilities with the Americans.    Nor is there any reason to suppose that the French would support such collaboration at the present time.Discussions could not start without their agreement,PUBLIC EXPENDITURE20.       The United Kingdom share of expenditure is now running at separately of over  1 million per week, and by the end of March 1970 220 million had been spent.    Looking to the future, the positionis as follows (  million) -1970-71 71-72 72-73 73-74 74-75 75-76 total estimated future annual expenditure(a) on extramuraldevelopment 52        43       31        21        16        11      174(b) on production (net) -brackets indicate a netinflow 13        24      49        49        14      (39)     11065        67       80        70       30      (28)    284(c)   Total
Notes: 1. Concorde development costs are based on the present basicestimates of  800 million at January 1970 prices, of which theUnited Kingdom share would amount to some  394 million; they include no allowance for development cost increases to  850 million or beyond.2.        If Concorde continues, production expenditure, which willmainly be in the form of financing loans, should be recovered in later years as receipts build up from sales, but there is a strongprobability of significant Government losses being incurred on production, particularly if the $28 million sale price on which theabove forecasts are based is not achieved or if sales fall short of,say, 100 aircraft.    This is because BAG and Rolls Royce areinsisting that the Government should indemnify them against therisk of loss on production.21.       J  Concorde were stopped now potential savings would be reducedbalcw the expenditure estimates by cancellation charges of perhaps about 30 million spread over 1970-71 and 1971-72, any damages awarded by theHague Court (see paragraph 12 above) and by any expenditure incurred inrespect of consequential redundancy and unemployment.    On the other hand,BOAC would expect their capital expenditure to be significantly reduced ifthey bought more 747s instead of Concordes.DOMESTIC IMPACT OF CONCORDE CANCELLATION22.      The principal concentration of employment on Concorde is at Bristolin BAC, Filton (currently about 6,000 workers) and Rolls Royce, Bristol(currently about 4, 000 workers); BAC also employ at Weybridge about,000 workers on Concorde.    The current rate of unemployment in the bristol area is 2. 3 per cent out of a work force of about 280, 000; if oncancellation all 10, 000 Concorde workers were to come on to the registerthe unemployment rate would rise to nearly 6 per cent.    previous experience of redundancies in the aircraft industry has been that by nomeans all those currently employed are made redundant, and that mostredundant workers are absorbed within a few months; but a localconcentration on this scale has not occurred before and many of thosere-deployed might replace others less qualified who in turn might swell theunemployment registers.    Many of those with higher and specialised skillson the development side would have difficulty in finding comparableemployment locally,,    On the other hand, Bristol is an area of rapid growth.In the short term there would be considerable additional unemployment fora time; it is difficult to assess its likely scale or duration but, by way ofillustration, it would cost the Exchequer in social security benefits and losses of contributions and taxation some  0.45 million per 1,000 menunemployed for the first 6 months.23,       In the longer term the economy of the Bristol area is soundly basedwith substantial prospects.    Continued growth at the present rate is likely torequire little or no movement In of mobile industry.    Even if work on concorde comes to an end the check to growth should be only temporary,while if it goes into quantity production, there will be some further increasein the rate of Bristol&apos;s growth.6
24.       The cancellation cf Concorde would probably cause BAC to closeFilton completely but the transfer or redundancy of the other workersthere (3,400) would probably be phased over a considerable period.    Theunemployment rate in the Weybridge area is currently less than 1.2 per centout of a work force of nearly 80, 000 spread over a large travel to work area.No long term unemployment problems arising out of cancellation areforeseen.    The longer term impact on Rolls Royce Bristol is moredependent on the work load of the R.nicholls Royce group as a whole.25.       Sub-contracting and equipment contracts for Concorde absorb about ,000 jobs spread over many firms and areas.    No major short or longer term unemployment problems are foreseen but some sectors of the equipment industry may be hard hit by the denial of opportunity to reapproduction benefit from their development effort.26,       The impact on employment of cancelling Concorde, particularlyoutside BAC, Filton, would be softened if meanwhile a decision had beentaken to go ahead with the BAC 311 and the RB 211-61 engine.    these projects and the impact on the industry of possible decisions on them aswell as Concorde will be discussed in a further paper,r)27.       Concorde has become a symbol of this countryrs efforts in the field of advanced technology.    The aircraft industry and possibly those working in other advanced technology industries and some of the public will not accept that cancellation is evidence of a determination to put the countryf8technological resources orly into economically rewarding projects.    Tothe extent that they do not, cancellation will have an adverse effect onmorale, possibly extending beyond the aircraft industry Itself.    On theother hand, Concorde is demonstrably uneconomic, and there are many who would see cancellation as encouraging evidence of the governments determination to eliminate waste in public spending.    Cancellation wouldalso be welcomed by those in the United Kingdom who are v/orried aboutthe effects of supersonic aircraft on the environment,,SUMMARY OF PROSPECTS28.      Even if all expenditure already committed is written off, any reasonable evaluation indicates that future expenditure will, even taking themost favourable assumptions, result in substantial losses.    Moreovercurrent expenditure at about  1 million a week is very substantial both initself and in relation to the reductions in public expenditure which ministers are currently seeking.    The case for continuing to spend this money is not economic but rests on a complex of non-economic factors -the most important of which is the impact of withdrawal on our internationalposition and, in particular on our relations with France and on the EECnegotiations.    These factors will in the future, as in the past, make it verydifficult to cancel the project at any time, unless the aircraft doessubstantially v/orse in the remaining tests than is now expected.    The real question is therefore, whether we should be prepared to continue an uneconomic project and, if so, on what basis we should do so,7
POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION29.       Against this background there are in practice two courses open atthis stage:1. To withdraw immediatelyThis would have to be a unilateral withdrawal since there is no prospect of cancelling now in agreement with the French.2.        To agree to continue until 31 March 1971 when the positionwould again be reviewedMinisters would then have to decide, on the basis of the assessment of the flight tests at M ^ 2 and any firmer indication of airlinethinking, whether or not to continue with the project.    If theresults of the flight tests are significantly W03T S6 than expectedthere will be a reasonable possibility of securing French agreement to cancellation on the grounds that the prospects had deterioratedto a point where It was clearly unreasonable to go on with the project.    But it is more likely that results wiJl be generally in line with predictions, in which case our position, including our forecasts of the aircraftts technical and commercial prospects, will be verymuch the same as now.30.      As to the choice between the courses, to safeguard our legal and diplomatic position if for no other reason, a decision to withdraw wouldhave to be preceded by discussions with the French.    Flight trials at M * 2will begin in October.    If Course 1 were adopted the necessary priordiscussions with the French would be taking place while the trials were inprogress.    The Law Officers advised in July that there was little to choose between the &quot;courses, but chey take the view that the nearer we get to theM s 2 tests, the more difficult it becomes to withdraw before the tests havebeen completed and assessed,    In negotiating asd diplomatic terms theadvantage lies with Course 2.    On the other hand, the ordering positionand sales prospects will not be much clearer in March 1971 than they arenow; the choice between continuation of the project and termination willnot be any easier.    And we will have spent a further  30 million.31.       If Ministers decide against Course 1, there is no need for a decision,even of a tentative nature, as to our line of action next spring.    The news of even a tentative decision might leak.    Officials would moreover beplaced in an extremely difficult position In their contacts with the French ifthey had to work against a background of a decision, even a tentative one,to withdraw from the project,    A tentative decision now to withdraw wouldnot lead to any reduction in public expenditure.    Expenditure and commit-ments are already being limited as far as practicable and further reductions could not be achieved without it becoming apparent to the firms and theFrench that effectively we had decided to withdraw.    If v/e continue with the project we must, however, take suitable action with the French to preserveour legal position.
METHOD OF PROCEEDING32, The detailed procedures v/hich it is suggested should be followed if ministers decide in favour of Course 1 or Course 2 are set out in Annex B.9

The difference betweenthe export credit interest rate and the discount rate has been taken into account in calculating thediscounted &quot;receipts&quot; column.The calculations also assume that costs, receipts, and losses will be shared equally between the 2countries.     In practice the UK will be responsible for less than half of the production and theimplied preferences, would range between 2-6 percentage points higher than those indicated above.
ANNEX BMETHOD OF PROCEEDINGCOURSE 11. If Course 1 is adopted, there are two possible methods of proceeding!a. A communication to the French Government that wehad decided to withdraw from the project and requesting an urgent meeting to discuss the necessary arrangements forterminating contracts etc.This has the merit of making a clean, sharp break and avoidsthe risk of our decision leaking before we are ready to annouce our decision to the firms and publicly.    There are, however,considerable objections on foreign policy grounds to proceeding in this way.    The French have been our partners in Concorde for years.    To inform them without any prior discussion that we had decided to withdraw would be politically damaging and do consider-able harm to our posture in Europe,    There is also the legalobjection that not to have offered to negotiate with the Frenchfor an agreed withdrawal would be prejudicial to our position before the International Court,b, A communication to the French Government setting out our doubts about Concorde and the need to save public expenditure and indicating that in our view the right course was to terminate the project.    The letter would request an urgent meeting with theFrench Government to review the position.The French would almost certainly reject our view of the positionand argue that the project should be continued.    Having listened toall the French had to say and considered any proposals they had tomake, we would then after a suitable period formally notify themthat we had decided to withdraw from the project.    This course ofaction is much to be preferred in terms of our foreign regulations.But the news would almost certainly leak following our firstcommunication to the French Government when we should bein the middle of the M s 2 tests.    This would, be embarrassingand might also be considered unreasonable by the public at large.If this course is adopted it would be desirable to press aheadrapidly with the discussions with the French, and to annouce our withdrawal as soon as possible thereafter.2.        In view of the magnitude of a decision to withdraw it would no doubt be appropriate that the communication, whatever form it takes, should bemade to the French Government at Prime Minister level.
COURSE 230 If Course 2 is adopted the decision should be communicated to theFrench Government by the Minister of Technology as soon as practicable.In doing so he would -i. Maintain the British view that the commitment of each government is now limited to what is agreed stage by stage.ii. Express the Governments continued anxiety about theprogramme on the various grounds: continued escalation of costs, noise, sales prospects, etc.iii. Make it clear that, in continuing beyond June 1970, britain was not to be taken as accepting that continuation of the project was justified on the basis of current reports by the ConcordeDirecting Committee and the CEPC,iv. Say that nevertheless we are prepared to agree to continue with the project until March 1971, on the understanding that a majorreview of the future of the project jointly with the French would beundertaken at that time in the light of the results at M s 2 and whatis then known of airline reactions and the prospects of orders.
