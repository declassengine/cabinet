OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJE3TYTG GOVERNMENTK ]CP(70) 42 COPY NO     d *22 September 1970CABINETAIDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth affairs. As indicated in Cabinet on 15 September the Minister of overseas development has modified his original proposals on the future of the aid programme.    I endorse his new suggestions.2.        Development assistance is now a major international business and,from the point of view of our overseas policy as a whole, it is ofimportance that we should accept as soon as possible the key &quot;Pearsontarget&quot; of an overall 1 per cent of Gross National Product (GNP) by 1975,on a best endeavours basis.,    On existing programmes it is probable thatwe shall fail to hit this target, but only by a fairly small margin whichmight possibly be made good by stimulation of private investment.    To fail to do so would have a disproportionately damaging effect on our international standing and influence,3.        As the Minister of Overseas Development says, the PrimeMinister will be attending the United Nations General Assembly in October,at which in effect the Second Development Decade is to be launched.    It willbe a handicap for Lim there in putting across Britain^ positive interest in development, and in getting a good hearing for points of significance to us,unless he is able to announce our acceptance of the 1 per cent overalltarget by 1975.4.        Against the background of our discussions on public expenditure, Ishould not support the proposals of the Minister of Overseas Developmentunless I were satisfied that what he is suggesting was both essential anda minimum.5.        In the last 5 years of Conservative rule we averaged over 1 per cent of GNP in total flows.    As we enter the Second Development Decade we ought to be able to look forward to returning to these standards by the endof the next 5 years.1
6. This Is important^ and I ask my colleagues to agree to the proposalsof the Minister of Overseas Development and to accept the target as defined in his paper.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office SW122 September 1970
