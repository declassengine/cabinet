DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 37 COPY NO     3 417 August 1970CABINETTHE CENTRAL, CAPABILITYNote by the Prime Minister1, My colleagues will be interested to know the progress which hasbeen made in establishing the central capability since the cabinet considered the outline of the proposal on 16 July.    The concept hasbeen further elaborated, as in the attached note; and work is now inhand on preparations for the establishment of the unit and the recruitment of its staff from the various sources on which we must try to draw if the unit is to have the requisite multi-disciplinary character.2.        The creation of a central capability of this kind is, of course, anew departure in government.    The description of its functions is necessarily, therefore, provisional at this stage; and it will be some little time before it can take root and find a definite place in the machineryof Whitehall.    Nevertheless, I believe that, properly used, it can make asubstantial contribution to the process of effective dec is ion -making and tothe development of a coherent Government strategy as the basis for the policies of individual Departments,    It is essentially interdepartmentalin character; and it is intended - and will, 1 hope, be seen - to be at theservice of the Cabinet (and its Committees) as a whole.    I ask all ministers, therefore, to ensure that their Departments give their full co-operation in helping it to come into being and to operate asa fully integrated element in our interdepartmental machinery,E H10 Downing Street SW117 August 1970
THE CENTRAL CAPABILITY1, The purposes of the new capability are to assist in identifyingissues for collective Ministerial decision, in improving the presentation of policy issues and in strengthening the broad strategic framework withinwhich collective Ministerial decisions should be taken.    It will therefore seek systematically to identify problem areas and broad policy options forfurther Departmental and interdepartmental study, to provide ministers with a better basis for forming judgments about planning priorities and toenable them to consider what changes, if any, should be made in the strategic objectives of the Government.2,        In order to carry out this task, a new unit will be established in the Cabinet Office, distinct from, but closely linked with, the existingSecretariat.    This unit will not duplicate work done by individual departments or by the Treasury on public expenditure programmes.But, working in close co-operation with Departments, it will seek to reconcile differences in the analysis of interdepartmental problems;to clarify points of significant disagreement between Departments; to identify the real issues for decision and the considerations which shouldbe taken into account in deciding them; to set the issues in the context of the Governments strategy and priorities; and to report to ministers collectively on an objective and non-Departmental basis,,    The analyticalstudies prepared by individual Departments v/ill clearly be a very important element in its work; but it will also be expected to undertakestudies of its own and to take the initiative in proposing subjects forfurther examination.3, The control and direction of the work of the new unit v/ill rest with a Committee of senior Ministers, under the chairmanship of thePrime Minister, which other Ministers will, of course, be invited toattend when subjects with which they are directly concerned are to beconsidered.    It will be the responsibility of this Committee to approve the unit&apos;s programme of work, to determining its priorities and to decide the manner in which its reports on particular questions will best be implemented,,
