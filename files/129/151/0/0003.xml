DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(70) 28 COPY NO      5427 July 1970CABINETREVIEW OF PUBLIC SERVICE and armed FORCES pensions memorandum by the Lord Privy SealSince the war, public service pensions have been increased undera series of Pensions (increase) Acts, the more recent, of which have been introduced ad hoc by successive Governments at intervals of 3 years or rather more.    Corresponding increases have been provided for retiredmembers of the Armed Forces under Royal Warrant.2.     The early Acts gave small increases on a means-tested basis.The Acts since 1959 have provided increases on scales which have givenmodest improvements for those fairly recently retired, but substantial increases for pensioners of long standing: for example the most recentAct, which took effect from 1 April 1969, gave increases of 18 per cent for those whose pensions began not later than 1 July 1955, whilst laterpensions had increases tapered down by 1 per cent or 2 per cent for eachsuccessive year to a minimum of 2 per cent on pensions which began inthe year 2 July 1966 to 1 July 1967.    The cumulative effect of the Actshas been to give the great majority of those who retired in the middle1950s full compensation for the rise in the cost of living since theirretirement:  but many of the larger pensions dating from before thatperiod, as well as the great majority of later pensions, are still wellshort of their original purchasing power.    Moreover, the successiveapplication of a series of standard scales of increase over the whole ofthe public services has   resulted in some severe anomalies: in several cases older pensions have been brought well above the level ofthose awarded more recently.BIENNIAL REVIEWS3.     It is common ground that the approach adopted in the recent Actshas now outlived its usefulness, and that a completely new system is needed for the future.    There is also agreement between the two mainparties about the form that that system should take.     Shortly beforethe General Election, the last Government committed themselves to introducing 2-yearly reviews with the object of maintaining the purchasing power of public service pensions;   our election manifesto ^contained a similar commitment.    The texts of these commitments areat Annex I.    The long-term aim of the pensioners1 organisations is full1
parit/ of pensions, i. e. bringing all past pensions up to the levelscurrently awarded for the same record of service,     Parity was,however, firmly rejected by spokesmen from both sides during thepassage of the last Pensions (increase) Act in early 1969, on groundsboth of principle and of cost? and there is little doubt that pensionersas a whole would welcome 2-yearly reviews designed to maintain the purchasing power of their pensions as a major step forward.    The lastPensions (Increase) Act provided increases with effect from 1 April 1969.We therefore need legislation to provide for a system of biennial reviews,the first to cover the period I April 1969 to 1 April 1971.EXISTING PENSIONERS4.     Merely to maintain the purchasing power of pensions as they stood in April 1969, by means of 2-year ly reviews from April 1971onwards, would do less than justice to the many existing pensionerswhose pensions at April 1969 were still well below their originalpurchasing power.    Both major Parties have recognised this and thelast Government accordingly proposed a once-for-all operation to restore the original purchasing power of existing pensions as at April 1969, from which point in time the 2-yearly reviews would takeover.    We have Paid that we will deal with the problem in a somewhat different way by bringing up all the pre-1956 pensions to the 1956 level,with appropriate increases since.    The pledge in our manifesto,however, which repeated undertakings given by Opposition spokesmenwhen the Pensions (Increase) Act 1969 was before Parliament, was based on the assumption that the pensions of those who retired after195 6 had in the main retained their purchasing power through the increases provided by the Acts after that date.     While this is true ofthe 1956 pensions, a detailed examination of the figures has shown thatit is far from the case for those of more recent origin.    Because therecent Acts concentrated the largest increases on the pensions oflongest standing, those dating from the early 1960s have done badly.Even when the increases due under the 1969 Act became effective,most of them were still 10 per cent or more below their originalpurchasing power, and many were below the level to which pensions foe comparable service first awarded many years earlier had by then been increased.    Some representative examples are shown in the tables at annex 2.5.     This highly unsatisfactory situation has some serious consequences for the pledge to increase the old pensions to 1956 levels.To carry it out in the form in which it was given ^ould mean doing nothing for those who retired in the early 1960s and have done badlyhitherto, and it would understandably be regarded by them as mostunfair.    Moreover, although 1956 was at one time represented by theOfficers! Pensions Society as an appropriate date for Armed ForcesPensions, we can now see that there is nothing about 1956 that make sit an obvious anchor for a once-for-all operation to deal with the deficiencies of the past.    On the contrary, to bring past pensions up to2
1956 levels only would cause such gross anomalies that irresistiblepressures would quickly develop for a later date and we should be in danger of being pushed in a few years towards full parity.    It isimportant that we should avoid that slippery and expensive slope.6.     One way of overcoming this difficulty would be to bring up thepre-1956 pensions to 1956 levels in accordance with our undertaking,but also to restore fully the purchasing power of those awarded since that date.    An alternative would be to bring up the oldest pensions onlyto 1946 levels and to restore purchasing power thereafter.    Either ofthese possibilities has serious financial implications, not least in the context of the radical reduction in public expenditure to which we are all committed.    Levelling up to 1956 in strict accordance with our election pledge would cost some  8 million to  10 million.    Levellingup, whether to 1946 or 1956, coupled with the restoration of the purchasing power of the more recent pensions would cost some 25 million to  30 million.    This is a very serious matter, but I am sure that it must be faced.    I suggest later in this paper ways ofeasing the additional financial burden that it represents.7.     As between levelling up to 1946 and 1956, I believe that theformer is to be preferred.    1956 is far from being the watershed thatwe had taken it to be, and if we level up to one arbitrary date, the pressures to move forward in a few years time will be very strong.There is in my judgment a real danger that we should then be on theslope that would lead us to full parity.    It is significant that theOfficers1 Pensions Society, who originally urged the adoption of 1956,are already pressing for I960, if not a later date.    Despite all this,officials have been instructed to process the 1956 proposal further,but nothing I have seen so far suggests that this will lead to anydifferent conclusion.8.     1946 - or, for the Armed Forces, the introduction of the 1945code - does represent a watershed, since it marks the beginning of thepost-war period.    Only the Armed Forces, the police and fire services and the overseas services have substantial numbers ofsurviving pensioners who retired before 1946.    Levelling up to thatdate would, therefore, present far fewer administrative and technical problems than levelling up to 1956, which would affect all the public services.    Levelling up to 1956 would be more closely in line withthe precise terms of our pledge.    But the alternative of 1946 with full cost of living compensation thereafter would, I believe, if properlypresented, be widely accepted as fully discharging the spirit of the pledge, and the other advantages it offers seem to me to be decisive,INCREASES FROM AGE 559.     We have also undertaken to reduce from 60 to 55 the minimum age for paying pension increases.    This is of particular importance toformer members of the Armed Forces, the police and fire servicesand the overseas services, who retire at relatively early dates.There is no difficulty of principle here; it is a practical question of cost and priorities.3
COST10.     To make good the loss in purchasing power of public service pensions between April 1969 and April 1971 would cost about  35 million in the first full year.    No estimate can be made of the cost of furtherbiennial reviews, since that would be wholly dependent on the rise inthe cost of living.    Levelling up to 1956, unaccompanied by any improvement in post-1956 pensions, would cost some  8 million to 10 million.    Levelling up to 1956 or to 1946 wath the restoration of purchasing power thereafter would come to some  25 million to 30 million.    By way of comparison it should be noted that parity to1969 would cost some  75 million, and to 1971 well over  100 million.Finally, a reduction from 60 to 55 in the minimum age from whichpension increases are paid would cost some  6 million to  8 million.11.     I am convinced that we must introduce biennial reviews onApril 1971 and that we must at the same time take effective steps todeal with the deficiencies of past measures.    Public Service pensionswere last increased on 1 April 1969* and the first of the biennialreviews ought therefore to deal with the period ending on 1 April 1971.The Conservative Party manifesto set out a programme for a 5-yearParliament and not a single session, and the pledge to introducebiennial reviews doeo not necessarily imply that the first such reviewwill take place in 1971.    But the pressures for action in 1971 will bevery strong.    Lord Ghackletonls letter of 3 June committed the lastGovernment to a review next year, and there will be widespreadcriticism if the expectations to which this has given rise have to be disappointed.12.    Hitherto, the shortest period between successive Acts ha6 been3 years, but this, in itself, would hardly justify a major postponement of the first review; the length of time between Acts has been one of themain criticisms of the old system.    Moreover, the cost of living hasbeen rising unusually rapidly since the 1969 Act took effect - the rise from mid-March 1969 is already over 7 per cent.    This may be compared with an increase of 6. 4 per cent between the 1956 and 1959Acts and 10. 4 per cent between those of 1959 and 1962.    (It is worth noting in passing that these figures have got progressively worse;between the 1962 and 1965 Acts the cost of living went up by 11. 3 per cent and between the 1965 and 1969 Acts by 14. 2 per cent).    The case for action ia 1971 therefore seems very strong.13.     When the commitment to reduce to 55 the minimum age for pension increases is taken into account, the cost of these proposals inthe first year rises to some  70 million ( 35 million for the firstbiennial review;  25 million to  30 million for the once-for-allincreases to deal with past deficiencies and  6 million to  8 million for reducing the minimum age from 60 to 55).     This is a formidablefigure and I have considered carefully what we might reasonably do toreduce it.4
14.    First, I suggest that we should defer for the time being thereduction in the minimum age to 55.    I do so reluctantly.    This is along-established commitment of our Party, going back to 1964, but itdoes not command the same priority as our other proposals and Ibelieve that that would be accepted even among the pensioners of the armed Forces and those public services most directly affected.     we ought, however,to make it absolutely clear that this is no more than a postponement, that this is a commitment which we will honour withinthe lifetime of this Parliament and that postponement therefore doesnot mean the repudiation of our election pledge.    I suggest that weshould do this by enacting the age reduction in the Bill, leaving the effective date to be determined by statutory instrument.    The waywill then be open for us to bring it into effect as soon as the financialposition allows, and without waiting for further legislation.    Defer-ment of the reduction in the minimum age would reduce the cost of theproposals to around  60 million.15.     Secondly, there is room for some manoeuvre over the date from which increases under the 2-yearly review should first be payable.The object of the review will be to make good the loss of purchasingpower over the period to which it relates.    Some time will be requiredto establish what increases are due and to make them payable j if the review relates to a period ending on 1 April, there is no prospect ofmaking increases effective earlier than the following September.    the choice is, therefore, between paying in September with a currenteffective date (say 1 September) or paying in September with an effective date of 1 April.    In other words there is no question of getting money into the hands of the pensioners earlier than September;the question is whether we should then pay with retrospective effect tothe end of the review period, which would give the pensioners some5 months back pay.16.     Deferment of the effective date of the increases I have proposed from 1 April to 1 September 1971 would save some  25 million in the next financial year (on the basis of a saving of some  5 million for each month of deferment), thus reducing the total use of our proposed &quot;package&quot; to some  35 million in the first year.    Moreover,whatever date is chosen on the occasion of the first review willdetermine the date from which future increases are paid.    If 1 April isconceded on this occasion, retrospection to 1 April will be inevitable onsubsequent reviews.17.     The spokesmen for the pensioners will no doubt press for an effective date of 1 April.    But it hardly seems necessary to contemplatepaying increases with 5 months retrospection on the occasion of eachreview.   The main object is to give the pensioners a continuing level of income that will enable them to support a reasonably even standard ofliving.    No doubt it will be argued that if increases are not paidretrospectively, pensions will at best lag 5 months behind movements inthe cost of living, and at worst 2 years and 5 months.    That may be so,5
but in any system of this kind some lag is inevitable.    Further, for thegreat majority of pensioners this is an enormous improvement on thepresent system.    The last Act kept some of them waiting a full 5 years for their first increases and then provided much less than the fullrestoration of purchasing power.    With the present pressure on public expenditure we cannot afford to pay a bonus representing 5 monthsarrears of increase every 2 years.    It will help us to get this acceptedif we do not introduce the Bill until after the Easter Recess next year.R ECOMME ND AT IONS18.     My recommendations are as follows(i)   We would introduce a system of biennial reviews tomaintain the purchasing power of public service pensions.(ii)   The first review should cover the period 1 April 1969to 1 April 1971.(iii) As a once-for -all measure, the oldest pensions shouldbe brought up to 1946 levels and all pensions from thatdate onwards should have their original purchasingpower restored as at 1 April 1969.(iv) The effective date for the payment of increases following the first review should be 1 September 1971.(v)   The reduction from 60 to 55 in the minimum age fromwhich pension increases are payable ohould be deferred for the time being, but the Bill should make provision for the reduction, the effective date to bedetermined by statutory instrument; and our spokesmenin both Houses should make it plain that we propose tomake this reduction effective&apos;within the lifetime of thepresent Parliament.J civil  Service Department SWl27 July 19706
ANNEX IS^^ITMT^J^^Tffi JWO PARTIES.G onservative JPajrtjy;The Conservative Party&apos;s commitments on public service pensions were set out in their election manifesto in thefollowing terms: -&quot;We will lower the age at which public service and armed, forces pension increases become payable to fifty-five,and the pensions of those who retired before 1956 will bebrought up to the same level as if they had&apos; retired thenwith appropriate increases since.    The purchasing power ofpublic service pensions will also be protected by a two-yearly review.    Special treatment will be given to war pensioners and their widows.&quot;It seems clear from the report of the Conservative Policy committee under the chairmanship of Lord Aldington that what we had in mind was that the basic pre 1956 pensions would be brought up to 1956levels and increased in accordance with the increases provided for1956 pensions by subsequent pensions increase legislation.   Noincreases in the post 1956 pensions were proposed because it was thought that their purchasing power had already been maintained bythis legislation.Ljabour .party 2.     The Labour Party defined their position in a letter from lord Shackleton, then the Lord Privy Seal, to the Secretary of thePublic Service Pensioners&apos; Council on 3 June 1970.   The text ofthis letter is set out in the appendix to this Annex;    itssubstance may be summarised briefly as follows:-(i)    Purchasing power to be protected by two-yearly reviews,the first to cover the period up to April 1971.(ii)   A once-for-all measure to increase all pensions which- have not recovered their original purchasing power asat April 1969 by the amount necessary to bring them upto that point.The letter took up a firm position against parity.
APPENDIX TO ANNEX 1Text of letter from Lard Shackleton, Lord Privy Seal,  t.) Dr Barnes,Secretary: of the Public Service Pensioners&apos; Council, dated3 June 1970&quot;You were kind enough to call on me with your colleagues en 3June to discuss future pension increase arrangements, and I said that I would let you have a note in writing of what I thentold you,2.     I explained that, with the approach of the General Election,the Government had been asked what their future intentions were on this subject.   As you already knew from earlier talks with my rfficials we have been hard at work on the undertaking givenby the Government when the last Pensions (Increase) Act was beforeParliament that we would see whether we could not devise more satisfactory arrangements f jr the future, taking into account theprovision in the new National Superannuation and Social Insurancescheme for reviewing the main rates of pension and other benefits at yearly intervals.    Our review is not yet complete, but the mainlines on which we shall proceed in future are now sufficiently clear.3.     There is,  I think, general agreement on the main defects ofthe present scheme.   First, pensioners have no assumed&apos; ance thatpensions will be reviewed at regular intervals.    In recent years there has been a gap of about 3 years between successive Acts,but there has been no certainty that future action will be takenwithin any predetermined period.   Moreover,  I know that it is widely felt that an interval of 3 years or more between measuresis too long.I!k.     secondly,  the increases provided have not been directly linkedto changes in the erst of living, ^nd it has been very difficult for pensioners to guess in advance what measure of increase mightbe available to them.5.     The way we have felt it necessary to distribute the availablemoney has meant that increases payable in the early years of retirement have been of modest proportion and it is only after a fairly lengthy period that we have been able to get near to full compensation for changes in the cost of living.6.     This is not to say that we now think that the resources madeavailable under the previous Pensions (increase) Acts were badlydistributed.    I believe that public service pensioners have fully understood and sympathised with the Government&apos;s decision to concentrate as much as possible of the available money cn thepensions of longest standing, which did so badly under the early/Acts
Acts after the war and have been most urgently in need ofimprovement.7.     The two Acts we introduced in 1965 and 1969, which costroughly as much as all the previous post-war Acts together, made a valuable contribution towards making good the deficiencies ofthe past.   But it is clear that a hew approach is necessary.    Thepresent system has produced many anomalies and inconsistencies,and a fu:- thef Act on the  same basis would be likely to intensifythem.8.     We have therefore decided that we should go over to a completely new system, which will be designed to give fullprotection to the purchasing power of public service pensions.We will do this by means of two yearly -reviews.   You will remember that during the debates on the 1969 Act we undertook that if oyApril 1971 the cost of living had risen by more than U per centwe would make a statement to Parliament indicating what action we proposed to take.    As soon as we know the full extent ofthe increases during the 2 year period up to April 1971 we willtake steps to increase public service pensions accordingly.Further reviews will be held at 2 yearly intervals and in thisway we shall be able to guarantee that in future the purchasingpower of these pensions will not be gradually eroded away overa lengthy period of years, as has happened in the past.   We willalso shorten the period between the cut off date and the effectivedate of future increases,  so la at pensioners no longer have to wait for anything up tc 5 years fcr the first revision of their pensions ,9.     I feel sure that your Council will agree, that thisinflation proofing of public service pensions represents a major step forward.    I know that their ultimate objective is parity, and that what I have proposed falls somewhat short of that.    But we do not see how we could possibly justify theintroduction of parity;    It goes well beyond the commitment that we have been able to accept in respect of pensions and benefits under the new National Superannuation and social insurance scheme and it would put public service pensioners ina highly favourable position as compared with other pensionersin this country.    Indeed,  our new proposals will provide much better for public service pensioners than is achieved by allbut the best of private sector pension schemes,10,   We recognise that there are very many public service pensioners who, notwithstanding the increase they have received under past Pensioners (increase) Acts, still have pensionswith a purchasing power less than when they were orginallyawarded.   Merely to keep pace with changes in the cost ofliving since April 1969 would leave these people at a permanentdisadvantage.   Nor does it meet this point to bring all thepre-19f6 pensions up. to the current rate for 1956 pensioners.There are many who retired after 1956 whose current rate ofpension does not fully compensate them for the rise in thecost of living even up to April 1969.   We therefore interd,as a special once-for-all measure,   that at the time of thefirst 2 yearly review those pensions which had not recoveredtheir original purchasing power as at April 1969 will receive/whatever
whatever increase is necessary to bring them up to that point,in addition to the increase to match the rise in the oost ofliving between April 1969 and April 1971.    In this way, weshall be able to ensure that pensions are fully protected against the effects of inflation, and that no one qualified byage to receive pensions increase will have a pension worth lessin purchasing power than it was when it was first awarded.11.   While what I have said may fall some little way short ofthe full aspirations  of your Council,  I hope that you will agree that this guarantee of inflation proofing, which means that however long ago a pension was awarded its real valuewill be maintained,  represents a mat-jor improvement in theposition of publio service pensioners.    &quot;
