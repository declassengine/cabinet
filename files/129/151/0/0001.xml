DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MA JEST YT3 GOVEB.NMENT.) 4CP(70) 26 COPY N22 July 1970CABINETTHE RUN-DOWN OF THE BRITISH ARMYNote by the Secretary of State for defence i attach the draft of a Parliamentary Statement on the run-dovm of theBritish Army which I would like to make before the Recess, as there is increasing speculation about our intentions in Parliament and the Press,and also in the Army itself, where the next reductions planned by theprevious Government are due to complete in about six week.sT time.    I willexplain the problem more fully at the meeting.Ministry of Defence SW122 July 1970
annex draft PARLIAMENTARY statement the House will know that for some time the Army has &quot;been carrying out a number of reductions of major units.   The firstphase of these reductions - 17 major units - was completed inMarch this year.   In the second phase nine major unit reductionsare due to he completed over the period from September of thisyear to March 1972.   The previous Government also announcedthat it might prove necessary during this period to reduce by atenth further major unit or the equivalent.2.     The numerous changes in the defence policies of the previouGovernment adversely affected morale in the Armed Services andhad a very damaging effect upon recruiting.   In consequence, the manpower position in the Army and in the other Services is serious.   Recruiting of other ranks for the armed forces as awhole fell from nearly k1,000 in 1966/67 to about 28,000 in1968/69.   Last year it improved to about 3U,000, although thiswas still 12,000 or about one-quarter short of what was required the present strength of the Army is about 7j,000 below establish-ment.   The shortages are most serious in the Royal Artillery,the Signals and the Infantry.   For some years now the number ofmen leaving the Army has been greater than the intake of newrecruits.   This again, in view of the previous Government&apos;3policies, is not surprising although it is deeply regrettable,3.     It will be a prime objective of our policy to restore con-fidence in the Services as a career.    But it is quite clear thatit will take us time to undo the damage caused by the lastGovernment, and that for some time to come serious manpowershortages will remain.U.     So bad has the position become, that it has been necessary on a number of occasions recently to bring infantry battalionsup to an acceptable strength for particular tasks by postingin men from other units in the same Division of Infantry.   Thisarrangement can be used to meet the immediate needs of the receiving battalion but it places a greater load on other units and increases the disturbance to which men and their familiesare subjected.    It is not an acceptable basis on which to planexcept in the short term or in an emergency.    In this serious situation a, sudden total reversal of the previous Government&apos;plans would have unacceptable consequences for the Army as awhole and for the individual   men and their families05.     Accordingly after careful consideration we have reachedthe following decision.6.     All the Royal Armoured Corps and infantry units affectedby Phase II of the rundown will be offered the option ofremaining in being as units of a size which at least in thefirst instance would have to be strictly limited.
7. These units will fulfil necessary roles including those oftraining and recruiting, and will vary in size according to theroles allocated to them.8.     This means that where disbandment was proposed the unitconcerned will he offered the alternative of continuing as a unit of limited size.   Where the reduction was being affectedby amalgamation the choice would be either to continue withthe amalgamation or to retain one of the two units affected atnormal strength and the other in a special role.9.     Discussions will be opened immediately with the Colonels,Commandant and other concerned.    In addition, the G-overnmenthas decided that there is no need to include the tenth reductionin the second phase as the previous administration had consideredpossible.   We can now remove the uncertainty that this possibilitycreated.   This reduction will not take place.10. If additional full battalions or RAC Regiments are formed in the future the units referred to in this statement would bethfi first to be considered.
