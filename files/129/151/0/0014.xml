DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 3910 September 1970COPY NOCABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. At Cabinet on 23 July (CM(70) 8th Conclusions, Minute 6) I was invited to discuss with the Ministers concerned proposals for a net reduction in public expenditure of  1,700 million by 1974-75; and tomake detailed recommendations to the Cabinet by mid-September.I have regarded the Cabinet remit as precluding me at this stage fromdealing with proposals for adding to expenditure, except to the extent that savings entail this expenditure,2, In the Annex to this paper I have summarised the results of my discussions.    Leaving aside investment grants - I assume that little or nothing will be left from the savings on these for reducing personal taxationafter dealing with the problem of company liquidity - I have discussed with my colleagues proposals totalling roughly  1,100- 1, 400 million in 1974-75for which the target agreed by the Cabinet is a little over  1,000 million;and some  400- 500 million in 1971-72, towards the f,start of several hundred million pounds&quot; in that year.3, In outline the present position is as follows:1

4. I invite my colleagues to endorse what has been agreed so far onthese items,5. There is also some  350 million of savings for 1974-75 if weinclude housing rents and agricultural support,    The details of theseneed time to be worked out and agreed with the interests concerned.But I am sure, and invite my colleagues to agree, that we must includethese two items in our statement, with a firm expression of our intentions and with figures to show our broad objectives in terms of public expenditure,6,        As against these savings, we have accepted additional commitments adding up to some  30 million in 1971-72 with consequential expenditure in later years and there will bea few million pounds more to be found to ease the impact ofthe new social service charges on families with small incomes,7,        This will bring us not much more than half-way to our target for 1974-75, and we badly need to balance the cuts on social expenditurewith cuts on other expenditure.    This is one reason why the future of the concorde and the BAG 311 and our whole expenditure on aid to industry generally is so important.    Otherwise the rest that we need to reach ourtarget has almost all to be found by moderating the upratings of social security pensions.    I urge my colleagues to agree therefore that thelargest possible contribution to the savings should be obtained from theMinistry of Technology over the whole field of civil aircraft,, the technological support programme and the Industrial reorganisation corporation, looking to the Department of Employment and productivity and to the Board of Trade to provide their shares; and that expenditureon defence and other external policies should at least be contained.80        The remaining items are as follows:i0      Social security  have proposed that the upratings in 1971 and 1973 should belimited to compensating for price increases only.    This would save -  million1971-72 1974-75125 490The Secretary of State has not accepted this.    He agrees thatthere is little room for improvement of pensions in 1971, butthinks that more will need to be done in 1973, and is consideringimprovements for older pensioners and in services for old people and a relaxation of the earnings rule for wives of the chronicallysick.    His ideas would cut the savings to -
  million1971-72 1974-7563 189This in my view means giving up more than we can contemplate,though I would not exclude the possibility that in 1973, if theeconomic situation permits and as a maximum, we should aim at an uprating in line with the growth of personal disposable income of the working population.ii. Education, Health and WelfareThe Secretaries of State have each agreed proposals in their fieldsas individually feasible.    But each has also said that someoffsetting additional expenditure on their services is necessary.I suggest that we can only look at the proposed additionalexpenditures when we have settled the savings, for the reasonwhich I have given in paragraph 10iii. Local Authorities&apos; Current ExpenditureSome of our specific proposals on charges will reduce the netprogrammes which between them make up the total of localauthorities&apos; current expenditure.    I have proposed that overand above this we should settle Rate Support Grant on the basis that local authorities can save by better performance about   percent of their current expenditure as at present planned^    several of my colleagues are afraid that this will xesult in undesirableadditional restrictions on their services.    But this is the only way by which we can influence local authorities to find economies,including economies of manpower, and I am sure that v/e mustpersist with itc9.        I must remind my colleagues mat they have been asked to bring forward further proposals for reductions.    These and other proposalsfor savings which I am still considering, for example, some of those on nationalised industries&apos; investment, will need to be decided at a further meeting this month.SUMMARY10.       I invite my colleagues -1.       To endorse the proposed savings shown above as agreed,reserving the question of some offsetting additional expenditureson social services for consideration when our programme of savings has been decided (paragraphs 3 and 8ii,).
2.      To agree that our statement should include a firm expression of our intentions, and figures to show our broad objectives in termsof public expenditure, on housing rents and agricultural support(paragraph 5).3,       To note that some additional expenditure will be needed to ease the impact of the new social service charges on families with small incomes (paragraph 6),4,      To agree that the largest possible contribution to the savingsshould be obtained from the Ministry of Technology - over the wholefield of civil aircraft, the technological support programme and theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation, the Department ofEmployment and Productivity and the Board of Trade alsoproviding their shares (paragraph 7).5e      To agree that expenditure on defence and other externalpolicies should at least be contained (paragraph 7).6.      To agree that the upratings of social security benefits in1971 and 1973 should be limited to compensating for price increasesonly (paragraph Si. )a7. To agree that Rate Support Grant should be settled on thebasis that local authorities should be expected to save by betterperformance about f per cent of their current expenditure as atpresent planned (paragraph 8iiiQ )68,      To note that responses to the request for further proposalsfor savings are needed for decision, together with those which Iam still considering, at a further meeting this month (paragraph 9).M V treasury Chambers SW19 September 1970
