DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS government cp(70) 41 COPY NO        5415 September 1970CABINETNON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy SealSCALE OF THE PROBLEM1. The size of the Civil Service has aroused considerableParliamentary, Press and public interest in recent years.    We have a clear-cut commitment to reduce it.     &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; saids-&quot;We will reduce the number of Civil Servants: underLabour their numbers have grown by over 60,000.The Land Commission will be abolished.    Thefunctions and responsibilities of all Departments and government agencies will be systematically rationalised.There will be cost-reduction plans for every singleMinistry in Whitehall ...&quot;2, The Civil Service is costly in terms of both manpower and money, and costs have risen sharply in recent years.    Under previousConservative Governments non-industrial numbers in post (excluding the Post Office) ran down from about 422, 000 in 1951 to about372,000 in 1958 and then up again to nearly 413,000 on 1 October 1964.When we took office this year the number was about 496,000: this includes some 15,000 sicaff transferred from the Post Office on the setting up of the Department for National Savings and the Ministry of posts and Telecommunications on 1 October 1969, so the real increase between October 1964 and July 1970 was about 68,000.    The non-industrial civil Service now represent about 1. 9 per cent of the United Kingdomworking population as compared with about 1. 8 per cent in 1951,1. 5 per cent in 1958 and 1, 6 per cent in 1964.    Its demand on skilledgraduate manpower is also increasing.    In money terms, each non-industrial civil servant costs the taxpayer on average about  2, 000 perannum all told:   the Estimates provision for non-industrial CivilService salaries and wages alone rose from the equivalent (revalued at constant prices) of  585 million in 1964-65 to nearly  700 million in1970-71.1
30 Apart from these considerations there is a simple butpotentially most embarrassiag political factor.    Our commitment as aGovernment to a reduction in Civil Service manpower is simple andunequivocal.    But what is required to achieve it is the reverse of simpleand is bound to take time.    However the commitment, as stated, has beenaccepted as such and has been fastened onto by public opinion.    A re&amp;entsurvey showed that the public are looking for real economies in CivilService manpower (which they often confuse with public service manpower) and they are looking for them early.    If we fail to make such economies, or at the very least to show determination to reverse the trend towards an ever mounting Civil Service budget as a first step in establishing a strategy for the Service, we shall most certainly come under rising public criticism and find ourselves forced into arbitrarymeasures which would interfere with our longer-term objective ofsecuring rational economies in manpower.PRESENT POSITION4. As a first step in attacking the trend, with the agreement of thePrime Minister I recently asked my colleagues to seek reductions intheir departments  manpower ceilings for 1 April 1971 and forecasts for 1 April 1972,    The starting pooition for the former date was the overall ceiling of 5 05,300 indicated by the previous Government on14 April 1970; whilst for 1 April 1972 a gross increase of about 16, 600above that level had been forecast by Departments,    These forecastswere based on the policies of the previous Government - which we willbe changing - and were no doubt pitched too high; on the other hand they include sizeable provisions for commitments on a continuing programmeof work in many areas which will continue more or less unchanged,,5. The replied which I have so far received are in aggregate deeplydisappointing.    They amount to net reductions of only about 1,400 in theoriginal aggregate of Departmental ceilings for 1 April 1971 and only about , 900 in the aggregate forecast for 1 April 1972 after taking into account the increases which are now being sought by a few Departments.    details are set out, Department by Department, in an Annex.    On this basisrevised figures would be 503, 900 for the 1 April 1971 ceiling and 517,000for the i April 1972 forecasts.6, These figures do not take into account certain important changes of classification that are in prospect, such as the possible transfer of present civil servants out of the Service to a civil aviation authority, orof certain courts staff into the Service,    These are legitimate butartificial changes which we will have to distinguish from real growth and savings.    Nevertheless they are presentationally important, andI propose to pursue as a matter of urgency some other possible changes of classification which might be presentationally helpful.
A STRATEGY FOR THE SERVICE7,        Further action is clearly necessary to consolidate and improveupon what Ministers have been able to offer so far.    This should also take account of the manpower consequences (some favourable, someadverse) of policy changes which may result from the public expenditurereview, and which are not reflected in the above figures; though $heirnet effect will hardly be very significant in relation to the size of theproblem.    Our immediate aim (covering April 1971 and April 1972)will be to halt the upward trend in numbers at about the size of Servicethat we have inherited.    This will be difficult enough, against the pressuresof demographic growth and the requirements of additional manpower for ourown policy innovations.    Thereafter, the possibility of making progress towards a smaller Civil Service will depend on our success in cutting down the functions of Government for, as the Prime Minister said at Sunningdalein June, this is the only way to really substantial reductions.     To put thematter in perspective, a reduction by 5 per cent below the July 1970 level would mean a figure of some 470,000,    I would like to be able to advocatethis as our target for April 1973, but it is much too early to say whether we can achieve it - or less or more,PROPOSALS RELATING TO APRIL 19718,        The first question for decision relates to the short term, our intentions for 1 April 1971,    I do not myself believe that we can accepta revised ceiling at the kind of level (503, 900) indicated in paragraph 5,We could of course argue that we propose to discharge our Electioncommitment to reduce Civil Service manpower within the lifetime ofthe present Parliament,    We could go on to claim that by checkingthe trend towards rising manpower figures we are making a good start.However, given the rather simple yardstick which public opinion will apply in this field, I very much doubt that we would get away with this claim,    I am therefore convinced that collectively we must and can do a lot better if we are to avoid damaging criticism.    In the short time available our room for manoeuvre is restricted and we must concentrate on the in-post figure for 1 April 1971,    Ideally our target should be a figure below the 496, 000 which we inherited: and we should at the veryleast force the in-post number below the 500,000 mark.    This will enable us to point the contrast with our predecessors&apos; ceiling,.    To allow ourselves to be pushed above the 500,000 mark by 1 April 1971 wouldbe quite gratuitously handing our critics valuable ammunition.    Thereis, to my mind, quite a lot of symbolism in the half million.    This figure,I accordingly submit to my colleagues, we should aim to make our CivilService Plimsoll Line,
9o        If we are to secure a reduction of this sort I shall need the full co-operation of Ministers in charge of Departmental even if necessaryin securing economies by just the sort of crude methods which we alldislike and which I hope v/e can avoid later on,    I accordingly urge that ministers should give further close personal attention to securing thefurther reductions which we need if we are to keep below 496,000 or atthe worst the 500,000 mark by 1 April 1971,    For my part, I propose toinstitue a rigorous monthly review of the staff-in-post figures reportedto the Civil Service Department and to have discussions with individual ministers about them.    And I will advise Cabinet further if at any time it appears to me that we are not taking the strong action which is required if v/e are to achieve an acceptable 1 April 1971 in-post figure,PROPOSALS RE IA TING TO APRIL 197210.       The second question relates to the medium term, our intentionsfor 1 April 19720    It is clear that a figure of the order of 517,000 for thatdate would be quite unacceptable,,    No doubt we could reduce it further by further squeezing and Departments will have to pursue vigorously the economies suggested by the Bellinger Panel and other enquiries.    Wemust all act with urgency and determination to cut out work to this end in every possible way?1L,        It is also of the highest importance that every possibility of manpower savings which may arise from any changes in the structure of Government should be promptly secured,12,       But we cannot yet identify or quantify any of these savings, and meanwhile Departments have to inform the Civil Service Department by15 October of the manpower figures on which they propose to base their1971-72 Estimates,,    I invite all my colleagues to give close personalattention to these figures in their Departments, bearing in mind theunacceptable present overall position that I have reported to them andto ensure that their intentions and the possibilities of future savings are fully reflected in major reductions in the bids submitted,    I will naturally be reporting to Cabinet again when I have received and reviewed them.THE LONGER TERM13,       As suggested in paragraph 7, we should by 1972-73 be reapingthe full benefit of the reductions in functions that will have occurred by then,    A judgment as to the consequent scale of reduction in CivilService manpower requirements ought to begin to be possible in thecourse of 1971,
PRESENTATION14,        Our strategy for containing Civil Service numbers in 1972 and ifpossible reducing them thereafter will require very careful handling bothexternally and from the point of view of the staff and staff associations.We should now start drawing public notice to our predecessors5 April 1971ceiling of 505,300,    As to the staff, if our policy is to seem defensible wemust be able to show that our programmes for reducing functions and reducing staff numbers are going hand in hand, and that understandingsabout a fair pay structure and progress with reform and modernisation of the Service are not jeopardised.    This further emphasises theimportance that attaches to the review and elimination of functions as the key to our whole policy here,MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY PROPOSALS15,       Finally, in order that the importance of the Civil service manpower implications of our policy thinking is always kept prominentlyin mind, I propose that it be a standing rule that any proposals put to cabinet or a Cabinet Committee should include a statement of the best available estimate (made in consultation with the Civil Service Department)of their effect on Civil Service manpower as well as of their cost,CONCLUSION16,       I invite Cabinet to endorse my proposals above, and in particular to agreesa. That Departmental numbers between now and 1 April 1971should be kept under intensified pressure and continuous scrutinyas proposed in paragraph 9* with the objective of forcing their total below 496, 000 if possible and in any case below 500f 000on that date,b. That Ministers be charged to give the closest personalattention to reducing their departments  manpower estimates for 1 April 1972 as proposed in paragraph 12, as a preliminary to our further reviewing the position for that date in Cabinet andwith the aim of keeping the total down to the figure achieved at a,c. That in reviewing the functions of their DepartmentsMinisters should bear in mind the longer-term Civil service manpower strategy outlined in paragraph 7,d. That we adopt as standard practice the rule proposed inparagraph 15,J civil  Service Department SW115 September 1970
