H)OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 30 COPY NO    5428 July 1970CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity1. The Government is committed to introduce legislation in the present session of Parliament to secure fundamental reforms in the legalframework regulating industrial relations.    It is essential that the Billshould have its Second Reading before Christmas so that the committee stage can at the latest begin immediately after the Christmas Recess,    Inview of the length and complexity of the Bill and the need for conducting theprocess of consultation without indecent haste this is an extremely tighttimetable - and there is dangerously little margin for delay.    3f we are tokeep to the timetable detailed instructions must be in the hands of theParliamentary draftsmen by early September - even if we subsequently need to make changes following consultations with the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress, which cannot be held before september.    I therefore have to secure now my colleagues agreement to themain principles which the legislation should embody, and to those proposalswhich are likely to be most controversial.2.        Whilst in Opposition, we agreed and published in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot;detailed proposals for action.    We have therefore a firm basis on which toproceed (for convenience, the main conclusions set out in pages 63 and 64of &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; are reprodviced at Appendix I).    Since &quot;Fair Deal&quot;was published we have examined additional proposals which are incorporated in this paper.    Most of these are logical extensions of the &apos;5&apos;air Deal&quot;policy;  or have been fore shad owed in proposals I made to the party conference last October.NEW SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL COURTS3.        As &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; proposed, we should so far as practicableproduce a comprehensive measure which supersedes or incorporates thegreater part of existing legislation, much of which is sadly out of date.    to administer the new law, we need to establish a more suitable structure oflabour law jurisdictions, based on a new Industrial Court (which should be of
broadly similar status to the Restrictive Practices Court) and on theexisting industrial tribunals (which I envisage would become the lower levelof the new system).    To deal with matters connected with trade unionrules and with complaints about their application by trade union members the Industrial Court should be complemented by a Registrar of Trade unions and Employers&apos;1 Associations.    These bodies should, between them, dealwith proceedings brought under the various provisions of the legislation;and in addition any other cases arising out of industrial action in thecircumstances of a trade dispute.    As &apos;Fair Deal at Work&quot; pointed out, itwas desirable to bring industrial relations cases within a new industrial court system with specially designed procedures for dealing with industrial relations matters.4.        The establishment of a new system of labour law will inevitablyconfront us with a number of large problems: for example, the relationship between the new Industrial Court and the existing courts;  he manning ofthe Industrial Court and the Industrial Tribunals; the rules governing theprocedure of these bodies; and the staging of the introduction of the newjurisdiction.    On all these matters I shall of course consult with theLord Chancellor,    In this memorandum, however, I have not dealt in detail with this range of problems; and have attempted to limit my proposals tothe substance of the policy and law which will fall to the new industrial court system to administer.ENFORCEABLLITY OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS5,        We proposed in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; that in future there should be apresumption that all collective agreements should be enforceable in thecourts unless the parties agreed otherwise.    We agreed also that thelegislation should establish limits to the damages which could be awarded inrespect of a breach of a collective agreement.    Although, initially, fewcollective agreements will be made enforceable - because most  rade union officials at present oppose this concept - there is no doubt that v/e shouldnonetheless proceed with it because of its beneficial long-termconsequences.    (This would of course involve amending Section 4 of theTrade Union Act 1871 in so far as this prevents the legal enforcement of anagreement between a trade union and an employers1 association).6.        This general change of approach will/ however, take some time before it is effective in the most difficult plants and industries.    For thisreason I am satisfied that we need to go one step further.    after consideration on the available alternatives, I propose that v/e shouldimplement a proposal which was first developed in the Donovan Commission^Report.    The Donovan Commission envisaged a procedure under whichprocedure agreements in selected firms with particularly unhappy experienceof unconstitutional stoppages might be examined by, and made legally binding on the recommendation of, the Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR),In this way existing good procedure agreements could where necessary bemade legally binding upon a union and employer alike in much the same way2
that, under the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 substantiveterms can be made binding upon, an employer who fails to observe theconditions established by collective agreement in his industry.    I would recommend that we follow the Donovan Commission^ lead, with somemodifications.    We might provide that the Secretary of State or one of theparties to a procedural agreement could apply to have the agreement madelegally enforceable.    The CIR would examine the procedure agreement and consider (a) whether it was suitable for enforcement and (b) what modifications or improvement should be made.    It would then be for theIndustrial Court to determine, in the light of criteria relating to the firmrsrecord of industrial disputes, whether the agreement - as awarded by theCIR - should be made enforceable.    If the agreement was made enforceable,the parties to the agreement could then take proceedings for breach of theagreement in the Industrial Court.7.        I would expect this approach tc the question of enforceable collective agreements gradually to encourage responsible attitudes and behaviourtowards collective agreements.    This approach should be supplementedand reinforced by the work of my Department in registering company-procedure agreements and pressing firms to review these agreements andbargaining arrangements.    We have at present no powers to requirecompanies to register their agreements with the Department, and the donovan Commission proposed that the Government should take such powers.Although our experience has been that companies are prepared to co-operatefully in the voluntary registration scheme which is now in operation, I thinkit important for presentational reasons that we should be a.ble to invokereserve powers to require employers to register their collective agreements with my Department.TRADE UNION IMMUNITIES FP,OM LEGAL ACTION8. Under the present law, any trade union is protected from actions intort whether or not acting in furtherance of a trade dispute.    In addition,any individual (as well as any union) is protected both from actions for criminal and civil conspiracy, and from actions for inducing the breach ofa contract of employment, provided he is acting in pursuance of a trade dispute.    These immunities from legal action date from a period when tradeunions were relatively weak and when it was generally felt that theprinciples of common law militated against effective trade union action insupport of legitimate objectives.    Neither of these conditions prevailstoday, which is why in &quot;Fair Deal at YtTork&quot; v/e proposed to reform in a fundamental way the immunities which trade unions and trade unionists enjoy.9.        The substance of what we proposed in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; was that:a.        The immunity enjoyed by trade unions from actions in tortunder Section 4(1) of the 1905 Act should be confined (i) to actscommitted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute and(ii) to registered unions.    This would mean, on the one hand, thatall trade unions could be sued for such civil wrongs which do not3
arise in the context of industrial disputes.    More important,it would mean under the existing law, that unregistered bodies(including unions whose rules had failed to meet the statutory-requirements) would only enjoy very limited immunities fromactions in tort, even when taking industrial action.b. The protection from civil action for inducing the breach of a contract of employment (afforded by Section 3 of the 1906 Act)should be confined to a registered trade union (or its officials).This change was recommended - albeit by a narrow majority -of the Donovan Commission.     This would have the effect that,in a strike which involved breaches of a contract of employment,anyone who induced the strikers to break their contracts ofemployment would be liable to a civil action.c. Industrial action should cease to enjoy immunity incertain specified kinds of strike (inter-union, in support ofan unlawful closed shop, blacking etc: I discuss these categoriesin more detail below).10.       My colleagues are, of course, already aware of the extent towhich these changes will be represented by the trade unions as a severeblow to the freedom of individuals and work groups to protect their interests by collective action.    They will be the more deeply resentedbecause, in this country, the typical strike is unofficial and unofficialstrike leaders would therefore be unprotected.    &quot;Whilst it is probablethat few employers would exercise the right to go to law against unofficialstrike leaders (in part because they would not be confident of being able to collect worthwhile damages and in part because they would not want toincrease the bitterness of industrial relations by legal action), therewould always be the fear of legal reprisal.11.       These consequences - as to which I wish to leave my colleagues inno doubt - are, of course, implicit in the policy to which we are already committed.    But they have caused me to give much further thought to theway in which they may be presented to the best advantage and so as tosecure their full long-term benefit.    As a result, I think it wise tooutline 2   consequences  about which we need to be clear.    They relateto 2 topic-j:(a) Enforcement.(b) &quot;Court&quot; machinery.ENFORCEMENT12.       Any attempt (along the lines visualised in &quot;Fair Deal&quot;) to makelegal remedies available Li respect of unlawful industrial action - andthese are, of course, a consequence of our proposal to restrict existingimmunities - must involve the use of one or other or both of two sanctions:(a)   An award of damages.4
(b)   An order - in conventional legal jargon known asan injunction - ordering a body or person to cease and desist from certain actions.An award of damages is normally enforceable against the assets of theperson or body concerned - and cannot (since the implementation of therecommendations of the Payne Committee) normally involve imprisonment.But non-compliance with an &quot;injunction&quot; can, and ordinarily does, involvethe possible sanction of imprisonment at the end of the road.    These are both, of course, civil (and not criminal) i-emedies.    3ut this may seemto be a distinction without much difference for the man who ultimatelyends up &quot;inside&quot;.13.       I must make clear to my colleagues that our proposals, taken asa whole, must involve an increase in the number of situations in whichthese sanctions will be available.    They have of course been available inthe growing number of trade dispute cases that have recently been beforethe Courts; but, in practice, these sanctions have not had to be invoked.One must hope that this will continue to be the case.    But the hope is virtually bound to be belied.    And my colleagues will wish to appreciatethis point.14.       Two important consequences, I suggest, must follow from this.First, we must make clear that there is to be no scope for such legalsanctions being invoked against individual strikers ^ so as to confrontthe Courts with the impossible task of &quot;locking up hundreds of men&quot;.Second, we should strive to be clear and consistent in our repudiation ofthe criminal law in this field.15.       The first of these conclusions means that we must ensure that theright of the individual - and of individuals seeing together - to withdraw their labour is expressly preserved.    The right to strike, as such, mustbe spelt out.    Any sanction, by way of damages or &quot;injunction&quot;, shouldbe available only against those who seek to call or induce continuance ofan unlawful strike.    There would, however, be no legal sanctions against any person simply for participating in a strike.16.       Where individual employees come out on strike without notice andin breach of their contracts of employment, they will continue - as atpresent - to run the risk that their employer may discipline them or take action for breach of contract.    But, I repeat, I envisage no additionalsanctions against employees as such.17.       The second conclusion which I propose - the express exclusion ofthe criminal law - would be in keeping with this approach.    I propose thatwe shculd reconsider the necessity for retaining the existing criminal sanctions against strikers contained in the 1875 Conspiracy and Protectionof Property Act (as amended in the Electricity Supply Act, 1919.Sections 4 and 5 of the 1875 Act make it a criminal offence for an employeemaliciously to break his contract, knowing that a consequence of his doing5
so will be to d eprive the inhabitants of a city of gas, water or electricityor to endanger human life or cause serious bodily injury.    TheseSections have scarcely ever been invoiced; and it is nowadays unrealistic to suppose that they could or would prevent a strike of public utilityworkers.    Insofar as such workers &quot;wilfully and maliciously&quot; act ontheir own volition so as to cause damage there are suitable remediesavailable.    But to retain a special criminal sanction against strikerswho, in solidarity with their fellows, obey a strike call seems to me tobe valueless and out of line with our general approach.    The proposal made in this paragraph v/as, I should say, rejected by the ShadowCabinet when we were in Opposition.    I suggest that it deservesreconsideration at this stage in the context of our proposals as a whole.COURT STRUCTURE18.       As explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above (and as foreshadowed in&quot;Fair Deal&quot;) I visualise that all proceedings brought under our proposed legislation will be dealt with by our new Structure of Industrial courts and Tribunals.19.       The logical consequence of this is that such proceedings shouldbe excluded from the ordinary courts.    This means that the presentimmunities of trade unions (and others concerned in industrial disputes)from orjdmajry civil action in the ordinary courts would, in practice, beextended.    And the special remedies (taking account of the ways in whichwe propose to limit existing immunities) would be available only in theindustrial courts.    Trade unions and industrial disputes would, therefore,appear in the ordinary courts - civil or criminal - only in respect of:a. Torts not committed in the context of a trade dispute.b. Prosecutions arising out of illegal picketing (undueviolence and so on).HOW THE RESTRICTED IMMUNITIES WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE20.       The consequence of all this is that in the industrial courts tradeunions (and others engaged in industrial action) would enjoy the immunitiesrestricted as proposed in &quot;Fair Deal&quot; (and as summarised in paragraph above).     It is to the substance of these immunities that I now turn;a.      The immunities (whether derived from Section 3 or section 4 of the 1906 Act) would be confined to:-i.       acts committed in furtherance of a trade dispute; andiL       to registered unions.6
b.       Industrial action in the following circumstances shouldnot be protected but should be subject to restraint by theIndustrial Court, whether or not it involves the breach of contracts of employment and whether or not it is officiallysupported :-i.       Action calculated or intended to disrupt an establishedbargaining structure (for example, a strike inpursuance of an inter-union recognition dispute -see paragraph 28 below).ii.       Action unlawfully to procure the dismissal of employees.iii. Action in certain circumstances to enforce the reinstate-ment of an employee (see paragraph 45 below).iv. Action to secure an unlawful closed shop (seeparagraph 45 below).v.       Inducement of the breach of a contract other than a contract of employment (this will cover the secondaryboycott axid inducing the breach of an enforceablecollective agreement).21.       On reflection, I consider that we should not be justified inremoving the protection enjoyed by registered trade unions which conductsympathetic strikes and strikes about job demarcation and job assignment.The sympathetic strike is often a reasonable means of assisting fellowunionists in a dispute in which the sympathetic strikers have a direct or indirect interest; and there would be very great difficulty in distinguishingsuch strikes from other sympathetic strikes.    Besides this, thesympathetic lock-out, which is difficult to distinguish from the sympatheticstrike, constitutes one of the most effective means by which the membersof an employers1 association car. protect themselves against a union whichadopts the &quot;whipsaw&quot; technique of striking one employer after another inorder to secure concessions.22.       Strikes about demarcation and job assignment, on the other hand,are clearly directed to furthering the interests of the strikers (forexample, their employment security).    However much one deplores theway in which these interests are defended, I think it would be unreasonable to outlaw demarcation disputes unless we were prepared to provide asuitable alternative means for resolving these disputes.    In other words,we should choose between leaving unions the freedom to strike overdemarcation and job assignment disputes and setting up some form of statutory machinery for dealing with &quot;who does what&quot; questions.    In thelast few years the problem of demarcation has been lessened byamalgamations and agreements between unions in the shipbuilding industry.For that reason, and because of the difficulties of identifying clearlydemarcation questions from other grievances where there is a strike, Ireach the conclusion that we should not legislate to outlaw strikes overjob demarcation.7
THE TRADE DISPUTES ACT, 196523.       Following the House of Lords decision inRookes v Barnard theLabour Government passed the 1965 Trade Disputes Act to protect fromlegal action anyone who threatened to induce a breach of contract ofemployment (or who threatened to break his own contract).    We opposedthat measure largely because it seemed intended to protect trade unionists who forced their employer by threat of strike action to dismissan employee who had fallen out with his union.    In the context of tradeunion law at that time - and now - this Act seemed a license to victimisenonconformist employees; and we promised to repeal it when wereturned to power.    Clearly we should do so; and in addition providethe necessary safeguards to protect non-union members from dismissalon that account.    I propose, however, in amending the immunitiesaccorded to trade unions and individuals to make it clear that in the areaof protected and lawful industrial action a threat to call a strike should betreated no differently from the actual calling of a strike.    In other words,we should reverse that part of the House of Lords judgment which appearsmost questionable, without at the same time leaving open thepossibility of victimisation of employees.BARGAINING STRUCTURE, TRADE UNION RECOGNITION AND THEDUTY TO BARGAIN24.       In &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; (pages ?.7 and 44) we proposed that employers should have a legal duty to negotiate with a trade union wherea majority of the employees wish the trade union to represent them.    Weenvisaged that legislation would establish appropriate machinery to giveeffect to this principle.    This machinery should also;a.,      assist in establishing a rational bargaining structure and preventing or reducing inter-union conflict and friction;and b.      deter industrial action directed towards undermining an established bargaining arrangement.25.       The real problem we have to confront is not simply that of forcingrecalcitrant employers to come to terms with unions which enjoy a large measure of support, but of establishing a sound and secure bargainingstructure which enables the parties to develop a satisfactory relationship with one another.    Recognition disputes not infrequently involve inter-union differences or i ivalry which, if not satisfactorily resolved, canprevent the development of a satisfactory bargaining structure.    This is why, in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot;, we proposed to remove immunity frominter-union disputes.    In itself, however, this was no more than a negative step.    Where we propose to curtail the right to strike, we shouldalso aim to provide an alternative way of resolving the dispute.    this consideration has prompted me to develop the scheme outlined in &quot;FairDeal&quot; to make it suitable for resolving both recognition disputes involving a single union and the more complex problems of the multi-union disputesituation.8
26.       What I propose is broadly as follows.    Any dispute aboutrecognition and/or bargaining structure could be referred by any of theparties involved (or by the Secretary of State) for investigation by the CIR.The CIR would decide what was the most acceptable and viable bargainingunit (or units).    In the light of the degree cf support among the employees in the unit for the union or unions concerned, the CIR would recommendwhich union(s) - if any - should have bargaining rights.     The CIR would report its conclusions to the parties and to the Industrial Court; and ifthe recommended union(s) wished to secure statutory force for the CIRsrecommendations, it would apply to the Industrial Court to have those recommendations made binding.    A ballot would then be arranged to allow the employees in the bargaining unit to decide whether they wished toaccept the CIRs recommendations - or whether they preferred not to havethe recommended unions as their bargaining agent.    K a majority of the employees endorsed the recommendations, the Industrial Court would bring them into force; and the employer (and unions) concerned wouldthen be under a legal obligation to bargain seriously about the terms andconditions of employment within the bargaining unit.27.       As suggested in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot;, if an employer refused tonegotiate seriously the union would be entitled unilaterally to refer a substantive claim for binding arbitration; a remedy which secures for theunion some of the benefits it would have obtained through negotiation.Besides making unnecessary any recourse to the courts for traditionallegal remedies, this sanction should also minimise litigation about what is&quot;serious&quot; negotiation - v/hich has caused a great deal of trouble in theUnited States of America.    I also expect that, because of the more activerole we envisage the Departments conciliation serv ice playing in the future,the recourse to unilateral arbitration would be infrequent.    Conciliationofficers would almost certainly be involved in trying to resolve disputesabout either an employerls or a union&apos;s willingness to bargain seriouslyjand this should materially assist in getting such disputes settled withoutunilateral arbitration being necessary.28.       There would be an obligation on the union side to maintain the integrity of established bargaining arrangements.    If any union (whetherrecognised or not) sought to undermine the bargaining structure byindustrial action (for example, calling or threatening a strike to force an employer to bargain with an unrecognised union) the employer would beentitled to seek a restiaining order from the Industrial Court, or to suefor damages.29.       I believe that this procedure for the resolution of disputes abouttrade union recognition would be fair and workable.    It would not forceunwilling unions into bargaining partnership, but would exert considerable pressure for them to compose their differences in order to secure statutorybargaining rights.    It would provide for the CIRs proposals to be confirmed by ballot among the employees - and there would also be provision after areasonable period for employees subsequently to seek a further ballot to challenge a unionfs right to continue to represent them.    And it would9
give the employer reasonable backing in resisting pressure fromunrecognised unions attempting to secure recognition by use of industrialpower,    I do not, however, expect that this statutory procedure would be invoked in so large a number of situations so as to pose a threat torelatively stable bargaining relationships.    Recourse to the CIR and theIndustrial Court should be necessary only in the more serious disputes.NATIONAL EMERGENCY STRIKES30.       The proposals in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; envisaged that theSecretary of State would have power, in disputes which might endanger the national interest, to apply to the Industrial Court for an injunction toprevent a strike or lock-out.    The maximum period during which an injunction could be enforced was to be not less than 60 days; and theMinister was to have pcwor to order a secret ballot to ascertain whetheremployees were prepared to accept the employer&apos;s last offer.31.       I am in no doubt that there would be advantage in some situationsin being able to invoke a piocedure on these lines.    But I am equally sure that if such a procedure was used with any frequency it would soon lose its value.    I suggest therefore that we should provide very strict criteriawhich would limit the award of an injunction to really serious situationswhere there was a genuine threat to national security or the livelihood ofthe community.    It was partly for this reason that &quot;Fair Deal&quot; proposedthat the Secretary of State !s application for an injunction should have to be endorsed by the Industrial Court,,    I am sure this is a necessary control on the use of this reserve power.    I do not think, however, we needmaintain the &quot;Fair Deal&quot; proposals for referring disputes for compulsory arbitration;  or that before an injunction can be granted, the Secretary ofState should invariably be obliged to set up and receive a report from, aBoard of Inquiry.    In some cases, the appointment of such a Board couldseriously delay the use of the emergency powers; and, in most cases, theessential facts and issues in the dispute will certainly be known to theSecretary of State as a result of reports from Departmental conciliationofficers.    The Secretary of State would of course retain this existingpower (which could be exercised at. any stage) to set up a Court of inquiry to make recommendations which might provide the basis for resolving thedispute.32.       I propose that the maximum period an injunction could be in force should be 60 days.    There would of course always be the possibility ofdischarging the injunction earlier if the dispute were settled or if therewere no longer a threat to the community.33.       The order made by the Industrial Court would prevent namedunions, officials or individuals from calling or supporting a strike by employees in the company or sector covered by the order.    If orders ofthis kind were disobeyed, it would be for the Attorney-General to takeproceedings against those concerned before the Industrial Court.    Wemust squarely face up to the possibility that, in the last resort, it mightbe necessary to commit to prison anyone who refused to comply with anycash penalty.10
34.       Since this injunction, like any other order of the Industrial Court,would apply only to those who might call a strike, there would be nosanctions against any person for participating in a strike.    I believe it ispresentationally of the utmost importance that we resist the temptation to seek remedies against strikers as such.STRIKE BALLOTSI-35.       We envisaged in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; that the final stage of thenational emergency procedure would generally be the holding of a balloton the employer&apos;s last offer.    I am now disposed to the view that provision for a strike ballot should not be related directly and exclusively to disputes in which the national emergency injunction procedure isinvoked.    Indeed, I believe it would probably be wrong to require a ballotas the inevitable final stage in the national emergency procedure; thereis a large risk that the parties would simply build the ballot in to theirtactical manoeuvring and not get down to serious negotiation until the ballot had duly confirmed - as it almost certainly would - that the employees did not accept the employees &quot;last offer&quot;.     I see some advantage, on the other hand, m giving the Secretary of State a general &apos;power - not limited to national emergencies - to demand a ballot before a major strike is called, if there is reason to suppose that the views of union members involved have not been adequately canvassed.36.       I recognise thai the discretionary ballot is a weapon that can easilymisfire;  that it is seen by unions as a potential threat to their authority and leadership; and that often trade union officers and executive committees are more cautious and responsible than many of their members.    On theother hand, there are occasions when union members get little opportunityto make their views known and when a small number of militants are ableto force a strike when a majority of employees is anxious not to come out.On balance, I think the advantages of a discretionary power to call a ballot outweigh the risks which the possession and use of such a powerentails.    And I therefore suggest we provide for a reserve power of thiskind - which would be exercised on the authority of the Industrial Court.REGISTRATION AND RULES OF TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS&apos;ASSOCIATIONS37.       The main purpose of the proposals in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot;concerning the registration of trade unions were to:a. protect individuals from injustice and ensure that therules of trade unions wrsre clear, just and democratic;b. ensure that immunities from legal action were accordedonly to responsible bodies; andc. ensure that, rules conformed to the public interest.Our proposals were broadly similar to those recommended in the donovan Commissionfs Report, and envisaged that combinations would berequired to register with a new Registrar of Trade Unions, in order to
secure corporate status and the privileges currently attaching to a tradeunion.    We also envisaged that the Registrar would be required to ensurethat rules of registered trade unions met certain standards; and that thereshould be provision for an independent body to hear complaints from tradeunion members that they had been unfairly treated by their union.38.       There can be no doubt that, as &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; proposed, the registration of trade unions and thejr rules will be an essential element in our legislation and we should proceed with our proposals.    It is possiblethat some unions might prefer to remain unregistered bodies without thestatus and privileges of a union rather than be forced to change their rules(perhaps because they were reasonably confident that no employer wouldrisk a legal confrontation by pressing a case against a powerful unregisteredbody).    I would nonetheless recommend that we maintain the view expressed in &quot;Fair Deal&quot; that voluntary registration, with incentives, isthe most satisfactory means of ensuring that union rules are subjected to public supervision.39.       In presenting our proposals for trade union (and employers1association) registration, it will be important to emphasise that the registrar^ role ia closer to that of &quot;ombudsman&quot; than &quot;policeman&quot;.He will have to satisfy himself that the rules of a trade union are fair and reasonable (for example, regarding conditions for membership); and hewill also have responsibility for investigating complaints from union members of unfair treatment and alleged breaches of rules by union officials.    His main function will, in short, be to protect union members;and in carrying out that function he will sometimes have to investigatecases where he has reason to suspect that a union has broken its ruleseven though no member has submitted a complaint.    It should, however,be no part of the Registrar Js job to ensure that unions discipline members who strike in defiance of union instructions: if a union failed to coe  its^&quot;best endeavours&quot; to restrain its members from striking, it must be forthe employer to seek appropriate remedy through an action for breach ofa collective agreement,SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNFAIR DISMISSALS40,       In &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; we proposed that there should be a right ofappeal against unfair dismissal.    The Industrial Relations Bill published by the previous Administration provided, in broad terms, that where anydismissal could not be justified on grounds of the employeels conduct orcapability, and did not result from redundancy, it should be judged unfair;and the employer would be ordered either to reinstate the employee or topay him suitable compensation.    This goes rather further than weenvisaged but it may be politically difficult for us to withdraw so far fromthe proposals that have been placed on the table since we published &quot;FairDeal&quot;.    I would, however, propose several changes from the LabourGovernments proposals, notably:i.       We should simplify the concept of unfair dismissal by not giving an exhaustive list of reasons for which dismissal is not permitted.
ii.       As emphasised in &quot;Fair Deal&quot; an Industrial tribunal should be able to recommend, but not require, reinstatement;only an award of compensation should be enforceable.iii.       We should provide for conciliation, probably by officersof the Department of Employment and Productivity, as a meansof resolving complaints of unfair dismissal before they go to an industrial Tribunal.41,       The last proposal, apart from being justified in principle, shouldsubstantially help to reduce what could be an impossible burden on theIndustrial Tribunal and the Industrial Court.    In addition, I think that weshould review the level of compensation proposed in the LabourGovernments Bill, which provided for a maximum award of  1,920.While the Tribunal will need some kind of formula to work to in assessingcompensation, I am not clear that the formula chosen by the previous administration which was based on length of service and level of earnings(in many respects similar to that applied to redundancy payments) is asuitable one for determining compensation for unfair dismissal.    It maybe that the case for a high level of compensation, and, more generally, for very strong and elaborate safeguards against unfair dismissal would be weakened if we substantially increased the statutory entitlement to noticeof termination, a question I come to in the next paragraph.AMENDMENTS TO THE CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT ACT42.       &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; proposed that the statutory notice of termina-tion under the 1963 Act should be extended for long service employees.    Ithink that we should go ahead with this proposaL    As a way of affordingprotection and relief to the employee whose employment is terminated, itmay be preferable to emphasise entitlement to notice rather than elaboratesafeguards against unfair dismissal.    I am not yet ready to make detailed proposals about the extended periods of notice.43.       In our policy statements we have proposed that the written statementof terms and conditions of employment required under the 1963 Act shouldalso set out basic rights and obligations.    I think that we should pursue this proposal, with particular emphasis on grievance procedure,i, et those aspects of procedure agreements that mo6t affect the individualemployee.RIGHT TO BELONG TO A TRADE UNION AND REGULATION OF THECLOSED SHOP44.       I propose that we should establish, as we have proposed, the rightof any employee to belong to an independent trade union.    Any attempt byan employer to infringe $his right, either by preventing or deterring an employee from belonging to a union or by penalising him for so doing,would then entitle the employee to take proceedings before an IndustrialTribunal,
45.       I also intend that our legislation should establish the right not to belong to a trade union,    This would be achieved, first, by makingunlawful the pre-entry closed shop &quot; though it might pi ove desirable toexcept from this general provision pre-entry closed shop ag reements in oneor two sectors where they can be justified e. g. , on grounds of maintainingreasonable security of employment.    Secondly, we need to safeguard theposition of employees and conscientious objectors when a union shop(or &quot;agency shop&quot; as I should prefer to call it) agreement is reached.    the safeguards were set out in &quot;Fair Dealt!as follows;a. 3f the employer or a sufficient percentage of employeesso request, a ballot should be held to determine whether employeeswich  an agency shop to be operated.b. No employee and no conscientious objector should berequired to jcin a union where there is an agency shop,though the agreement between the union and the employermay properly stipulate that an employee who refused to join the union should make appropriate payment in lieu of uniondues.c. No-one expelled from a union which enjoys an agencyshop agreement with an employer should on that accountalone be dismissed by the employer unless expulsion resulted from failure to pay union dues.d. Any union or union official or group of workers whichbrought pressure to bear on an employer to dismiss an employee in contravention of (b) and (c) above should be liableto legal action.THE COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THE EXISTINGINDUSTRIAL COURT46.       I would propose that we should continue in existence the CIR(which is at present established under Royal Warrant).    The CIR will be primarily concerned to assist employers and unions in the (voluntary)reform of industrial relations procedures and institutions.    It would,however, also have important duties in relation to trade union recognition(as suggested in paragraph 26 above) and in relation to the selectiveenforcement of procedure agreements (as suggested in paragraph 6 above).These functions would make it undesirable for the CIR to remain as a royal Commission.    I propose therefore that the Commission should beestablished on a statutory basis, so that its powers will be approved byParliament and it can be abolished only by an amending statute.47.       The existing Industrial Court was established under the industrial courts Act 1919 as a body to which disputes about the terms and conditionsof employment could be referred for voluntary arbitration.    Since 1919,the Court has been charged with a number of more specific arbitrationfunctions, notably under the Terms and Condiiiane of Employ mo at Act.  The
Court has therefore a long experience in resolving &quot;interest&quot; disputes;it is not in the true sense a judicial body interpreting the law orcollective agreements.    Although, therefore, it might be a tidy solution to transfer its functions to the proposed new Industrial Court, I think this worcld add to rather than reduce the confusion between judicial and arbitration functions.    I consider therefore that the balance ofadvantage lies in retaining the Court in being but under a new name whichwould clearly distinguish its special function as an arbitral body.CODE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PRACTICE48.       We envisaged in &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; that a Code of industrial relations Practice would be scheduled to the proposed Industrial relations act.    I now think it would be unrealistic to attempt to append a Code of practice to the Bill,   This is so for sevex-al reasons: the overriding need to enact legislation this Session; the need to consult widely and thoroughlyon the contents of the Code; and the possibility that the Code may have tobe prepared successively in different sections.    Instead I would proposethat we take powers in the Bill to establish one or more Codes of practice covering, among others, the subjects touched on in &quot;Fair Dealat Work&quot;.    This approach would have the advantage both of enabling usto produce more detailed recommendations and to publish different Codesat different times (and, where desirable, revise Codes as necessary).There may, too, be room for treating different Codes in different ways;so the statutory provision should be left as flexible as possible to allow for the possibility that the Secretary of State could, with parliamentary approval, impose certain additional requirements through the Codes of practice.DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY EMPLOYERS49.       One subject which might be treated in a Code of Practice is the disclosure of information necessary for bargaining purposesP and for keeping employees well-informed about the operations of theircompanies.    I propose that we should, as we suggested in Opposition,require registered companies to disclose to employees the same amountof information as they are required to give their shareholders.    Thiswould be a minimum requirement, however, and there is a strong case for providing a body of advice about the extent to which employers shouldtake into their confidence the union officials with whom they negotiate.One of the features of the Labour Governments Industrial Relations bill was that it included a statutory requirement on employers to disclose totrade union bargaining representatives, information which was necessaryto enable the union to participate effectively in negotiation.    I should liketo consider how far a variation on this idea could not be incorporated inour Bill.15
AMENDMENTS TO THE WAGES COUNCILS ACT5 0. The Labour Governments Bill included a small number of amendments to the Wages Councils Act, the main effect of which was toencourage the development and voluntary collective bargaining in WagesCouncil industries. These amendments were on lines recommended bythe Donovan Commission; and I think they would make a small, but useful,contribution to the development of the voluntarist approach in industrial relations.CONCLUSION51.       My colleagues will be very well aware that the various proposals outlined above, which follow very closely what was foreshadowed in&quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot;, will be extremely unpopular with the trade unions,without at the same time causing great jubilation among the ranks of theemployers.    The attitude of the CBI in the past has generally been todeprecate proposals which leave to employers the major responsibilityfor taking legal action against unions and their officials.    For that reason, they will not find attractive many of the proposals outlined above which, though they establish new and narrower limits to legitimateindustrial action, usually leave it to the employer to see that the unions donot take action outside the limits.    The trade unions, for their part, mayhave hoped that &quot;Fair Deal at Work&quot; represented simply a bargaining position from which we would quickly shift once in power.    They will bedoubly disappointed, therefore, to find that on such matters as tradeunion immunities, trade union registration and even on recognition disputes,we are sticking steadfastly to the principles laid down in &quot;Fair Deal atWork&quot;.I52.     ; I seek my colleagues agreement to the proposals in this memorandum;and Cabinet authority to instruct the Parliamentary draftsman to preparelegislation on these lines.    In view of the urgency with which theseproposals have had to be prepared and will need to be developed, I wouldbe grateful, too, for authority to modify them with the agreement of the ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations.R department of Employment and Productivity, SW128 July 197016
CONFIDENTIALAppendix 1&quot;Fair Deal at   Work&quot; -Summary of recommendationsOur proposals are, we believe, as much in the interests of wage-earners and responsible trade unions as of employers and the public at large.   We summarise below the key points:(1)   There would be a new Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos;Associations with powers to ensure that their rules are just;secure fair democratic control;   and are not contrary to thepublic interest.   Registration would be a compulsory condition for any organisation wanting to have the full legal status ofa 1 trade union1.(2)   Trade unions would have corporate legal status - subject onlyto immunity against civil proceedings when acting in further-ance of a lawful trade dispute which is not in breach of agree-ment.(3)   There would be special industrial courts comprising legally-qualified chairmen sitting with &apos;lay&apos; members from both sides of industry.(if)   A Code of Practice would lay down basic standards and guide-lines by which methods and behaviour of management, employees and trade unions could be assessed.(5)   Freely-negotiated agreements between employers and unions wouldbecome legally binding except in so far as the parties agreedto exclude certain provisions.   This would put collective agree-ments on a par with other forms of contract:    no more and no less.(6)   Employers would have a legal duty to recognise, and negotiate with, registered trade unions where a majority of the employees concerned wanted union representation.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEmployees would have a new statutory right of appeal againstalleged unjust dismissal and against disciplinary or coerciveaction by a union - or from any other quarter.(8)Strikes to enforce a closed shop, inter-union disputes,Sympathetic&apos; strikes or lock-outs, and strikes called for the predominant purpose of preventing management from engagingcertain types of  -labour would no longer be protected &apos;tradedisputes&apos;.   The Trade Disputes Act would be repealed and earlier Acts defining &apos;trade disputes&apos; amended.(9)   There would be new safeguards for individuals which must be guaranteed in any agreements to operate a union shop.(10)   The Minister of Labour would be given four new powers:First, to exercise the conciliation functions of the Ministryat his own discretion, instead of having to await a request from one party to a dispute.Second, to refer a dispute to the Industrial Court for arbitra-(11 )txon, where the national interest was seriously threatened.Third, to apply to the Industrial Court for an injunction to delay or stop a strike or lock-out for a stipulated periodwhile further negotiations take place.I        Fourth, (before this period expires) to arrange for a secretballot to be conducted among the workpeople in dispute toensure that the real wishes of the majority are known.The Minister could, however, only exercise the last three powers after receiving the report of a fact-finding Board of Inquiry.CONFIDENTIAL
