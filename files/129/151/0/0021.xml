DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS government cp(70) 46 COPY NO      g 423 September 1970CABINETASSISTANCE TO THE HOTEL industry memorandum by the President of the Board of trade. We inherited froin the previous Administration a scheme ofincentives to the hotel industry in the form of grants and loans.    When thescheme was devised it was very difficult to judge its likely effect or costbut an estimate made at the time was that it would result in the provisionof about 20, 000 new hotel bedrooms at an estimated cost to public funds of 19 million in grants and  7 million in loans spread over the years 1969-70to 1974-75.    This estimate has already proved too low and the cost to theGovernment in grants alone is likely to exceed  30 million perhaps by asubstantial margin.    This is committed expenditure and v/e cannot avoid it.2. The scheme has strict time limits but no financial ceiling.    To be eligible projects must otart before 3i March 1971 and be completed by31 March 1973,    The British Tourist Authority (BTA)have recommended that the grants part of the scheme should be extended for one year, ie. that projectsstarted before 31 March 1972 and completed by 31 March 1974 should be eligible.    This proposal and certain others put forward by the BTA are discussed in the attached annexes.3,        To extend the grant scheme as proposed would cost an estimatedadditional  6 million to  8 million, and in my view the high cost makesacceptance of the proposal out of the question.    The scheme v/as devised asa short-term measure, and there has already been a big increase in thelevel of investment in hotels,    I recommend that the scheme be allowed to run its course and lapse in accordance with the time limits laid down in thelegislation.    Further study is needed before we can judge whether there isa case for any assistance of a long term nature to hotels.    Even if there is,I am sure that extension of the present scheme is not the way to give it.M A C NBoard of Trade SW122 September 1970
confidential annex AASSISTANCE TO THE HOTEL industry.      introduction.1 The British Tourist Authority have submitted proposals for anextension of the hotel development incentive scheme incorporated inPart II of the Development of Tourism Act 1969; they recommend alsocertain longer-term measures of assistance including changes in the tax treatment of hotels. An early decision is needed on the futureof the incentive scheme.2.      ORIGIN OF THE INCENTIVE SCHEME2.1     The present scheme of incentives for hotel development was introduced primarily for balance of payments reasons, both in orderto encourage provision of accommodation for overseas visitors andto encourage Britons to take their holiday at home.2.2     A study carried out in 1967 on behalf of the Hotel and catering Economic Development Committee showed that investment in new hotels and extensions was less profitable than investment in manufacturing industries generally.   The EDC recommended thatincentives should be given in the form of depreciation allowances forbuildings, investment grants for new equipment, and Government loans.2.3     The Government at that time, while accepting that there was acase for assistance, did not accept the specific recommendations bythe EDC.    Instead, provision was made, in the Development of tourism Act 1969, for a scheme of grants and loans tied to specifictypes of development and designed to provide a quick shot-in-the-arrn to stimulate the building of new hotels and extensions to existing hotels.   The scheme was deliberately designed as a short-term measure of a once-for-all kind.3.      MAIN FEATURES OF THE INCENTIVE SCHEME3.1     The incentive scheme provides for the making of grants and loans for hotel building and extensions.    (A brief summary is givenin the Annex.)   The scheme is open-ended, but the Act specifies thatthe work on which grant or loan is claimed must have been startedbetween 1st April 1968 and 31 March 1971 and must be completed by31 March 1973.4.      ESTIMATED COST OF THE INCENTIVE scheme.1     The cost of grants, over the period of the scheme, was originally estimated at about  19m.   This allowed for the paymentof grants on 20,000 bedrooms at an average rate of  800 per bedroomand for the expenditure of some  3m. on grants for improvementschemes involving the installation of the specified items of fixedequipment.    It assumed that investment would rise from  15m. a yearto  25m. a year, of which  20m. was expected to be eligible for grant.4.2     It was estimated, that a further  7m. would be required forloans,5.      COSTS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INCENTIVE SCHEME SO FAR5.1     Applications for grants now in the hands of the tourist boards
cover the construction of over 30,000 bedrooms,  as against the original estimate of 20,000 for the whole period of the scheme.    The rate of receipt of new applications continues high.    On the basis of presentapplications about 20% of the bedrooms will be built in Scotland andWales.5.2     The cost of grants is now expected to be very much higher thanthe estimate of  19m. mentioned in para. 4.1.    It is unlikely to beless than  30m. and may be much more.5.3     It is difficult to isolate the effects of the scheme, but there seems no reason to doubt that it has contributed towards the recentgrowth in investment in hotels.5.4     It is as yet too early to estimate the likely response to, orcosts of, the loan scheme; progress on this part of the scheme is necessarily slower because of the time taken to obtain and examinethe information needed from applicants.6.      BTA proposals.1    The recommendations of the BTA are as follows.6.2     Short-term(a) the grants provisions of the Incentive Scheme shouldbe extended for 12 months.The BTA argue that although the scheme was outlined in a white paper in May 1968, legislation to allow payment of grants and loans and to establish the Tourist Boards did not receive Royal Assentuntil July 1969.    They claim that as a result effective operationof the scheme did not start until 1970.    This left about one year(until 31 March 1971) during which the Boards could publicise thescheme and give guidance on the eligibility of particular projects for grants and loans.   Many developers,  the BTA state, delayeddoing any work on projects until they were sure of the terms ofthe Act.(b) the provision relating to grants for fixed equipment forhotels should be expanded, and the cost of fire precautionequipment and its installation should qualify as eligibleexpenditure.The BTA argue that the present incentives do not afford sufficienthelp to hoteliers who wish to improve existing accommodation by adding, for example, private bathrooms, and comfortable modernrestaurants and bars.6.3     Long-Term(a)   Loans through a Hotel Development fund the establishment of a new body is proposed,  which theBTA see as comparable to the Agricultural MortgageCorporation Ltd., to provide medium-to-long-term financefrom sources such as pension funds and insurance companies for larger independently owned hotels.2
(b) Loans for small hotelsThe BTA advocate a separate scheme  or small hotels, tobe administered by the Tourist Boards.    They propose ascheme covering the whole of Great Britain on the lines of ascheme at present sponsored by the Development Commission.Under this latter scheme, which applies only to rural partsof the development areas, loans are made available to smallhotels, boarding houses, holiday chalets and the like.    these loans are limited to a  25,000 maximum.(c) Taxation allowancesThe BTA recommend that the hotel trade should be given taxequality with manufacturing industry.    They argue that the incentive scheme may eventually stimulate an investment ofabout  150m. in the hotel industry in Great Britain, addingby over one-third to the current investment value in hotel sand that further tax allowances should be given to increasethe profitability of this investment, and to enable theindustry to remain fully competitive with its Europeancompetitors.    Tax allowances are advocated in preference toother forms of assistance on the grounds that by benefittingthe profitable enterprises they reward and thus encourageefficiency.   The tax allowances proposed are:-(i)    Industrial building allowanceThis would allow the cost of hotel building to bedepreciated and written off against profits.    The BTAargue that hotel buildings are purpose-built structureswith an estimated 30 years life, and that they willrarely have any alternative use.    They propose that thesame depreciation rates should be allowed as apply to industry.(ii)    Investment grants (or allowances)The BTA urge that the hotel industry should be eligiblefor investment grants or allowances on their equipment from the time that the incentive scheme expires.    Theyassert that the withdrawal in January 1966 of investmentallowances was &quot;a major blow&quot; to the industry.   Hotelequipment, by the nature of the business, depreciatesrapidly.7.      COST OF BTA PROPOSALS    ,7.1     The BTA have not costed these proposals.    They argue that&quot;any action taken by the Government would be in a sense self-financing&quot;.    The rationale of this seems to be that any increasedtax revenue accruing from greater tourist spending in Great Britainought to be regarded as revenue to be used for the benefit of the hotel industry.    This can hardly be regarded as a serious argument.7.2     The Board of Trade have attempted to make an estimate of theprobable cost of the various proposals.    The figures are necessarilyvery tentative.3
confidential .3     Cost of the extension of the Incentives scheme for one year it is estimated that the cost of a year&apos;s extension of thepresent grants scheme would be between  6m. and  8m.    This assumes that qualifying investment continues to run at the present estimatedlevel of about  30m. a year.    This does not take account of the BTA1sproposal (paragraph 6.2(b)) to expand the range of work qualifying for grant.7.4     Cost of the introduction of the loan scheme the cost of these proposals (paragraph 6.3(a) and (b)) would depend on the criteria and the scope of the schemes.   Because ofthe tentative nature of the BTA&apos; s proposals it is not possible toestimate the likely cost of their adoption.    It would howevercertainly be higher than the present cost of the development commission scheme now running at  1m. a year.7.5     Industrial building allowancesOn the assumptions that it would be possible to extendindustrial building allowances to hotels in isolation from othercommercial buildings and that qualifying investments would be in the region of  30m. to  35m. a year, it is estimated that the adoptionof this proposal might cost in the region of  2-g-m. to  3m. in thefirst year in terms of lost tax, rising progressively to something in the region of  14m. to  16m. after 21 years, when it would level off.This calculation is at constant prices and assuming that CorporationTax remains at the present rate.7.6     Cost of investment grantsIt is estimated that qualifying investment would be of theorder of  5m. to  10m. a year and that investment grants might costsome  1-g-m. to  2^m. a year.8.      COMMENT ON BTA proposals.1     General-   There appears to have been no attempt by the BTAat an objective and critical study of the need for further help from public funds.    Their proposals appear to be based on the viewsof the trade obtained by the circulation of a questionnaire.Proposed Extension of the Incentive Scheme8.2     In examining the future supply of hotel accommodation, theBTA start from the incorrect premise that there are at present5,900 hotels offering 300,000 beds.    Studies published by the EDCindicate that there are 9,000 licensed hotels in the country,offering 455,000 beds.    If unlicensed hotels and guest houses areincluded, the total number of establishments may be about 30,000.8.3     The need for incentives to provide more accommodation, overand above that likely to be produced during the currency of thepresent incentive scheme, lias not been demonstrated.    The BTA paperdoes not provide any evidence that normal market forces will not secure sufficient investment in the future to keep pace withdemand.    There are indications that profitability in the industry
is improving.   Average hotel occupancy has risen Prom 52% in 1967to 6 5% in 1969 .8.4     Nor do the BTA demonstrate that the incentive scheme has beenthe main factor in the growth of investment.    On the contrary,  they state in their memorandum that although the scheme has speeded up some investment decisions and encouraged new interest in possibleinvestment,  they have not found that as yet new hotel units havebeen started directly as a result of the Act.8.5     Other factors must also be taken into account.    There is evidence that profitability was improving by the end of 1968 and may now be higher generally than at the time of the EDC study.    Incertain areas like London special factors (e.g. difficulty in getting office development permits) may also have stimulated interestin building hotels.    In response to an enquiry by the BTA, about half the hotel proprietors questioned said that they would have goneahead with their new investment whether or not there had been an incentive scheme.    Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that theannouncement and introduction of the present scheme has contributedin part to the current upswing in investment.8.6     The BTA appear to base their case primarily on the argument that some hoteliers did not use the interval between the publicationof the details of the scheme in a White Paper and the passing oflegislation to plan their projects, and that in consequence, theymay not be able to start in time to get grants.    In the absence ofevidence that this additional accommodation is needed, or will not go ahead without a grant, this argument does not appear to besufficient to justify the expenditure which would be involved inan extension of the scheme.Longer Term proposals.7     The BTA&apos;s recommendations for continued assistance in the formof tax reliefs and loans are not supported by any study of present :and likely future profitability of the industry.    The EDC is carrying out a study into the future pattern of demand, investment and profitability of the industry in different parts of the country.This study should be completed by the middle of next year.    Itseems premature to consider proposals for longer term assistanceto the hotel industry by way of grant or loan until the report ofthe EDC on investment is available; until the Tourist Boards arein a position to assess relative- priorities within the touristfield; and until the present review of taxation and public expenditure is completed.    It will then be possible to judgewhere there is a need for further assistance, where this need arises,and what priority it should be accorded in.relation to other forms ofassistance to tourism and other demands on the public purse.9.      conclusions .1     The BTA have not established a case for incurring the substantial additional expenditure of public money which extension of the incentive scheme would involve.    The scheme was devised as a short-term measure to stimulate snvestment in hotels, and, on the basis ofthe applications already made to the Tourist Board, it is clear thatthe objectives of the scheme have been more than achieved.5
9.2     The Board of Trade recommend that consideration of the other proposals of the BTA should await the outcome of the Government1sgeneral review of taxation and public expenditure, and the completionof the EDCs study.BOARD OF TRADE22 September 19706
ANNEX BMAIN FEATURES OF THE HDI scheme.     The Incentives Scheme provides an entitlement to grants for new hotels, for extensions to existing hotels providing not lessthan 5 additional letting bedrooms, and for the purchase andinstallation of certain items of fixed equipment.    The rate of grantis 20% of eligible expenditure (25% in Development Areas), subjectto an upper limit of  1,000 for every additional bedroom created bythe development ( 1,250 in Development Areas).2.     To be eligible for these grants an hotel must have at least 10bedrooms for letting and must have certain other characteristicsnormally associated with traditional serviced hotel accommodation.The scheme does not extend to self-catering accommodation, nor tobed and breakfast establishments nor to long term residential accommodation.3.     The time limit of the scheme is specified in the Act; the workon which grant is claimed must have been started between 1 April 1968and 31 March 1971 and be&apos;completed by 31 March 1973.4.     The scheme provides no automatic entitlement to loans, but thestatute gives the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, whoadminister the scheme, power to give loans in addition to grants in suitable cases.    Loans cannot normally exceed 30% of the eligibleexpenditure on new hotels, or 50% of the eligible expenditure onextensions and improvements.     The maximum loan is  500,000 for anyone project.    Loans are given only for projects costing  10,000 ormore ( 20,000 in the case of new hotels).BOARD OF TRADE22 SEPTEMBER 19707
