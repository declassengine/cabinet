OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT54CP(70) 32 COPY NO28 July 1970CABINETFINANCIAL, ASSISTANCE TO HARLAND AND WOLFF LIMITEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Minister of technology, We are bringing this matter before our colleagues both because ofits importance in terms of industrial policy and for its impact on the current situation in Northern Ireland.    Substantial public expenditure is alsoinvolved.PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION2.        The Belfast company of Karland and Wolff have requested urgentfinancial sssistance, through the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB), toenable them to carry on business.    Information provided by the companyrecently shov/ed that:-i. They have a bank overdraft of  2jr million v/hich Is fully used.There Is no possibility of an increase.Ii 11ii. They owe suppliers about S.?,j million of which nearlyS.j million is owed in Northern Ireland.  2 million is the maximum amount of suppliers1 credit they v/ould generally think prudent.iii. They expect, even with the most advantageous financial arrangements, to lose money on shipbuilding and engine building up fco 1974.    A profit forecast for 1974 is based on a  2.5 millionprofit from future orders (ie. orders not yet taken or contemplated).Iv.       On the same basis, they expect an adverse cash flow of 8f million during the whole of the period up to 1974.     7 million of this adverse flow is in the period 1970-71.v. By the end of this week they claim they will be unableto meet wages payments.3,        The figures supplied by the company support the view that 1.5 million is needed almost Immediately to meet essential payments, andthat a further sum of between  1 million and  2 million will be required bythe end of the year if they are to stay in business.
4.        A fuller background note on the company is at Annex,LONGER TERM NEEDS5,        The company are preparing a detailed submission for the SIB ontheir longer term needs and hope to submit it in August,    present information indicates a need for at least a further  4 million early nextyear, but there are a number of ways in which the company longer termcash position might be eased.6.        Cost escalation and inflation have made unprofitable past fixed pricecontracts taken by Harland and Wolff (in common with other shipbuilders).The company have already renegotiated contracts for two ships for deliveryin 1973 and are seeking to renegotiate prices for two large tankers forEsso and two for Onassis.    There are ship repair facilities (at London,Liverpool and Belfast) which are at present breaking even and which mightwell have a price on the market to help meet future losses.    these facilities are not essential to the shipbuilding operation.    The company have negotiated with the Northern Ireland Government a moratorium on capital repayments on their 1966 loan due for repayment between 1970 and1975.    They also hope to negotiate a deferment of interest paymentsamounting to  245, 000 per annum,7.        We are therefore not required for the moment to reach a final view on the amount of any further assistance needed beyond an initial sum of upto  3f million, but if we agree to this initial sum it must be in the knowledge that (as explained below) we are accepting a liability for an even largeramount.    The method of meeting this longer term requirement can be pursued with the SIB, the Northern Ireland Government and the company.There could be a case for putting the onus of legislation to provide money on the Northern Ireland Government though we should in practice have to put them in funds to meet this requirement.THE SIB VIEW8.        The SIB hold the view that the company should have a viable futuregiven proper direction, good management and co-operation from theworkers.    313 think it undesirable that the substantial public investment inthe new building dock and other capital facilities ( 15 million) should be jeopardised by a temporary shortage cf working capital or that the company with its shipbuilding potential should go out of business.    They have therefore recommended that the assistance needed should be made available under the provisions of the Shipbuilding Industry Act.    They point out,however, that they are unable to provide more than  3.5 million as a grantunder Section 3 of the Act given the funds remaining available to them forthis ptrrpose and other calls.    Moreover, they cannot under the terms of theAct provide loans to the company for working capital purposes nor, since they may only take equity in circumstances where they can give loans,could they provide funds by way of subscription for shares.
9, The SIB therefore seeks the approval of the Minister c  Technologyfor a grant of  3.5 million.    They make it clear, however, that they recommend this assistance only if they are assured that the further assistance needed would also be made available by the Government,10.       With a  3. 5 million grant by the SIB grants under Section 3 of the shipbuilding Industry Act will exceed the Ministry of Technology voteprovision for 1970-7L    However, as loans under Section 4 will be less thanforecast overall, shipbuilding industry expenditure will not exceed thePublic Expenditure Survey Committee (PESO) forecast,    A supplementary estimate to cover this and expenditure in respect of other shipbuildingcompanies may be necessary next spring.THE BEAGLE IMPLICATIONS11.        In considering the implications cf the Beagle case in February, 1970,the Law Officers set down the principle, under the Companies Act, thatGovernment should never knowlingly be a party to an insolvent companycontinuing to carry on business unless either there was a reasonable prospect that by doing so, or by some other means, it would become solventagain, or that Government was satisfied that such funds as may be needed to pay creditors would become available from its own resources orotherwise.    In further deliberations with the Law Officers, it v/as made clear that they meant by &quot;become solvent again&quot; that the company would&quot;become solvent again and remain so for a reasonable period&quot;.12.       Following information from the Chairman and the Financial Directorof Harland and Wolff there is no doubt that the company is now insolvent.It is the Treasury Solicitorrs opinion that, by agreeing to provide money,whether through the SIB or otherwise, the Government will be committed to providing not only what in immediately required to make the companysolvent, but also whatever further assistance may be needed to keep thecompany solvent for a reasonable period.    Given that we know on presentforecasts that the company is not expected to break even financially againtill 1974, &quot;a reasonable period&quot; may have to be interpreted as up to thattime.    1  this is not done, and the company subsequently goes into liquidation, the Government may well be obliged to ensure that thecompany1 s creditors are met in full,ALTERNATIVE TO ASSISTANCE13.       Any assistance to the company at this time from public funds will carry with it the obligations set out in the preceding paragraph.    Thealternative of refusing assistance would inevitably lead to the collapse of thecompany and its eventual liquidation.14.       Liquidation need not mean that shipbuilding at Belfast would entirelycease with the immediate and permanent loss of some 9* 500 jobs in the belfast shipyard.   Arrangements would likely be made for the completionof ships in the yard where construction was at an advanced stage.    Moreover,3
the building dock and its facilities (even Incomplete) provide a shipbuildingfacility unequalled elsewhere In this country and possibly in Europe..    Withthe present world demand for ships and a world shortage of. capacity for early delivery8 such a facility is likely to prove attractive to othershipbuilders.    Similarly both the engine building and ship repair facilities at Belfast may find a purchaser,15.       The effect on other industries in Northern Ireland might also be only moderate,    Harland and Wolff say that only about 15 per cent of their trade creditors represent Northern Ireland interests.16.       Against this must be set the profound shock which the collapse of this company would have on Northern Ireland opinion at the present difficulttime.    No-one can really foresee what the effect of a liquidation would be.Even if shipbuilding survived at Belfast there would be a period of uncertainty and some additional unemployment.    With  an overallunemployment rate in Belfast of 4, 5 per cent of the working population(and a higher male unemployment rate) the loss of even half the jobs in theyaid would increase the unemployment rate in Belfast to 6; 5 per cent ormore.    In the present disturbed state of Northern Ireland, this could havean inflammatory effect.FUTURE POSSIBILITIES17.       The company have improved their management information systems and have introduced a new management structure.    They are also seeking anew Managing Director.    They are concentrating on building bulk carriersand large tankers and are rationalising their facilities and abandoning those not required for this purpose.    The new steel working facilities have not yetbeen completed but are expected to be fully operational by the beginning of next year.    The company are seeking to Introduce shift working.    All ofthese developments should enable thern to increase substantially their steelwork productivity.    No further contracts will be taken without the inclusionof a price variation (i. e. escalation) clause.    They hope to return toprofitability by 1973 or 1974 (although if their cash flow deficit continues atthe current rate beyond 1971 we would expect to see far bigger losses thanthose forecast).18.       Two prominent foreign shipowners (Fred Olsen and Onassis) haveshown interest in acquiring the shipbuilding facilities and operating themwith the help of management expertise from abroad.    British shipbuildersmay also be interested in acquiring the facilities, particularly the new building dock.    These possibilities are being actively explored,    None ofthem is sufficiently advanced to avoid the immediate need to supply 1, 5 million to the company.    It is likely that any possible arrangementshere would require public funds (such as the clearing of the company*sdebts first) to get them off the ground.4
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS19,       The following main conclusions may be drawn;U Harland and Wolff are insolvent.    They require if million immediately, up to  2 million by the end of the year,and up to  4 million in 1971 zf they are to stay In business,,    Theycannot raise the money required immediately from the market orfrom sale of assets.ii.        For 1970 to 1973 inclusive they forecast company losses of  10 million which could be greater if the expected Improvementin company performance Is not achieved.iii8       The Shipbuilding Industry Board has recommended a grantof  3-1 million under the Shipbuilding Industry Act - provided theGovernment undertakes to make available any further sums requiredto keep the company viable.    Moreover, given the insolvency ofthe company, the Government is in no position under the CompaniesAct to meet Immediate needs only without an obligation to meet thefurther needs of the company as foreseen.iva       The alternative is liquidation of the company to release it from its present, financial burdens0    With the present situation inNorthern Ireland this is politically unacceptable.v.        In all of this, we need to recognise that this will be an industrial rescue operation having similar features to the UpperClyde Shipbuilding (UCS) and Cammell Laird (i. e, public funds tomeet losses).    It carries with it, unless handled very skilfully,the same potential demoralisation of the rest of the Industry assimilar operations under the previous G over nine tit.    It will need to be cast within the wldei framework of aid to Northern Irelandat a troubled time without undue emphasis on employment alonewhich is precisely the case for UCS and Cammell Laird.    (Thereis not much difference between the unemployment rates for belfast and Glasgow).20,       We therefore recommend to our colleagues that:i. The Minister of Technology should approve the SIB,recommendation of a grant of  3f million for Harland and Wolffbut should ask for only  if million to be made available immediately on the understanding, however, that the Government accepts that thefinancial needs of the company as foreseen will have to be met byone means or another,ii. Departments concerned should consider how best to meet thefuture financial requirements of the company given the limitations onSIB funds and the desirability of associating this aid as closely aspossible with the Northern Ireland Government.5
iii.       The Ministry of Technology should actively explore, inconsultation v/ith other interested Departments, how best to reinforce the management and improve the future financialperformance of Harland and Wolff (including the possibility of association with foreign interests) and the conditions to be attachedto any further help from public funds.R MG RHome Office SW127 July 1970
ANNEXBACKGROUND mFOEMATION ON HAELAND &amp; WOLEFIn their yard at Belfast the company build and repair ships,aanufacture ships engines and electrical equipment and fabricatestructural steelwork.     The company also has shiprepair yards at Liver-pool, Southampton and London.2,    The company&apos;s shipbuilding activities are concentrated in alarge new building dock with associated steel facilities, still in course of construction, and an adjacent yard building on berths.For ship repair the company has the exclusive use of a large moderngraving dock owned by the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.3.    The company employs about 7,500 operatives and 2.000 staff atBelfast and about 700, 1,400 and 750 (including staff) at liverpool, Southampton and London respectively.&apos;4c    Currently on order with the company are six giant (250,000 dwt)tankers and eight bulk carriers for delivery between now and 1973.The company also has orders for 23 slow speed diesel engines andthree steam turbines, also for delivery between now and 1973-Assistance from public funds%    In September 1966 the company was saved from collapse by a 3.5 million loan at 7 per cent from the Northern Ireland Government.The loan is to be repaid by instalments between now and 1975-60    Between mid-1968 and end 1969 the company received a total of 8 million in loans from the SIB at rates varying, between 7z% dJ1^L%% to be interest free until end 1970, with interest capitalisedbetween then and 1975        repayable thereafter in equal instalmentsover 33 years.     The loan was a contribution towards the cost ofbuilding the new dock and facilities.     Most of the rest of the costof the dock and facilities was met from Northern Ireland GovernmentInvestment Grants (about  6im.)o7.    In 1967 the SIB promised  910,000 in grants as a contributionto the cost of building two giant tankers for Esso.     To date 455,000 has been paid.8.    In 1969 the SIB promised up to  1.56 million in grants as a contribution to the losses and expenses arising out of there organisation of the yard around the new facilities.     To date 1.2 million lias been paid.9.    In all, Harland arid Wolff can be said to have had  19m. sofar from public funds for their purposes;   a promise of nearly  lm.to come;   and a current plea for up to  7m. or so.2?th July 1970
