DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS government cp(70) 34 COPY NO   5429 July 1970CABINETTHE OPEN UNIVERSITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and Science40, 000 applications have already been received by the OpenUniversity.    The University has been sifting these over the last fewmonths.    They intend, and, as things now stand, they are entirelyfree, to send letters of acceptance to 25, 000 students from 1 August.There has been no consultation about a departure from this cornmit-ment with the Chancellor (Lord Crowther), the Vice-ChancellorDr. &quot;Walter Perry), the Treasurer (Sir Paul Chambers) or with anyother member of the Council.    We simply could not defend the abrupttermination of the Universityls existence, without consultation, bySaturday.    Quite apart from this political consideration the unit cost per graduate produced in this new institution could Well be substantially less than in the orthodox university system.    Its successful develop-ment could offer significant off-setting savings in higher education costs in later years.    It has aroused considerable intersst and expectationand attracted a surprisingly wide range of influential support.    Wewould be open to further criticism, within the educational world andfrom public opinion at large, if we decided to write off  8 million ormore of public expenditure as nugatory without allowing any opportunityof proving that the claims mad-* for the Open University can besubstantiated and without any firm evidence that they cannot.    I must therefore ask my colleagues to reject ifca immediate termination.2.     I would not rule out the alternative of reducing the first intakefrom 25, 000 to 15, 000 students, although I should point out that the saving in 1971 would be negligible and less than  2 million in 1973-74.Moreover, to pursue this course would have undesirable consequences.The decision would have to be announced before Saturday 1 August.    Thefirst of the Government cuts would thus be seen to be falling on education.This would lend credence to the recent Press speculation that other cutstotalling  100 million in the education sector were to follow.    For twoor three months I could neither confirm nor deny these rumours.    Ibelieve we should have trouble out of all proportion to the money saved.1
3,     I invite my colleagues to consider leaving the intake for this year at 25, 000.    The Government would need to do nothing publicly at thisstage.    But I would put the Open University on notice that later thisyear (when the Government proposals as a whole on reductions in public expenditure had been announced)     I would want to consider with them?(i)     the rate of entry for the second and succeeding years;(ii)      the need to provide for students under 21 who might otherwise go to other, more costly forms of higher education;(iii)     the prospects of them increasing their own revenuewith a view to limiting the continuing level of publicfinancial support.    I believe this approach could bemade to save almost as much as the alternative whileavoiding the immediate political difficulties.4.     I propose that we should follow the course outlined in the last paragraph.    But if my colleagues wanted a gesture towards economy,despite the political consequences which I am sure would follow, I wouldbe prepared to accept an entry of 15,000 students this year.M H t department of Education and Science Wl29 July 19702
