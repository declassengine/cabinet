IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 31 COPY NO5428 July 1970CABINETSCOTTISH ELECTRICITY prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. At their meeting on 21 July (CM(70) 7th Conclusions, Minute 7)the Cabinet invited the Minister of Technology to bring forward forconsideration the consequential effects of higher coal prices on thecharges for electricity and steel.    The memorandum (CF(70) 29)circulated by the Minister deals with the effects on electricity prices in England and Wales and on steel prices.    This memorandum dealtwith the effects on electricity prices in Scotland,2, The Scottish Electricity Boards recently announced price increasesaveraging 7 per cent to take effect from 14 July in the South of Scotland and1 August in the North,    These increases were the minimum necessary to cope with the increases in coal prices made by the National Coal Boardearlier this year.    They were based on the assumption that the Board&apos;sfull programme of conversion to oil-firing proceeded as planned.3,        Any further increase in the price of Scottish coal would necessitateearly increases in Scottish electricity prices, even if the Boards1 full oilconversion programme were approved immediately.    A 12^ per cent increase in the coal price would add  4- 5 million (or 3 per cent) tothe annual costs of the Scottish Electricity Boards.    The Boards&apos; records of increased productivity have been very good, but there is no prospect oftheir absorbing cost increases of this order,,    Unless charges were increased the South of Scotland Board would be in deficit on revenue account for a second successive year, and the Board is thereforecontemplating a coal surcharge on all consumers, except industrialconsumers (whose tariffs are linked to coal prices), of , 07d. per unit,which represents an increase of between 4 and 5 per cent,    I would wishto bring this into operation by 1 October.    The North Board, which is lessdependent on coal, will nevertheless also have to reconsider its charges.4,        If a second round of coal and electricity price increases takes placethis year pressure will certainly grow for Government subsidies to theNational Coal Board to reduce the cost of electricity coal in Scotland.There is a special Scottish problem here.    In Scotland coal constitutes a much larger, and more rapidly risingi proportion of the electricity industry&apos;s fuel than in England and Wales.    Regional differentiation of
coal prices, for commercial reasons related to costs of production, isvery difficult to reconcile with a denial of freedom to the Scottish electricity boards to act commercially by proceeding with their programme of conversion of power stations to oil-firing, which would also lightenthe burden of electricity costs to Scottish industry.    If commercialforces are not to be allowed to operate to this extent, there is a strong arguement for supporting Scottish coal production from the Exchequerrather than by imposing a burden on Scottish electricity consumers,conclusion.        As electricity tariffs have just recently been increased in Scotland,the further necessary increase will be seen to be directly related to coal prices.    Industrial and other consumers will almost certainly demandeither that the Scottish Electricity Boards should be permitted to under-take a thoroughgoing conversion policy (which would be very damaging tothe mining industry in Scotland) or that prices for electricity coal inScotland should be adjusted, whether by removal of the regionaldifferential or by a direct subsidy.    I would regard this as a reasonabledemand and I must press that the alternative possibilities of removing the regional differential or directly subsidising electricity coal in scotland should be sympathetically examined by the Minister of Technology.G T C CiiScottish Office SW128 July 1970
