k DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 4523 September 1970MERSEY DOCKS AND HARBOUR BOARD -FINANCIAL situation memorandum by the Minister of Trans pertBACKGROUNDMy letter of 17 September to the Chancellor of the Exchequerdescribed a serious and urgent financial situation that had just beenrevealed to me by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB).There were two immediate problems,    First, that the MDHB would be unable, without a third-party guarantee, to proceed with a bond renewal of about   1 million on 27    September.    Second, that they neededalmost immediately a  3 million tranche of a loan under the HarboursAct already agreed for work done on their new Seaforth Dock scheme.W ithout this loan they would not be able to meet immediate commitments.2.     The recent background to this situation is that the Chairman andDirector-General of the MDHB came to see me at the end of July: theyadmitted that they were in financial difficulties and asked forGovernment help.    I insisted that they should appoint a first rate firm ofaccountants to investigate their affairs from a short list to be agreed with me and that I should approve the terms of reference.    Theaccountants should report before the end of the year,3.     Messrs, Binder, Hamlyn and Co. were duly appointed early inAugust.    What they found was so alarming that they felt bound to write to the MDHB on 10 September telling them in effect that they were for all practical purposes insolvent.    On the MDHB&apos;s forecasts there was likely to be a revenue deficit of  2, 7 million in 1970 and furtherdeficits totalling   27 million over the next five years.    In addition theMDHB had to refinance  28. 6 million of its capital debt by the end of1973, including  6. 2 million of bonds falling due on 1 January 1971.The MDHB was also contemplating capital expenditure of over 30 million before the end of 1973.    On the basis of these figuresBinder, Hamlyn considered that the MDHB would be unable to raise further capital.    After consulting their merchant bankers and legal advisers theChairman of the MDHB came to see my officials as described in myletter of 17 September.COPY NO     5,1CABINET1
THE  3 MILLION LOAN4.      The problem of the  3 million Harbours Act loan was discussed on 21 September in the Economic Policy Committee (EPC).    The advice of the Solicitor General is that since there is a Loan Agreement with theMDHB and the works have been carried out, I remain under a legal obligation to advance this money to the MDHB.    Accordingly, inrespect of this particular  3 million tranche, no question arises of myincur ing any liability to the bondholders or other creditors of the MDHBof the sort that might arise if I were voluntarily to provide the MDHBwith funds to enable them to continue trading while insolvent.5.     It is therefore clear that there is no escape from advancing this 3 million tranche of loan and this was accepted by the EPC.    I amaccordingly proceeding with issuing it this week and I have so informed the MDHB.    I have made it completely clear to the MDHB (as myDepartment have already emphasised to them) that this does not imply any commitment whatsoever on the part of the Government to standbehind the MDHB in meeting their financial obligations to their bond-holders or other creditors.PROPOSED PUBLIC STATEMENT6.     As the MDHB are unable to proceed with the acceptance  of any ofthe  1 million bond renewal on 27 September, Binder, Hamlyn e&amp;d theBoard&apos;s merchant bankers, Baring Bros, are new preparing the termsof a statement to be issued to the Press (possibly on Thursday,24 September).    It is expected mat this will explain that the MDHB&apos;financial affairs are being investigated by consultants and that pendingreceipt of the consultants report the MDHB have decided that theyshould not renew the bonds,7,     Baring Bros, are considering whether such a statement would hold the position, but we must recognise that in the absence of an assurance of Government financial backing for the MDHB it may not doso.    This is, however, a risk I think we must take, in order to avoid the Government blindly incurring an unknown liability with reducedchances then of pressing the bondholders to take a share of the loss orthe MDHB to press on with putting their house in order.    But, theMDHB must be put in funds to the extent of sufficient cash to meet theirliabilities until about the end of the year.    By that time Binder, Hamlyn&apos;sfull report (which will recommend the steps that the Board might take todeal with their problems including possible legislation to deal with a financial reconstruction) should have been received and considered.THE NEXT FEW MONTHS8.     In addition to the   3 million tranche payable this week, theMDHB are entitled under existing loan agreements to further sums ofabout  2 million; on the legal advice already received, there seems nodoubt that this will have to be paid.    But since the EPC discussion it2SECRET
has become clear that the MDHB ls further cash requirements are liJoelyto amount to an additional  3 millions and since the alternative is forthe MDHB to cease trading I think we shall have no option but to advance the money.    But my colleagues will appreciate that this is likely to haveimplications of the kind mentioned at the end of paragraph 4, and we mustact with this clearly in mind.THE SEAFORTH DOCK scheme.     I have no doubt that we should continue to make loans to supportthe Seaforth scheme.     The scheme is Liverpool^ only hope.    Most ofthe port is obsolescent.    It is for this reason that the MDHB decided afew years ago to embark on the Seaforth project now estimated to cost about  40 million.    About half of this sum has already been spent andthe dock is planned to start coming into use next July.    If the projectwere abandoned, as it might be if we did not continue to make loans and grants (not only the  3 million payable this week and the further sum needed till the end of. 1970, but the balance of the cost), I see nofuture for the port.LIMITATION OF THE GOVERNMENTS LIABILITY10.    We should, however, do everything possible to prevent the continuing provision of new capital from involving the Government in any liability to the bondholders and debenture holders much of whose capitalhas already been lest.    It is for this reason that we need a breathing space until the MDHB &apos;s advisers have been able to examine their prospects thoroughly and prepare detailed proposals for remedial action.The MDHB have already considered various possibilities, including a25 per cent increase in charges; closure of part of the Docks; cuts in labour and staff; closure of oversea offices; sales of land; and alarge reduction in capital expenditure on improvements and renewals ofthe existing dock system.    K these were all carried out very significantimprovements could be secured in the board&apos;s future revenue prospects.But they need careful study (in which my Department and the national ports Council will need to take part) and they clearly will not avoid theneed for some capital reconstruction.CONCLUSION11.     I will report to my colleagues as soon as possible the outcome ofthe discussions with the MDHBfs advisers (in which I am being advised bya senior partner of Peat, Mar wick and Mitchell) and circulate a draft ofthe MDHB&apos;s proposed statement.    At the same time the Government^position will have to be made clear, either in a public statement or by aletter to the MDHB,J W W ministry of Transport SE122 September 19703
