OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS government cp(70) 29 COPY NO   5427 July 1970CABINETELECTRICITY AND STEEL prices memorandum by the Minister of TechnologyAt their meeting on 21 July (CM(70) 7th Conclusions, Minute 7)the Cabinet invited me to bring forward for consideration the consequentialeffects of higher coal prices on the charges for electricity and steeL2.     About four fifths of the coal price increase whatever its level will fall on the British Steel Corporation (BSC) and the Electricity Boards.This means that to get the benefits of the increase for the economy and theExchequer those Boards must be allowed to pass it on - otherwise we getthe adverse publicity merely for the sake of a transfer of burdens withinthe public sector.    The consequential increases are not an additional burden on consumers - it is through them and not directly that any coalprice increase will be made effective,THE PROPOSALS3.     I have now received proposals as follows(a) The Electricity Council propose that from 1 October the area boards should increase prices by around 0. 15d per unit(about 7 per cent) on all sales except to those large consumerswhose tariffs or contracts provide for prices to vary automaticallywith coal prices.    This increase would raise  20 million in1970-71 and rather more than  50 million in a full year.    It is designed to recover the cost of a 12f per cent increase in theprice of electricity coal and also the unrecovered costs of thelast two coal price increases.(b) The BSC propose simultaneously with the increase in the price ofthe coal to raise the prices of steel products by varying amountsequivalent in total to about     per cent on turnover.    The increases which would raise   10 million in 1970-71 and  18 million in a fullyea? would be sufficient to cover an increase of 12f- per cent in theprice of coal,, but no more.1
ELECTRICITY4. The last general increase in electricity prices was in September 1967.Since then costs have risen by  116 million made up as follows:-5.     Of the higher fuel costs about  37 million is attributable to the lasttwo coal price increases -   15 million of this has already been recovered from large consumers whose prices automatically reflect changes in coal prices.     16 million of a further coal price increase of lZj per cent wouldbe recovered in the same way.    The proposed increase relates only to the consumers - mainly commercial and domestic - who are not covered bythese arrangements.    Without it there would be a growing distortion in thetariff at the expense of the industrial consumer.6,     The electricity industry has done much to absorb cost increasesby improved operating efficiency and productivity bargains.    Butinevitably financial results have been affected.    In 1969-70 the electricity boards in England and Wales earned a return gross of interest of6. 4 per cent against the financial objective for the current quinquenniumof 7 per cent - a short fall of  30 million.    A coal price increase of say12f per cent (costing the boards  43 million in a full year) would,together with the effects of other cost and revenue changes, mean a shortfall this year on the financial objective of about   80 million with revenuesbarely sufficient to cover interest charges.7.     There is undoubtedly scope for further cost saving in theelectricity industry - for example there are big delays in commissioningnew plant and the availability of plant when commissioned is too low.But this will take time and in the meantime there is a gap of about  80 million to be covered this year even without allowing for thepossibility of a wage increase in the autumn.    Against this the benefit thisyear from the proposed increase would be only  20 million.8.     If the increase were limited to that consequential on the proposedcoal price increase it would need to be 0. 07d per unit for a lZjr per cent increase and 0. 055d for a 10 per cent increase.     But to limit theelectricity increase would reduce revenue by  28 million a year, withconsequences for borrowing and taxation? would leave the industry even further short of its modest financial objective; and would perpetuate thedistortion mentioned in paragraph 5.    There is, therefore, a powerfulcase on financial grounds for recovering past price increases with thepresent one.    This could be presented as a coherent whole related to thecoal price increase and it would probably avoid the need for a furthernationwide price increase until 1971-72,    (Some of the Boards in a relatively weak financial position might not be able to wait beyond next april.)Higher fuel costsHigher salariesHigher interest chargesOther increases (e. g. rates) 51 million 25 million 20 million 20 million2
STEEL9.     The BSC made losses in their first two financial years of 42 million in total after paying interest but before paying any dividendat all on their  700 million of public dividend capital.    They made a smallprofit of  10 million in the six months to March 1970 and had expected a profit of over  100 million in the current financial year.    They haverecently told me that they now expect this figure to be reduced to 35 million.    This deterioration is due not to cost increases^ which were allowed for when steel prices were generally increased in January, but tooperational shortcomings, in particular commissioning delays and labour difficulties.10,    A profit of  35 million will be barely sufficient to cover the BSCsaccumulated losses - so after four years of nationalisation the country will have received no dividends on public dividend capital despite the factthat we have had a world steel boom.    There is thus a case for asubstantial general increase in British steel prices which would bring them more into line with those in western Europe.    The BSC are not proposingsuch an increase - they rightly take the view that it is their responsibility to solve the operating problems which have depressed their financial results.    They do say that they cannot reasonably be expected to absorban increase in coal prices which at 12-1 Per cent would cost them 18 million in a full year and for which they made no provision in their earlier assessments.PROCEDURE11.    The industries have to consult their statutory Consumer Councilsbefore implementing price proposals.    Unless there are early referencesthe price increases could not be implemented cn the proposed dates:every month&apos;s delay would cost  4f million in the case of electricity and  1 \ million in the case of steel,     I think we should let them go aheadon the clear understanding that the references are without prejudice tothe Governments position and that we will be looking at the position as awhole when we get the reports of the Consumer Councils.CONCLUSIONS12.     There is clearly much room to improve the performance of theelectricity industry and the BSC.    Major long term questions are involvedincluding the effects of the previous Governments fuel policy on theelectricity industry&apos;s costs, difficulties with the nuclear power programme and the future structure of the BSC.     I have put work in hand on allthese matters and will report to my colleagues as soon as possible.    In themeantime I am satisfied that the BSC ought to increase prices to the extentneeded to cover the increase in the price of coking coal which we approveand that the Electricity Boards should increase unit charges by 0.15d,assuming coal prices are increased by 10.J.2f per cent.    The case on industrial grounds is strong; and the increases will benefit the revenue of the boards by  30 million an 1970-71 and by  70 million in a full year,which is important for taxation.3
13.     Accordingly I ask my colleagues to agree that I should tell theElectricity Council and the BSC that we have no objection to their puttingtheir price proposals to the Consumer Councils on a conditional basis butthat the Government will wish to consider the position as a whole in thelight of the reports of the Councils.G RMinistry of Technology SW127 July 19704
