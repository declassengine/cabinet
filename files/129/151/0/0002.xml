DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS government cp(70) 2723     July 1970CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1970-71Memorandum by the Lord President of the council I submit for the approval of my colleagues proposals for thelegislative programme for the remainder of the current Session, whichhave been considered by the Ministerial Committee on Future Legislation;these are set out in Annex A to this memorandum.    At Annex B, I havelisted the Bills, mostly minor in character, which have already been introduced or will have been introduced by the time both Houses risefor the Summer Recess.2,     If we are to avcid hasty and ill-considered legislation, we must take a firm stand now against including in the legislative programmemore Bills than the available Parliamentary time and drafting resourcescan reasonably accommodate.    Inevitably this will mean holding over until a subsequent Session some measures which we would like to obtainnow, but I am sure that it is the right basis on which to proceed and inthis I have the support of my colleagues on the Ministerial Committee.It is particularly important to resist the temptation to attempt too muchin this first Session, because as a new Government we have had no chance to push preparations and drafting ahead before  the Session opened and itwill not be easy to have sufficient Bills ready for the earlier part of the session.    And if business is to be discharged efficiently we must avoidplacing too heavy a load on any one Minister and his Department.3.     The list of Bills in Annex A is classified under the following headings:-Essential Bills - that is Bills which must be obtained bya specific date (e. g. because otherwisepowers will lapse or some financiallimit be exceeded. )Contingent Bills - that is Bills the need for which is not as yet certain, but which may become essential in the above sense.B       - Main Programme BillsC      - Bills in ReserveCOPY NO     g IAI     -A21
B(S) - Bills for Scottish Grand CommitteeS      - Bills suitable for Second Reading Committee ProcedureP    - Bills suitable for Private members the remaining Bills put forward for the Session&apos;s programme, for which no place has been found, are listed in Annex C.Details of the programme. Taking the categories of Bill in turn, I would make the followingpoints in the light of the discussion in the Ministerial Committee and ofthe views expressed by Ministers in charge of Departments,5.     Essential Bills.    The Secretary of State for Scotland is anxiousto see included a Bill to increase the allowance payable to Her MajestyfsHigh Commissioner tc the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.Accepting that the present limit of  7,500 is quite unrealistic and that failure to raise it may necessitate unpleasant economies, I do not see how such a Bill could fa?,l to spark off controversy about the Civil List.There are embarrassments either way and I must ask the Cabinet todecide.6.     Cqntingent Bills.     These are Bills that may oecomo essential;in practice only a proportion of them is likely to materialise.   european communities is shown here although legislation in this field seemsextremely unlikely in the present Session and, if substantial, wouldprobably make it necessary to drop some other Bills.7.     Ms1B-? 2  5HHB?*    This is the most important part of theprogramme and the one where the pressure for a place is heaviest; toprevent overloading the programme I have felt bound to reject a numberof the Bills put forward as highly desirable.    I have excluded CigaretteSmoking and Fluoridation because it seems to me far from clear that we will wish to legislate on these difficult subjects.    Building and Units ofMeasurement should, I think, wait in view of the number of other bills which the Minister of Housing and the Minister of Technology aresponsoring.    Civil Aviation I had originally placed in the reserve list,but in view of the risk that failure to legislate early to change the presentlicensing system might imperil attempts to build up a second force, the ministerial Committee agreed that a Bill limited to this one aspect shouldbe included in the main programme and Gas Industry Reorganisation be moved to the reserve list to make room for it.    I ha\re not includedLicensing (Abolition of State Management in Scotland), because I think itwould be premature to legislate for Scotland until we have settled our policy on the Carlisle State Management District; but the Secretary ofState for Scotland is, I understand, reluctant to accept this.2
8.     Bills in Reserve,    I have placed Commercial Radio here because it is likely to be some time before we have a Bill ready.    Much as wewould like to see the Bill pass into law this Session, it would be a mistake to introduce so controversial a measure late in the Session.9.     Scottish Grand Committee Bills,    I have shown all the Bills proposedby the Secretary of State, leaving htm to decide which can be accommodated within the drafting resources and time on the Floor available to him,10.     Second Reading Committee Bills.    I regard this procedure as a valuable way of handling non-controversial legislation and would like toencourage it.    The list includes a number of Law Commission Bills andothers which have already been drafted.11.    Bills for Private Members.    I have shown here all the Bills which seem suitable for handing to Private Members, but would welcome moresuggestions.12.     I invite the Cabinet to approve the programme which I now putforward.    It would be unwise to add new Bills to it without makingcorresponding deletions.W w privy Council Office, SWl23    July 1970
