THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government 1CP(70) 47 C0F  NO      sJ.*23 September 1970CABINETSCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAMMESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and science the conclusions of our meeting on Monday 14 September(CM(70) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2, Conclusion 3) invited Ministers to circulate memoranda on increases in expenditure an which they had not reached agreement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    The present memorandum explains my proposals for diverting to the school building programme some cf the savings which I am willing to make elsewhere in educational expenditure.SAVINGS IN EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURE2. The Chief Secretary proposed the following savings to me and theSecreffery of State for Scotland g-a. An increase in the school meals charge tc lip in April 1971and, by further stages of lp a year, to I4p in England andWales and I5p in Scotland, accompanied by improved remissionarrangements for poorer families worth one-eighth of theestimated gross savings.b. Withdrawal of free milk (e?scept for some pupils in special schools) frwrn the school year 1971-72.c. Increases in fees for further education courses, beginning inthe academic year 1971-72 (England and Wales only).d. Institution in 1971-72 of a charge for borrowing books from public libraiies.These measures would save, in Great Britain, about  32 million in1971-72, rising to about  60 million in 1974-75 - a total of  190 million in the four year period.1
3.     I have told the Chief Secretary that in general I accept theseproposals as reasonable contributions to achieving our aim of reducedpublic expenditure (though the Paymaster General will be asking theCabinet to consider the question of principle involved in the proposedlibraries charge).    I also wish to retain free milk for pupils of nurseryand infant age.    But I am prepared to forgo the more generous remissionarrangements offered by the Chief Secretary and to increase the school meals charges in two stages only, to 12p in 1971 (I am now satisfied, onthe basis of the latest estimates of costs, that there is no danger of a charge of 12p exceeding the cost of the meal,, even in those areas whereit is lowest) and I4p in 1973,    The net effect of these modifications isto increase the amount saved over the four year period to  200 million - 10 million more than the Chief Secretary proposes.    I understand thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland is in broad agreement with thesemodified proposals.SCHOOL BUILDING NEEDS4,     Our main priority in education, explicitly stated in our Manifesto,is to do more for the primary schools.    The only way in which we as aGovernment can effectively honour this pledge is to increase the school building programme, so that more old and substandard primary schoolscan be rebuilt.    To take only the oldest category, a survey by localauthorities in England and Wales shows that there are 700, 000 primarypupils - one in seven - in pre-1903 schools which must be kept in service.Replacing them all would require a programme of  175 million (in termsof starts).    But as it stands in the official forecasts of expenditure theprogramme for 1972-73 (which has yet to be publicly announced) providesonly  11 million for improvements.    This is below the figure of  17 million for 1971-72 allocated by my predecessor and well below the 30 million a year (at 1964 prices) allocated by Edward Boyle in thesuccessive years 1965-68 without a specific pledge to the primary schools.What makes the comparison even more unfavourable is the overall size ofthe programme - and we shall be judged as much by that as by what weprovide specifically for improvements.    Leaving aside the special, once for all programme for raising the leaving age, the total at present fixed for 1972-73, (roofs over heads and improvements) is  111 snlHaosiacompared with the  147.5 million which my predecessor allocated for1971-72 . a drop of 25 per cent.5.     I want to bring the 1972-73 programme up to the 1971-72 level ofstarts of   147. 5 million by the following means a.     By diverting capital resources from other (e, g, further and higher) educational building programmes; the scope is limitedbut I can raise an extra  8 million of starts for the primary schools in this way.2
b. By using  8 million (equivalent to  7 million of starts), leaving 2 million for Scotland, of the extra  10 million which I am prepared to save by my modification of the Chief Secretary^proposals (paragraph 3 above),c. By drawing the necessary balance of  28 million ( 21.5 millionstarts) from the  190 million savings proposed by the chief secretary.I should then be able, in fulfilment of our Election pledge, to make 47.5 million available for improvements, mainly of primary schools,in the building programme for 1972-73, the first one which I shallannounce,6.     I also wane to keep up the level of starts in^ 1973-74 so that thereis no drop in the school building programme from that provided by our predecessors.     Compared with the level at present fixed this meansfinding an additional  33 million in starts ( 43 million in expenditure).Out of the total starts of   147. 5 million,  44 million would then beavailable for improvements.    My Department is examining how muchother educational building programmes for 1973-74 can contribute.This is a complex matter, with implications for the future level of provision for higher education, and I am not yet in a position to decidejust how much.    But, as in 1972-73, I want to draw on the  190 million of savings for that part of the  43 million which my other programmescannot cover.7.     To sum up, taking the two years 1972-74 together, I seek to divertto school building, from the total of  190 million which the chief secretary proposes should be saved,  71 million (of which  59 million would be spent by 31 March 1975) less whatever I can find from othereducational building programmes starting in 1973-74,    The detailed figures are set out in the Annex.    But beyond the mere figures there arebroader considerations which I must emphasise.    I should not have been willing to make the savings described in this Paper if I had not envisageddiverting some part of them to the school building programme.    If thisproves impossible I must reconsider from the political viewpoint whethereducational expenditure can bear savings totalling  190 million over4 years and it is not simply a question of the total amount of these savings;we must not give the impression that we are attacking educationalexpenditure in a wholly negative way, and one which would be quiteinconsistent with our declared approach and priorities before the election.conclusion.     I invite my colleagues to agrees-a. that the school building programme for England and wales should provide for starts of  147.5 million in 1972-73 and1973-74; and3SSCIIST
b.     that the necessary additional resources should be provided from the savings of  190 million in educational expenditureproposed by the Chief Secretary, to the extent of  28 million for the 1972-73 programme and of  43 million for 1973-74,less what I find I can divert from other educational building programmes for the latter year.M H t department of Education and Science Wl22 September 19704
