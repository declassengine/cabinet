[DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 38 COPY NO r10 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, Before we resume our consideration of public expenditure, Iwould like to remind my colleagues of a number of facts.a.      Repeatedly in Opposition individual Front Bench spokesmenpromised to reduce the burden of taxation.    Our election manifesto, approved by the then Shadow Cabinet, includedthese words:&quot;We will concentrate on malting progressive and substantial(my underlining) reductions in income tax and surtax.    these reductions will be possible because we will cut outunnecessary Government spending and because we will encourage savings ee. We will abolish the selective employment Tax&quot;.In one of last year&apos;s Finance Bill debates, Iain Macleod said this:&quot;The attitude of the Conservative Party towards SET hasalways been clear.    We intend to abolish it as soon as wecan ... nor do we intend to replace it with an employment tax&quot;.That statement received wide publicity.b.      As a measure of our commitments, it is worth bearing inmind that:i. To cut the standard rate of income tax by 6d would cost  350 million; Is off the standard rate would cost nearly 700 million.ii. To abolish SET will cost about  600 million.1
c.      In addition to the above commitments we have given firmundertakings to;i.      Abolish aggregation for minors&apos; income,.ii0     Allow interest again for tax relief,iii.     Tax married women&apos;s earnings separately from theirhusbands1,,The fulfilment of these three undertakings will cost at least 50 million in a full year.d0      Owing to the tight liquidity position of companies, we mustregard most of the savings from the abolition of investment grants,amounting to about  700 million, as being available only for returnto companies in the form of taxation relief, apart perhaps from some part of savings on grants for ships,e. Our predecessors increased public expenditure as a proportion of the Gross National Product from 43 per cent to 51 per cent.    The programmes which they left to us forthe future would have involved a further substantial increasein central government tax rates above their present very high level.    The best estimates which can now be made, based onthe medium-term economic assessment which is carried outby an interdepartmental group of officials, suggest that thiswould have been more than  300 million by 1974,    A corresponding reduction in public expenditure is required merely to prevent arise in present tax rates.    It is only in so far as we achieveeconomies going beyond this point that we shall create room for tax relief,f. Since we took office we have already committed ourselves to new public expenditure amounting in 1971-72 to  30 million ayear,2,        In the light of these facts, what are the means of fulfilling our election pledges ?3,        We could hope that, with better Government, the economy wouldgrow faster and the tax yield would thereby increase at a faster rate thanthe growth of public expenditure, thus giving us some elbow-room for taxcuts.    But this hope rests, in part at least, on our providing incentives towork and save which are themselves largely dependent on lightening theburden of taxation.    It would be an irresponsible gamble to pin our hopeson faster growth as the principal means of cutting taxation.    The only safeapproach is to assume that significant faster growth will follow the cuts in taxation.
4, There is one further point of psychological importance,.    Thestatement on public expenditure which has been promised for this autumnwill be a touchstone of our credibility as a Government, both by the general public and, more particularly in the first instance, by the opinion-formers.Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that there will ever be a moment in the lifetime of this Parliament when we shall be in a stronger position to makethe sort of drastic cuts which are necessary - and which we led the nation to believe would come with the new Government.50        Unless we secure reductions in public expenditure on the scale( 1,700 million including investment grants) agreed by the Cabinet last july (CM(70) 8th Conclusions, Minute 6), for which the Chief secretary has put forward a balanced programme of proposals, we may well find ourselves unable to fulfil our Election pledges.A treasury Chambers SW19 September 1970
