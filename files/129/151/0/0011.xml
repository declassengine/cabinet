OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(70) 36 COPY NO     5429 July 1970CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW 1970:THE OPEN UNIVERSITYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In her memorandum (CP(70) 34) the Secretary of State for Educationargues that the Open University should proceed as planned.    I am unable toagree with this view, for the following reasons:..... i   - ,. :a. We have always made it clear that we had no commitment tocontinue the Open University.    The late Chancellor of the Exchequer,when In Opposition, said so specifically to the British broadcasting corporation when they approached him, and In January 1969Sir Edward Boyle made a statement opposing the decision by theformer Administration to proceed with it at a time when (as now)there were other more Important claims on limited resources.b. It is possible that Indue course, by admission of the under-21sthe Open University will be able to contribute significantly, and atmuch cheaper cost, per graduate, to the problem of accommodatingin higher education the huge increase in numbers of students forecast for the next decade.    But there is no certainty either that, in theevent, the unit costs per successful graudate will be as low asforecast, or that the Open University will in practice provide an acceptable alternative9 for any significant number of students, to more conventional forms of higher education.    It was certainly not designed as such.ic. I have examined the ways in which the Open University mightmove towards greater self-sufficiency, but I see little prospect of this the proposed scale of fees already represents an unusually highpercentage of costs: but even a doubling of fees would yield only about   million, taking account of the extra public expenditure which thiswould Impose on local authorities.    And I see little prospect of substantial sales of material abroad or to other institutions.1
d.        I have also considered what would be the effect of a sharply-reduced level of student intake.    As will be seen from the agreedfigures in the annex to the Secretary of State,s memorandum, areduction from 25,000 to 15, 000 would yield savings rising to only about  if million by 1973-74.2.        As my colleagues know, our goal of drastic reduction In public expenditure and of alleviation of taxation can only be achieved If werigorously pursue every significant saving available to us.    In thesecircumstances I cannot agree that we should Ignoro a project which we didnot initiate, have never commended, and have never accepted as a commitment? which is completely experimental and uncertain in its effects; and which, at best, can only be of marginal use in the solution ofthe urgent resource problems which face us in conventional education.3.        I recognise the difficulties, and I agree that it is not worthencountering them for the sake of  1 or  2 million of marginal savingsthrough reduced intake.    I do consider, however, that it Is worth facingthem, despite some nugatory expenditure of about  8 million^ for the sake of direct continuing savings which will rise to over  10 million a year in five years&apos; time.    I also recognise the difficulty that closure would have tobe announced very soon, and in Isolation from the general pattern of theother measures which we are examining.    But this, in my view, only make sit the more important that the action we announce should be bold enough toshow that we mean business.    A forthright statement now cancelling the project will no doubt provoke protest and opposition.      But It will be taken as a real earnest of our intention to cut and re-fashion public expenditure inaccordance with the social, and wider educational, priorities set out in ourManifesto and to secure the reductions in taxation on which our wholeeconomic programme rests.M V treasury Chambers SW129 July 1970
