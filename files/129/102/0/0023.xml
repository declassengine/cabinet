The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No,C.(6o) 1 231 3th September9 I960CABINETFACILITIES FOR UNITED STATES SUBMARINES IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of DefenceWhen the Cabinet last discussed this matter(C.C*(6o) 1+8th Conclusions) they agreed in principle:-&quot;that facilities in the Clyde area should &quot;be madeavailable for United States POLARIS submarines, on theunderstanding that satisfactory arrangements were made asregards the extent of United Kingdom control over their operations, and that an attempt should be made to obtainaccess to plans and technical information which wouldmake it possible for the United Kingdom to obtainPOLARIS submarines&quot;.Trie facilities in question would consist of a depot ship(where the missiles would be stored), a floating dock and ancillary vessels;   when the squadron had built up to full strength (nine submarines) there would probably be three submarines in the Clyde area at any one time.      Negotiationswith, the United States Government have now reached the state at which a definitive agreement is in sight and it is possibleto consider the terms of a memorandum of understanding and apublic announcement.Location2, Formal United States agreement is awaited to the useof Holy Loch following a discreet reconnaissance by a team ofUnited States Naval officers who expressed themselves as wellsatisfied with this site.Consultation and Control3. The circumstances are not quite the same forsubmarines refuelling from time to time in United Kingdomwaters and for United States Air Force units based on UnitedKingdom airfields.     We cannot therefore expect to have thesame degree of control over all the operations of the UnitedStates submarines as we have over United States aircraft.,However after lengthy discussion with the United States G-overn-ment we are within sight of an understanding which will, weconsider, be satisfactory from the point of view of publicopinion in this country.k* It has been agreed, and can be publicly announced,that the deployment and use in periods of emergency of thesubmarine depot ship and associated facilities should be amatter for joint consultation:    this is based on the under-standing that either side should be permitted to have the
tender removed from territorial waters if either the americans or ourselves judged there was an emergency.     an agreed formula is incorporated in the attached draft announcement.5. It has also been agreed, and can be publicly announced, that launching of POLARIS missiles in UnitedKingdom territorial waters should be &quot;a matter for jointdecision&quot;.     An agreed formula is incorporated in theattached draft announcement,6. The United States Government have offered thefollowing private assurance on control outside territorial waters:-&quot;With reference to the launching of missiles from united States POLARIS submarines outside United Kingdomterritorial waters, the United States reaffirms the assurance given by President Eisenhower to ForeignMinister Eden on 9th March, 1953, that in the event ofan emergency^ such as increased tension or the threat of war, the United States will take every possible stepto consult with Britain and other allies&quot;.A formula for use in public is still under consideration.We have proposed the following to the United States government as a statement which could come from their side.     We consider this is the best we are likely to get out of them for publicuse: -&quot;The launching of missiles by United Statessubmarines outside United Kingdom territorial watersis in the same category as the use of nuclear weaponsgenerally.     There can be no certainty that consultationwould always be possible in an emergency but the UnitedStates Government will use their best endeavours to consult with their British and other allies as regardsthe use of POLARIS missiles as well as about the use of nuclear weapons generally&quot;.United Kingdom POLARIS Submarines7. The United States authorities have not been preparedto offer us a simple option to buy POLARIS submarines as aquid pro quo for facilities we were providing in Holy Loch;they have insisted that any reference to such submarines shouldbe linked with the general requirements of the North atlantic alliance and are not prepared at the moment to negotiate a purely bilateral arrangement for supplying us with polaris submarines.     The result of this would necessarily be to associate our own requirements with the Medium Range BallisticMissile scheme of the North Atlantic Alliance and it would therefore be unacceptable to us.     Publicly, we think it better to say nothing, especially since there is little prospect on financial grounds of our being able to include the purchase ofPOLARIS submarines in the defence budget for a number of years.Since the links between the United States Navy and the royal navy on these matters are very close, we are confident that wecan rely on consultation and contact through Service channelsas at present to provide the necessary technical collaboration.A special visit is being arranged to enable the Royal Navy to study the operational and logistic aspects of the United StatesFleet ballistic missile programme at the invitation of the-2-
Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, Admiral Dennison. TheFirst Sea Lord will also aim to take these matters furtherduring his visit later in the year.Financial Arrangements8, These will be the subject of detailed discussionwith other Departments concerned and with the United states authorities.     In negotiation the United States Governmentwill no doubt seek financial concessions, and may citeprecedents drawn from other agreements covering shared strategicundertakings.     But in principle we should, at any rate as an opening gambit, seek full repayment for all facilities providedby the Admiralty and of any other expenditure that may be incurred in fulfilment of the American project.     For example:-(a) for facilities provided from naval sources theAdmiralty would recover full costs, as for services rendered to any other foreign government, includingappropriate departmental expenses:    this would cover for example the provision and laying of moorings,the supply of stores, any emergency repairs InRoyal Dockyards, all works services etc.;(b) any accommodation required to be retained by theAdmiralty on behalf of and before use by the UnitedStates Navy would be maintained at United states navy cost;(c) if any works services undertaken for the United states navy were cancelled before construction had commenced,the design costs and other preliminary disbursementswould be met by the United States Navy,9, The United States are not likely to need much land;it would be reasonable to offer them at the outset one exception to the re-payment principle in respect of the purchase of any land they may require.     This would accord with the North.Atlantic Alliance Infrastructure practice.Administrative Arrangements10. Timing.     The United States target date for establishing their depot ship in Holy Loch is now February1 961 ,     The floating dock would not come across until the summer of 1 961.     There is, therefore, time for the necessarypreparatory work and local consultation provided that a reasonably early public announcement makes it possible to liftthe present strict security rules.      Such preparatory measures as can be put in hand unobtrusively, including the laying ofmoorings in Holy Loch, are being taken.11 , Safety Organisation on the Clyde.     The Admiraltyintend to provide the necessary monitoring facilities andsuitably qualified staff and to establish an emergency organi-sation which would come into operation in the very unlikely event of an accident:    it is planned that executive control ofthis reorganisation should be vested in the Royal Navy.      Itis also planned to set up a local liaison committee following the pattern of those established at the Atomic energy authority&apos;s nuclear stations.     This committee would include representatives of the local authorities and civil emergency-3-
services.     It would play an important part in educatinglocal public opinion, and in preparing plans for dealingwith the hazards associated with trie project.     The questionof indemnifying Her Majesty&apos;s Government against nuclearrisks will have to be discussed with the United states authorities.120 Public Announcement.     It is proposed that astatement should be made in Parliament on either Tuesday orWednesday, 25th or 26th October, and that a similarannouncement should be made in Washington by the UnitedStates authorities at the same time.13. Conclusions and Recommendations.     We invite our colleagues to endorse(a) the terms on which it is proposed to provide facilities in the Clyde;(b) the lines of the proposed draft United Kingdomstatement, for final clearance with the UnitedStates authorities;(c) the proposed financial arrangements.H.H.W.13th September, i960.
annex draft ANNOUNCEMENTThe United States Navy have recently carried out anumber of successful underwater test firings of the POLARISmissile.     The first missile firing submarine, the GEORGEWASHINGTON, will become operational before long.      It willbe quickly followed by other vessels now nearing completion.A new and flexible element will thereby be added to the strategic nuclear deterrent.2. Clearly there would be operational advantage ifsheltered anchorage on this side of the Atlantic could beprovided for a submarine depot ship and floating dock, andthis Her Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to provide.These facilities would be used by United States submarineson routine patrol in peacetime.     The anchorage will beprovided in the Holy Loch in the Clyde and the depot shipshould be established there during February of next year,with the floating dock to follow a little later.      Supportingfacilities will be provided by the Royal Navy.3. Measures will be co-ordinated by the United states naval authorities in London and the Admiralty to govern theoperation of United States submarines in peacetime so as toprevent mutual interference between United Kingdom and UnitedStates submarines and anti-submarine forces in such matters as sanctuary, routeing, arrival and departure notices.1+. The deployment and use in periods of emergency ofthe submarine depot ship and associated facilities in theUnited Kingdom would be a matter for joint consultation,5. The launching of POLARIS missiles at any time from united States submarines in United Kingdom territorial waterswould be a matter of joint decision between the two Governments.(Formula on control outside territorial waters to be inserted.)6. Under normal operating conditions no risk to health or safety will arise from the presence of these submarines, orof their weapons.     Local arrangements will include the setting up of a Liaison Committee which will ensure thefullest possible consultation with the local authorities and interests concerned.7. Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcome this agreement asan admirable example of co-operation between allies.      Itowes much to the close and friendly relationship which exists between the two Navies.13th September, 1 96O0-5-
