(60) 129 COPY NO.19th July, I960CABINETBLUE STREAK:   SPACE RESEARCHNote by the Deputy Secretary of the CabinetFollowing the Cabinefs decision to abandon BLUE STREAK as a weapon (C.C.(60) 26th Conclusions, Minute 1), officials were instructedto examine further the implications of developing BLUE STREAK as asatellite launcher for space research.The attached report by representatives of the Departmentsconcerned is circulated for consideration by the Cabinet on Thursday,21st July, I960.(Signed) F. A. BISHOPCabinet Office, 3.W.I.19th July, I960.
SECRETSPACE RESEARCH:BLUE STREAKReport by officials.introduction.     On 13-th. April, 1960, the Cabinet endorsed the decision ofthe Defence Committee that the development of BLUE STREAK asa static medium range ballistic missile system should be abandoned.     This decision was announced to Parliament on13th April last, and it was stated that the Government would consider with the firms and other interests concerned, as amatter of urgency, whether the BLUE STREAK programme could be adapted for the development of a launcher for space satellites;a further statement to Parliament was promised as soon aspossible.     Officials of the Departments concerned have nowexamined the advantages and disadvantages of undertaking thedevelopment of a satellite launcher.     The following report is a development of their preliminary report on this question(D. (60)  17) y which was considered by the Defence Commit*w whenthe decision to abandon BLUE STREAK as a weapon was   reached,2.      The desirability of adapting BLUE STREAK as a satellitelauncher cannot be considered without some general view of the potentialities of space research.      The report which followstherefore deals with this subject before going on to considerways in which a British space research programme might beundertaken;    the position of Australia;    the prospects ofinternational co-operation in space research;    and whether we should develop our own launcher.     The possible courses open to Ministers are set out in Section VIII.3.     The full potentialities of space research can by no meanshe foreseen at the present time, although a few specificapplications are already evident.     There is little doubtthat space research is opening a new field of human endeavour,which may have significant commercial, military, scientific and technological i:.iplieations.Scientific researchh.     The United Kingdom space research programme is at presentconfined to the instrumenting of three small satellites (ofabout 150 Ids. weight) to he launched in the United Statesover the next year or two by the small United States SCOUTrocket under the arrangements made last year.      The british national Committee on Space Research (the Royal SocietyCommittee under Sir Harrie Massey) and the official space research Steering Group (under Sir Edward Bullard) have considered the possible scientific content of a space programmeusing large satellites of the size which could he launched byBLUE STREAK/BLACK KNIGHT.      These Committees are satisfied thatthis would enable the United Kingdom to mount a much larger, andscientifically more significant, programme of scientific workthan the modest beginning which is already possible throughthe use of SCOUT.II.POTENTIALITIES OF SPACE RESEARCH-1-SECRET
5.      Our space scientists think that satellites which couldbe launched by BLUE STREAK could provide them with a most valuable programme of research work extending over many years.They stress that such a programme could be usefully undertakenwhatever the Americans and the Russians may carry out.Experience in scientific research shows that the results ofa programme are not normally limited to what can be foreseenat its start.     The space scientists consider that thiscountry should not deny itself the opportunity of enteringthis new field, which could provide potentially valuablegrowing points for the physical and engineering sciences,replacing those provided in the past by developments in radarand nuclear energy,6,     For scientific experiments, involving two or threelaunchings a year, the cost of designing and developinginstruments alone is estimated to be of the order of       million a year.     The consensus of opinion among the space scientistsis that such a programme would of itself justify expenditureof say  5 millions a year (including the  f million), as partof a development programme for launchers and satellites.7.      The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy have recentlyreaffirmed their previous advioe, incorporated in theirreport for 1958-59, i.e. that a programme of scientific research in space using satellites on a purely national basis,would not in itself justify the very large expenditure necessaryfor a full-scale progratrcrie, including the development of launching vehicles.Tele c ommuni cations8.     Earth satellites may well play an important part inthe future development for both civil and military purposes ofreliable world wide communications and navigation services.The congestion of the  short-wave (H.F.) radio frequency bandis now so great that further appreciable expansion of long-distance communication by this means is impracticable.Submarine cables, while providing high-quality communications,have limited capacity and are susceptible to accidental ordeliberate interruption.      International telecommunicationtraffic is expanding very rapidly and satellite communicationsystems, because of their high potential capacity and greatflexibility, could provide a valuable additional means for meeting these increasing requirements.     Furthermore such systemscan be designed to &quot;be less susceptible to accidental ordeliberate interruption.      Satellite communication systemsoffer the most promising means yet available for the worldwiderelaying of television.9.     The commercial prospects of a satellite communicationssystem, which is the criterion by which a civil communicationsoperator would assess expenditure for this purpose, are difficult to estimate at this stage.     Until a pilot scheme has established practicability and the lives of satellites have been determined, the costs of providing and operating a satellite communications system are not known.      in these circumstances,although the Post Office could not make a financial contributionto the development of a satellite launcher, it is prepared -and has indeed started - to devote development effort and funds to the ground radio communication equipment and. the largesteerable aerials needed for a pilot satellite communicationssystem, and to the radio equipment needed in a satellite,within a total expenditure of  3-35 -million over a five-year period.
Meteorology10,    Earth satellites could he used to improve.meteorologicalobservation, and might increase the accuracy of local short-range weather forecasting and enable long range weather fore-casting to be undertaken.    The improvement of short-rangeforecasting would be of greater value to the remoter areasof the world than to the United Kingdom, where highly developed sources of information are already available.Long-range weather forecasting might prove to be of economic value,M i111 ary anplicat!ens11.    Telecommunications road meteorological satellites may prove to be of considerable military importance.      The formermight provide a reliable strategic communications system,which would be a necessity in the event of global war, whilethe latter might produce weather information in the situationwhen more conventional meteorological data are denied usduring periods of extreme tension or after the outbreak ofwar.      In addition there are further possible satelliteapplications of purely military interest;    these includephotographic and electronic reconnaissance vehic3.es forintelligence gathering and as ballistic missile early warning systems as a guard against surprise attack.      TheMinister of Defence has stated that if a space programmebased on BLUE STREAK was such that it was likely to produceworthwhile results, the military interest would justifycontributing defence money up to  5 millions a year.     no provision has been made for this in the latest forwarddefence costings.Technology12,   Technological benefits may derive as a by-product ofthe development of a satellite launcher, satellites andtheir instruments, since they present problems the solutionof which will demand considerable ingenuity from scientists and engineers.     New ideas thus stimulated may have relevanceoutside the limits of space research.      In the United States,for example, satellite work (admittedly on a much larger scale than the United Kingdom could contemplate) has alreadystimulated technological advances in other spheres.
III.    A BRITISH SPACE RESEARCH PROGRAMMEAlternative courses13.   A British space research programme could he undertaken in the following ways -(a) by adapting BLUE STREAK as a satellite launcher and developing the necessary satellites;(b) by obtaining American launchers and firing them atWoomera with British satellites;(c) by relying on American launchers and launchingfacilities to carry British satellites or instruments.Development of BLUB STREAK and British Satellites1h.    If BLUE STREAK were adapted as a satellite launcher,Australian participation would be essential, as indicated inSection IV below.     A three-stage rocket would be needed to launch satellites of types which v/ould be adequate to explore the potentialities mentioned in Section II.     The first stage would be an adaptation of BLUE STREAK stripped of its militarycharacteristics.      It would be based on the five years research and development already done, and would make use of the experimental and testing facilities already in existence inthis country and in Australia.     Static testing would takeplace at Spadeadam in Cumberland, and firing would be froniWoomera.      The necessary facilities are already largelyavailable.15.    The second stage of the rocket would be &quot;based on the research vehicle BLACK KNIGHT, &quot;which has four years of develop-ment behind it, has been proved by a number of successfulfirings at Woomera, and for which there will be continuingprogramme apart from satellite launching.      The adaptationBLACK KNIGHT would make use of existing facilities in theUnited Kingdom and Australia.16.    The development of the third stage would draw on theexperience gained with BLACK KNIGHT, and v/ould use a motoralready in existence in experimental form.      It v/ould be designed to fit on the modified BLACK KNIGHT and to carrydiffextent satellites,17.   A satellite launcher of this nature would be capable offurther development, e.g, by improved second and third stages.18.    Satellite development would begin with relatively simplebut scientifically useful vehicles, and would move on to themore sophisticated satellite with a stabilised platform, whichwould be needed for astronomical research and military andother developments which might then appear desirable.    examples of the types of satellite which could be launched fromI96I+/65 by the vehicle based on BLUE STREAK are -(a) a stabilised satellite of 1,500 - 2,000 lbs. in anear circular orbit at 300 miles altitude;(b) an unstabilised satellite of 300 - 500 lbs.  in aneccentric orbit with apogee 8,000 - 12,000 miles;(c) an unstabilised satellite of 50 - 100 lbs. in a highly eccentric orbit with apogee of about 100,000miles.-k-
19*    The Americans have so far launched a number ofunstabilised satellites of about 50 lbs. to distances of1,000 - 2,000 miles apogee;    a series of 300 lbs. satellitesto about 500 miles, with crude stabilisation which has workedonly to a very limited extent;    and several space probes ofahout 100 lbs.  to moon distance and beyond with no stabilisation-tion.     The future American programme is not known with any certainty, hut in addition to a large   number of smallscientific satellites it is expected to include unstabilisedpayloads^of 6,000 - 8,000 lbs. to 300 - 500 mile orbits byabout 1963/65.      In their military communications satelliteprogramme the United States hope to fire satellites of about500 lbs. into near earth orbits in the next two to three shears,with a rough stabilisation system relative to earth axis.Later stages of the communications satellite programme involvea pay load of about 2,000 lbs. launched to a stationary/ orbit(relative to earth rotation) at 20,000 miles.      The NationalAeronautics and. Space Administration programme includes by19S3/65 a precision stabilised satellite, comparable with thatdescribed at paragraph 18(a) for astronomical purposes.Nothing is known of future Prussian plans: present Prussiancapabilities include the launching of about 8,000 lbs. into anear earth orbit, but only crude stabilisation has so far been attempted.      In their launcher developments both Russia and america   seem to be strongly orientated towards mannedsatellites, which require much larger payloads than are needed for the range of useful scientific and technical experimentswhich could&quot;&quot;be undertaken by satellites of the types described in paragraph 18.20.    The tentative programme of launcher and satellitedevelopment proposed in D.(60) 17 has now been careftillyexamined with the firms and the Ministry of Aviation Establish-ments concerned.     These consultations have confirmed that a programme of launcher and satellite development could be spreadover a period of four j^ears from now as a technically viableand economic programme which would keep the development teamsin being.      This programme would provide for the firing of eight development rounds, which should permit development of alauncher capable in 196k of putting into orbit satellites of upto 2,000 lbs.     This firing programme Is reasonable in relationto the probable rate of development of satellites.21.   The likely cost of such a programme has been discussed with the firms concerned and with the Ministry of Aviationstaff in Australia.     For prudence in costing, the programme is assumed to spread over five years insread of four as envisaged above, and a 50 per cent contingency allowance hasbeen added.    The whole of the cost incurred in Australia hasbeen included, and so has expenditure on BLACK KNIGHT apartfrom that on the continuing programme which will be needed-5-
whether or not BLUE STREAK is further developed.      On this basis the estimated cost over five years from July, 1960,would be about  52 millions for the development of a satellitelauncher.     A satellite development programme would cost about 12 millions more over the same period, making a total of 6ii millions new expenditure.*22.    It is impossible at present to estimate the scale of the space research programme, or further development work, whichmight follow the initial development over the next four or fiveyears of a satellite launcher based on BLUE STREAK and of the associated satellites.     This will depend on the potentialitieswhich emerge from the initial development programme.     any estimate must be very uncertain, hut annual expenditure mightrange from about  15 millions for five firings a year up to about 25 millions for ten firings a year.Acquisition of. United States launchers for use at Woomera23.    The United States will continue to produce a variety ofsatellite launchers, though our choice might lie between some-thing slightly smaller or considerably larger than BLUE STREAK.This need not be an overriding disadvantage, since our space research programme and the satellites required for it have notyet been determined, and could no doubt be related to theavailable American launchers.     Estimates of cost of Americanlaunchers are conflicting, and reliable estimates could only bemade after official consultation with the American authorities.However, it is not unreasonable to expect the cost of an Americanvehicle broadly comparable in size with BLUE STREAK, and incurrent production for United States purposes,  to be similar tothat of a BLUE STREAK launcher.     A larger vehicle would be correspondingly more expensive.      Besides the basic cost of a united States launcher, fairly considerable expenditure wouldbe needed for the provision of ancillary facilities and any necessary modifications.     The use of American launchers would avoid the bulk of the immediate research and development expenditure to which we should be committed if we developedBLUE STREAK.      In the longer term it is more difficult tomake a comparison of costs, since this would depend largely on the extent of our requirements.      There can of course be no certainty that we should not meet difficulties in obtainingAmerican launchers for a space research programme, e.g. overtiming or the continued availability of a particular type ofUnited States vehicle, or because of American misgivings basedon commercial or wider political grounds.     But in principlethere is no reason to suppose that these difficulties need be insuperable.The cost of winding up the BLUE STREAK weapon programme hasbeen reassessed, and is now estimated at about  20 millions,most of which will fall in 1960/618     Thus, if BLUE STREAKis developed as a satellite launcher, expenditure in 1960/61,including military cancellation charges, would amount toabout  2^ millions.     In addition,  2 millions would be spenton the continuing programme for BLACK KNIGHT, which was originally included in the military BLUE STREAK programme.The estimated cost of the original military programme in thecurrent financial year was  1+1 millions     The general aim,when BLUE STREAK was abandoned as a weapon, was that expenditure in 1960/61, including military cancellationcharges, should not exceed  2q. millions.     The estimatedcost after 1960/61 would be about  15 millions a year for four years.     This compares with the general aim thatannual expenditure after 1960/61 should not exceed  10 million:--The figures are set out in more detail at the Appendix.
2U.    If American rockets were to be bought, the type would haveto be decided and contracts placed well in advance, in orderto permit planning of the satellite and of launching facilities at Woomera to proceed.     There would be complex technical problems in ensuring the compatibility of a satellite   andlauncher, if each were developed under separate control.British teams would need to go to the United States for considerable periods to acquire the necessary knowledge of the design of the vehicles, constructional details and firingtechniques.     As regards Woomera, some of the facilitiesalready available there could be employed, but some newfacilities would also be needed.     Range operating costs wouldvary with the type of vehicle v.sed,  the larger rockets beingthe more expensive to launch.Use of United States launchers and facilities in the UnitedStates25.    It might he possible to use American vehicles launched in the United States to carry either British instruments or british satellites.     The terms on which we could use Americanlaunchers and launching facilities would be a matter for negotiation with the United States authorities.26.   We are already developing instruments for- flight in american satellites, and the current arrangements with theUnited States might be extended.      If the Americans were willing to make laiinching facilities and satellites availablemore or less free of charge, a modest programme of experimentscould probably be undertaken at a relatively small cost.However, the technical problems arising from the dividedcontrol of the instrument and satellite development ^ouldbecome progressively more complicated if more advancedexperiments were undertaken.     Any attempt to develop aBritish satellite for firing from American launchers in theUnited States would present acute organisational and engineerindifficulties, and this would increase the cost of satellitedevelopment.-7-SECRET
IV.    AUSTRALIA27.    13? BLUE STREAK is to Toe developed as a satellitelauncher, Australian participation is essential, if only becauseof the facilities at Woomera provided by the existing jointproject there.      The attitude of the Australian Government to participation in a space research programme with the UnitedKingdom is not known, since they appear to be awaitingproposals from this country &quot;before considering the problem.Their main concern is that Woomera should be usefullyemployed,  and they are unlikely to resist any reasonableproposals for a joint programme of space research with theUnited Kingdom.      They woiild probably regard a programmebased on American launchers as less preferable than thedevelopment of a British vehicle.     They woiild be especiallycritical if the United Kingdom abandoned BLUE STREAK andparticipated in a European project of co-operation in space research, using the French Sahara range and not Woomera.28.    If the Australians participated in a joint programme of space research,  they would probably wish to be full partnerswith this country, and to be more closely associated with thewhole undertaking than is the case with the current UnitedKingdom weapons projects at Woomera.     A separate agreement might have to be negotiated with the Australians for a jointprogramme of space research,  and they might call for a revisionof the agreement governing the present joint project.      Thecost-sharing arrangements would be a matter for negotiation,and no estimate can be made at the present time of the likelyAustralian contribution.29.    Whatever is to be the future of BLUE STREAK, early-consultation with the Australians is essential for politicaland practical reasons,  and should be undertaken before any final decision is reached or announced.      The Prime minister has in any event promised Mr. Menaies that a team from theUnited Kingdom would visit Australia to discuss the future arrangements at Woomera.V.    EUROPEAN C Q-OPEE AT 103\T30.    There is a growing interest in space research in western europe.     Most countries have set up national committees of scientists (similar to the British National Committee on space research).      The scientists have had a series of Europeanmeetings,  and a study group representing ten countries hasbeen set up in order to prepare an agreement for an Inter-Governmental Preparatory Commission.      The objective is to constitute this Commission early next year, and then toproceed to work out a detailed scheme for a Europeanorganisation.      The executive committee of this Group is preside over by Sir Harrie Masseyj    the secretary and the administrativefacilities are French.31.    It is too early to predict the outcome.      It is not yetclear how far most of the European Governments and interested:whether the organisation (if any) will be confined to purescientific research or whether it will deal with applications,such as communications;   whether it will be confined toinstrumentation and satellite development, or whether it willacquire or even develop launching vehicles andfaciltiest, orwhether Governments will conduct independent space researchprogrammes in addition to the European programme.     Thesematters will not be sorted out for some time.      However, theFrench Government is much interested, no doubt at least partly-8-
secl&apos;-:-:;:&apos;189because the large rocket techniques involved are relevant to the delivery of nuclear weapons as well as to other purposes.      Pending Ministers&apos; consideration of the problem,an interim reply has been sent to an aide-memoire in which theFrench Government have suggested that technical and financialinformation about BLUE STREAK should, be provided to enablethem to study the possibility of collaboration in its use in ascheme of European co-operation in space research.       Theinterests of the smaller countries appear to be predominantlyscientific and related mainly to satellites rather than torocket launchers.     Under the terms of the Brussels Treaty theFederal German Republic is debarred from the manufacture ofmissiles in its territory, but could be associated in otherways with a co-operative space project.32.    When Ministers first considered the impact of possibleEuropean co-operation on their decision about the continueddevelopment of BLUE STREAK as a satellite launcher, it was thought that this might provide a valuable opportunity forco-operation with wider political benefits;    and that in aco-operative venture the Europeans might be prepared to payable substantial part of the cost of developing the launcher.The scope for such a venture is limited by the following factors -(a) if we continue BLUE STREAK, it will have to become a united Kingdom/Australian joint project (seeparagraph 27)s    the Europeans would have to acceptAustralia as a partner;(b) as a practical matter,  the present development plan for BLUE STREAK and BLACK KNIGHT as the first and second stages of the satellite launcher would haveto continue unchanged.      There could be some scope for European countries in developing the third stage, but this is not a significant part of thework;(c) again as a practical matter, launchings would -initially at least - have to be at Woomera;(d) it would be necessary to get United States agreement to the use of BLUE STREAK for the United Kingdom&apos;civil purposes;    and all the more so to discloseits design etc., to Europeans.     There are importantUnited States defence and political interests involved.33*   There are various possible kinds of co-operative venturebased on BLUE STREAK,.      They range between the followingextremes -(a)   to participate in a European scientific organisation for space research (like CERN for nuclear research).This would be predominantly concerned withinstrumentation and satellite development and withthe organisation of experiments;    as well as being amember the United Kingdom would, offer theorganisation BLUE STREAK launching vehicles andlaunching facilities at Woomera on suitable terms.We would presumably also maintain an entirelyindependent national effort (notably for defence and communications purposes), and so probably would the French;
(b)    to pool our effort with the Australians and theFrench and perhaps certain other European countries.A joint organisation of Governmental representatives would be set up to control the development of thelauncher (within the limitations described at paragraph 32(b)) and the operation of the launchingfacilities.      The agreement setting up this jointinstitution would specify the way in which thedecisions would be taken for the management and direction of the common programme, and the extentto which the members might retain facilities for independent launching and space research programmes,or offer facilities to other countries e.g. a consortium of European countries or the Commonwealth.In a venture of this kind the French might wellseek an equal share of control with the UnitedKingdom,  and the financial arrangements could,provide substantial receipts from the French andother partners.34.    It wouldbe impracticable to examine all the inter-mediate courses, but a few general considerations can be setout.      Broadly speaking, the nearer we are to the first extreme(paragraph 33(a)), the more independence we retain in theconduct of our space research programme (not only secrecyfor defence and cbmmunications satellites, but also freedomof management and operation);   but the less likely we are toget any significant European contribution to the cost oideveloping the launchers.      The less design information wegive to the Europeans, the easier it should be to get UnitedStates clearance for the use of BLUE STREAK for civil purposes;   but on the other hand the more we keep BLUE STREAKapart, the greater the danger that the Europeans will base their space research on American launchers (provided cheaplyor possibly free) or ultimately even on French launchers(the French could probably launch very small satellites bythe mid-1 Q^Cs, but would s till be  very far from launchinganything approaching the satellites that could be launchedat that time by BLUE STREAK).35.    The nearer we are to the second extreme(paragraph 33(b)) the better are the chances of spreading the cost, of increasing the resources devoted, by the partnercountries as a whole, and of achieving worth-while results from a co-ordinated enterprise;    but the less would be our chances of getting differential advantages in comparisonwith our partners (i.e. particularly the French) ir. defence,communications, pure science, etc.,    because our resources would be largely devoted to the co-operative venture, andour partners would have to be granted as much freedom as ourselves in doing independent development work.     these considerations have considerable relevance to a later stageif larger satellites were needed than couldbe launchedby BLUE STREAK.-1 0-
36.    The second extreme might have attractions . for the French:they might see it as promising closer Anglo-French activity inthe nuclear field, and in aviation and weapons generally.However, they would he anxious to retain their freedom to conduct independent operations.    If this were to he on thebasis of knowhpw acquired from BLUE STREAK it would pose a difficult problem vis-a-vis the Americans.     We might get asubstantial financial contribution, either as purchasing ashare in the common enterprise or as payment for specificinformation and technique.     The French would be likely to press for some, launchings at the French Sahara range, at least as asupplement to Woomera;    our association with the French inthis would not be welcome to the Africans.37.    If BLUE STREAK is abandoned,  the United Kingdom (withoutAustralia) could still participate in a European co-operativescheme, based (at least in the relatively short run) uponAmerican launchers - although ultimately the use of Frenchlaunchers (or indeed a return to British launchers) might come under consideration.      In either case the French would insist on using the Sahara range and not Woomera.33,    The international political implications of the variouscourses cannot be easily assessed.     If we and the Australiansalone were to develop BLUE STREAK as a satellite launcher, wecould offer facilities for space research to European countries.If this were accepted, v/e might gain some general advantage,but it would not be of any great political significance inrelation to our European policjr as a whole.      Bug there could be considerable political advantage in the offer to european countries (particularly France) of a share in the control of blue STREAK as the starting point for large-scale collaboration in space research.     Our attainment of this advantage would depend on the goodwill of the Americans and on their refraining from offering more attractive alternatives to our potentialpartners.VI.    C0MMOITWEALTH CO-OPSRAT ION39.   &apos; No formal discussions have taken place with commonwealth countries about the possibility of co-operating with them ina space research programme.     Sir Harrie Massey has recentlyvisited Australia and other Commonwealth countries, and hasdiscussed space research with scientists and others.     he believes that the Australians would welcome a proposal for a commonwealth project based on BLUE STREAK.     He also seesprospects of general co-operation in space research with India,Canada and Hew Zealand.     Canadian Interest in some form of commonwealth co-operation in space research was confirmed ininformal discussions with the Minister of Defence during his recent visit to Ottawa.      A satellite communication system is likely to be of considerable intorcst to the Commonwealth..I4.O.    Commonwealth countries (apart from Australia) wouldprobably not wish to play an important part in the developmentof a launcher and satellites.     They are unlikely to wish todo more than make some scientists available.     commonwealth countries, other than Australia, would probably not be acceptable as equal partners in a co-operative launcher projectWith European countries.     Even for satellites or instrumenta-tion alone (in which most of them would be more interested)a separate scheme might need to be devised for the commonwealth countries concerned,-11-
U1.    If we decided to cancel BLUE STREAK and purchase UnitedStates rockets to launch at Woomera, this might give us  some basis for a co-operative scheme v/ith Commonwealth (though notwith European) countries.V^1 *    IS A BRITISH LAUNCHER KEEP ED ?h2.    At present we have a programme for instrumentation,costing about       million a year under which facilities aremade available to us by the United States authorities as partof a general offer including the use of small satellites andthe American SCOUT rocket.     A more comprehensive programme, but still on   a relatively modest scale and directed primarilytowards instrumentation, could be undertaken through the useof other American launching facilities.     We could not hope to have full control over the timing, the extent or perhap seven the nature of the space research programme which could beundertaken in this way;    and we should have to share the resultswith the Americans.b,3.    However, if we are to play a more substantial part inspace research then the alternative ways of obtaining launchersare either to develop BLUE STREAK or to acquire Americanvehicles for firing from Woomera.      If the possibility ofplaying a more substantial part is not to be ruled out, theimmediate problem is whether to continue the development of blue STREAK, or to abandon it and explore the prospects ofobtaining suitable American launchers.     There would be certainpractical disadvantages,  if we were to rely on Americanlaunchers.     We should be less certain of getting suitablerockets just at the right time, and it would be a much racro complexmatter to make sure in advance that the rocket, the satellite,the instruments and the launching facilities were properlyco-ordinated.     In the following paragraphs the choice &quot;between british and American launchers is examined in the light of the potentialities of space research described in Section II above and other relevant factors.Scientific researchUU,    The space scientists consider that a British launcher Y/ouldpermit a much larger and scientifically more significantprogramme of experiments than is possible under present arrangements using SCOUT, and that the facilities available through the use of BLUE STREAK could be fully employed forsystematic observations over many years.      The prirnarjr interestof the space scientists is in work with satellites andinstruments in space, rather than in the launchers that put them into orbit.      They would prefer launchers entirely under united Kingdom control, as this greatljr facilitates the design of satellites and instruments.     However, if we could obtainsuitable launchers from America for firing at Woomera, an experimental programme could probably be undertaken comparable with that which would be possible by the development of blue STREAK.-12-8BCRET
Telecommraaications and meteorologyh5.    The Post Office consider that satellite communications are destined to play a very important; role in the futured development of reliable worldwide point-to-point and mobilecoinmunicatioiis, and that it could be unwise for the UnitedKingdom tc allow herself to become dependent on other countries for such important services.   Although it seems unlikely thatthe Americans would impose unfair conditions on our use of anylaunchers which they supplied, it is not impossible that theywould pay some regard to their own interests, particularly ifcommercial applications emerged.    Wo such doubts would arise if we were to develop BLUE STREAK.h6*    Similar considerations might arise in connection withmeteorological research, though to a lesser degree.Military ap-plicat ionsh7a    If BLUE STREAK were developed as a satellite launcher, thiscountry would retain current first-hand experience of the design and construction of large rockets, and would be free to develop them for military purposes.    Also it is only &quot;bythis means that we could have complete control over any defenceapplications of space research,  such as communications,,    how important this may be depends upon a judgment about the futureof the Anglo-American alliance.    The cancellation of blue streak might seriously prejudice, if not destroy, our technicalability td make a timely re-entry into large rocket development work, if this should prove desirable at a later stage.Technologyh80    If BLUE STREAK were abandoned, we should lose the technological benefits which could accrue as a by-product of thecontinued development of large rackets (though we should notnecessarily lose the technological value of satellite develop-ment).    It is difficult at this stage to forecast what usefulnew techniques may emerge during the development of largerockets, but these could include improvements in the reliability of long-life instruments and electronic components and thedevelopment of special materials.    The research required may also contribute towards the solution of problems associated withnovel methods of power generation.    On the other hand, cancellation-&apos;tion of BLUE STREAK would release valuable scientific andtechnical resources for other work.Financeh98    The use of American launchers would avoid the bulk of thedevelopment expend!ture on BLUE STREAK (about  52 millions over five years).    There is no reason to suppose that comparablelaunchers from American production would be much different inunit cost from BLUE STRE.1K.    The cost of satellite development7/ould be higher, because of the technical difficulties of co-ordinating the design and construction of satellites andlaunchers.    The provision of special facilities for firingAmerican launchers from Woomera would be fairly considerable,but not significant in comparison with the cost of developingBLUE STREAK.    In the longer term a financial comparison ismore difficult.    Much would depend on the s cale of our programme-13-SECRET
Effect in industry50.    If BLUE STREAK were cancelled, there would he some short-term problems of adjustment - especially atDe Havillands.     In present economic circumstances the personnelreleased could undoubtedly &quot;be re absorbed in due course to the eventual benefit of the economy at large.     But there wouldbe a more    intractable local unemployment problem at Spadeadam.Australia51.    The cancellation of BLUE STREAK would undoubtedly causedifficulties with the Australians.      There is some feeling inAustralia that they have not been consulted sufficiently inthe past.      If further reductions take place in the workavailable for Woomera through the cancellation of BLUE STREAKthey will seek to revise the financial agreement governing the use of the range.      The firing of American launchers fromWoomera would be better than nothing, but the Australians would regard it as a second best solution.International co-operation52,    If BLUE STREAK were cancelled, we could still co-operate with other countries (principally in Europe, and perhaps alsoin the Commonwealth);    this would be primarily directed toscientific research, would not be of any great political significance.      To continue BLUE STREAK and, given Americangoodwill for the project, to offer European countries (notablyPrance)  a share in the control of its development as part of aco-operative space research programme would afford considerable political advantages to the United Kingdom.Prestige55.    It can be argued that the extent of this country&apos;sparticipation in space research will affect our scientific,industrial and political prestige - in short our standing inthe world.      There would of course be something to gain, if only in scientific terms, if a British satellite ?/ere to beput into orbit even without a British launcher.      But thelaiancher itself and the ability to get into space is undoubtedly significant, and the successful development of blue STREAK might well bring us considerable credit.      But by thetime this could be achieved, the Americans and the Russians,whose programmes are far larger and more ambitious, couldbe much further ahead.       Our prestige might be better s orved-by using our limited resources in some other directione     Anindependent space research programme is undoubtedly an expensive undertaking, and the rewards c annot yet be assessed.If the development of BLUE STREAK as a satellite launcherobviously strained our resources, it could be positivelyharmful to our prestige.-1 k-
VIII.POSSIBLE COURSES5k *    The immediate problem &quot;before Ministers is what to do withthe BLUE STREAK project.    By about the middle of July thedevelopment programme for BLUE STREAK will have been run downto the level appropriate for the development of a satellitelauncher.    Should it be allowed to continue, and if so on what basis?   The firms concerned must soon be told where they stand.    Moreover, some announcement about the future of blue STREAK is presumably desirable for Parliamentarypurposes before the summer recess, and in any case we are under an obligation to consult the Australians without delay.55*    It is not at present necessary (nor is it possible) todecide the extent to which the United Kingdom should undertakespace research, nor to decide what our attitude should be tothe possibilities of international co-operation in this field.It is necessary, hov/ever, to consider to what extent thedecision on BLUE STREAK would affect our future freedom of decision in these matters, and how far this would be ofimportance.    These and other relevant considerations have beenconsidered in the preceding section.56.    The possible courses are as follows -(a)    to cancel BLUE STREAK completelyIt would be necessary to explain this decisionfully to the Australian Government before apublic announcement was made.    The decision would imply (and it would have to be stated in the public announcement) that whatever effort we decided tomake in space research must be based, at least for many years, on the use of United Stateslaunchers or launching facilities.    It would therefore be desirable, again before any public announcement, to ascertain that the United StatesGovernment would in principle be willing topermit us to obtain launchers (or facilities)for space research purposes.(b)    to proceed with a -programme of development of blue STREAK as a satellite launcher, preferablyas a joint United Kingdom/Australian projectIt would be necessary to consult the australian government urgently, in order to reach as great a measure of agreement as possible, before any public announcement.    It would also be advisable to inform the United States authorities inadvance (since we should eventually need their concurrence).    This course would enable us andthe Australians to consider whether anyparticipation in international co-operation in space research should include the launcherin some way.-15-
(c)    to -proceed with the development of BLUB STREAKas a satellite launcher&apos; on a provisional &quot;basisThis course would be necessary if Ministers feelunable to decide immediately to cancel BLUE STREAKor to undertake its development as a satellitelauncher;    or if they favour its development, and ittranspires that there is not enough time to make adequate progress in the consultations with the australians and the Americans, and possibly with european countries, to enable a final decision to be announced before the Summer Recess.    In either ofthese cases the development of BLUE STREAK wouldhave to continue at least until the end of the year,in order to give contractors a reasonable basis for planning.    It could, be explained publcly that thedelay in taking a final decision was needed to allowtime for the necessary consultations, including if ministers wished, exploration of the possibilitiesof co-operation with European countries.    If thiscourse were followed,  it would again be necessaryto have as full consi;.ltation as possible with theAustralian Government before any public announcement was made;    and it would be desirableagain to inform the United States authorities inadvance.57.      In view of the importance of the issues to be resolvedwith the Australians, whatever course is followed, it may be felt advisable for a Minister to go to Australia and havediscussions with the Australian Government at a very early date,and before any further -public announcement is made aboutBLUE STREAK.58.      If the development of BLUE STREAK as a satellite launcheris continued until the end of the year,  it would be desirableto take a further decision during October at the latest, inorder to give instructions to contractors in reasonable time.If the possibility of co-operation with European countriesin a space research programme based on BLUE STREAK is regardedas a substantial factor in reaching a final decision,  it shouldbe recognised that consultations cannot very well be suffiently advanced to permit the taking of a final decision in October;and in this case contracts might have to be extended on a provisional basis for a longer period.-16-
