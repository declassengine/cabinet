THE SIX AND THE SEVEN: THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVECovering Note to the Answers to the Prime Ministers List of QuestionsIntroductionWe attach replies to the questions circulated by the Prime Minister in his memorandum of 1st June (E.Q. (60) 29). They are in the form of fairly shortanswers with, in some cases, more detailed argument and explanation in annexes.We have altered the order of the questions where it made it easier to submit the answers to Ministers in consecutive form. We have also added two questions(Nos. 8 and 9) which we thought might arise in Ministerial discussion as they didin our own.Reservations2. We must make two specific reservations which apply to most, if not all,of the answers:(a) On many points the policies of the Six (i.e., the European economic community) are not yet firm, notably on matters left open in the Treatyof Rome. Consequently any answers given now might be considerablyaffected by the policies which will eventually be adopted; and(b) If the United Kingdom were to join the Six, we should undoubtedlyinfluence to a considerable extent the development of these policies.Our presence would also inevitably bring about changes in the structure of the Common Market as it exists to-day. But it is not possible to judge now how great our influence would be and how far thereforeour presence would change the eventual outcome and consequentlysome of the answers we have given.&quot; Joining &quot; and &quot; Close Association &quot;3. We have not discussed in the answers what might be the difference on particular issues between joining the Community and close association with it.This is because we think that, if we were to seek to join the Six, the precedingnegotiation would bring about modifications in the Treaty of Rome which wouldbe likely to leave us in much the position we should reach if we sought &quot; close association &quot; at the outset. There would be some difference in public presentation,but probably little in substance. The main substantial differences would be:(a) &quot; Close association &quot; might well take much longer to achieve than actualjoining, and the price we should have to pay would be greater than weshould have had to pay for the Free Trade Area, while we should notbe members of the inner councils of the Six, and would thus not solve the political difficulties which we think will arise if we remain outside;(b) Our willingness to join as a full member would give the other members ofthe Six a better chance to overcome any French reluctance to acceptus; whatever their individual inclinations might be, they would find it much harder to secure French acceptance of any intermediatesolution short of full United Kingdom membership, and(c) The immediate impact on the Commonwealth would probably be lessunfavourable if instead of actually joining the Community we enteredinto close association with it.The Issues Involved4. In what follows we set out some of the main issues which arise on the answers. But we have not attempted to summarise the answers, and many of the qualifications and reservations which appear in them are not repeated here. Thiscovering note is therefore supplementary to the answers, but not a substitute.
Foreign Policy Considerations5. In the first place, it is now apparent that there are strong reasons offoreign policy for our joining the Six. If the Six &quot; succeed &quot;, we should be greatlydamaged politically if we were outside, and our influence in world affairs wouldbe bound to wane; if we were inside, the influence we would wield in the world would be enhanced; while still retaining in some degree the right to speak on ourown account, we should also be speaking as part of a European bloc. If, on theother hand, the Six &quot; fail &quot;, there would be great damage to Western interests, andthe weakening of Europe which would follow would be a serious matter for theUnited Kingdom; it would be too late for us to go in to prevent failure when a breakdown was seen to be coming, but if we were already in, we could probablystrengthen the European bloc and prevent its disintegration. Foreign policyconsiderations therefore require us to be in the inner councils of the Six.Economic Advantages6. In joining the Six, we should be participating in a vigorous and rapidly expanding market, and there would be good grounds for hoping that our commerce and industry would benefit. We could gain a great deal from larger scale production, specialisation, higher efficiency resulting from keener competition andthe more rapid spread of technical skills and new developments. All this we shouldmiss to the detriment of our industry if we remained outside. If we joined,the inflow of new investment into the United Kingdom would be greater, and theoutflow of capital to the Six might be less than if we remained outside. We should,however, only achieve these advantages and potentialities if we were fullycompetitive with the Six which we must be whether we join the Common Marketor stay outside it and if the Government maintain appropriate economic policiesat home.What Joining the Common Market Means7. We cannot join the Common Market on the cheap. Joining means takingtwo far-reaching decisions. First, we must accept that there will have to be politicalcontent in our action we must show ourselves prepared to join with the Six intheir institutional arrangements and in any development towards closer politicalintegration. Without this we cannot achieve our foreign policy aims seeparagraph 5. Secondly, there must be a real intention to have a &quot; common market &quot;,and this implies that, in so far as the members of the market consider that productioninside the market requires protection against outside production, this must also apply in our corner of the market; that is to say, in general we must accept thecommon tariff.The Four Main Problems8.   Joining the Common Market raises four main problems.  First, and most difficult of all, are the problems of our political and economic relations with theCommonwealth and the maintenance of free entry  which goes wider than theCommonwealth,find the maintenance of free entry^-which goes wider than the&apos;/Thirdly, there is our commitment to, and relationship with, the other countries in/ the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.). Fourthly, there is the question ofj  the reaction of the United States (and indeed other third countries outside the\ European bloc and outside the Commonwealth).The Commonwealth and Free Entry9. In the political field we believe that we could demonstrate to the Six theimportance to them (if we were to join) of our maintaining the Commonwealthpolitical relationship. We believe that we could show the value to the free worldgenerally of our special relationship not only with the old Commonwealth countries,but also with the newer countries (notably India) and the emerging countries (forexample Nigeria). The Six in general are well aware of the attachment of the british people to the Commonwealth concept.10. It is in the economic field that we come up against what seems to us thereally crucial issue in the problem of whether or not to join the Common Market.This arises from the existence of arrangements for the duty-free entry into theUnited Kingdom of a range of products which come mainly from the
Commonwealth, but also from important third countries like the United States.At one extreme it seems that if we were to insist on the maintenance in full of thesefree entry arrangements (which are the basis of the whole Commonwealthpreferential system), there can be no agreement with the Six, particularly as wecould not then accept and take part in their common agricultural policy. At theother extreme, it seems inconceivable that we could accept the common tariff infull and thus give the Six more favourable treatment than the Commonwealth(&quot; reverse preferences &quot;) on some products in which there is a strong Commonwealthinterest. For example, it is unthinkable that we should apply the common tariffof 20 per cent, against wheat from Canada and Australia and the United States while allowing French wheat in free of duty.11. The Six would expect us to raise the problem of free entry, but we cannotjudge whether we could negotiate an acceptable compromise solution. A possibleline of approach though one full of difficulties is indicated in the following paragraphs.12. It might be that we could accept the common tariff on manufactured goodswithout placing intolerable strains on the Commonwealth, provided that we could secure from the Six some easement of their restrictions on imports from the low-costcountries (though our attitude to Japanese goods would be a complicating factor).Even so, the granting of &quot; reverse preferences &quot; in favour of the Six and against theCommonwealth would create serious resentment in some Commonwealth countries.13. The treatment of raw materials would be a somewhat easier problem,a solution might be found on the basis of acceptance of the common tariff, or onthe continuance of free entry coupled with compensation taxes, or possibly througharrangements on a commodity by commodity basis. To accept the common tariff on raw materials as well as on manufactured goods would be a further blow to theCommonwealth.14. As regards foodstuffs, the problems of tropical products would probablybe less difficult than those of temperate products.15. As regards the former, our overseas territories and the overseas territories of the Six produce in general the same kind of things, and a broad bargain mightbe possible under which they would allow free entry to the produce of our overseas territories and we would allow free entry to the produce of theirs. Taken as awhole, such a bargain ought to be acceptable to the Commonwealth countries concerned, whether dependent or independent.16. It is on temperate foodstuffs that the most difficult problems would arise.It seems out of the question that we could accept the common tariff or the otherprotective devices of the Six for these products, even from foreign sources, becauseof the impact on the Commonwealth, the damage to our trading relations withthird countries in the case of the United States a breakdown of the trade agreement and the consequences for food prices here. The only possible way outmight be to propose discussions with the Six, commodity by commodity, bringing in the Commonwealth countries concerned, the United States and perhaps other major foreign suppliers. But this would involve a most formidable programme of negotiations and at this stage it is impossible to say whether generally acceptablecompromises would emerge.Agriculture and Horticulture17. If we joined the Six and accepted their common agricultural policy, ourfarmers as a whole might not suffer, though some sections would. But the common agricultural policy is radically different from our own, and farmers in the UnitedKingdom would need to be convinced that this new policy would not work out totheir disadvantage. To join the Six while attempting to maintain existing free entryarrangements for foodstuffs would expose our farmers to the full force of worldcompetition. Horticulture would involve difficulties of a different kind. It is notthe present intention of the Six to use managed markets in horticulture, but since we rely on the tariff to protect our horticulturalists, these would be faced with increasing competition from the Continent from the outset. We might be able(e.g., through minimum price schemes) to mitigate the damage for some time, butin the longer term some sections at least of the industry would be bound to suffer.
European Free Trade Association18. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given repeated assurances that they willabide by their commitments to the Seven and will only proceed in their dealings withthe Six in consultation and accord with their partners. If it were to look as though we were not fully honouring these undertakings and were merely out to obtain thebest possible arrangement for ourselves, we should be exposed to severe criticism on grounds of bad faith and not only in the countries of the Seven. In practice,if we were to join the Community and if, as is possible, Denmark and Norway joinedwith us, it should prove practicable to negotiate an association providing for the avoidance of trade discrimination between the E.E.C. thus enlarged and thoseE.F.T.A. countries who felt unable to enter the Community. The outcome mightwell be satisfactory, but the handling of the E.F.T.A. countries at the time when wepresented our proposals to them, and when we entered into negotiations with the six, would be very difficult indeed and call for the greatest care.United States19. If the Americans recognised that we were intending to enter Europepolitically as well as economically, they could hardly object. Just as they have welcomed the move towards integration brought about by the Treaty of Rome, so they would probably welcome a move by us to integrate ourselves with the Six.In addition to their interest in the problem of free entry, however, they would dislikethe larger bloc from the economic point of view, since it would entail increaseddiscrimination against them. This dislike might be intensified if the arrangementsfor dealing with the problems of the overseas territories (dependent and independent the Six&apos;s and ours) led to the setting up of what looked like new preferentialarrangements discriminating even further against the United States.Tactics20. On all current indications we do not think that circumstances will be favourable for discussions with the Six leading to a mutually acceptable settlement for some considerable time-at least 12 or 18 months. We do not therefore deal in this paper with questions of tactics and handling. They will, however, be of thegreatest importance and may determine the nature of the settlement (e.g., whether we join the Community alone or as part of a wider move involving the other  .F.T.A. countries). These matters would need very full consideration. Therewould be questions of how and when, and in what order, the Commonwealth,the E.F.T.A. countries and others with an interest (notably the United States)were consulted, and the further question of how the negotiations should take place and where. All these matters we leave over for the time being. But we do thinkit right to emphasise to Ministers at this time that, once they have decided on our policy and on the basis on which they are willing to negotiate, an essential stepmust be to ensure by some appropriate preliminary approach that the Six (andthis really means France) would be willing to see us join or move to close association with them on terms which we could accept. To launch another initiative and receive a second rebuff would be disastrous.
THE SIX AND THE SEVEN: THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVEAnswers to the Prime Ministers QuestionsFOREIGN POLITICAL QUESTIONSQuestion 1Will the Six develop into a powerful and effective unit, both economically and politically, or will it break up or be weakened by internal dissension?Answer(a) It is not possible at this stage to be sure how powerful and effective theEuropean Economic Community (E.E.C.) will become, or what shape it will assume.So much will depend on what happens in France and Germany after the disappearance of de Gaulle and Adenauer.(b) On the one hand there is a genuine sentiment in the peoples of the Six for closer European unity, even at the cost of surrendering considerable nationalindividuality. This is likely to grow as the Six become more and more a goingconcern. It will be in the interests of the Governments of the Six to form a closer-knit community and they will be encouraged by the United States to do so. If thingsgo according to plan, the Community should become a very important factor onthe world scene politically, economically and quite possibly militarily as well.(c) But on the other hand if there is a crise de regime in France after de Gaulle&apos;sdisappearance or over Algeria, or if the Germans were, some years after Adenauer&apos;departure, to lose their morale and seek an accommodation with Russia, or if therewere to be a major world economic recession, then the Community might well be greatly weakened. Furthermore, one cannot be sure that there will not be Franco-German rivalry for the leadership after the disappearance of de Gaulle andAdenauer, even though in other respects the Community is working verysuccessfully.(d) As long as General de Gaulle is in power, his concept of a &quot; Union desPatries &quot; is likely to dominate. If the Community develops on these lines, its formmay be described as that of a Confederation, rather than the political Federationwhich remains the objective of the Monnet school. It is more difficult to forecasthow far Governments will hold to this concept after the GeneraFs departure. Therecan be no certainty that the strength of the Federalist movement will not reassertitself effectively. But in any event it does not follow that a confederation would beless effective and powerful than a federation.Question 2// it is going to succeed, is it desirable that the United Kingdom shouldbe associated with it so that we can influence its policies?Answer(a) Yes. If the Community succeeds in becoming a really effective politicaland economic force, it will become the dominating influence in Europe and the onlyWestern bloc approaching in influence the big Two the USSR and the UnitedStates. The influence of the United Kingdom in Europe, if left outside, willcorrespondingly decrease. Though we may hope to retain something of a special position vis-a-vis the United States, the latter will inevitably tend to attach moreand more weight to the views and interests of the Six rather than to those of theUnited Kingdom. The relative decline in the United Kingdom&apos;s status will reduce our influence in the Commonwealth (see also Question 17) and with the uncommittedcountries. Quite apart, therefore, from the economic damage which we shall suffer from the consolidation of the Six, if we try to remain aloof from them bearing in
mind that this will be happening simultaneously with the contraction of our overseas possessions we shall run the risk of losing political influence and ofceasing to be able to exercise any claim to be a world Power.(b) On the contrary if we were to be effectively associated with the Community,we should not only be able to benefit from its political and economic influence, but would have the opportunity to influence its policies. This would be particularly the case if, as is by no means impossible, France and Germany dispute for the leadership of the Community. If that should happen it might be the role of theUnited Kingdom to hold the balance between the two and exercise a degree ofleadership in the process.Question 3// it is going to fail, would this be such a setback for economic and politicalco-operation among the Western Allies and for world trade generally that we ought to go in to prevent failure?Answer(a) Yes. Whether failure would occasion a serious setback for world trademay be arguable. However, the collapse of the Community after it had been inexistence for some years, would be a grave misfortune not only for Western Europe,but for NATO and the Western cause as a whole and therefore for the UnitedKingdom. It would greatly increase the risk of Western Germany breaking theties with Western Europe and throwing Germany itself into the arms of the USSR.It would encourage the spread of neutralism in Europe and would seriouslyendanger the existence of NATO.(b) If the United Kingdom were in a position at the critical moment to exerta powerful influence, these dangers might be overcome. But it must be doubted if the United Kingdom, after the consequences of some years of standing aloof fromthe Community, would be in such a position. The United Kingdom would be ina much stronger position to prevent the collapse of the Community or to limit its effects if it had been associated with Six from an early date.Question 4Alternatively, is the creation of a powerful bloc in Europe &quot; the thirdforce &quot; likely to be dangerous in terms of world power politics ?AnswerA European &quot; third force &quot; would only be dangerous if it pursued radicallydifferent policies from those of its allies. Such differences could only occur if theCommunity adopted a more aggressive or more conciliatory attitude towards theSoviet bloc. It does not seem possible that Western Europe in the foreseeable future could enjoy the military strength to contemplate adventures against theRussians except at the side of the United States and United Kingdom. Neutralismis a little less unlikely but for political and geographical reasons this too seems aremote possibility. The risks of neutralism in any individual country of the Sixwould certainly be much greater if the Community did not exist or were todisintegrate. There is, however, a possibility that the Six might pursue independentpolicies (possibly but not necessarily anti-American) which would not affect their basic loyalties but would have some of the disadvantages of neutralism.Question 5Who of the Six is likely to control it or have the greatest influence over itspolicies ?answer the French will have the greatest influence in the next few years and may beable to retain it. But much will depend on the future of France after de GauhVsdeparture and upon developments in Germany. The Germains, particularly if therewas a swing to the Right backed by the industrialists, might well make a determinedchallenge for the leadership.
Question 6How would our influence with the Six from outside compare with our influence if inside ?Answer(a) The tendency, already noticeable, for the Six to reach decisions on questionsof importance to them by discussion among themselves before meeting othercountries in the various international bodies will no doubt grow as the Communitydevelops. As this extends, as seems inevitable, to political consultation, we shall find ourselves increasingly excluded and therefore unable to exert effective influenceduring the formative stages of E.E.C. policy-making. On matters directly affectingthe Treaty of Rome this is already the position and we have already been thesufferers in the last few months from the growth of direct consultation between the six and the United States. We may find a tendency for the United States andE.E.C. increasingly to concert policy on major issues, political and economic,without proper regard for the views and interests of the United Kingdom.(b) The best way of insuring against this would be so close an association withthe Six that we take part, from the outset and at all stages, in policy discussions on particular problems. How far it would be possible to achieve this by anarrangement short of full membership is open to question. It would certainly bedifficult to achieve it with complete success unless we were regarded by the Six asfull and equal partners.Question 7How will the development of the Six affect our relationship with the UnitedSlates and our influence in the rest of the world ?Answer(a) Although we could still hope to maintain something of a special position with the United States, more particularly perhaps in military matters, and would continue still to benefit from the ties of a common language, the general decline inour influence especially in Europe-would inevitably encourage the United states to pay increasing importance to the views of the Community. The corollary is thatif we were effectively associated with the Six we should not only improve ourposition with the United States but in some degree be able to act as an intermediary between the United States and the Community.(b) As regards our influence in the rest of the world, this is partly covered bythe answer to Question 2. If we stayed aloof from the Six, the relative decline inour status would reduce our influence in the Commonwealth and with theuncommitted countries. We should run the risk of losing political influence andof ceasing to be able to exercise any claim to be a World Power. On the other hand,if we joined the Community, the initial reaction of the Commonwealth would bethat this was turning away from them. Our influence with some of the uncommittedcountries, e.g., in Africa and Asia might in the short term be diminished to the extent that we were felt to be even more closely associated with the colonial rearguard, viz.,France and the Netherlands, although much would depend on developments inAlgeria and what country might currently be the target of the &quot; anti-colonialists &quot;.In the longer term, our association with the Six should make us economicallystronger and thus improve our capacity to wield influence through trade and aid factors which will count a good deal with the uncommitted countries.Question 8*What woidd be the attitude of the United States to our joining the E.E.C.?Answer(a) The initial reaction of the United States to our seeking membership of theE.E.C. might well be one of mistrust of our intentions. But if it was made clear thatwe were seeking full membership and if as we should hope this was welcome to the other members of the Six, the United States Administration could hardly beseen to oppose the joint purpose of the Six and of ourselves. Furthermore, therewould be political advantages for the United States to set against any economicSupplementary question.SECRET
disadvantages for them. Public opinion in the United States which favours the concept of a United Europe would in general be on our side. There would, however,be misgivings both inside and outside the Administration. On the economic side,American dislike of a larger bloc discriminating against United States exports would be strengthened. Some circles would be disturbed at the thought of theirclosest ally moving to some extent out of their sphere of influence. These fearswould be mitigated by the hope that the accession of the United Kingdom to the six would increase both the strength and reliability of Europe.(b) Membership of all three European Communities (the European Coal andSteel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community as well as E.E.C.)might endanger our bilateral agreement with the United States on atomic energymatters.Question 9*Would the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.) survive UnitedKingdom membership of the E.E.C.? If not, what would be the consequences for the United Kingdom ?Answer(a) Not in its present form. United Kingdom membership of the E.E.C. asconstituted by the Rome Treaty would not be consistent with the full obligations of the E.F.T.A. Convention.(b) It can be taken as certain that membership of the E.E.C. would be unacceptable to some of our partners in the E.F.T.A. But, provided we ourselvesbecame members, it a night be possible to negotiate for them a satisfactoryassociation, the general effect of which would be avoidance of trade discrimination.(c) Even if arrangements of this kind could eventually be made, there would,at the ouset, be a good deal of resentment in some of the E.F.T.A. countries,particularly Sweden and Switzerland, at the change of policy, and a suspicion thatthey were going to be let down by the United Kingdom. But given satisfactory arrangements eventually, these feelings should not endure for long. (See alsoquestion 12.)TRADE AND ECONOMIC QUESTIONSQuestion 10What direct trade and economic advantages do we expect to gain from joining the Six ?Answer(a) The industrial policy of the Six, in contrast to their agricultural policy, iscompetitive and expansionist. Joining the Six would give large potential tradeand economic advantages for British industry. We should be joining an area whichis economically the most rapidly expanding in the world and we can reasonablyhope that our commerce and industry would be invigorated by this. We would be part of a single market of over 200 million people; and though we should still,compared with our European competitors, be slightly handicapped in much of thearea by higher transport costs and different standards and specifications, we couldgain much from more specialisation, larger-scale production, higher efficiencythrough greater competition and a more rapid spread of technical skills and new developments. The inflow of new investment from both inside and outside thearea might be greater, and the outflow of capital to the Six might be less, than ifwe remained outside, with consequent benefit to our balance of payments. Finally,in its external trade, the area should be at once a competitive seller and an expandingbuyer. With rising production, it would be possible, given the will, to invest moreoverseas and give greater aid to under-developed countries.(b) But it should be emphasised that all the above advantages are potentialitiesthat joining the Six might enable us to realise, not inevitable consequences of joining.* Supplementary question.
If our economy and our exports are to grow faster in the future the main changesmust come from within the United Kingdom. Even before union the exports of the six were growing faster than ours. If we are to prosper, we shall have to be fullycompetitive with them whether we are in the Common Market or not and theremoval of tariff barriers against the Six would force greater competitiveness on our industries. But the Government would still have to maintain appropriate economic policies at home.&quot; (c) Whether we join the Six or not, we shall have to reduce the proportion ofour output devoted to consumption, and increase the proportion which is invested orexported. If we join the Six and seek to secure the benefits of association withthe Community, we shall have to be fully competitive with them and this may involve changes in our industrial structure which may be both more rapid and of adifferent character than would be the case if we stayed outside. While these changes were taking place, there would be greater need for mobility of labour inthe United Kingdom, and some social hardship might be involved. In this connexion, however, we must remember that changes in the pattern of industry aretaking place all the time, and that in an expanding economy they can be accomplished without undue difficulty. Moreover, we were ready to face industrialchanges when we originally proposed a free trade area, although the changesrequired for the Common Market may be a little greater than those which a free trade area would have involved. If, on the other hand, we decide to stay out ofthe Common Market, we shall not be faced with these particular, short-term problems, at any rate in the same form. But neither will United Kingdom industry have the advantages of our association with the Six, and this may lead to stagnationand the country as a whole being the poorer for it.Question 11What are the other important consequences of joining the Six?Answer(a) One of the objectives of the Six is the eventual free movement of labourwithin the area of the Community. If we join the Community, we must expectgradual pressure to adopt a more liberal attitude to this question, but how muchmore liberal cannot be forecast at this stage. In general, the present practice ofthe Six is less restrictive than ours, and we should find it difficult to resist pressure to fall into line with them. We should bear in mind that the movement of labourworks both ways, and might conceivably be of advantage to us as a method ofdealing with unemployment.If we joined the Six, we should be accepting the objectives of the eventualfree movement of capital, the removal of restrictions on services, such as bankingand insurance, and the harmonisation of labour conditions (equal pay, for example),and of fiscal policies. The future significance of these objectives is quite uncertain,and the Six will certainly pursue them gradually. As members of the Communitywe should be in a position to exert our influence on what the actual policiesshould be.In general, it seems fair to say that most of these possible developments offerpotential advantages in the long run (and from some, such as banking and insurance,we should benefit in the short run as well), but they may give rise to some difficultiesin the transitional period.(b) There would be some change in the pattern of our trade, though howgreat it would be is impossible to say. There is already a tendency for theproportion of our trade with the Commonwealth to fall; this tendency would beincreased, since we should both buy and sell more in the area of the common market. We should also expect to buy proportionately less from the UnitedStates and we might sell proportionately less to them as well.(c) Very tentative estimates suggest that if we join the Six as full members,and accept the common agricultural policy without modification (but see theintroductory note to Questions 13-15), the direct effect on the Retail Price Indexmight be to raise it by about 2 per cent. some increases in food prices being offset by some reductions in the prices of manufactures. There would be consequentialindirect effects on wages and prices, but both direct and indirect effects would make themselves felt little by little over the lengthy transitional period.   As a partialSECRET57264 c
offset to the rise in the cost of living there would he the savings to the Exchequerfrom the abolition of the agricultural subsidies, and these could be used to reducethe level of taxation.Question 12What value do we expect to gain from our preferential position in the markets of the Seven (bearing in mind possible adherents) ? If we attempted to bring the Six and the Seven together, how much of this advantage might welose through:(a) sharing the preferences with the Six;(b) the possible refusal of some members of the Seven, and any lateradherents, to associate with the Six ?AnswerWe expect to increase our export trade to the Seven (i.e., other E.F.T.A.countries) by a useful amount. The total market (over 90 millions including theUnited Kingdom) is big enough to give us in theory a major increase, and of coursewe dominate the market as the greatest industrial producer in a way in which wecould not hope to dominate the Six. On the other hand, the preferential advantagesare small in the richest parts of the area. If we had to share our preferences withthe Six we should lose most of our gains, though if the sharing were postponed for a couple of years we could dig in during that time and expect then to retain some of our gains. (A fuller answer is given at Annex A.)AGRICULTURE, FOOD, PRICES &amp;c.The answers to the following questions (Nos. 13, 14 and 15) about agriculture,food and prices are based on the assumptions (i) that the common agricultural policy of the Six is broadly as at presentproposed by the Commission and has become fully operative;(ii) that we participate in it without having been able to negotiate anysubstantial changes, or special exceptions.But how far these assumptions are realistic is examined in the cover note by theChairman of the Economic Steering (Europe) Committee.Question 13What changes would have to be made for United Kingdom agriculture,and horticulture, if we joined the Six ? Should we have to participate in&quot; managed markets &quot; ? What would this involve and how would these changesaffect (a) the Exchequer; (b) the farmer; (c) the consumer ?Answer(a) Joining the Six would mean a fundamental change in our agricultural policy. We should be moving from a system which in general combines world freemarket prices for food with support for the farmer by deficiency payments fromthe Exchequer, to one of managed markets with higher prices paid by the consumer.Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, and Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1957, as wellas the present assurances to the agricultural and horticultural industries couldnot be maintained. They would be replaced as instruments of support for the farmer by managed markets, which would include a common tariff, supplementarylevies and some quota restrictions on imports from third countries and occasionaldirect intervention in markets for some commodities.(b) The maximum gain to the Exchequer from these changes in agricultural policy would be the amount of the commodity subsidies ( 160 millions per annum)and the proceeds of the common tariff on imports from third countries. production grants would go on; and supplementary import levies would not, in general, benefit the Exchequer because they would be pooled and go mainly to the Six. (See alsoquestion 15.)   United Kingdom farmers as a whole might remain roughly in the
same position. Some sections would do better but others concentrating on milk(if this could not be excluded), bacon, eggs and horticulture, would stand to losequite a lot. The Commonwealth, which at present enjoys quota and duty free entry, would be hard hit. (See also question 16 and supporting Annex.) Theconsumer would find the cost of Jiving rising, markedly in bread and butter; as a partial offset reductions in taxation ought to be possible. (See also question 11.)Generally, there would be some interference in our marketing system particularlyin the national and international corn exchanges. (A fuller answer is given at annex B.)Question   14How would joining the Six affect our access to cheap foodstuffs and basic materials ? What effect would it have on our internal costs and our competitive position in third markets?Answer(a) We should, on the whole, have to pay more for food imports. But it is notpossible to quantify this or to say what the effect on the terms of trade would be.(b) The prices of some foodstuffs, including horticultural products, wouldprobably be somewhat reduced. But these price reductions would be much morethan offset by increases elsewhere-especially for bread, butter and meat, whererelatively large rises in price must be expected. Food prices as a whole might riseby about 1\ per cent.  (See also question 13.)(c) The prices of basic materials would probably not be much affected. E.E.C.tariffs on basic materials are in most cases low. However, since at present most ofthe basic materials on which we have a tariff come in duty free from theCommonwealth, no reductions in price can be expected.Question 15What would be the fiscal advantage to the Exchequer from joining the six in particular the revenue from import duties or export taxes, and theeffect on agricultural subsidies?Answer(a) The net ultimate gain to the Exchequer is put tentatively at about  220millions per year, on the basis of present levels of trade and income. It should be emphasised, however, that the figure is little more than a guess.(b) On the assumption that Commonwealth free entry is not maintained, therewould be an increase in revenue from tariffs amounting to about  70 millions (netof the loss from the abolition of tariffs on E.E.C. products and the small reduction,on average, in the level of our protective tariffs against manufactured imports from third countries). The maximum gain from the reduction in agricultural subsidiesis put at  160 millions, but in fact the gain is likely to be rather less than this (seequestion 13). No significant gain is expected to accrue from supplementary importlevies on agricultural produce (see question 13) or export taxes. It is possible thatharmonisation of social policies might relieve the Exchequer of some of the burdenof financing the social services. However, this is speculative and in any case therewould be a strong argument for reducing taxation by as much as was saved in thisway. Hence no gain is assumed from this source.  (See question 21.)COMMONWEALTH QUESTIONSQuestion 16To what extent does joining the Common Market put Commonwealth free entry and our Commonwealth preferences at risk? Of what value are they now, and how much of that value might we expect to keep over the next10 or 20 years in either case? Would compensation taxes on some of our exports to the Six to allow for Commonwealth free entry be practicable?Could we negotiate any benefits for the Commonwealth in the markets of the six to compensate for loss or reduction of free entry here?SECRET57264 c 2
Answer(a) Joining the Common Market without any special exception would requireus to apply the common tariff to all imports from the Commonwealth, so endingfree entry (except for those raw materials where the common tariff is nil) and the preferences we give the Commonwealth, and replacing them by preferences for europe against the Commonwealth.(b) We should lose immediately such contractual rights as we have topreferences and all preferences themselves would disappear within a few years.They cover about 20 per cent, of our total exports. The value varies but majorexporting industries attach a good deal of importance to them. They are slowlydeclining in value and the decline will continue; if we do not by our own action(e.g., through our arrangements with the Six or because of substantial increases inour own agricultural output) hasten change, our preferences in commonwealth countries will still be worth having even after 10 years.(c) We could accept the imposition of compensation taxes where necessary.(d) Commonwealth Governments would not be prepared to let us, in their absence, negotiate benefits in Europe to compensate them for loss or reduction of free entry here. The most important trade affected would be in agricultural itemswhere the Six would be very unlikely to make any significant concession. there might be scope for negotiating benefits for tropical foodstuffs, and possibly for someraw materials and low cost manufactures, as part of an arrangement involvingreciprocal benefits for the associated overseas territories of the Six.(e) The difficulties for the Commonwealth would be reduced if free entry intothe United Kingdom could be continued for basic foodstuffs. But this in turnwould give rise to two problems. First, if free entry were confined to theCommonwealth, there would be very serious difficulties with the United Statesand other foreign countries, quite apart from the consequences for the cost ofliving. Secondly, the retention of free entry would remove any attraction theCommon Market might have for United Kingdom farmers.(A fuller answer is given at Annex C.)Question 17Is it politically possible to take a course which could be represented as turning away from the Commonwealth? Would it in fact be practicable tojoin the Six without substantially weakening the Commonwealth, connexion?answer the initial reaction in Commonwealth countries to our joining the common market would be difficult to dispel, and there would possibly be a continuing fear that we had altered our traditional policy and had turned away from them.Furthermore, in course of time the Common Market may develop into a federalEuropean State, though such a development would be contrary to present trendsamong the Six. The closer the Six moved towards a federal State, the more difficultit would become for us if we were members of the Community to maintain our relationship with the Commonwealth, at any rate on its present basis.The indirect political effects, i.e., the political repercussions of the economic consequences, would depend on the extent to which the terms we were able tonegotiate with the Six in fact damaged particular Commonwealth countries. Anywithdrawal of free entry would create great difficulties with them. They would insist on re-negotiating their trade agreements with us, and we should stand to lose the preferences we enjoy in their markets. If we were unable to preserve free entry for foodstuffs, the economic consequences for the Commonwealth would be so serious as to endanger its very existence, particularly since we should be admittingimports of foodstuffs from Europe duty-free. On the other hand, if we remainedoutside a successful European common market our influence with theCommonwealth would be affected by the relative decline in our political status andeconomic strength. (See also the answer to Question 2.)(A fuller answer is given at Annex D.)
Question 18// the Commonwealth connexion were substantially weakened, how would this affect our influence in the world?answer the Commonwealth association (including the use of sterling as a reserve and trading currency) is an important buttress of our position as a Power with world-wide interests and influence. It goes some way to offset our loss of stature in theeconomic and military fields. Without it, or were it substantially weakened, ourstanding in the world would suffer and our ability to influence the policies of theUnited States be affected. A unique bridge between the West, i.e., the older whitecountries of the Commonwealth, and the new countries of Asia and Africa wouldbe broken. Our political influence with Asian and African countries might welldiminish with consequent increased opportunities for the Communist Powers anda weakening of our trading potential in these parts of the world.(A fuller answer is given at Annex E.)SOVEREIGNTY QUESTIONSQuestion 19To what extent would joining the Six require us to give up sovereignty, i.e.,to give up such control as we still have over our domestic economic policiesincluding agriculture and our social policies?AnswerBetween now and 1970 there would be some progressive loss of sovereignty ina number of matters affecting domestic policy, of which agriculture is likely to bean important example. It is difficult to say how much would be involved in any single field. The terms of application of the generally imprecise provisions of the rome Treaty affecting the issues other than tariffs have still to be agreed betweenthe Six in many cases. If we were to join the E.E.C. at an early date we could take part in the formulation of these provisions, and influence the extent to which theyaffected freedom in domestic policy. The effects of any eventual loss of sovereigntywould be mitigated:(i) by our participation in majority voting in the Council of Ministers andby our being able to influence the Commissions preparatory work;(ii) if resistance to Federalism on the part of some of the Governmentscontinues, which our membership might be expected to encourage.Question 20To what extent would joining the Six limit our freedom to act independently in matters of foreign policy, including external commercial andfinancial policy?Answer(a) Our power of independent action in many fields is already limited by ouralliances, our Commonwealth obligations and indeed by our own reducedcircumstances. The concept of &quot; interdependence &quot; recognises this, but places no constitutional brake on our power of independent decision nor does it call inquestion our status as a sovereign nation with an identity of our own. If we wereto join the Community, we would accept treaty limitations on our sovereignty of amore precise and definite character than any existing alliances impose. How farthese limitations would prove to be of such a nature that in our external affairs wewould find ourselves unable to take independent action and thus prejudice what we might conceive to be a vital United Kingdom interest is hard to foretell. The stakewe would acquire in the success of the Community as a whole might change ourconcept of what were vital United Kingdom interests, whether in domestic orexternal relations. Progress towards integration is bound to be gradual. All themembers would still have special interests to reconcile, and each would take their
full part in the evolution of Community policy towards particular problems. Thepossibility of further erosion of the power of independent decision and perhapsultimately of some loss of national identity must nevertheless be faced.(b) At present we have independent control of our tariff (up or down) though in practice our freedom is limited by many considerations. In accepting thecommon tariff of the E.E.C. we should forfeit this freedom though we should gain avoice in settling and adjusting the common tariff. We should have to move ourtariffs up or down to the common tariff level; we should be able to exempt imports,wholly or in part, from this common tariff only in certain closely definedcircumstances and subject to approval by the organs of the Community;autonomous reductions in the common tariff would, with limited qualifications,require unanimity; and it would be the Commission, subject to control by theCouncil (by unanimous vote at first and subsequently by qualified majority vote),that would be responsible for negotiating in respect of the common tariff withoutside countries. In addition to losing from the outset independent control of ourtariff, we should be committed to achieving, by the end of the transitional period, acommon commercial policy generally in relation to outside countries.(c) Our prime objective in the financial field must be to maintain the strengthof sterling. The Treaty of Rome provides specifically for independent action by amember country in emergency to defend its balance of payments. The institutionalprovisions appear to be such as to give us adequate opportunity to make our influence felt if ideas emerged which would be harmful to sterling. In general,any loss of freedom of action would be a change of degree, being Ota intensification of methods of economic co-operation which we have fostered since the war, unless and until common monetary institutions are evolved as part of more completepolitical unification.(d) As regards capital movements, the Six have already shown signs of beingready to move faster towards complete liberalisation among themselves than wehave been ready for generally. To allow complete freedom of capital movementswould be a large departure in United Kingdom policy, which we have not hithertofelt able to afford because of the inadequate size of our reserves; the difficulties of complete liberalisation at present would be formidable, but should not, over a periodof years, be insuperable. If we were to join the Six it would eventually be-psssifefeito prevent movements of capital out of the United Kingdom for new industrial investment in Europe in order to achieve the best economic siting of plants; if onthe other hand we were outside the Six there would nevertheless be a strong demandfor capital movements in order to surmount the tariff barrier which in our owngeneral economic interest it would be difficult to resist. Liberalisation vis-a-vis theother members of the Common Market would involve for us virtually completeliberalisation world-wide since several of the Six already have no barriers againstcapital movements to the rest of the world. The special position which the sterling commonwealth countries have had in the London market would in time have to be shared with the other members of the Common Market.Question 21How important is it to maintain our present independence in fixing thelevel of our tariff and our present freedom of choice of economic policies,including the freedom to decide whether to join new economic groupings?Answer(a) Our independence over tariffs is already severely restricted in practice see question 20 and our economic freedom limited. Further limitations of thekind to which we would be likely to have to submit would not necessarily provedangerous to us, having regard to the degree of economic interdependence we havealready found it advantageous to accept.(b) The main reductions in sovereignty, which we should have to expect infields other than tariff-making if we accepted the obligations of the Treaty of Rome,are set out in answer to question 19. The importance or otherwise for economic policy of maintaining sovereignty in the fields of agriculture and capital movementsare discussed elsewhere (questions -13 and 20 respectively). The abolition of restrictions on the movement of persons and the implementation of equal pay for equal work would probably not have any serious economic effects, but would giverise to serious difficulties with labour.   In particular, the acceptance by Her
Majesty&apos;s Government of a commitment to establish equal pay would, as we arguedin the Free Trade Area negotiations, violate our principle of not interfering with free negotiations between employers and workers. Harmonisation of social policiesmight ultimately entail a shift towards the continental system of financing social services, i.e., higher contributions by employers and insured persons and lowercontributions by the Government. This would make possible a reduction in general taxation which would largely but not wholly offset the effects on wages, prices,income distribution, &amp;c, but there would doubtless be hardship and difficulties inparticular cases.(c) As regards general economic policy, the Treaty of Rome provides only for consultation and collaboration and, though external pressures in favour of particularpolicies might thus grow, our institutional sovereignty would be unimpaired.However, we should undoubtedly be less able than we are at present to insulateourselves from the effects of the economic policies of the Six, and these policiesmight sometimes be different from our own. In recent years, for example, the Sixhave tended to emphasise price stability more, and full employment less, than theUnited Kingdom: to the extent that such differences in attitude persisted the achievement of the aims of United Kingdom policy might prove to be considerably more difficult.(d) In practice, our freedom to join new economic groupings is already limited,as these answers have shown. If we were to accept a common tariff we could notindependently seek to establish an Atlantic free trade or preferential area. But if all members of the Community so agreed, such a development would not be precluded.(A fuller answer is given at Annex F.)OTHER QUESTIONSQuestion 22What has changed in the situation since Ministers decided on the basis ofa full review in 1956 and again in 1959 against joining the Common Market?AnswerThere have been five main changes in the situation:(i) Earlier on it seemed very doubtful if the European Economic community would ever see the light of day owing to the inability of a weak france to withstand increased competition from her future partners, especially from Germany.(ii) We thought that, even if the Common Market did come off, we shouldbe able to make our own terms for associating with it. The free trade Area negotiations proved us wrong.(iii) France and Western Europe generally is no longer weak. The common market is becoming a powerful and dynamic force, economically and politically.(iv) In 1956 we thought that joining the Common Market would weaken our special relationship with the United States. The position has now changed and the United States are attaching increasing importanceto the views of the Community. It is by no means clear, therefore,that the best way of retaining our influence with the United states would be by staying outside the Community, rather than by becoming a leading member of the group with a powerful influence on their policies.(v) In so far as our previous attitude was influenced by our desire to do nothing which might prejudice the Commonwealth relationship, this consideration is now matched by the fear that the growing power and influence of the Six will seriously affect our position in the world ifwe remain outside and this itself will be damaging to our relationship with the Commonwealth.(A fuller answer is given at Annex G.)
Question 23What are the chances that the Six, once they are consolidated, would b&amp;prepared ultimately to enter a free trade area with the Seven?AnswerWe find it impossible to think of circumstances in which the Six would everagree to joining a free trade area of the pattern we attempted to negotiate in1956-58. The arguments on political grounds and on grounds of economic interest for the E.E.C. Governments declining to enter such a free trade area are too strong. These arguments, and the -ability of the E.E.C. countries to sustaina policy of refusal, will become stronger as time goes on. On the other hand,there are also forces working in the direction of an association with other european countries. The French may become more worried about their ability to dominatethe Germans. At the same time, increasing French confidence in their economic position and the consolidation of the Community may make them more disposed to accept the possible risks involved in an arrangement with the Seven. It istherefore possible that, if the Seven remain firm and united, the Six may in a fewyears be prepared to enter into some association with them. But it would bevery risky to gamble on this.
ANNEX ALong Answer to Question 12QuestionWhat value do we expect to gain from our preferential position in the markets of the Seven (bearing in mind possible adherents)? If we attempted tobring the Six and the Seven together how much of this advantage would we losethrough:(a) sharing the preferences with the Six;(b) the possible refusal of some members of the Seven and any lateradherents to associate with the Six?Answer1. What value we derive from the free trade which will be established afterthe ten years transitional period in E.F.T.A. (the Seven) depends on how ourmanufacturers take advantage of the new opportunities for increasing their sales.The United Kingdom domestic market will be increased by 37 millions (Finland will mean another 4 millions). But in this total we have 9 millions for Portugal, a country which we cannot expect to be a source of dynamic demand in E.F.T.A. Austria toois not so rich a country as some of the others, nor is Finland. In fact in the shortrun the real markets in the E.F.T.A. are in Scandinavia and in Switzerland, and it isin these markets that determination to make E.F.T.A. a reality will bear most fruit.The theory of a free trade area is that it will generate more trade; E.F.T.A. will mean more competition, leading to cheaper prices, and the accession of this bodyof Scandinavian and Swiss consumers with high standards of living to our domestic market will mean increased demand. It is impossible to predict what trade will come out of this; all that can be done is to point out the factors.2. As regards manufactured goods, in 1958 the other E.F.T.A. countries tookonly 14 per cent. ( 258 millions) of their imports of manufactured goods from theUnited Kingdom and 55 per cent. ( 997 millions) from the Six. There is a greatdeal to be won. As the tariffs come down we should have more and more of an edgeagainst other suppliers to the E.F.T.A. markets. The significance of the tariffadvantage will depend on its amount, i.e., upon the height of the external tariff inthe country concerned and the commodity concerned. The Portuguese and theAustrian tariffs are high, the Norwegian and Finnish tariffs are like our own,medium, and the tariffs of Sweden and Denmark and Switzerland are generallylow.3. The tariff advantage which we shall have in the most important markets of the E.F.T.A. will not be large and may even be non-existent on some items.Moreover if we consider the geographical separation of the E.F.T.A. countries, andthe fact that the E.E.C. countries have more direct and easier access to the E.F.T.A.countries than we do, it can be appreciated that we shall have to fight to get muchof the Six&apos;s share of trade in the E.F.T.A. market. There are also the factors oflanguage, of standards and specifications and of terms of sale, in respect of whichthe other traditional suppliers may be able to counterbalance any tariff advantage that we have. We must therefore be sober in our expectations.Conclusion4. We would expect to gain some of the trade that is now done with the restof the world by the other E.F.T.A. countries as a result of the establishment of theE.F.T.A. We have always hesitated to lay stress on the amount of trade we shallgain from the E.E.C. and from the rest of the world, since it is our contention thatE.F.T.A. will be not trade-diverting but trade creating and outward-looking.(a) If we attempted to bring the Six and the Seven together, we would not havethe tariff advantages of the E.F.T.A. in relation to the Six, and thusshould not expect to improve our position in the E.F.T.A. markets assuch (given our competitive position) as much as we might in anE.F.T.A. by itself. On the other hand we should have the advantages to be gained from participating in a wider single market.
(b) It seems that some form of discrimination, not necessarily the same as thatwe should adopt ourselves, would be inevitable for the other membersof E.F.T.A. In that case we should lose all the preferential advantages that E.F.T.A. gives us over the Six, and any preferences we receive overthe rest of the world would in those circumstances be of negligiblevalue. If, contrary to this expectation, some member of the Seven didnot find an acceptable form of association with the Six and ourselvesthe additional loss to our trade would be negligible.24th June, 1960.ANNEX BLong Answer to Question 13QuestionWhat changes would have to be made for United Kingdom agriculture andhorticulture if we joined the Six? Should we have to participate in &quot; managedmarkets &quot;? What would this involve and how would these changes affect (a)the Exchequer; (b) the farmer; (c) the consumer?answer the Common Agricultural policy. The Treaty of Rome lays down the guiding lines for a common agricultural policy, which has yet to be worked out in detail. Proposals have been made by theCommission of the E.E.C. These are now being reviewed by the Commission in thelight of comments of the Six Governments and over the next few months the Councilof Ministers of the Six will be discussing them. There will no doubt be changes,but we think it right to assume that these will not be of a fundamental character.Essentially, the common agricultural policy provides for a common level of prices,which would be above world prices, for producers throughout the Common Market.This would be maintained by applying the common external tariff, supplementedwhere necessary by import levies, to imports from third countries which, for someproducts, would also be subject to import licensing; and, in some cases, by directintervention in the market. These forms of agricultural support, with the cost fallingdirectly upon the consumer, are not dissimilar from the individual policies which the six now practice. There would be a transitional period before the common policycame fully into operation.2. Present United Kingdom policy is to support farmers&apos; income by means of deficiency payments to supplement free market prices. This is a system whichpreserves the freedom of the market and of commercial policy to a much greater extent than is possible under the present practices of the Six or under the policy likelyto eventuate under the Commission^ proposals. The increase in taxation whichwould be necessary to enable the Six to switch to our system would be more thanthey could bear for they have much larger farming populations and produce muchmore of their total food requirements.3. Acceptance of the agricultural policy of the Six as outlined in paragraph 1above would mean for us the transference of a great part of the cost of agricultural support from the taxpayer to the consumer through higher prices in &quot; managedmarkets &quot;. In horticulture, joining the Six would mean that imports into the UnitedKingdom from third countries would be subject to the common tariff. Our growers,however, would lose the benefit of the present tariffs, which are the main element in their protection, against imports from the Six, although this might be mitigated,at any rate during the transitional period, by the adoption of minimum price arrangements and similar devices. The Commission have not yet produced any proposals for fish, but the common tariff will apply to imports of fish from third countries and the Commission can be expected to aim in addition at some form of&quot; managed market&quot;.
Effect on United Kingdom Agricultural policy.   What follows is based on the assumptions-(i) that the common agricultural policy of the Six is broadly as at presentproposed to the Commission and that it has become fully operative;(ii) that we participate in it without having been able to negotiate anysubstantial changes.5. In general, joining the Six would mean that Part I of the Agriculture Act,1947, Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1957, and the present assurances to our agricultural industry could not be maintained once the common agricultural policy had come into full operation; nor could the pledge to horticulture of equivalencewith the agricultural industry with the tariff as the main instrument of protection.Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be unable to continue to give to United Kingdomproducers the kind of pledges they have been getting. The way in which thecommon policy would affect farmers&apos; output and income would largely depend onthe levels at which the common internal prices were fixed from year to year, andthe United Kingdom would have only a partial say in this; we deal in paragraph below with what might happen in practice. Joining the Six would also involve someretreat from the policies of decontrol and freedom of markets which theGovernment have put into effect.Effect on Third Countries and the Commonwealth6. Joining the Six would mean that, unless some special arrangement couldbe made, all imports of agricultural products (including horticultural and fishproducts) into the United Kingdom would be subject not only to the high common tariff but also, as regards agricultural products, to supplementary import levies andto some import licensing controls so as to maintain the high common internal price.The effect of this on Denmark&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom would be so serious that she would inevitably wish to enter the Common Market. The Irish Republic,whose agriculture is to some extent complementary to our own, would be very hardhit. However, her bargaining position vis-a-vis the Six would seem to be very muchweaker than Denmark&apos;s. The Commonwealth would be affected in varying degrees.The high levels of support in the Community might well lead to the emergence ofagricultural surpluses which would be to the detriment of Commonwealth exporters.There would be serious problems, particularly in cereals, for Australia and perhapsCanada. A really critical situation would arise in New Zealand which has notdiversified its economy to the same extent and is heavily dependent upon the UnitedKingdom market. Her exports of butter and other dairy products in particularwould be severely damaged.Effect on the Exchequer7. We believe it reasonable to assume that the internal prices likely to be fixed for agricultural products would by and large be much the same as the presentguaranteed prices to farmers in the United Kingdom. On this assumption, market prices of United Kingdom-grown agricultural products would rise in the aggregateby an amount of the same order as our present commodity subsidies. TheExchequer would therefore save what is at present being paid out on these subsidies(about  160 millions a year) and would also receive the proceeds of the common tariff on imports from third countries which could be expected to be substantial.Whether the Exchequer would be able to save these amounts in full, however, would depend in practice on the extent of the pressures that might be generated for supplementary financial assistance to United Kingdom producers, particularly smallproducers, whose interests would be damaged by accession to the Common Market.The supplementary import levies would be pooled and would mainly accrue to the six and not to the United Kingdom. To that extent United Kingdom consumerswould be assisting the producers of the Six.Effect on United Kingdom Agriculture8. The support which United Kingdom agricultural producers are now gettingconsists of the commodity subsidies of  160 millions referred to in the preceding paragraph and production grants (fertilisers&apos; subsidy, ploughing grants, grants to small farmers, &amp;c.) worth another  100 millions. We could expect to be able tocontinue the system of production grants if we joined the Six, but particular schemes
and total expenditure would doubtless come under increasing scrutiny in Brussels.On the assumption in paragraph 7 about the level of internal prices in the common market, the increased market returns to our farmers would be sufficient overall to compensate them for the loss of the commodity subsidies. The effects on particularagricultural commodities would, however, be uneven. We would expect, forexample, that United Kingdom producers of cereals, beef, mutton and lamb would receive higher prices than at present. More generally, our producers should alsoobtain some advantage from the increased export opportunities that would be likelyto be available in the markets of the Six for high-grade agricultural products and manufactured foodstuffs. On the other hand returns on bacon pigs and eggs whichare of special importance on the smaller farms could be expected to be appreciablylower. Our horticultural producers, many of whom also operate on a small scale,would be increasingly faced with competition from the Netherlands and Italy andmany would have to go out of business. A special problem would have to be facedon milk, which is an essential element in our farming economy. The establishmentof a common level of wholesale prices with the Six would mean a significant reduction in the returns of United Kingdom milk producers. It might, however, bepossible to negotiate an arrangement under which milk for liquid consumption,which is a special case for the Six as it is for us, was virtually excluded from theCommon Market. Even if the milk problem were solved it would still be the case that the adverse effects of joining the Six (on eggs, bacon pigs and horticulture)would be felt especially by the small farmers a numerically large, and economicallyvulnerable and a politically sensitive part of our farming community.9. The Commission have produced no proposals for a common policy on fish,but other things being equal the United Kingdom fishing industry could be expectedto do fairly well under any arrangements which were acceptable to the fishingindustries of the Six.10. It is difficult to judge what effect joining the Six would have on theefficiency of United Kingdom agriculture. In general our producers as a whole arealready at least as efficient as producers as a whole in Western Germany, Franceand Italy and the competition to which they would be exposed in the home marketas well as the export opportunities which would be available in the wider market should tend in themselves to increase their efficiency still further. On the otherhand, the system of agricultural support proposed by the Commission could have theeffect of insulating producers in the common market from conditions in the world market thus reducing the incentives towards increased efficiency. This danger could also arise under a deficiency payments system as at present practised in the UnitedKingdom, but in this system there is the built-in safeguard that any widening of the margin between the support prices and world market prices is automaticallyreflected in an increase in the subsidy bill.Effect on the Consumer11. Rather more than half the burden of support in the United Kingdom for agriculture would be transferred from the taxpayer to the consumer, who wouldalso have to bear part of the cost of supporting producers in the Six under theCommission^ proposals for the pooling of import levies. The consequentialincrease in retail food prices in the United Kingdom might be of the order of 375 millions. This would represent an increase in retail food prices of 1\ per cent.( 375 millions out of  4,900 millions) and in the cost of living as a whole of 2\ percent. There would be one or two startling increases, e.g., the price of bread might increase by as much as 2^d. or 3d. on the lid. loaf and the price of butter mightbe nearly doubled. The savings on agricultural support and the proceeds of thecommon tariff on food imports from third countries would be available and might,if desired, be used to neutralise part of the rise by reducing taxation.Transitional Period12. These paragraphs are based on the assumption that the full agricultural policy of the Six is in effect; and is broadly on the lines proposed by theCommission. This may, however, not be the case and if we joined the Six we might expect in any event to negotiate some changes in the policy and secure somemitigation of its effects. It would, however, be unrealistic to base a decision to join the Six on the assumption that really substantial changes could be secured. On theother hand, there will in any case be a transitional period of about six years before
the common policy is fully operative and we might be able in negotiation to secure a longer period for the United Kingdom. This would give us the opportunity ofgradually adjusting our own system to the system which would be in force when acommon market had been established with the Six and to some extent of easing the path of our own producers towards it. Once this stage had been reached it wouldnot be possible to continue our present system unless the Six were prepared to agreethat some products could be excluded from common market arrangements. Wethink that it may be possible to negotiate the virtual exclusion of liquid milk as mostof the Six themselves will want to reserve their national markets for liquid milkexclusively for their own producers. It is also possible that the Six would not objectto the exclusion of beef, live cattle, mutton and lamb from a common market withthe United Kingdom since they have little interest in trade with us in these fourcommodities.ANNEX CLong Answer to Question 16QuestionTo what extent does joining the Common Market put Commonwealth free entry and our Commonwealth preferences at risk? Of what value are they now, and how much of that value might we expect to keep over the next tenor twenty years in either case? Would compensation taxes on some of our exports to the Six to allow for Commonwealth free entry be practicable? could we negotiate any^ benefits for the Commonwealth in the markets of the Six to compensate for loss or reduction of free entry here?answer the obverse of the preferences we enjoy in most Commonwealth countries is the combination of the free entry given to Commonwealth goods (except a fewwhich for more than 30 years have attracted what were in origin fiscal dutiesat m.f.n. or preferential rates), and the preferences provided by this exemption from our tariff. In most independent Commonwealth countries, except Canada,we enjoy preferences as of right under the Ottawa Agreements as modified overthe years. Under these agreements we in turn are under contract to accordpreferences for certain goods (mainly primary products, but including somemanufactures) and to maintain free entry. Thus under our Agreements with australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, India and also theIrish Republic, we have, in addition to obligations in respect of certain margins of preference, commitments to maintain free entry either generally or for goodsin which the countries concerned have an active trade interest. To- impose duties on the Commonwealth generally or in particular cases we should need to be released from or to denounce our existing agreements.2. Under the 1958 Import Duties Act our previous legislative obligations togive free entry to the Commonwealth disappeared, but in the context of the Act, theColonies were given a formal assurance that it was not Her Majesty&apos;s (governments intention to change the present duty-free entry treatment for Colonial goods.Ministers are, in addition, deeply committed to the maintenance of Commonwealthfree entry by what they have said both in Commonwealth discussions and inParliament. Of these statements, the following are perhaps the most important:The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Harold Macmillan): &quot; We couldnot expect the countries of the Commonwealth to continue to give preferential treatment to our exports to them if we had to charge them full duty on their exports to us. I do not believe that this House would ever agree to our enteringarrangements which, as a matter of principle, would prevent our treating thegreat range of imports from the Commonwealth at least as favourably asthose from the European countries.&quot; (Hansard, 26th November, 1956, Col 37.)The President of the Board of Trade (Sir David Eccles): &quot; The Coloniesare not in the same position as the independent Commonwealth countries tonegotiate trade agreements with the United Kingdom.   We have especial
responsibilities towards them which go beyond the consideration that would apply in a commercial negotiation between countries each having fullinternational sovereignty. It would be inconceivable that the United kingdom should discriminate in tariff policy against the goods of any Colony in favour ofthe goods of the other independent Commonwealth countries. Therefore,although the Colonies could not have any contractual guarantees, the UnitedKingdom Government have given Colonial Governments an undertaking thatwe do not intend to make any change in the present tariff treatment of colonialgoods which are now duty-free.&quot; (Hansard, 2nd December, 1957, Vol. 579,Col. 43.)Report of the Montreal Conference: &quot; The United Kingdom confirmedits intention of maintaining, as an important element in the preferential system the free and unrestricted entry of nearly all goods imported from theCommonwealth.&quot;  (Paragraph 31 of Cmnd. 539.)The Paymaster-General (Mr. Maudling): &quot; Secondly, we must recognisethat to sign the Treaty of Rome would mean having common external tariffs,which, in turn, would mean the end of Commonwealth free entry, and I cannotconceive that any Government of this country would put forward a propositionwhich would involve the abandonment of Commonwealth free entry.&quot;(Hansard, 12th February, 1959, Col. 1381.)The Home Secretary (Mr. Butler): &quot; Provided that we agreed on that and do not do away with Commonwealth free entry, which might otherwise be in danger, certainly we shall do our best to get constructive unity in Europe.&quot;(Hansard, 19th May, I960,.Col. 1483.)3. Commonwealth free entry (both in itself and because exemption from ourtariff provides preference) is thus an essential element in our contribution to theCommonwealth preferential trading system as its exists to-day. But independently of this, our existing exemption of Commonwealth goods from our protective tariffcontinues, for the Commonwealth, a policy which prior to 1930 applied more widely. Prior to 1930 we were essentially a free trade country. When introducingour general tariff we preserved this tradition in relation to the Commonwealth. Inour readiness to move to free trade with Europe we are in line with this tradition.To impose duties on the Commonwealth (with which we conduct half our trade)would be a major step away from it.4. To apply the common tariff to the Commonwealth would mean that commonwealth goods would lose equality of access in the United Kingdom marketwith United Kingdom producers where there is United Kingdom production; thatwe should be substituting preference for Europe against the Commonwealth forpreference for the Commonwealth against Europe; and that commonwealth countries would lose preference in the United Kingdom market against the UnitedStates and other outside countries. A note on the trading interests of individualCommonwealth countries is attached as an appendix.What we might aim for. If Ministers are prepared to contemplate any derogation from the principleof Commonwealth free entry the choice would seem to lie between readiness toabandon Commonwealth free entry across-the-board, and readiness to abandon it for manufactures and such raw materials as would not continue to enjoy free entryunder the E.E.C. common tariff, while attempting to maintain Commonwealthfree entry for foodstuffs. (To adopt the common tariff for foodstuffs but seek to maintain Commonwealth free entry for them would involve important increases in preference on some products for the Commonwealth here against outsiders andespecially the United States; this would seriously upset our existing tariffagreements with the United States.) In the industrial field, it would not be realisticto assume that we could get by with isolated departures from Commonwealth free entry here and there. In so far as there is any case at all for the Six to argue thatthe maintenance by us of our traditional policy of free entry for the Commonwealthis incompatible with achieving industrial free trade in Europe, there would be nological basis for distinguishing between one manufactured or semi-manufacturedproduct and another. The difficulty of drawing and holding a line, once theprinciple is breached, has been one of the reasons for resisting domestic pressuresfor protection against Commonwealth competition with our own producers.
6. If we acceded to the Treaty of Rome as it stands and applied the common external tariff against all Commonwealth territories, we should then be admittinggoods and commodities free of duty from both the Six and their Associated overseas territories (dependent and independent), while putting duties on similar goods and commodities from independent Commonwealth countries and our colonial territories. Even apart from this last point, free entry here for the products of the associated Overseas Territories of the Six would obviously be unacceptable without adequate reciprocity in the markets of the Six for the products of commonwealth countries. The difficulty over this is that the dependent and independent commonwealth is in the aggregate a much larger producer than the A.O.Ts. ofthe Six, and produces a much wider range of goods, including manufactures andtemperate agricultural products. Full reciprocity across the board is therefore too much to hope for. It might be possible to arrive at agreed arrangements fortropical products such as the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. themselves produce, and it would clearly be a great advantage for tropical Commonwealth countries if they could secureduty-free access to the markets of the Six for all their tropical products and rawmaterials, and not merely for those on which the common external tariff is nil. Ifsomething on these lines could be negotiated, it would obviate the damage to thetrade of tropical Commonwealth countries with the Six which would otherwisearise from the present arrangement for the association of the A.O.Ts. with theCommon Market. It would also have the advantage of not carrying into thefuture in Africa and the Caribbean the rivalries between European Powers which itwas never possible to avoid completely during the Colonial era.7. In reciprocity for free entry into the United Kingdom from the Six&apos;sA.O.Ts. we might accordingly try to negotiate free entry from the Commonwealthinto the Six&apos;s markets over a list of products, and the retention of Commonwealthfree entry into the United Kingdom on the remaining Commonwealth products(including manufactures and temperate agricultural products) with something lessthan free entry for these products in the Six&apos;s markets. But satisfactory arrangements would be much more difficult to negotiate over these &quot; remainingCommonwealth products &quot;, especially for temperate agricultural products, than fortropical products; if satisfactory arrangements were made for tropicalCommonwealth countries but not for the others, a source of friction and a newdivision within the Commonwealth would be created. It may be noted that theTreaty of Rome has a Protocol permitting, e.g., France to continue to give Morocco,Cambodia, &amp;o, the same customs treatment as before the Treaty so far as concernsentry to the French (but not the Common) market. In principle this constitutesan important precedent, which can no doubt be brought into play in argument;but there is of course a great difference in scale between French imports from the protocol States and ours from the Commonwealth.Attitude of the Six8. The Six would no doubt recognise that our adherence to the common market would have additional value in the political field if it were achieved without causing a serious weakening of the Commonwealth connexion. This should leadthem to give sympathetic consideration to proposals we might make for reducingthe economic impact on other Commonwealth countries of our association withthe Six. On the other hand, they would have some narrowly self-interested reasonsfor opposing any very wide exceptions to the common tariff as applied to theCommonwealth by us. The Six would be very unlikely to make any significantconcession on temperate agricultural products, which constitute the bulk of commonwealth trade affected. But there might be scope for negotiating with themsatisfactory arrangements for tropical products on the lines indicated in paragraph above.9. As explained in the answer to Question No. 13, it would be unrealistic to base a decision to join the Six on the assumption that substantial changes could besecured in their agricultural policies. They would be likely to require us to acceptthose policies in much their present general shape, and those policies are hardlycompatible with the retention of free entry for temperate agricultural products fromthe Commonwealth. In view of the likelihood of increased agricultural productionin Europe, the result of our accepting those policies would therefore be likely to dosevere damage to the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African exporttrade to this country.
Our Preferences in Commonwealth Countries10. The application of the common external tariff to the Commonwealthacross-the-board would mean the immediate end of the Ottawa Agreementsstructure. It would doubtless be some years before the preferences we now enjoydisappeared completely; Commonwealth countries would take their time to readjusttheir tariff structures. But we should have lost entirely our contractual rights topreferences.11. If we could exclude foodstuffs from our association with the common market by something close to the definition used for E.F.T.A., we could expect tomaintain the most valuable of our existing preferences. Under this definition, themain interests of Australia and New Zealand would be preserved (though Australiaattaches importance to her small but growing trade in manufactures); the preferencesimportant to South Africa for fruit against the United States and for wine againstPortugal and Spain would be preserved; and we should preserve the Federationtobacco preference against the United States. Canada&apos;s position in the UnitedKingdom market for foodstuffs (about a third of her exports to us), including wheat and other grains, would be preserved, but she would face tariffs here (and preference for Europe over her) over a wide range of semi-manufactures and manufactures(aluminium, chemicals, machinery, &amp;c), accounting for some 30 per cent, of herexisting trade with the United Kingdom, in addition to losing the potential futurebenefit of free entry here. The pressures which always existed for her to strikebargains with the United States at our expense would be intensified. India does not now enjoy the full benefit of her rights to free entry for jute manufactures andother textiles; but the loss of her rights to free entry for manufactures (which are of potential as well as existing importance to her) would radically alter the basis of theexisting agreement with her. We could also not expect our existing agreement withPakistan to survive. The less we could keep of the E.F.T.A. exception for foodstuffs,the less we could hope to retain of the preferences we enjoy. The Colonies which give United Kingdom goods preferences are mainly interested in a limited group of tropical agricultural products, especially sugar. If the Commonwealth sugar agreement is retained in something like its present form and the adverse effects oncitrus and bananas are not too great, United Kingdom preferences in these territories should not be seriously affected.Value12. We have no preferences in Ghana, Nigeria or the East African colonies;something under one-third of our exports to South Africa enjoy preferences; inAustralia and New Zealand the proportion is probably nearer 90 per cent.; weenjoy preferences, though these have no contractual basis, in Canada over thegreater proportion of our trade there. We also have non-contractual preferencesin Malaya and Ceylon, and contractual preferences of limited value in India and pakistan. In all, preferences, greater or smaller, are enjoyed by about 20 per cent,of our total exports.13. In 1948 the average margin of preference calculated over our exportsenjoying preference was about 15 per cent. Since then the level has been declining.In 1957, for instance, Australia obtained freedom to reduce our margins to generallevels of 10 per cent, and 1\ per cent, for different categories of goods; and in 1958New Zealand obtained similar freedom to reduce to general levels to 10 per cent.,1\ per cent, and 5 per cent. Australia has not yet made full use of this freedom, andNew Zealand has as yet made no use of it. Canada has reduced our marginsin a number of cases. Elsewhere, though one or two individual preferences havebeen eliminated, there has been no significant reduction of the general level of ourpreferences.14. Our engineering industries, which account for half of all our exportsof manufactured goods, attach great importance to the preferences which theyenjoy. Where our chemical industry faces keen competition from the United Statesand Germany quite a small margin of preference can turn the scale. There is a range of industries for which the Commonwealth represents the major market.Between 65 per cent, and 75 per cent, of all our exports of glassware, linoleum,carpets, lace, pottery and cutlery and over half of all our exports of paper, knitwearand footwear go to the Commonwealth. These industries, and others which havean important Commonwealth trade, would regard the loss of preferences as aserious matter.
15. There has been erosion, over the years, in the margins of preference weenjoy through tariff adjustments to reduce the cost of essential imports, throughthe raising of preferential rates to protect local industries, through the decline, withthe fall in the value of money, of the ad valorem incidence of margins expressed in specific terms, and as a result of Commonwealth participation in multilateralnegotiations for the reduction of tariffs. Erosion on these accounts must beexpected to continue, but there is no reason to foresee that its pace will materiallyincrease provided that :(a) we are able to maintain for Commonwealth countries the valuable rightsand opportunities they enjoy in our market; and(b) they find little scope for obtaining concessions in other countries in returnfor reducing their m.f.n. tariffs and our preference margin in their ownmarkets such scope is inevitably limited in the agricultural sector,where the major interest of our most important Commonwealth partnersstill lies.Subject to these provisos we need not expect over the next ten years or so that ourmargins of preference will have been reduced or eroded to a point where they will cease to be of material value. For the most part they have a long way to go before they reach the minimum significant level of, say, 5 per cent. At this level a numberof important industries would still enjoy a material advantage, and preferencesof the order of 5 per cent, over 20 per cent, of all our exports would remain of realpsychological value as a continuing assurance of a special place in importantmarkets. One qualification to this should be made: if the further expansion ofour own agricultural output reduces substantially the market here for Australiaand New Zealand, the preference system would decline more rapidly.Compensation Taxes16. The use of &quot; compensation taxes &quot; on United Kingdom exports to offset,where necessary, advantages United Kingdom manufacturers might enjoy in theCommon Market in competition with Common Market producers through access to duty-free materials of Commonwealth origin would be manageable, though there would be problems of administration, which could lead to anomalies andfriction.Benefits in Europe to Compensate the Commonwealth if we join the CommonMarket17. Commonwealth Governments would resent it if we tried to carry throughnegotiations for this purpose on their behalf. They would regard this as then-own business. What we could do would be to make clear to both sides that wewould not seek to preserve any rights we might have to preferences which other commonwealth countries wished to terminate as part of a bargain with the Six orother countries. This might lead to triangular negotiation in which we should be seeking a satisfactory form of association with the Six; the Commonwealth wouldbe seeking adequate access to the markets of the Six; and the Six would be seeking a better position than at present in Commonwealth markets at the expense of the preferences we enjoy there. It would then be for the Commonwealth countries to decide whether any benefits they could secure in this way were adequate, orwhether they preferred to continue giving us preferences in the hope of getting a better bargain later, or of encouraging us to continue to give them such special treatment in our market as we had preserved in the course of our negotiations.18. Negotiating benefits in the markets of the Six to compensate theCommonwealth for loss or reductions of free entry into the United Kingdom wouldmean trying to get benefits to compensate for action by us which would, accordingto the circumstances of the products, involve:loss of equality of access to the United Kingdom market with United Kingdomproducers;loss of preference in the United Kingdom market against the United States orother outside countries; and where there was actual or potential European production, a preference for europe against the Commonwealth.SECRET57264 e
The improved access to the markets of the Six which the commonwealth countries would be seeking to obtain is in fact what they are already and have long been anxious to achieve both vis-a-vis the individual countries themselves and inrespect of the common external tariff of the Common Market as a whole. But theiranxiety to secure improved access to the markets of the Six would obviously beincreased by any losses they were likely to suffer in our market as a result ofour joining the Common Market. In the course of such negotiations theCommonwealth countries would have greater freedom than hitherto to offer to endpreferences accorded to us. It would remain to be seen whether this greater freedom would have any more success than the freedom they already have, whichthey have not in practice been able to make much use of. It is our hope, and thatof the Commonwealth countries concerned, that the Six will anyway open theirmarkets more freely to the manufactured exports of the under-developed countries;but their progress in the direction of lifting the existing quantitative restrictions willbe cautious and controlled. The question of other tropical products has beendiscussed in paragraph 6 above.19. As regards temperate agricultural products where so much of theCommonwealth interest lies the pattern of agricultural production in Europe, itspotentialities for expansion, the declared aims of the Six, and the social and political considerations dominating these, clearly imply little, if any, scope for adjustment in favour of Commonwealth producers at the expense either of the Six&apos;s ownfarmers or of any hopes that they may entertain of improved access to the UnitedKingdom market for their own surpluses. M. Wormser gave Mr. Nash noencouragement on this subject when they discussed it in Paris in April and it isnoteworthy that M. Rey, in answering a question from Lord Boothby at a meetingheld at the House of Commons on 1st June, stressed that any arrangement betweenthe Six and the United Kingdom designed to offer advantages to the rest of theCommonwealth would raise the greatest difficulty if it involved concessions by the six in the agricultural sector. Australia sometimes appears to be favouringmanaged market arrangements under which responsibility for supplying the UnitedKingdom requirements would be shared between our own farmers, Australia and continental Europe in multilateral negotiations in which she took part, and a primeAustralia objective is to have an effective voice in the formulation of Europeanagricultural policies: but it is questionable if the Six would concede this even if wewere ourselves prepared to do so.ANNEX DLong Answer to Question No. 17QuestionIs it politically possible to take a course which could be represented asturning away from the Commonwealth? Would it in fact be practicable tojoin the Six without substantially weakening the Commonwealth connexion?answer the political effect on the Commonwealth connexion of our joining theCommon Market (with or without special derogations, e.g., to preserveCommonwealth free entry in whole or part) can be analysed into:(a) the effect of the limitations that would be placed on our freedom to act independently in international matters; and(b) the political repercussions of the impact on Commonwealth trade andfinancial relations of our joining the Common Market.Effects of Limitations on our Freedom of Action2. As regards (a) above, it is far from clear what specific limitations would beplaced upon our power of independent action in international matters. The hopeof the convinced &quot; Europeans &quot; in the Six is that the Common Market and itscompanion institutions should lead on to a new federal State in Europe. Theexperience of, e.g., the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community
in the past year suggests that such an evolution is unlikely to take place, at anyrate in the foreseeable future, and such ah evolution certainly does not seem, to appeal to President de Gaulle.-.: But the influence of the &quot; Europeans &quot; may growin the long term, and if such an evolution did take place it would clearly changefundamentally our existing relationship with the * other Commonwealth countries.3. Assuming that no federal evolution resulted from the Common Market,&amp;c, the limitations on our independent action might not be very much greater,except in the economic field, than those that already result from our membership of the Atlantic and other alliances. Outside. the economic field, the other commonwealth countries could still see value in the kind of frank and informalconsultation which we have at present, though well knowing (as in respect of questions affecting our NATO partners to-day) that our actions would be largelyinfluenced by our need to support our allies and partners in other groups. Similarly,of course, we ourselves have to recognise the influence on Indian or Ghanaianpolicies of their membership of Afro-Asian or pan-African groups. At thesame time, intra-Commonwealth consultation can sometimes influence non-Commonwealth countries in groups of this kind through the commonwealth countries that adhere to them, and Commonwealth Governments might hope inthis way to be able to use us as an effective channel through which their views couldgain a hearing in &quot; European &quot; councils. The effect on the Commonwealth of ourconnexion with the Common Market might be greatly influenced by whether wewere willing and able to play this part.4. Other Commonwealth countries recognise the necessity of someassociation with Europe and, under present circumstances, of intimate militarycollaboration with Western Europe for our security, but they see this as beingdue to our geographical position off Europe; for us to become in effect part ofEurope, even economically, would be regarded by them as a change of traditionalpolicy and a deliberate turning away from the Commonwealth. Their reactionscould no doubt be tempered, were it made apparent to them that failure to join the Common Market would seriously weaken the United Kingdom&apos;s power and position in the rest of the world and its ability to help them. But there would still be fears in Commonwealth countries over the extent to which we should berestricting our freedom of action by joining the Six, and it would be difficult todispel these fears without using arguments that might cause the Six to doubt thewholeheartedness of our association with them.Repercussions of the Economic Effects5. The severity of the political repercussions of the effect on commonwealth trade would obviously depend on the seriousness of the damage done to particularCommonwealth countries. The probable extent of that damage is examined inthe answers to Question No. 16. If we associated ourselves with the Six in a manner that involved doing severe damage to other Commonwealth countries, then theeffect on the Commonwealth connexion would be very serious, and might be to cause its entire disruption. We assume, however, that Ministers would not contemplate a course of action which would do severe damage to other commonwealth countries. We should therefore need to limit the damage done to commonwealth trade, e.g., partly by preserving some Commonwealth free entry;partly by ensuring that &quot; European &quot; agriculture did not pre-empt the UnitedKingdom market and displace imports from Commonwealth countries; partly byreaching some arrangement over tropical products and the Associated overseas territories.The Alternative6. We have said in the answers to Questions 1 and 2 that it is not possible atthis stage to be sure how powerful and effective the European economic community will become, but that if it should in the event become a powerful and effective unit, and we were not associated with it, then our status would decline.This would be the result partly of the increasing political importance of the Six, and partly of a diminution in our relative economic strength. It would be bound.to damage our influence with the Commonwealth, although the process would nodoubt be gradual. We must seek to avoid a position in which we have to make a choice between the Six and the Commonwealth, not least because whichever choicewe made there would be danger of damage resulting to our relations with the
ANNEX ELong Answer to Question No. 18Question// the Commonwealth connexion were substantially weakened, how would this affect our influence in the world ?AnswerAny serious weakening of the Commonwealth resulting from United Kingdomaction could lead to its disintegration, since the association, already under strainover the South African issue, still depends so much on United Kingdom care and initiative.2. The value of the Commonwealth association cannot be judged in precise terms. But our role as founder and still the central pivot of it (including themanagement of sterling which is the main reserve and trading currency for theCommonwealth) is an important buttress of our position as a power with world-wide interests and influence. It goes some way to offset in the political field ourloss of stature in the economic and military fields and our growing dependence forour security on the United States and the Atlantic Alliance. Any substantialweakening of the Commonwealth connexion would therefore seriously damage our prestige and influence.3. Our general political standing and our ability to influence the policies ofthe United States would suffer if the Commonwealth were to fall apart. Inparticular, the Commonwealth connexion is important to us, to the United Statesand to the West as a whole because the anxieties of the free world regarding thefuture concern Asia, the Far East and Africa: it is in these areas that the continuingstruggle against Communism, ideological and economic, will be fiercest. a weakening or disintegration of the Commonwealth would be damaging in these areas (United States alarm was considerable over suggestions in 1957 after Suezthat India might leave the Commonwealth.4. The nature of the Commonwealth, the different interests and objectives of its members and the apparent incompatibility of icertain of its elements oftengive a false impression, e.g., when its members differ on controversial issues in theUnited Kingdom. But the knowledge that it exists and that the Commonwealthmachinery for liaison is constantly at work not only adds to our prestige in the eyes of the rest of the world, but increases the practical influence we can exert.5. Among its members the Commonwealth contains countries that are important in their own right and for their influence with other Powers, e.g., Indiaamong the Asians; Nigeria, we hope, among the Africans; and Canada among a group of important &quot; middle &quot; Powers. Our intimate association with these keycountries enhances our own influence and standing.6. The Commonwealth is also an important instrument through which wecan retain the goodwill and friendship of uncommitted and newly-independent countries. It provides a ground on which the newer non^white members can meet with the &quot; older &quot; white members on terms of equality. In a world in which thestruggle with the Communist Powers will become more and more ideological andeconomic, this is of the greatest importance. For in practice the Commonwealthassociation plays an invaluable part in keeping out of Communist clutches a large part of the world&apos;s more backward populations. Among other things theassociation assures to them the maximum economic assistance that the resourcesof the &quot; older &quot; members permit. This is by no means a one-sided benefit, for by long association and intimate connexions the United Kingdom is most favourablyplaced to benefit from the increased trading possibilities that their economic expansion will offer.Commonwealth. We ought therefore to endeavour to make the Six appreciate the value to them of our relationship with the Commonwealth, and also make theCommonwealth appreciate the value to them of our associating ourselves with the six.
SECRET,29*. *       . . ; Annexe.Long Answer to Question No. 21QuestionHow important is it to maintain our present independence in fixing thelevel of our tariff and our present freedom to decide whether to join neweconomic groupings?AnswerTariffs and Commercial PolicyOutside horticulture, we have to-day limited freedom in practice to raise ourtariffs, since we have bound large areas of it in tariff negotiations with the UnitedStates and others, and are also, in general, prevented by our obligations underthe GATT from increasing preference margins. It has not been our policy to make changes in our m.f.n. tariff except after negotiations or upon application frommakers or users; but we have certain powers of exemption from duty (e.g.,machinery or chemicals not made here); this freedom would disappear at any rateeventually.2. While our freedom to move our tariff is limited, it is open to any industryto ask for changes up or down. The mere holding of an advertised inquiry actsas a safety valve without which pressures on Ministers for other kinds of assistance could increase. In the last three years, 7 out of 21 applications for increases havebeen aocepted, as have 27 out of 33 applications for decreases. The ability toreduce duties on particular minor materials and components has some beneficial effect on industrial efficiency.3. It has since the war been a continuing objective of United kingdom policy to negotiate for reductions in the United States tariff for the benefit ofour exports in return for reductions in our tariff. The United States market takes11 per cent, of our total exports; it takes on average a little over 9 per cent, ofthe exports of the Six. It can be argued that with Europe, moluding ourselves,forming a powerful single market with a common tariff wall, the United states should be stimulated into willingness to reduce its tariffs in return for reductions in the level of the common wall. The question is whether the members of theEuropean group would be able to reach sufficient agreement on the specific items in the common tariff to be reduced to enable such negotiations to get anywhere.The behaviour of the Six in the forthcoming GATT Conference will enable usto judge the possibilities better than we can now.4. The Treaty of Rome envisages that the member States will ultimatelyconstitute a group with a common commercial policy towards the outside world and that they will speak with a single voice in the I.M.F., GATT and othercomparable international organisations. The Commission, subject to qualifiedmajority supervision by the Council, would, for example, negotiate trade agreements with outside countries on behalf of the members as an entity.5. The implications of these obligations would be felt more gradually thanthe implications of adopting the common tariff. Some of the difficult problems are:(a) &quot; Trade &quot; as well as &quot; Aid &quot; for the Under-developed Countries. Wecommitted ourselves at Montreal to a liberal policy towardsmanufactured exports from the under-developed countries of theCommonwealth. In the textiles field, where alone so far this competitionhas made itself significantly felt, we have, by reason of theCommonwealth connexion, been ready to accept a much larger invasion of our domestic market by imports from India and Hong Kong than any other European countries have been willing to contemplate.(b) Japan. A common policy towards Japan would be implied. - At presentdifferent countries in Europe have different attitudes.(c) Sino-Soviet Bloc Trade-in working progressively towards a commoncommercial policy, we would face the risks of pressures, to which weshould have to pay increasing regard, to modify policies we might wish to pursue in own economic or commercial interest to suit the interests ofother members of the group.
(d) Agriculture. A common import policy is implicit in the provisions of theTreaty of: Rome looking towards a single managed market for agriculture. This, m addition to a commdh tariff, could involve acommon policy for the quantitative limitation of imports aimedessentially at limiting imports into the group as a whole to requirements which Could not be met within it. This could mean subordinating&apos; imports from the Commonwealth and other suppliers to the combinedinterests of our own farmers and those of our European partners; or if arrangements could be devised for assuring a place for Commonwealthproducers, the system would operate as a preferential group to the detriment of the United States and other outsiders.(e) Commodity Policy. While recognising that extreme  fluctuations incommodity prices may be damaging and in suitable cases joining inarrangements for minimising them, it has been our policy to favour the existence of free commodity markets. France has repeatedly madeidear that she does not share our attachment to these. There is, as yet,no clear single view within the Six, but we could come under pressure to modify existing policies and this could have implications for our terms of trade.6. As a member or near-member of the Treaty of Rome we could notindependently seek to establish an Atlantic free trade area consisting of ourselves and the United States or Canada (or both). There are no present signs that eitherCanada or the United States are ready to contemplate such a development and ifthe time should come when they were ready, it could be hoped that Europe as awhole might be willing to respond.Social Policies7. There are only two specific provisions of any significance concerning socialpolicies in the Treaty of Rome that members shall.try to maintain the &quot; existingequivalence&quot; of paid holidays and the application (by the end of the first stage,i.e., end-1961 or at the latest 1963) of &quot; the principle of equal remuneration for equal work &quot; as between men and women. Only the second of these gave usserious difficulty in the Free Trade Area negotiations, or might do so again. Ourreal objection was one of principle to interfering with free negotiation between employers and workers in this respect. This has always prevented our ratifying the relevant I.L.O. convention. The Government has introduced equal pay for itsown non-industrial employees, and there are probably not very many workers in private employment who would be affected by the universal adoption of theprinciple. Thus it would probably not involve major economic difficulties for us,though in some particular cases it might have a sharp immediate impact on costs.Essentially the question seems to be a political one, and the noticeably morefavourable attitude of the T.U.C. towards integration with Europe, compared witha few years ago, might make this problem less intractable than it was at the timeof the Free Trade Area negotiations.8. As regards general provisions for harmonisation of social policies, thereare two main questions to explore.(a) Is there likely to be effective pressure generated over the years for theirimplementation?(b) What would be the effects on the United Kingdom if such pressuredeveloped?9. Economic arguments are against the claim that harmonised social policiesare required, either in a common market or, indeed, in other conditions.Governments are always reluctant to consider changing policies, unless they seegood reason for doing so, and in the last resort there is the safeguard of the fairlystringent voting procedure of the Council where decisions would be taken.Moreover, much of the pressure for harmonisation of social charges, and of methodsof financing them, came from the French (where most of the cost of social security benefits falls initially on employers). Now that successive devaluations and firmdomestic policies have put France into a much better competitive position in theCommunity their agitation may be much less.10. However, economic arguments are not the only criterion. Those, bothin the independent Commission and in Member States, who want the thoroughgoing
SECRET31integration of Western Europe, will see a political element in social harmonisationas one aspect of the integration of the area. There is also likely to be general moralpressure for a &quot;levelling up &quot;, particularly of labour standards and conditions, ineffect intensifying the work already done on a broader scale by the InternationalLabour Office. Thus in practice the answer to the first question may turn ratheron the political development of the Community than on the economic merits ofthe case. At present the trend seems to be in the direction of a looser kind ofconfederation rather than a tight integration, and the pressure for socialharmonisation at the moment seems not very strong. But we cannot know if thatwill always be the case.11. If, in the event, effective pressure for harmonisation did develop, the&apos; problems it would raise would be greatest for countries with relatively backwardsocial policies. Workers&apos; living standards and working conditions in the UnitedKingdom are quite good and welfare services are comprehensive, so should probablybe little affected by proposals for &quot; levelling up &quot; conditions. The questions it would raise for the United Kingdom would be mainly about methods of financing and,to a lesser extent, levels of some benefits.12. Our tradition has been to have flat rates of national insurance charges and benefits (the latter related to a subsistence standard) rather than to relate themto earnings as do most European countries, and we finance much more of the costof social services (e.g., family allowances and the health service) from general taxation rather than specific levies. The first is not a rigid rule. The new pension scheme is based on graded additional contributions and pensions according to earnings, within certain limits. If we had to shift nearer to the continental systemof financing there would be an increase in contributions from employers and insuredpersons, and this would make possible a largely offsetting reduction in general taxation. Whether this would have general repercussions on wage and price levelswould depend mainly on how far it would be possible to devise increases and reductions in taxes and charges which would be direct substitutes one for the other in their incidence. Prima facie it would seem possible to go quite a long way to mitigate the impact of changes, though sharper consequences would be likely to persist in particular cases, where conditions differed markedly from the general pattern.Economic Policies13. In brief outline, the Rome Treaty declares that Member States shall consider their economic policies including, explicitly, their policies as regardsexchange rates as matters of common interest and shall co-ordinate their economic policies; lays down some basic objectives of policy; and imposes on Membersobligations about ensuring free movement within the Community of goods, services,labour and money. The Commission is given the duty of making proposals to theCouncil for the carrying out by Members of their obligations and appropriateeconomic policies and for other joint action. It may in some situations, such as,for example, a national balance of payments crisis, advise a Member State directlyon remedies it recommends, and may in some cases prescribe policies to be followed.A consultative Monetary Committee, composed of representatives of member states and of the Commission is established by the Treaty to help co-ordinatemonetary matters and the Members have since set up also an Economic PolicyCommittee. The articles are not always tightly drawn and to some degree their real meaning will depend on the way the Community develops.14. In formulating proposals about capital movements and balance ofpayments matters the Commission is bound to consult the Monetary Committee,on which we should be represented, and all proposals it makes to the council are subject to the latter&apos;s voting procedures. In some cases this would give us a rightof veto. In others, where a qualified majority vote is required, two opponents are needed to defeat a proposal, as the Treaty now stands. These are very considerablesafeguards against possible unacceptable proposals being made by the Commission.15. Moreover, it has been United Kingdom policy since the war to foster thegeneral trend towards reduction of national sovereignty in matters of economic policy. We and other countries have accepted specific limitations on our freedomof actionhy subscribing to the codes and rules of I.M.F. the GATT and O.E.E.C.,believing that this is a price worth paying for securing similar limitations on fellowmembers. Thus for example in trade, quantitative, restrictions on imports are now
generally abjured as a normal instrument of policy. In addition the continuousdiscussions and the techniques of examination and confrontation of various aspectsof economic conditions and policies which have developed in these organisationshave facilitated the creation of an international opinion which can further influencenational policy makers. Harmonisation has developed quite well in O.E.E.C.,where conditions are perhaps more favourable than in larger organisations with more diverse membership, and we see it as the major occupation of the O.E.C.D.16. To the extent therefore that the provisions of the Treaty of Rome merelytake us somewhat further along this road they should give us little cause for concern.However, it must be emphasised that some of the commitments we should have toundertake if we joined the Six are different in kind and might, if the area becomesinward-looking rather than outward-looking, eventually be different in direction.While we should be removing administrative barriers towards the Six, we should be(e.g., for agricultural imports) raising barriers towards the rest of the world.17. Moreover, while our freedom to use most of the traditional weapons of monetary and fiscal policy would remain unimpaired the effectiveness of these weapons and hence our ability to achieve our economic aims might be much reduced. This is partly because of the greater side-effects which might be expectedto appear: e.g., differences in tax policies between countries would become a biggerfactor in determining the location of new plants. But the main reason is that the six have in recent years had rather different attitudes towards the aims of policy e.g., emphasising price-stability more and full employment less than has the UnitedKingdom. As we became less able to insulate ourselves from the effects of theeconomic policies of the Six we should find it more difficult to maintain policies outof step with them; e.g., to reflate before they were prepared to. ,Conclusions18. While it is difficult to assess whether there will be much pressure toharmonise social policies in the Common Market, the fact that the United Kingdomrutdvm^hu- -^Tias a standard of labour conditions^ieia-ti^ to those prevailing in the Six shouldmean that any adjustments we might ultimately be compelled to make would not present serious difficulties. The harmonisation of economic policies presents moreproblems. Even if it does not progress very far at a formal or institutional level,our growing exposure to developments in the economies of the other countries ofthe area is bound to make it progressively more difficult for us to achieve our own policy aims when these differ markedly from those of the Six.ANNEX GLong Answer to Question No. 22QuestionWhat has changed in the situation since Ministers decided on the basis ofa full review in 1956 and again in 1959 against joining the Common Market?answer in November 1955 the Economic Policy Committee agreed (E.P. (55)11th Meeting) that it was &quot; against the interests of the United Kingdom to join a european Common Market&quot;, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer added theimportant qualification &quot; at any rate for some time to come &quot;. Again, in February1959 the Chancellor circulated a paper (C. (59) 27) on the difficulties of joining theEuropean Economic Community, but this was for information only and was not discussed. The question which Ministers are now considering has not been beforethem in the circumstances which now confront us. There have been five mainchanges since 1956:(a) The Treaty of Rome entered into force on 1st January, 1958, and in 1956it was still under negotiation in Brussels. At that time, therefore, ministers were seeking to answer a hypothetical question what the UnitedKingdom&apos;s attitude should be if the Common Market came into
existence. There was a strong feeling in some quarters that the common market would never come off owing to the inability of France to standup to increased competition from the rest of the Six. This feelingnecessarily influenced Ministers&apos; attitude to the problem.All this has changed. We are no longer dealing with a hypotheticalquestion. The Common Market is an established fact and is rapidly increasing in cohesion and economic strength.(b) When the Treaty of Rome was signed, we sought to associate ourselves withthe Common Market by proposing a Free Trade Area in western europe. We thought that the Six would be so keen for us to join themthat we should be able to dictate our own terms. The failure of the free trade Area negotiations proved us wrong. We now realise that wecannot achieve a Free Trade Area on the. sort of terms which weoriginally proposed, and that substantial changes of policy will be needed if we are to secure a reconciliation between the United Kingdomand the Six. We must recognise that we shall have to pay a bigger pricenow than we would have had to pay for the Free Trade Area in .1958.We are facing a new situation and the essential question is whether weshall be able to negotiate sufficient modifications in the Treaty of Romeas not to do serious damage to the Commonwealth relationship and to domestic agriculture (and horticulture).(c) Since 1956 the position of France has been transformed, economically and politically. This is also true of Italy, at least economically. A weakFrance would have meant that the Common Market would never have got very far, and would almost certainly have failed within a few years.A strong France means that the Common Market&apos;s chances of successare greatly improved and this greatly strengthens the case for ourassociating ourselves closely with the dynamic and rapidly expandingmarket in Europe.id) In 1956 the United States was following two contradictory policies inEurope. On the one hand they were supporting the Six&apos;s objective of political integration, largely in order to secure a reconciliationbetween France and Germany. On the other hand they were strongly in favour of multilateral trade in accordance with GATT principles and,in consequence, strongly opposed to the discrimination against their exports which was inherent in the proposals for a Common Market;At that time we believed that the second of these two policies wouldprevail, and that by playing upon American fears of discrimination weshould be able to secure their support against the Six and in favour ofa wider solution through O.E.E.C., which was our chosen instrumentin the European economic field.It is now clear that the United States have decided that Europeanpolitical integration, particularly a solution to the problem of Franceand Germany, is more important to them than a measure of discrimination against United States exports, which is the commercialprice which they are prepared to pay for the major political objective.In other words, the earlier contradiction between United States policieshas been reconciled, but not in the way we expected.As a result, there has been gradual change in relations betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States in the sphere of european economic affairs. The United States are paying increasing attention tothe views of the Six and showing a tendency to side with them, if it comes to the point, against us. We can no longer fall back in the same way on our special relationship with the United States to compensateourselves for the absence of a satisfactory accommodation with the Six.It is by no means clear that the best way of retaining our influence withthe United States would be by staying outside the Six rather than bybecoming a leading member of the Community, with a powerfulinfluence on their policies.(e) In so far as Our previous attitude was influenced by our desire to do nothing, which might prejudice the Commonwealth, this is now matched by theconsideration that the present and prospective success of the Six, bothpolitically and economically, is likely to alter the balance of power in
the world. They may become a bloc comparable in influence with theUnited States and the USSR, and if that happens and if we remainoutside, our relative position in the world is bound to decline, and this in itself would be damaging to our relationship with the commonwealth and to the influence which we can now exert over the uncommittedcountries. On the other hand, in considering whether or not to join the six, we must obviously take into account the terms which we are likelyto get.
APPENDIXEFFECTS ON INDIVIDUAL  COMMONWEALTH  COUNTRIESCanadaExports to the United Kingdom represent about one-sixth of total Canadianexports. Exports to the United Kingdom were  312 millions in 1959, of which 43 millions (14 per cent.) were of &quot; unaffected &quot; items, i.e., the principal productsthat would be unaffected by our joining the Common Market through beingduty-free from all sources in both the United Kingdom and Common Market. Ofthe remainder about half are of food, drink and tobacco (including wheat and othercereals worth  90 millions) and the rest manufactured goods (including chemicals and newsprint). Unless we could retain Commonwealth free entry for agricultural products, much would depend on how European agricultural policies work out. IfEuropean production increased enough to make serious inroads in the UnitedKingdom market the Canadian farmers would suffer considerably, though the factthat their wheat is hard and European soft would be a considerable protection. Ifagricultural free entry were retained the Canadian wheat trade would probably belittle affected (though the loss of preference on flour might have some effect). on some things, e.g., aluminium and newsprint, Canada would gain a new or higherpreference against the United States and other outsiders if free entry were retainedcomplete, but would still suffer greater &quot; European &quot; competition over chemicals and manufactures through the loss of preference. If free entry were ended on non-agricultural items, Canada would suffer substantial damage from &quot; reversepreferences &quot; in favour of the Common Market, including trade in aluminium andnewsprint (assuming in the case of the latter that Scandinavia would be inside theCommon Market).Australia2. Exports to the United Kingdom represent nearly one-third of totalAustralian exports. In 1959 Australian exports to the United Kingdom were 233 millions, of which  70 millions (31 per cent.) were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Ofthe rest,  127 millions (over 80 per cent.) were of food and drink, including  45millions of meat. The crucial question for Australia would be our agriculturalarrangements with Europe (although the Australians have also made much playwith their small but growing concern in exporting manufactures). The Australiansappear to believe that the Six would be prepared to lower their agricultural barriersin return for the end of United Kingdom preferences in Australia, &amp;c. This seemsan unrealistic view. If it is in fact likely that once we were linked with the common market Australian exports of agricultural products (except mutton and lamb andnot, of course, including wool) to the United Kingdom would be in serious danger.If agricultural free entry could after all be retained, the loss of preference againstEurope on beef might become important if European production expanded, butincreased preferences against the Argentine, &amp;c, on some types would be very helpful. If agricultural free entry were not retained, the Australian wheat and meattrades would both be.badly hit: one result would be the abrogation of the 15-yearmeat agreement with Australia, under which we have paid substantial sums to theAustralian meat industry it is due to expire in any case in 1967. Another productwhere serious damage would result if we were unable to preserve our present arrangements for Commonwealth entry is sugar; the Commonwealth sugar agreement is important to Queensland.New Zealand3. Exports to the United Kingdom are over half of total New Zealand exports.In 1959 they amounted to  183 millions, of which  35 millions (19 per cent.) werein &quot; unaffected &quot; items. New.Zealand&apos;s position would be similar to Australia^.Loss of free entry on agricultural products could in the long run do severe damage
to the trade in dairy produce once the &quot; managed market&quot; became established with us (and also, no doubt, Denmark) inside it, and New Zealand outside. NewZealand&apos;s mutton and lamb exports, on the other hand, which amount to some 49 millions a year, would probably be less affected than other agricultural items,although the ideas of the Six in this sector are not yet known. Exports of beefto the United Kingdom, which may again become substantial in a few years&apos; time,would be in the same position as for Australian beef.South Africa4. Exports to the United Kingdom amount to nearly one third of total SouthAfrican exports (excluding gold). In 1959 they were  98 millions, of which  18millions (18 per cent.) were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Here again apart from somemarginal interests in manufactured goods, the main question is the effect on agricultural products.  47 millions are food and drink, including  25 millions of freshfruit and vegetables. If free entry were retained some of this trade might still suffer from the loss of preference against Europe. South Africa would also sufferdamage if the present arrangements for Commonwealth entry of sugar were notcontinued. The loss of free entry would involve substantial damage from loss ofpreference against the United States on canned fruit and against Spain and Portugalon heavy wines.India5. Exports to the United Kingdom account for between one third andone quarter of total Indian exports. In 1959 they were  143 millions of which only  7 millions (5 per cent.) were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Tea is the most importantsingle item:  66 millions in 1959, or nearly one half of the total. The effect ontea of our joining the Common Market would probably not be great unless weimposed the 35 per cent, duty required by the common external tariff and thatduty then led to a fall in consumption. Jute and cotton goods make up another 20 millions (14 per cent.); trade in jute goods would be endangered by common market competition even if free entry were retained, but much more so&apos; if not.For domestic reasons we could probably not take much more cotton textiles thanat present; whether duty-free entry were retained or not. If it were not retained,tariff preference over Japan and China would also go; on the other hand, india would have a stronger case for resisting the prolongation of the present measuresrestricting imports. Indians potential export trade in other manufactures wouldbe likely to be curtailed by loss of free entry. Trade in coffee and other tropicalproduce generally would be hit by preferential competition from the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts.,in so far as their production could expand to fill available markets, if we were after all to agree to give them better treatment here than we gave Commonwealthsuppliers.Pakistan6. Exports to the United Kingdom are about one-fifth of total Pakistanexports. In 1959 they were  26 millions of which  16 millions (62 per cent.) werein &quot; unaffected &quot; items and another  3 millions approximately in tea (see aboveunder India). Pakistan has small interests in a variety of manufactures, some ofwhich might suffer from Common Market competition if free entry were lost;trade in tropical products might also be affected by preferential competition fromthe Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. if we gave them (but not our Commonwealth suppliers) free entry.Ceylon7. Exports to the United Kingdom account for about one-third of Ceylohstotal exports. In .1959 they were  40 millions of which  2 millions (5 per cent.) werein &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Tea ( 32 millions) accounts for another 80 per cent, ofCeylonese exports to the United Kingdom; for the position on tea see under
&quot; India &quot; above. On vegetable oil Ceylon exports to the United Kingdom wouldbe liable to damage from preferential A.O.T. competition, if we gave the Six&apos;sA.O.T.s free entry but not our Commonwealth suppliers.Ghana8. Exports to the United Kingdom account for over one-quarter of totalGhanaian exports (excluding gold). In 1959 they were  23-7 millions of which 1-4 millions (6 per cent.) were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Cocoa is the largest singleitem and would be exposed to severe competition if Commonwealth preferentialentry were ended. If at the same time we were to allow free entry to the six&apos;s A.O.Ts., the Ghanaians would suffer further damage from preferences infavour of the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. against them. Ghanaian exports of tropical timberwould also be threatened. If present arrangements for Commonwealth entry were retained, Ghana would profit from higher preferences against &quot; outsiders &quot; on cocoaif the common tariff remained at its present high level.Malaya9. Malayan exports to the United Kingdom are about one-seventh of totalMalayan exports. In 1959 they were  36 millions, of which  29 millions (80 percent.) were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. Malaya is likely to be the least affected of commonwealth countries by the Common Market itself or by our joining it, herprincipal exports of rubber and tin being unaffected. Exports of vegetable oilswould be exposed to preferential competition from the A.O.Ts. if free entry wereended for Commonwealth suppliers but granted to the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts.Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland10. Exports to the United Kingdom are about one-half of total exports fromthe Federation. In 1959 they were  90 millions, of which  57 millions (63 per cent.)were in &quot; unaffected &quot; items. The main item outside this field is tobacco whichwould be at substantial risk vis-a-vis United States tobacco through loss ofpreference if free entry were ended.Nigeria11. Exports to the United Kingdom represent nearly three-quarters of nigeria&apos;s total exports. They were worth  87 millions in 1959, of which about17 per cent, was of &quot; unaffected &quot; items, 24 per cent, of commodities (mainly oilseeds)on which the loss of United Kingdom preference might cause some damage, while on the remaining 59 per cent, (cocoa, vegetable oils, tropical hardwoods) considerable damage would be suffered by the loss of United Kingdom preference. &quot; Reverse &quot;preferences in favour of the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. would do still more damage if they were granted free entry here and present arrangements for Commonwealth entry wereended. If these arrangements were continued, and the common tariff appliedotherwise, Nigeria would enjoy increased preferences against &quot; outsiders &quot; on cocoaand reduced preferences on vegetable oils and hardwoods. This would create difficulties for her on certain vegetable oils (particularly technical palm oil). Thepresent preferences on oilseeds would still be lost, but these are of doubtful economic value. On balance Nigeria would probably lose a little by the United Kingdomsaccepting the Common Tariff, even subject to present arrangements for commonwealth entry.Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika12. Exports to the United Kingdom represent about a quarter of East Africa&apos;total exports. They were worth about  31 millions in 1959, of which about 5 percent, was of &quot; unaffected &quot; items, 5 per cent, of commodities (mainly oilseeds, sisal)on which the loss of United Kingdom preference might cause some damage, while onthe remaining 90 per cent, (mainly coffee, tea, wattle and pyrethrum extract andcloves) considerable, and in coffee grievous, damage would be suffered by the lossof United Kingdom preferences if the present arrangements for Commonwealthentrv were ended. &quot; Reverse &quot; preferences in favour of the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. would do
still more damage if they were granted free entry here.at the same time. (Coffeeaccounts for one-third of East Africa&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom.) If theretention of present arrangements for Commonwealth entry into the UnitedKingdom were negotiated as a feature of the United Kingdom&apos;s joining the common market and the Common Tariff accepted as it stands, East Africa would enjoyenhanced preferences on coffee, tea, and cloves, the same preference on wattleextract, and a reduced preference on pyrethrum extract, and a loss of preference onoilseeds and sisal. On balance, however, East Africa would gain from such anarrangement.Hong Kong13. Exports to the United Kingdom represent about one-ninth of HongKong&apos;s total exports. They were worth about  33 million in 1959, of which cotton textiles, clothing, footwear and light manufactures represented the bulk. some damage might be caused by the loss of free entry, but Hong Kong manufacturers would have a stronger case for resisting attempts to prolong the present unofficialquantitative restrictions. If quotas for Japanese and Chinese goods were increasedHong Kong might lose trade to those countries if it lost the benefit of the preference.If Commonwealth free entry into the United Kingdom were retained Hong Kongexports would continue to enjoy preferential protection against outsiders via thecommon tariff at roughly the same levels as now, though they would be exposed tocompetition on roughly equal terms from low cost producers among the Six.The West Indies14. Exports to the United Kingdom represent about one-half of the west indies&apos; total exports. In 1959 they were worth about  78 millions. Of this about 27 millions represents Trinidad petrol an &quot; unaffected &quot; item; some  43 millionsrepresents sugar, bananas, citrus, cocoa, coffee, rum and spices, all of which would suffer heavily if the present arrangements for Commonwealth entry were ended.Indeed the effect would be ruinous, especially if &quot; reverse &quot; preferences were createdat the same time for the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. by granting them free entry here. If thepresent arrangements for Commonwealth entry were retained, the West Indieswould enjoy enhanced preferences of varying degree on sugar, bananas, citrus,cocoa and coffee.Fiji and Western Pacific15. Exports to the United Kingdom represent about half the total exportsof these territories. They were worth about  6 millions in 1959, composed of sugar( 3 millions), copra ( 2 millions) and coconut oil ( 1 million). It is doubtfulwhether these territories could easily withstand the loss of the preference on copra,while the effect of the ending of the present arrangements for Commonwealthentry for sugar and coconut oil would be serious for Fiji, and ruinous if at the sametime the Six&apos;s A.O.Ts. were granted free entry here. If present Commonwealtharrangements were retained, Fiji would still find her trade in coconut oil in some danger from European crushers, but her position as regards sugar would be at least as good as it is to-day. The loss of preference on copra would still cause concern toall Pacific territories.Mauritius16. Exports to the United Kingdom represent about three-quarters ofMauritius&apos; total exports. They were worth about  13 millions in 1959, virtually all of it sugar. The effects upon Mauritius would therefore be the same as forother territories who are heavily dependent upon sugar: disastrous if present arrangements for Commonwealth entry under the Commonwealth sugar agreement were not retained; neutral, or even favourable, if it were.
British Borneo17. Exports to the United Kingdom represent one-ninth of these territories&apos;total exports. They were worth about  14 millions in 1959, of which  8 millionsrepresents &quot; unaffected&quot; items (rubber, petroleum). On some  4 millions inhardwoods and pepper some damage might arise from the loss of free entry andpreference. The Borneo territories would in general maintain their present position if Commonwealth free entry were retained, but the effect of either hypothesis upon them is probably less than for any other dependency of the United Kingdom.
