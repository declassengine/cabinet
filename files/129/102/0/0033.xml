Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1960C. (60) 133 Copy No.    58&apos;13th September, 1960CABINETPROBLEMS OF THE NORTH BRITISH LOCOMOTIVE company memorandum by the Minister of transport the Secretary of State for Scotland has submitted a paper (C. (60) 132) on the placing of orders with the North British Locomotive Company.Cabinet Decided that the British Transport Commission should not place Orderswith this Company2. This matter was discussed in the Economic Policy Committee on 13th july and in the Cabinet on 25th July (C.C. (60) 45th Conclusions, Minute 7). Theproblem essentially was whether I should influence the British transport commission against their commercial judgment to place orders with the Company.The Cabinet concluded that the Commission should not be authorised to placethose orders with the North British Locomotive Company. I was invited tomaintain contact with the Commission about some other orders for locomotivesfor which they had invited tenders in the normal way.The Economic Policy Committee Agreed that Government could not Interfere withthe Commission^ Commercial Judgment3. The Commission later informed me that the tenders received from theCompany for these further locomotives were not competitive either in price or asregards delivery dates. The President of the Board of Trade reported accordingly to the Economic Policy Committee on 31st August. The Committee agreed thatthe President of the Board of Trade should inform the Company that theGovernment could not interfere with the Commission^ commercial judgment.The Company must not therefore look to orders from the Commission to keep them going until such time as they might be able to diversify their activities.C. (60) 132 Suggests the Company be Asked to Tender Again at a Lower Price4. The Secretary of State in his paper now suggests that the british transport Commission should be asked to approach the Company to see whetherthey could undertake orders for these locomotives at the price offered by thesuccessful tenderer. The Secretary of State understands the price to be some to 10 per cent, lower than the prices originally submitted by that Company. Injustification he refers to a recent report of an official Working Party on government Contracts and Research in Scotland.The Report of the Working Party on Government Contracts and Research inScotland in Relation to Nationalised Industries is Still Under Consideration5. As regards that report, the present position is that Departments, includingmine, have been asked to consider how far its recommendations should be made applicable to the nationalised industries. This matter is, therefore, sub judice. Inmy view it would in any case be wrong, especially at a time when I am faced withthe problem of encouraging the Commission to act so far as possible as a businessconcern, for me to use any influence with them to place orders which if they were left to the free exercise of their commercial judgment they might not do.57712
Objections to the Proposals of Secretary of State6. I see also the followins objections to the course proposed by the Secretaryof State:(a) I am doubtful about the propriety of stimulating an approach by theCommission to the Company which in effect invites them to tenderagain at a lower price in order to meet a price quoted by a competitor.i&apos;&apos; (b) Even if the North British Locomotive Company were able to reduce their prices in this way, it is not clear from previous discussion of the subjectthat they could meet the delivery date required by the Commission.(c) In an industry which will probably have to contract it is questionable whether it is right to deprive a company which intends to remain inthe business of manufacturing locomotives of orders so as to enableanother company to diversify its activities.My conclusion. For these reasons I do not consider that I should be asked to approach the Commission on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State.E. M.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,13th September, 1960.
