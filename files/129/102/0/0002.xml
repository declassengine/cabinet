(TRIJ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 1025th July, I960CABINETINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AGREEMENT:ARTICLE VIIIMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have considered the attached report by the Economic Steering Committee, which recommends that adecision should now be taken that the United Kingdom should be ready atthe appropriate time in relation to similar moves by other importantcountries to move from the transitional provisions of Article XIV to thepermanent obligations of Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund(I. M. F. ) Agreement.2.        These obligations are in effect:-(i)        Currencies are to be convertible.(ii)        Except for transfers of capital, restrictions on paymentscan only be used with the approval of the I. M. F.(iii)        Except where a currency has formally been declared tobe scarce, there should be no discrimination inrestrictions without the approval of the I. M. F.3. While restrictions on trade do not require the approval of theI.M.F. directly, the Fund advises the Contracting Parties to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G. A. T. T. ) on the balance of paymentsaspects in all cases where a country claims a balance of paymentsjustification for such restrictions.    If therefore at some time in the futurewe should find it necessary to reimpose quantitative restrictions on imports, the I. M. F. would advise the G. A. T. T. on whether we had a balance of payments case for doing so.     This would be so whether wewere still under Article XIV or had already moved to Article VIII.    TheFund would judge the case on its merits.As regards our existing quantitative import restrictions, we havealready reached the stage at which we no longer claim balance of paymentsjustification for those which remain.     Consequently international controlof these restrictions is entirely a matter for the G. A. T. T. , and not for theI. M. F.    A move to Article VIII has therefore no bearing on this situation.4.        In addition, as long as sterling remains convertible, we should find great difficulty in obtaining the approval of the I. M. F. for anydiscrimination in the application of restrictions, apart from the operationof the &quot;scarce currency&apos; clause.    This is true whether we move to article VIII or not.-1-COPY NO.
5.        The report argues that for these reasons a move to Article VIIIwould be no more than a formal recognition of a situation which has alreadybeen reached, and would not impose any further limitation on our freedomof action in future.    It would, moreover, be in our own interest to give this sign of full support for the principles of the I. M. F. , since we should in turn strengthen our claim for support, if necessary, from the Fund;  wewould also be in a stronger position to maintain pressure against therestrictions of other countries.6.        The staff of the I. M. F. are now exploring the attitude of theprincipal countries which have removed substantially all their restrictions to a move to Article VIII.    Germany, Belgium and Holland are known to beready to move, and France and other countries might follow later.    It wouldbe damaging to sterling if we held back when they do so.7.        The Economic Policy Committee have considered these argumentsand agree that the United Kingdom cannot refrain from the move to article VIII if the other principal countries take this step.    Subject to that,we should wish to proceed as slowly as possible.     There would of course have to be further discussion with the Commonwealth before we announcedour willingness to move, and it is possible that some independent commonwealth countries, e.g. Malaya, will wish to follow suit.8.        Ministers were of the opinion that, while the move would not bemore than a formal step, it would underline the need for us and othermembers of the sterling area to manage our internal economies in a way which will avoid putting a strain on sterling.     The Ministerial meeting ofthe Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council in September, I960,will provide an opportunity to have further discussions with commonwealth ministers on this subject.9.        There is one matter on which members of the Economic PolicyCommittee wish to place a rather different emphasis than that in theattached report by officials.    Paragraph 11 of the report argues that ifwe had to introduce new restrictions it is open to question whetherdiscrimination in favour of the sterling area would be a sensible orpractical course.    Ministers felt that our representatives should avoidsaying that we would never resort again to discrimination against the non-sterling area.    While it would be difficult to reintroduce such discrimina-tion because of the position of Canada and our partners in the european free Trade Association, we might nevertheless have to contemplate this in certain circumstances, and we should certainly seek to avoid entering into any commitment which would preclude this.Recommendation10.       Subject to the comments in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 above, theEconomic Policy Committee recommend that the United Kingdom should assume the obligations of Article VIII of the I. M. F. Agreement at an appropriate time in relation to similar moves by other importantcountries.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.5th July, I960.-2-
annex the Move to Article VIII of the International Monetary FundAgreementReport by Economic Steering CommitteeMinisters considered in June, 1959, a Report by Officials onthe move to Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund Agreement.On 1st June, 1959, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told his colleagues that at the Annual Meeting of the I.M.F. in September, 1959, we were likely to be invited to join in the discussion of a programme leading to a move in the course of i960.    When the matter was considered by ministers, they were in agreement in principle on the ultimatenecessity of a move, but they considered that steps towards this end should be taken with such caution as the likely pressures allowed, andno commitments should be entered into.2.    The discussions in the I.M.F. have proceeded as forecast lastyear.    On 1st June,  1960, the Executive Board of the Fund agreed aDecision ( t Appendix 1) on some of the legal and policy problems involved in the move to Article VIII.    The terms of this decision were acceptable to us, and we supported it in the Board.   The decision was made public.    The Managing Director of the I.M.F., Mr. Jacobsson,and his staff are now having informal discussions with those countries who have made sufficient progress in the removal of restrictions tobe in a position to move to Article VIII.   Mr. Jacobsson wishes theposition of each country that wants to move to be considered oy theExecutive Board, which would give specific approval to any remainingrestrictions within the jurisdiction of the Fund.   We do not yet know the definite intentions of any other Government, but the Germans havebeen in a position to move for more than a year and are unlikely to postpone their move beyond August.    Belgium and the Netherlands wouldprobably wish to follow suit.   The position of France is more uncertainand there may be consultations within the European Economic Community.3.    he United Kingdom will hove to decide whether it too will formallyaccept the permanent obligations of the Agreement to which it subscribedon joining the Fund,   For the reasons set out below we consider both that it is in the United Kingdom interest to do so, and that it wouldbe damaging to confidence for the United Kingdom to hold back if germany and other countries made the move.Effect of Article VIIIh.   When the International Monetary Fund was constituted, temporary provisions (Article XIV) wer   made for the transitional period following the war to enable countries to defer for the time being taking onin full the permanent obligations.    The effect of the permanentobligations, which are set out in Article VIII, is 2-(i)    Currencies are to be convertible.(ii)   Except in respect of capital movements, restrictionson payments can only be used with the approval of theFund.    (While restrictions on trade do not require theapproval of the Fund directly, the Fund advises-theG.A.T.T. on the&quot;balance of payments aspects in all caseswhere a contracting party claims balance of paymentsjustification for such restrictions;    this is already thecase under article XIV, and would continue to be sounder Article VIII.)1.
(iii)    Except in a case where a currency has formally been declared to be scarce, there should be no discrimination in restrictions without approval of the Fund, whichwould be very difficult to get.Our existing restrictions5-      In the course of the last twelve months we have made considerable progress towards the elimination of discrimination and the reduction of our remaining restrictions on visible andinvisible imports.    In particular, we have eliminated (apartfrom one or two technical points) any exchange restrictions which would need Fund approval under Article VIII, and we could therefore now make the move without setting a precedent forderogations by others which would be contrary to our interestso6.     A detailed note is attached at Appendix 2 on our remainingquantitative restrictions on imports.    Some of these are of a kind which are explicitly recognised in the GATT as permissible(e.g. restrictions for the purpose of maintaining security,health and morals).    The discriminatory restrictions which wemaintain on imports from Japan and the state trading countries are not regulated by the provisions of the GATT.    The remainder(some of which are discriminatory against the dollar area) are maintained in contravention of the strict provisions of the GATT,and we may be under pressure there to regularise or eliminatethem.   We have already told the Fund and the GATT that we donot claim balance of payments justification for these remainingrestrictions.    Consequently,  international control of these restrictions is entirely a matter for the GATT (even if theyare discriminatory), and not for the Fund.    The move to article VIII in the Fund, therefore, has no direct bearing onthe situation, nor is it likely indirectly to make the positionany more difficult to hold than it is at present.Future effects of the move7e     We must also consider whether this action by us would affect our ability subsequently to impose quantitative restrictions on trade (with which exchange restrictions would also normally be associated) if we were to decide that such a course was unavoidablein the interests of the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments.8o      It should be mentioned here that the wisdom and effectiveness of re-introducing import restrictions as a means of correctingdisequilibrium in the United Kingdom balance of payments is inany event questionable.    The following difficulties would attend such a re-imposition:-(i)    The immediate effect would be a loss of reserves,owing to forestalling purcliases while the machinery was being built up, and to the shock to confidence inthe p^und,(ii)   Unless control was extremely widespread, expenditure would be diverted from controlled to uncontrolleditems.(iii)   Unless control were accompanied by restriction oftotal demand, expenditure diverted from imports would fall on goods which could otherwise have been exported.(iv)    If the restrictions were maintained for any length oftime, we should have to expect retaliation from the2.
countries whose exports we were cutting down.    the reaction of the United States and Continental countries would he severe.    It must &quot;be remembered that many ofour experts are in the nature of luxury goods, whilethe bulk of our imports are food and materials.9.     However, even if in spite of these considerations we diddecide to reimpose restrictions, the fact that we had moved to article VIII would not, for the following reasons, make our action more difficult than it is already:(i)    Exchange restrictionsCountries which have already dismantled theirrestrictions on current payments would require Fund approval for the reimposition of restrictions even if they remainedunder the transitional provisions of Article XIV.   We arealready in this position.    The Fund are not likely to give such approval any more readily because a country has remained under Article XIV after it was ready to move to article VIII.(ii)   Import controlsA. move to Article VIII would not take away our rightunder the GATT to impose quantitative restrictions on imports if we found ourselves in serious balance of payments difficulties.    Irrespective of whether we were underArticle XIV or Article VIII, we would have to satisfy theFund that our balance of payments position at that timejustified the action that we were taking.10.    A move to Article VIII involves acceptance of specificobligations not to discriminate in the application of restric-tions, apart from the operation of the so called scarce currencyclause, on which a separate note is attached at Appendix 3a    Butthe justification for discrimination by the United Kingdomdisappeared in December, 1958, when we made sterling externallyconvertible.    This general principle in relation to convertiblecurrencies has been affirmed by the Fund and the GATT.    As longas sterling remains convertible we should find difficulty injustifying discrimination whether or not we move to Article VIII.11.   In any event, the scope for discrimination in new restric-tions would in practice be extremely limited.    No doubt therewould be a strong political interest in not restricting importsfrom sterling Commonwealth countries.    However,  the post-war policy of discriminating in favour of the rest of the sterling area was based on a general understanding between sterling area countries to discriminate In each ether&apos;s favour and againstimports from hard currency sources.    There is no ground forthinking that such a general agreement to discriminate could be revived.    To reopen the economic division between Canada andthe rest of the Commonwealth without the compelling reasons of dollar shortage would be bitterly resented by Canada.    Moreover we now have to consider the internets of outf partner in tho European Free trade association. Eut to oxetnpt them and not the European Economic OocEunity would increase strains in Europej and it would be hard to explain why weshould exempt Europe without exempting also the UnitedStates and Canada, whem we hope shortly to join in a new. Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Development.    It is not cleartherefore whether discrimination in favour of the sterling area would on any future occasion be a sensible or practical course.However, if it were in our wider interest to discriminate infavour of the sterling area in future, we think that, as the sterling area is a concept to which the I.M F. have now become3o
accustomed, some limited discrimination, might he acceptableinternationally.     But this is not a matter for argument inadvance;    it is something to deal with at the time if thesituation arises.Desirability of a United. Kingdom move12.   We consider that the United Kingdom should be prepared totake part in a concerted move of those countries who are in aposition to assume their Article VIII obligations.     Weconsider both that it is in the general United Kingdom interestto do so, and that it would be damaging to confidence if theUnited Kingdom appeared hesitant or unwilling.13.   We have indicated above that the move would not furtherlimit our freedom of action in regard either to our remainingimport restrictions or to the policies we might adopt in future economic difficulties.      The move to Article VIII gives formaland public recognition to the fact that the post wartransitional period is regarded as terminated by the countriesmaking the move.     This is true in the case of the UnitedKingdom.     It does not imply in any way that we expect infuture to be free of balance of payments difficulties, but itaffirms that if such a situation arose our course of action would be decided upon with full regard to our international obligations and to our need to justify any restrictions imposedto the Fund and to the G.A. T.T.lh.    It is in the broadest interest of the United Kingdom, asa country to whom exports are vital, to achieve and maintainthe maximum freedom of world trade and payments, with stronginternational rules and institutions to support them.     Thishas been the objective of successive Governments over thepast twenty years.     With the support of all parties, theUnited Kingdom took a formative part in creating and joining the I.M.F.  and G.A. T.T.      The consequence of these international commitments was the disappearance of restrictions once balanceof payments justification had ceased.     To refuse now, withoutgood reason, to give formal expression to our achievement bymoving to Article VIII would be damaging to confidence in ourprofessions to support for liberal trade and payments policies.It would harm our relations with the United States and canada and with the I.M.F.  itself, upon which we are heavily dependent for support in time of economic difficulties.And it would weaken our influence in the Fund in maintainingpressures against the restrictions of other countries.15.    Finally, we cannot consider our own course of action without relation to what other countries may do.     We know that the Germans have been in a position to move for morethan a year, though they have postponed this action whilediscussions in the I.M.F. were proceeding.     There is noreason to suppose that they are prepared, to defer a move much longer, and some other countries in Europe are also ready.In the Sterling Area, Malaya at least are anxious to go forward.     For us to hold back while Germany and othercountries made a move, against in particular the background of the balance of payments and reserve strength of Germany,would provoke doubts on the external prospects of the UnitedKingdom and the strength of sterling.4.
Conclusion16o    It is recommended therefore that a decision should now be taken  to &quot;be ready at the appropriate time to assume the obligations of Article VIII.    The precise timing would depend on the inten-tions of other countries, and should be settled in consultationwith the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.We should inform sterling area Governments of our intentions insufficient time for them to have our decision in mind when they take their own decisions.June, 1960.-5-
I.M.P. Executive Board Decision,, 1st June,  1960Article VIII and Article XIVThere has been in recent years a substantial improvement inthe balance of payments and the reserve positions of a number ofFund members which has led to important and widespread moves tothe external convertibility of many currencies.    Most inter-national transactions are now carried on with convertiblecurrencies, and many countries have progressed far with theremoval of restrictions on payments.    In consequence of these developments, it seems likely that a number of members of theFund either have reached or are rearing a position in which theycan consider the feasibility of formally accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and h.    Previous decisions takenby the Fund,  such as those on multiple currency practices,bilateral arrangements, discriminatory restrictions maintained for balance of payments purposes, and payments restrictions for security reasons, indicate the Fund1s attitude on these matters.The present decision has been adopted as an additional guide to members in pursuance of the purposes of the Fund as set forth in Article I of the Articles of Agreement.1.      Article VIII provides in Sections 2 and 3 that members shall not impose or engage in certain measures, namelyrestrictions on the making of payments and transfers for currentinternational transactions, discriminatory currency arrangements,or multiple currency practices, without the approval of the Fund.The guiding principle in ascertaining whether a measure is a restriction on payments and transfers for current internationaltransactions under Article VIII, Section 2,  is whether it involves a direct governmental limitation on the availabilityor use of exchange as such.    Members in doubt as to whether any of their measures do or do not fall under Article VIII may wish to consult the Fund thereon.2.      In accordance with Article XIV, Section 3, members may at any time notify the Fund that they accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and h, and no longer avail themselves of the transitional provisions of Article XIV.    Beforemembers give notice that they are accepting the obligations ofArticle VIII, Sections 2, 3 and h,  it would be desirable that,as far as possible, they eliminate measures which would require theapproval of the Fund, and that they satisfy themselves that theyare not likely to need recourse to such measures in the foreseeable future.    If members, for balance of payments reasons, propose tomaintain or introduce measures which require approval underArticle VIII, the Fund will grant approval only where it is satisfiedthat the measures are necessary and that their use will be temporarywhile the member is seeking to eliminate the need for them.   Asregards measures requiring approval under Article VIII and maintainedor introduced for non-balance of payments reasons, the Fund believes that the use of exchange systems for non-balance of payments reasonsshould be avoided to the greatest possible extent, and is preparedto consider with members the ways and means of achieving the elimination of such measures as soon as possible.    Members havingmeasures needing approval under Article VIII should find it useful to consult with the Fund before. accepting&apos;-&apos;%he obligations..ofArticle&quot;VIII, Sections 2, 3 and ho6,
3.      If members at any time maintain measures which are subject to Sections 2 and 3 of Article VIII, they shall consult with the Fund with respect to the further maintenance of such measures.    Consultations with the Fund under Article VIII are not otherwise required or mandatory.     However, the Fund is able toprovide technical facilities and advice, and to this end, or as a means of exchanging views on monetary and financialdevelopments,  there is great merit in periodic, discussions betweenthe fund and! ts members even though no questions arise involvingaction under Article VIII.    Such discussions would be plannedbetween the Fund and the member, including agreement on place and timing, and would ordinarily take place at intervals of about oneyear.Uo      Fund members which are contracting parties to the GATTand which impose import restrictions for balance of payments reasonswill facilitate the work of the Fund by continuing to sendinformation concerning such restrictions to the Fund.    This willenable the Fund and the member to join in an examination of thebalance of payments situation in order to assist the Fund in itscollaboration with the GATT.    The Fund, by agreement with members which are not contracting parties to the GATT and which imposeimport restrictions for balance of payments reasons, will seek toobtain information relating to such restrictions.7*
APPiSKDIX 2The effect of moving to Article VIII on curdefence in tho G-.A.T.T. of our remainingimport restrictionsOur remaining quantitative restrictions on imports, apartfrom those imposed on imports from Japan ana the Soviet bloc,and those maintained for reasons of public morals, human, plant and. animal health, national security, etc., cover the relatively short   list      of items &quot;below.    These restrictions can no longerhe justified, by reference to our balance of payments and. reservesposition, so&apos; that the Fund no longer has a say in the considera-tion of these restrictions in the G.A.T.T.   A move from ArticleXIV to Article VIII in the fund will not make it any more diffi-cult to hold tho- position in the G.A.T.T.  than it is at present.We are technically in breach of the G.A.T.T. in respect ofthese remaining restrictions, but we hope to reach an accommoda-tion with the affected contracting parties.   We have just made astatement to this effect in the Q.A.T.T., pointing out that thereare programmes for the liberalisation of imports of basket-wareend watches, that we are already in consultation with some of thecountries affected by the other restrictions (e,g. the UnitedStates about citrus products), and that we are- ready to consult with any other countries having a trade interest affected by ourrestrictions.    This statement was well received.List of remaining restrictionsMain crop potatoes ... .....*Jute manufactures        ...    ... ...Watches        0.0    00.    ...    ..o o. .Baskets of cane, willow or wickerCoal, coke and solid fuels .....Apples and pears;    bottle or cannedappleV/holo hams  .00    .0,    .oo    .o. o.o 000Milk and milk products        ... ... . ..-jargo aircraft    ...    ...    ... ... * . *Alcoholic beverages, including gin,beer, wine and rum ..    ... ... ...3 an ana s       .0.    ..0    o.o    00. .o* 00,Bottled or canned fruit      ... ... ...Grapefruit fresh         ...    ... .... ...Grapefruit juice          ...    ... ... ...Orange nuico       .0.    o..    .0. ... ..oPig meat      .0.    0.0    .oo    oo. ... .00Pharmaceutical products      ... ... ...Cigars         00.    ...    ...    o.. ..0 ...Restrictedfrom allareasRestrictedfrom all except thesterlingareaRestrictedfrom the dollar area
APPENDIX 3Scarce. Currency GlausesA separate Article of the I.M.F. Agreement lays clowncertain conditions under which discrimination would he allowed if a currency had been formally declared to bescarce.     The Committee on the Working of the monetary system under the Chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe expressedsome doubt about whether this provision would be workable inpractice, and they suggested that, before making the move to article VIII, the United Kingdom should seek agreement amongI.M.F. members that the Fund&apos;s approval for discriminationshould not be withheld in conditions in which there is apersistent and substantial movement of gold and foreign exchange to a single country or group of countries.2.     We would agree with the Radcliffe Report that if a &amp;saviGU8scarce currency situation were to develop member countries wouldrequire some relief from the nondiscriminatory provisions of theAgreement.    The Scarce Currency Article of the I.M.P. agreement was of course intended to deal with just this situation.   TheUnited States however have always disliked this provision, andwould always try to block its use.    They would certainly not beprepared to commit themselves in advance not to do so.    If there-fore the United Kingdom were to try to get the assurances whichthe Radcliffe Committee suggested, they would almost certainlyfail, and it would be worse to have tried and failed than neverto have tried at all.3.      In view of the greatly improved international co-operation in economic matters today, we hope that the situation which was envisaged when the scarce currency clause was drafted will not beallowed to arise.    If it did, there is little doubt that the restof the world would in fact take steps to protect themselves, what-ever the rules may say, on the basis that&quot;the rules were beingfrustrated by the offending member.   We do not think therefore that it would serve a useful purpose to try to argue this outwith the Americans before the situation arises.4.      In view of the importance of this matter,  the economic secretary to the Treasury made a statement in the House of commons debate on the Radcliffe Report on 25th November,  1959 (House ofCommons Official Report, Columns 692-3).    He said that while theGovernment sympathised with the Committee1s objective, it wouldnot seem practicable to secure in advance hypothetical commit-ments about the implementation of the scarce currency provisions.While expressing the belief that, with the present economic co-operation in monetary matters, the situation envisaged in thescarce currency clause would not come to pass, he pointed out thatif it did - and if it proved impossible to implement the scarce currency provisions - obviously there would be a grave danger ofa breakdown of the whole system of international monetaryco-operation, which is the very purpose of the Fund&apos;s existence.9*CONFIDENTIAL
