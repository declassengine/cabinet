ADVISORY COMMISSIONON THE REVIEW OF THE CONSTITUTIONOF THE FEDERATIONOF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDCornwall House Annexe,Waterloo Bridge Road,London, S.E.I.7th September, 1960.My dear Prime Minister,As Chairman of the Advisory Commission on the Review of theConstitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the establish-ment and terms of reference of which you announced in the House ofCommons on the 21st July, 1959, I now have pleasure in submitting theReport of the Commission.All but two Members have signed the Report, though, in the case ofsome, subject to reservations on certain issues. Their notes of reservationare contained in the Report. Two Members have prepared a Minority report which I also submit.In presenting our Report to you, Sir, and through you to the fiveGovernments concerned, I should like to say how very warmly I appreciateall the hard work and goodwill which my colleagues on the commission have brought to bear upon our task.  I am most grateful to them all.Yours sincerely,Monckton of Brenchley.The Rt. Hon. Harold Macmillan, M. P.
oACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe wish to express our gratitude to all those who have helped us inour work: to the very many witnesses who came forward to give evidence,sometimes in face of considerable difficulties, and even personal risk ; tothe Governments of the Federation, Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland without whose continuous co-operation, more particularly in providing air and road transport and accommodation, we could not possibly have completed our work in the time available; to the Liaison officers who looked after our needs, both intellectual and physical, with greatkindness and efficiency ; to the very many people both official and unofficialwho offered us hospitality and enabled us to widen our experience ofevery aspect of life in the Federation; to the drivers, messengers and other staff from all the Governments concerned who served us so well; and tothe pilots and crews of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force, of the northern rhodesia Government Flight and of Central African Airways, who flewus to the most remote and inaccessible areas of the Federation.We were also most fortunate in our staff. We would like to pay awarm tribute to the registry and accounts staff, typists, personal assistantsand verbatim reporters, from the Commonwealth Relations Office, theColonial Office, the Treasury and other Departments in Whitehall, who accom-panied us throughout our travels and who carried out their work accuratelyand cheerfully in circumstances which they could not always have foreseen ;to Mr. R. N. Dawson of the Foreign Office Conference and Supply Depart-ment, who acted as our Conference Officer and concerted with the Governmentsall our movements and accommodation; to Miss M. M. Swan, our StaffSupervisor, who ran the clerical side of the office and on whom fell theresponsibility of looking after the welfare of the junior staff, sometimesin difficult circumstances ; and to Mr. P. D. 0&apos;Driscoll, our Press Officer,who contributed greatly to our excellent relations with the Press.To our Assistant Secretaries, Mr. J. C. Morgan of the Colonial Office,Mr. D. A. Scott of the Commonwealth Relations Office (both of whom were members of the Committee of Officials referred to in Chapter 1), andMr. F. C. Wisdom of the Department of Justice, Southern Rhodesia, ourgratitude is deep and genuine. With such a large Commission, so muchtravelling over a very wide area, and with so many witnesses, theiradministrative work was heavy indeed ; but to this work, and to the widertask of constantly helping us in our deliberations, they brought a patientskill and tireless zeal for which we all want to express our thanks andadmiration.Finally we should like to put on record our warm appreciation of the outstanding services of our Secretary General, Mr. M. D. Tennant, C.M.G.,of the Ministry of Labour. In the initial preparations, during our tourof the Federation, and in our final deliberations on the Report, he borewith the greatest efficiency and enthusiasm the major burden ofresponsibility.
CHAPTER IINTRODUCTIONReview of the Federal ConstitutionArticle 99 of the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasa-land provides that &quot;not less than seven nor more than nine years from thedate of the coming into force of this Constitution, there shall be convened aconference consisting of delegations from the Federation, from each ofthe three Territories and from the United Kingdom, chosen by their respective governments, for the purpose of reviewing this Constitution &quot;. The federal constitution came into full effect on 23rd October, 1953. In terms of Article99, therefore, the Review Conference must be convened not earlier than23rd October, 1960, and not later than 22nd October, 1962. In a joint declaration made by the United Kingdom and Federal Governments on 27thApril, 1957, however, those Governments announced their intention thatthe Conference should be convened in 1960.Appointments and Terms of Reference of the Commission2. The Prime Minister announced on 21st July, 1959, that, after dis-cussions with the Federal Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom proposed than an advisory commission should be appointed with the following terms of reference:  &quot; In the light of the information provided by the Committee of officials and of any additional information the Commission may require, toadvise the five Governments, in preparation for the 1960 Review, onthe constitutional programme and framework best suited to the achieve-ment of the objects contained in the Constitution of 1953, includingthe Preamble.&quot;Composition3. On 24th November the Prime Minister announced the composition ofthe Commission, with the exception of six of the United Kingdom memberswhose names were announced on 22nd December. The Rev. Fr. HenryChikuse, who was originally nominated from Nyasaland, was compelledto resign for reasons of ill-health before taking up his appointment, and was subsequently replaced by Mr. W. M. Chirwa. The Commission was finallyconstituted as follows :-The Rt. Hon. Viscount Monckton of Brenchley,K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., M.C., Q.C. (Chairman).Sir Donald MacGillivray,G.C.M.G., M.B.E. (Vice-Chairman).

Gondwe, B.E.M.Mr. G. G. S. J. Hadlow, C.B.E., J.P.4. Unfortunately, as a result of ill-health, Lord Shawcross was compelledto resign on 4th June on medical advice. At the request of the PrimeMinister he agreed to make his services available to the Commission for consultation and advice. We have been very glad to take advantage of this offer.Procedure5. We assembled at the Victoria Falls Hotel in Southern Rhodesia on 15thFebruary, 1960, and held our opening meeting the next day, to discuss ourprocedure.   We decided that it would be necessary to spend about three7
months in the Federation before returning to the United Kingdom to completethere the hearing of evidence and to write our report. Of this time,approximately four and a half weeks were spent in Northern Rhodesia, two and a half in Nyasaland, and five in Southern Rhodesia. In order to cover the maximum amount of ground, we decided to divide into three parties forthe purpose of touring each Territory to hear evidence and to study at firsthand the political, economic and social development of the Territory. TheChairman did not attach himself permanently to one party, but moved fromone party to another to enable him to obtain a more general impression ofthe whole Federation. This was found to be most useful in providing liaison between the parties, and at the same time it enabled the Chairman to meet a broad cross-section of the inhabitants of the Territories. In addition, we found it of value to compare notes and exchange impressions whenever wereturned to base. The composition of the parties was changed as we moved from one Territory to another, a procedure which had obvious advantages.Our touring took us to all parts of the Federation, including some of themost remote areas ; this was only made possible by the very extensive useof aircraft. Apart from the flight to and from the Federation, we travelledwell over sixteen thousand miles, of which more than one-third was by air.Full details of the itinerary and of the parties are set out in Appendix I.Evidence6. We heard or received evidence from every section of the public andfrom all communities in the Federation with the exception of civil servants,whose position is referred to in paragraph 8. Political parties of everyopinion, apart from some of the extreme African nationalist parties, appeared before us ; religious leaders, churches and missionary bodies ; representativesof commerce, industry, mining and agriculture ; African chiefs and headmen ;municipal bodies and Native and other local authorities ; European, african and non-racial trade unions ; clergymen and teachers ; scientists and econo-mists ; welfare organisations; and groups and individuals of all races Africans, Asians, Coloureds and Europeans. All these gave evidence orsubmitted written memoranda. We received over a thousand written memo-randa, and many of those who submitted them also gave oral evidence. Thenumber of witnesses or groups of witnesses giving oral evidence was about750. In the tribal areas, some of these groups amounted to several hundredpeople. We shall be submitting this evidence in separate volumes as an appendix to our Report, except where witnesses have asked that their evidence should not be published. There is no question in our minds that many more witnesses would have come forward in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland to give evidence had it not been for the boycott of theCommission organised by the United National Independence Party and the african National Congress Party in Northern Rhodesia, and the MalawiNational Congress in Nyasaland, and the intimidation with which theseboycotts were enforced. The organisations responsible had clearly estab-lished a remarkable degree of control. Frequently in towns and villageswe were met by an array of posters advocating the boycott of the Corn-mission, and in some places in Nyasaland the arrival of the commission was the signal for a complete withdrawal from contact, even by certainmissionary groups. It was clear that intimidation was widespread, and we heard evidence that threats of hut burning and the use of witchcraft were
frequently effective in preventing witnesses from coming forward. On anumber of occasions we were specifically requested to refrain from visitingNative Authorities, schools and even Missions lest our mere presence shouldprovoke disorder.Other Sources of Information7. Apart from taking formal evidence, we made it our business to seefor ourselves as much as possible of the daily lives of the inhabitantsthroughout the Federation ; in all the areas we visited we had private andinformal conversations with individuals of all races and in all walks of life.We had informal talks with members of the Governments, African political leaders and many others who were not able or willing to appear before usto give formal evidence. Interpreters were put freely at our disposal, andwe had every opportunity of meeting anyone who wanted to meet us. Wevisited European and African farms and tea, coffee, cotton and tobaccoestates. In addition to the Kariba and Kyle dams, we visited a number ofindustries, including copper, coal and asbestos mines ; steel works, andtextile, rubber tyre and other factories. We also visited numerous schools,hospitals, training colleges and other educational institutions, including theUniversity College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Relations with the Governments in the Federation8. In accordance with our terms of reference, we had before us tworeports* prepared by a Committee of Officials of the five Governments,under the chairmanship of Mr. B. St. J. Trend, C.B., C.V.O., then a ThirdSecretary in H.M. Treasury. Although the five Governments neither gave evidence to the Commission themselves nor permitted civil servants to volunteer evidence, they agreed that officials, if they were invited to do soby the Commission, could give us factual information on subjects on whichthey were qualified by their office to speak. We decided not to ask officials to give formal evidence. Wherever possible, however, we arranged for appropriate senior officials, both European and African, to hold discussions with the Commission on the understanding that what was said would notbe treated as formal evidence. In order to assist our work, the four governments in the Federation appointed Liaison Officers who had them-selves been members of the Committee of Officials, and who were of thegreatest assitance to us in providing factual material relevant to the evidencereceived. The names of the Liaison Officers, together with a complete listof the staff of the Commission, are contained in Appendix II.Scope of the Evidence9. In hearing witnesses we were guided by the Prime Ministers state-ment in the House of Commons on 24th November, 1959, that he regarded the Commission &quot; as free, in practice, to hear all points of view from whatever quarter&quot;. We thus excluded no evidence on strict grounds ofrelevancy, but left it to a later stage to decide what material we could properly take into consideration in preparing our report.* Survey of Developments since 1953 Appendix VI.i  Possible Constitutional Changes-Appendix VII.
10. We also took into account the statement by the Secretary or Statefor the Colonies on 2nd November, 1959, that the United Kingdom Govern-ment were prepared to publish in full the statements submitted to theCommission or the evidence given before it, subject to the understandingthat those witnesses who did not wish their evidence to be published might ask that it should not be made public. All witnesses who appeared beforeus were heard in private and were invited to say whether they agreed tothe publication of their evidence. Very few asked for it to be withheld.The consent of those who submitted written evidence only has, wherever possible, been similarly obtained. Owing to the large number of witnesseswho decided to give evidence, we found ourselves unable in practice, par-ticularly when we were divided into parities, to take verbatim records ofall the oral evidence received. In cases where it was not possible totake a verbatim record, summary records were prepared by the Secretariat.Immunity of Witnesses11. The Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations, Mr. C. I. M.Alport, said in the House of Commons on 26th January, 1960:&quot; The Government of Southern Rhodesia and the Attorneys Generalof Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have given assurances in thefollowing terms: &apos;No statement made to the Commission, whetherorally or in writing, will be used in evidence in any criminal proceed-ings; this does not apply to statements made by witnesses outside theCommission, even if merely in repetition of oral evidence or re-publication of written evidence given to the Commission.&apos;&quot;The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and the Governor of nyasaland have given assurances to the same effect with regard to themaking of detention and restriction orders and proceedings arising outof such orders.&quot; All these assurances also apply to members of the Commission.&quot;12. In amplification of this statement the Lord Chancellor said in theHouse of Lords on 2nd February, 1960:&quot;My Lords, witnesses appearing before the Commission, whether in the United Kingdom or in any of the three constituent parts of theFederation, will be entitled to rely on the defence of qualified privilegein any action for libel or slander that is to say, they will have a gooddefence in respect of anything said in evidence given honestly andwithout any indirect or improper motive.&quot; So far as newspaper reports are concerned, the defence of qualifiedprivilege will, under Section 7 of the Defamation Act, 1952, be availableto newspapers printed and published in the United Kingdom in respectof reports of evidence given before the Commission while sitting in theUnited Kingdom. The Act of 1952 does not extend to cover the sittings of the Commission outside the United Kingdom, but in this case the newspaper will be protected by the defence of qualified privilege atCommon Law. In Northern Rhodesia, the position is the same as in theUnited Kingdom by virtue of the Northern Rhodesia DefamationOrdinance and the Common Law.  There is no statutory provision in
Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia corresponding to the United KingdomAct of 1952, but the operation of the general law in those territories will afford protection against civil actions for libel or slander equivalent tothat of the defence of qualified privilege at Common Law.&quot; I do not believe there is any risk of criminal proceedings, whether under the law of libel or the emergency legislation in force in thedifferent parts of the Federation, in respect of any fair and accuratenewspaper reports of evidence given before the Commission.&quot;13. As a matter of policy we made it clear that, although it seemed probable that the Governments would decide to publish the evidence received at the same time as our Report, we did not wish to encourage witnesses to publish their own evidence piecemeal. We pointed out that, if they did so,they would not be protected against the normal operation of the law, eventhough their evidence would be regarded as privileged if published as partof the Commission^ Report. We accordingly made it clear to the Press that,although we were very willing to give them any information possible about our movements, including the places we visited and any incidents whichmight be of general interest, we were not prepared to publish full lists of the witnesses heard or to give any indication of the content of evidence received.
CHAPTER 2THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO FEDERATION14. The two Rhodesias and Nyasaland form a land-locked unit boundedby the Union of South Africa and the Bechuanaland Protectorate to thesouth and south-west, by Tanganyika Territory to the north-east, and on theother sides by foreign territory. Within this area of approximately 475,000square miles there are some eight million people. The great majority areAfricans organised into many different tribal units, but there are about297,000 Europeans, most of whom have made their homes there and forma permanent community. There are also some 25,000 Asians and 13,500members of the Coloured community.15. That the three Territories would gain strength and balance by poolingtheir resources through a political association was an idea put forward manyyears ago. In 1938, a Royal Commission under the chairmanship ofLord Bledisloe was appointed &quot; to enquire and report whether any, and if so what, form of closer co-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland is desirable and feasible, with due regardto the interests of all the inhabitants, irrespective of race, of the territories concerned and to the special responsibility of our Government in the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and -Northern Ireland for the interests of theNative inhabitants&quot;.16. In their report*, the Bledisloe Commission examined the alternativesof amalgamating the three Territories or of associating them in some form of federation. They took the view that any attempt to federate three Govern-ments &quot; enjoying such different measures of responsibility and in such differentstages of social and political development&quot; was unlikely to succeed. Intheir view, the wide disparity between the three Territories constituted a funda-mental objection to any scheme of federation. With certain reservations by individual members of the Commission, they concluded that amalgamationwas the ultimate objective, but that certain conditions must be present before a policy of amalgamation could command general confidence and support.In particular, they commented on &quot; the striking unammity, in the northern territories, of the native opposition to amalgamation, based mainly on dislikeof some features of the native policy of Southern Rhodesia, and the anxietyof the Natives in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland lest there should be anychange in the system under which they regard themselves as enjoying the direct protection of [the Crown]&quot;.17. They recommended however that as an immediate measure an inter-Territorial council should be set up with the functions of (1) examining theexisting Government services of the three Territories and bringing about thegreatest possible measure of co-ordination in these services, and (2) surveyingthe economic needs of the whole area, agricultural, industrial and commercial,and framing plans for future development in the light of that survey.* Cmd. 5949.
18. fhe United Kingdom Government accepted the recommendationsof the Bledisloe Commission, and immediately after the war a central african Council was established by the Governments of Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with instructions to co-ordinate policyand action between the three Governments in all matters of common interest.It was not until 1950 that the question of a closer form of political associa-tion was again seriously examined. On 8th November of that year the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. James Griffiths, announced the convening of a Conference of Officials to discuss the possibility offormulating a scheme for the closer association of the three Territories.This conference took place in London during March, 1951, and its report was published in June, 1951*. The Conference of Officials recognised thatAfrican opposition in the Northern Territories was still a serious obstacle to closer association. But they expressed the belief that, in the last resort,the judgment of African opinion would turn on the form which any schemeof closer association might take and on the range of subjects within theresponsibility of a central Government. They did not think that Africans inthe Northern Territories would be prepared to withdraw their oppositionto a scheme of complete amalgamation, but they thought that some other more acceptable form of association could be designed. Provided thiscontained adequate provision for African representation and adequate protection for African interests, and provided the services more intimatelyaffecting the daily life of Africans were outside the scope of a centralGovernment, they thought that Africans might well come to realise thevery substantial advantages to them of closer association. They recommended federal system, and put fonward a scheme for an association of this kind.19. A Ministerial Conference followed at the Victoria Falls in Septem-ber, 1951. It was attended from the United Kingdom by the colonial and Commonwealth Secretaries, by the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia and by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. At this conference, African representatives from the two Northern Territories made it clear that they were unable to accept any scheme in which SouthernRhodesia was closely associated with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Representatives of African interests in Northern Rhodesia explained, how-ever, that Africans would be willing to consider the question of federation on the basis of the Report of the Conference of Officials &quot; after the policyof partnership in Northern Rhodesia had been defined and, as so defined,been put into progressive operation &quot;.20. To meet the apprehensions felt by Africans in the two northern territories that federation might impair their position and prospects, theConference agreed that in any further consideration of proposals for federation &quot;(1) The Protectorate status of the two northern territories would beaccepted and preserved. This therefore excludes any considerationnow or in the future of amalgamation of the three territories unless a majority of the inhabitants of all three territories desire it.(2) Land and land-settlement questions in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland must remain as at present (subject to the iltimate authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the.United Kingdom)* Cmd. 8233.
the responsibility of the territorial Government and Legislaturein each territory and not of any federal authority. The land rightsof the African people in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland must remain secured in accordance with the existing Orders in Councilon the subject.(3) The political advancement of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, both in local and territorial government, must remain as at present (subject to the ultimate authority of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom) the responsibility of theGovernment and Legislature of each territory and not of any federalauthority &quot;..21. In the House of Commons on 21st November, 1951, Mr. OliverLyttelton (now Lord Chandos), the new Secretary of State for the Colonies,stated that while the United Kingdom Government believed that a scheme of federation would be in the best interests of the Africans as well as the otherinhabitants of the Territories, they recognised that African opinion in thetwo Northern Territories had declared itself opposed to the proposals inthe officials&apos; report; hut they trusted that, in the light of the assurancesagreed upon at the Victoria Falls Conference, and of the economic andother advantages of closer association, Africans would be prepared to accept these proposals. The statement stressed the importance which the UnitedKingdom Government attached to the conclusion of the Victoria FallsConference that economic and political partnership between europeans and Africans was the only policy under which federation could be broughtaibout in the conditions of Central Africa, and that any scheme of closer association would have to give full effect to that principle.22. Far from accepting the proposals, the Africans from the twoNorthern Territories subsequently refused to participate in the meetings which were convened in London in April-May, 1952, to prepare a draftFederal Scheme*, and again declined to attend the Conference in london in January, 1953, which drew up the final Scheme. Nevertheless, this conference took the view that &quot; all the inhabitants of the three territories would benefit if an effective central authority could take major economicdecisions in the interests of the whole area &quot;. They considered that &quot; anyloose form of association, such as a league or an organisation similar tothe East Africa High Commission and Central Legislative Assembly, wouldn&apos;t -ot give the central authority sufficient financial and economic power&quot;,and that the solution lay in a federation on the lines set out in the schemethey had prepared. They believed that this offered &quot; the best hope of strengthening that co-operation and partnership between the races and territories by which alone their peoples can attain a full measure of well-being and contentment&quot;.23. The assurances given at Victoria Falls in 1951 were embodied in the preamble to this Federal Scheme. In the Report of the Conferencef one small qualification was made to the third of these assurances:&quot; As regards amendments of the Territorial Constitutions, the existing machinery and the responsibility of Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers, in theUnited Kingdom remain unchanged, but Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers would naturally seek the views of the Federal Government before advisingHer Majesty &quot;._&apos; * Cmd. 8573. f Cmd. 8753.14
Although this qualification did not in the least shift the onus ofresponsibility, some African leaders feel that, in practice, it enables theFederal Government to slow down the rate of political advance in theTerritorial sphere.24. The Federal Scheme became the Constitution of the Federationby the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation Act of 1st August, 1953, whichwas brought into force by Order in Council in September of that year.
CHAPTER 3PRESENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS FEDERATION25. We were working in the Federation from February to May of thisyear and we received a great variety of evidence, both written and oral,much of it critical of the present Federal arrangement. In the two northern territories the evidence given by Africans was mainly opposed to Federa-tion, and that of Europeans mainly favourable to it; in Southern Rhodesia,on the other hand, African evidence was mainly in favour of Federation,while a significant number of Europeans felt that Federation in its present form could not be made to succeed.Views of Africans in the Northern Territories26. In both Northern Territories the African nationalist political parties,whose attitude was one of implacable opposition to Federation, organisedboycotts of the Commission on the grounds that the terms of referencedid not appear to permit the break-up of the Federation to be considered.In Northern Rhodesia this meant that, with one or two exceptions, the officials of those parties would not give evidence. This did not prevent us from knowing their views, which have been frequently expressed in public.It meant, however, that a large number of the Africans who did give evidence were men of moderate opinions. Nevertheless, the great majorityexpressed opposition to Federation. In Nyasaland the boycott had a farwider effect, and the number of Africans willing to give evidence was much smaller. The very thoroughness of the boycott, particularly in theNorthern and Central Provinces, reinforced by widespread intimidationand violence, itself indicated the degree of influence over the African popu-lation which the nationalist organisations had obtained. In spite of theseboycotts, we have no cause to think that the impression we got of african opinion was other than accurate.27. The dislike of Federation among Africans in the two northern territories is widespread, sincere, and of long standing. It is almost patho-logical. It is associated almost everywhere with a picture of SouthernRhodesia as a white man&apos;s country. This attitude, rather surprisingly, is adopted even by Africans who go frequently to Southern Rhodesia towork and enjoy the higher wages and standard of living available to themthere. This paradox was vividly explained in a memorandum submittedto us by Mr. B. G. Paver, lately Chairman of African Newspapers (Pvt.) Ltd.in Salisbury.   We cannot do better than quote his own words:&quot;In their tribal areas in Northern Rhodesia and in Nyasaland, theindividual was an identifiable unit of village life with no need toproduce documentary evidence of his identity, whereas, when he crossed the Zambesi, this became essential. In his tribal life, time was ofno consequence, but in his changed environment of a wage-earningexistence, time assumed a hitherto unknown significance ...   In
tribal life, there was complete freedom of movement, and noindividual ownership of land. In the areas to which he travelled,freedom of movement was impossible. It was restricted by documents of identification and by the, to him, unheard of concept of individualownership of land . . . The untutored tribesman naturally foundthat he could only obtain gainful employment in areas owned byEuropeans. From this he assumed that virtually all productive landsouth of the Zambesi was owned by Europeans, and from this he came to the conclusion that any close association with Southern rhodesia would inevitably lead to an extension of conditions which would deprive him of his land.&quot; These comparisons of two systems, these misconceptions and fearswere perpetuated by being recounted over nearly half a century inhundreds of villages throughout the Northern Territories by tens of thousands of returning migrant labourers. Under the circumstances,the task of the militant African nationalist was a comparatively easyone. He had only to withhold the truth to have his views confirmed by the conclusions arrived at by those who had temporarily assumed the role of migrant labourer.&quot; This is the fundamental origin of opposition to Federation &quot;.28. Although opposition among the politically conscious minority isfounded on logical reasoning, what has been said above shows that amongstthe masses it is based largely on emotion and sentiment. This doesnot make it the less genuine. As in all movements of opposition emotionshave been exploited iby political leaders, and their task has been madeeasier by the existence of widespread ignorance and misunderstanding ofthe nature of federation. Indeed, we often found that no clear distinctionwas seen between federation and amalgamation.29. Evidence received during our tours of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland convinced us that intimidation and violence have been organised on a considerable scale by nationalist parties against their political opponents, and even against those who failed to give their active support,with the general aim of stifling the expression of moderate or pro-Federalopinion. The Commission had evidence of intimidation at first hand. Anumber of witnesses who had expressed their desire to give evidence to uswere deterred from coming forward, and some who had given evidencewere subsequently threatened. One witness was threatened in the street ashe left the building in which we were sitting and returned to ask for protection. The nationalist parties extended their boycott even to socialcontacts with Commissioners, and a member of a municipal African com-mittee who defied this boycott was threatened with murder at his house and place of work, and had to be guarded by the police throughout ourvisit to his Territory. In Nyasaland intimidation had gone far to undermine the authority of the Government and in some places had seriously threatenedthe maintenance of law and order. There is danger of its having the same effect in parts of Northern Rhodesia. Whatever changes may be agreed by the Review Conference, nothing will foe achieved unless intimidation and violence are effectively stamped out.30. However, despite the effect of intimidation on the free expression of opinion, we were left in no doubt that genuine opposition to Federation
on the part of Africans in the Northern Territories has grown more intenseduring the last seven years, and that the expectations that this opposition would decline as the economic advantages of Federation became apparenthave not been realised. It appeared to us that opposition is still mainlyfounded, as it was then, on fear that political association with SouthernRhodesia would bring about the sure, albeit gradual, replacement of pro-tection iby Her Majesty&apos;s Government, leading to eventual self-government,by white domination from Salisbury, the introduction into the northern territories of the native policies of Southern Rhodesia, and the eventualloss of land. The repeated and strong expression by leaders of the federal government of the quite understandable desire for a further advance towards Dominion status has increased African fears that Her Majesty&apos;governments protection will toe withdrawn before self-government in theNorthern Territories has been secured. Many Africans, mainly in the rural areas, who expressed through their Native Authorities the wish to abolishFederation, linked this with a strong desire to retain the protection of theCrown until they were able to govern themselves. In some cases, notably in Barotseland, this desire is strengthened toy a deep loyalty to the person of The Queen. Many Africans also feel that Federation has held backpolitical advancement in the Northern Territories. The three assurances given at the Victoria Falls Conference, subsequently endorsed by her majesty&apos;s Government and written into the Preamble of the Constitution,have not sufficiently allayed African fears on those scores.31. The old grounds of opposition remain. To these, new grounds havebeen added during the last seven years ; and developments, both withinthe Federation and outside it, have lent strength to that opposition. In1953 only five countries in Africa enjoyed the status of an independentnation: the Union of South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia and Libya. no single unit of the British, French or Belgian colonial empires had attainedself-government. Significant progress towards this goal had been made inthe West African colonies, particularly in the Gold Coast, but conditionsin West Africa, which had no settled European population, were thought to have little relevance for the multi-racial countries of the eastern and central portions of the continent. In 1957 the Gold Coast emerged fromits colonial status as the independent state of Ghana, and in so doingstarted a chain reaction among the still dependent states of Africa. TheFrench Empire began to be transformed into a series of independent statesloosely associated with the French community, and in other territories the process of political evolution was so accelerated that the distant objectivebecame an immediate goal. By the end of 1960 the five independent statesof 1953 will have been joined by over twenty others. In particular, the citizens of the Federation will have seen independence come to one of theirneighbour states which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regardedas more experienced politically than the Rhodesias and Nyasaland.32. These events occurring outside the borders of the Federation havehad a powerful effect within. It is inevitable and natural that the prospectof independence, seven years ago unthinkably remote, should now appearto many Africans to be a right from which they should be no longerdebarred; and racial feeling, far from having merged into a sense ofmulti-racial nationhood, has grown sharper and stronger.  It now appears
to many Africans that only the presence of the European community poli-tically entrenched behind the Federal Constitution stands between themand the form of freedom already granted to their fellow Africans in most other parts of the continent. So long as Federation seems to them to blocktheir way to rapid political progress, so long will their hostility to it continueto grow.33. In our travels we were repeatedly told that a major reason for Africandistrust of Federation was the failure of the administrations in northern rhodesia and Nyasaland upon its introduction in 1953 to commend thenew arrangement to Africans who naturally looked to them for guidance.Whatever the reasons, it is true to say that, in general, no very spiritedand determined effort was made when the Federation came to birth to convert the African people and to counter the objections which so manyof them had already formed. But this does not appear to us to have lentany great strength to the opposition to Federation already existing at thattime. More important was the fact that Federation was imposed againstthe will of Africans in the Northern Territories. This criticism was expressed to us again and again by African witnesses, and there is nodoubt that it has been one of the greatest obstacles to the Federation^success. No new arrangement can succeed unless it obtains the supportof African opinion.34. Equally important has been the failure to take any immediate,significant and well-publicised steps to demonstrate the reality of racialpartnership as the basis of Federation. There is no doubt that racial dis-crimination, although it exists in some degree all through the Federation,is felt to be particularly galling in Southern Rhodesia. Sincere efforts havebeen made, especially in the last few years, to remove the colour bar,but it still operates, and presses hardest on those naturally most sensitive toit, namely, members of the emerging professional and middle classes. Itexists in Southern Rhodesia to a degree that causes such offence as to makeassociation with Southern Rhodesia appear insupportable to Africans in theNorthern Territories. The indignities that many of them have suffered onvisits to Southern Rhodesia are very vivid in their minds, and these arefelt most acutely by those who are the leaders of political thought.35. Africans expressed to us bitter disappointment in the operation of federation in practice since it had failed to give expression to the concept of partnership not merely in daily life but in the form of its Constitution.Many Africans were critical of the small number of African seats in theFederal Legislature twelve out of fifty-nine. They raised objections tothe over-centralisation and the quality of the Federal Health Service. they also criticised the fact that European education and, except in Nyasaland,agriculture were Federal subjects while African education and agriculturewere Territorial. They complained that the standard of the services pro-vided for Europeans in these fields was higher than that provided forAfricans ; this gave them the impression that Federation was for the benefitof Europeans only.36. They were critical too of the franchise. Indeed, it appeared to us that any hope that African opinion would, in time, become reconciled to federation in its existing form was seriously jeopardised by the electorallegislation of 1957 and the circumstances of its enactment. The Bill pro-posed to introduce a higher qualitative franchise for the majority of the
seats in the Federal Assembly, and a special roll with lower qualificationsthan had previously been required. It also extended the franchise to british protected persons, that is, generally speaking, to African inhabitants ofthe Northern Territories. Supporters of the Bill claimed that these pro-visions on balance represented a generous concession to Africans. However,the African Affairs Board, which had been described by the British Govern-ment as a reliable safeguard of African constitutional representation, classedthe Bill as unfairly discriminatory and secured its reservation for con-sideration by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, who were constitutionally entitledto accept or reject the advice of the Board. In fact the Bill was approved and in due course passed into law. We express no view as to whether the electoral Act was a wise measure, but we have no doubt that the effectof its passage on politically minded Africans was profound. They con-sidered that the object was to reduce their chance of qualifying for the franchise, and that the method adopted was unfairly discriminatory; andthey interpreted the overruling of the objection raised by the AfricanAffairs Board as showing the British Governments unwillingness to resist pressure from the Federal Government.37. No doubt the African Affairs Board has, even by its very existence,played a considerable part off-stage in helping to keep discriminatory legis-lation off the statute book. Yet, particularly as reconstituted since the lastFederal elections, it is regarded by Africans as an insufficient and unreliablesafeguard.38. In short, the conditions which the Committee of Officials in 1951regarded as necessary if Federation was to have a chance of being acceptedby Africans in the Northern Territories, that is to say, adequate provisionfor African representation, adequate protection of African interests, and theretention by the Territorial Governments of services most intimately affect-ing the daily life of Africans, have not, in the Africans&apos; view, been sufficientlyimplemented.39. Another ground of criticism of Federation in practice lies in the siting of the Federal capital in Southern Rhodesia. This has strengthenedthe belief of Africans in the Northern Territories that Federation meant ruleby white men, and its particular location in Salisbury, alongside the Govern-ment of Southern Rhodesia, has enhanced African fears that the laws and practices of Southern Rhodesia will be imported into Federal policy.40. In one other matter Africans have felt that Federation has beenharmful to their interests. The number of Europeans in both Southern andNorthern Rhodesia has increased greatly in the last few years as a result ofeconomic expansion. Many Africans, while recognising the need for Euro-pean skill and capital to develop the country, fear that the continuation ofEuropean immigration will keep them out of the jobs for which they arenow fitting themselves. They also fear that European immigration will leadto the extension of the Southern Rhodesian land policies to the northern territories.41. In brief, the opposition to Federation which, as we have seen, was strong at the time that Federation was introduced, has gathered furtherstrength by African disappointment in the manner of its operation. Partner-ship, in their view, has been a sham. The constitutional forms have given them a meagre part to play and have not provided sufficient protection for
their interests, and rule from Salisbury is distrusted as too much influenced by European interests and by the native policies of Southern Rhodesia. Theopposition to Federation, in part emotional and blind, has indeed becomeso strong that, however radical might be the changes in form and outlook,the retention of the name &quot; Federation &quot; which has become a hated word andis associated in their minds with a policy of white domination, will causeopposition to linger on.   In our view, it should be changed.Views of Africans in Southern Rhodesia42. Although there was no organised boycott by African political parties in Southern Rhodesia, a significant number of Africans were not prepared togive formal evidence. Nevertheless, we did receive a large amount of formalevidence from Africans, and from this and from informal contacts webelieve that we were able to obtain an accurate impression of their attitudetowards Federation. There is a clear distinction between this attitude andthat of Africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Many Africans in southern Rhodesia, as in the Northern Territories, have little appreciation ofwhat Federation means, but most of them either expressed no opposition to federation or indeed supported it. Africans in Southern Rhodesia whofavour Federation do so partly because they believe that close association with the large African majorities in the Northern Territories, will strengthen their position in relation to the Europeans. In their view the federal government has proved more liberal than the Southern Rhodesia Govern-ment, and they have a clearer appreciation of the economic benefits whichhave come from Federation since so much of the development has takenplace in their Territory. In striking contrast to the position in the northern territories, Africans in Southern Rhodesia want more departments ofgovernment to be made Federal because it appears to them that Federalservices are more liberally financed. Some fear that the break-up of federation would force Southern Rhodesia into closer association withthe Union of South Africa and lead to the introduction of apartheid.43. This does not mean that Africans in Southern Rhodesia are satisfied with things as they are. Like their neighbours in the Northern Territories,many complain that Federation has failed to introduce partnership to the degree they had been led to expect, and they feel that more should be done to implement it at once. We heard, for example, frequent demands that theyshould cease to be treated as a separate section of the community throughthe medium of the Native Affairs Department. They also feel strongly thatAfricans should play a bigger part in public fife. In particular, they wantsubstantial representation in the Southern Rhodesia Legislature where at themoment there are no African members. We welcome the measure recentlypassed by that Legislature increasing the number of seats therein ; this should give Africans a greater chance of being elected as members.Views of Europeans44. In Southern Rhodesia there is a large volume of European opinionhostile to Federation. Many believe it will bring about a too rapid increasein the political power of Africans both in the Federation and in all three territories. The strength of this belief has made it more difficult for bothFederal and Territorial Governments to move faster towards aboUshing racial discrimination, particularly in the political sphere.  Only a relatively small
number actively want to maintain exclusive white domination mdeinnitely.There is an even smaller number who, rather than surrender this domination,might prefer union with South Africa.45. Some Europeans in Southern Rhodesia feel that Federation has causedAfrican unrest and political disturbance in the two Northern Territories to spread to the south. They do not believe that the nationalist movement in southern Rhodesia would have been so active had it not been instigated bynationalists in the Northern Territories. Some go so far as to believe thatFederation in its present form must inevitably cause increasing agitation,civil disturbance and even bloodshed. It is also frequently said that, ifFederation had not been introduced, the self-governing Colony of SouthernRhodesia would long before now have been granted full status as a memberof the Commonwealth. White Southern Rhodesian nationalists, like blacknationalists in the north, believe that Federation has been an obstacle to their constitutional advance.46. Both in Southern and Northern Rhodesia a considerable body ofopinion regards Nyasaland as an economic and political liability to theFederation rather than as an asset, and considers that Nyasaland should nothave been associated with the Federation in the first place. Some go so faras to recommend that Nyasaland should now be allowed unilaterally tosecede and that there should be a new form of economic alliance. There arealso many people in both Southern and Northern Rhodesia who favour a plan to amalgamate or federate the &quot; line of rail&quot; in Northern Rhodesia with southern Rhodesia and to form an economic alliance with the African areasin Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. (The &quot; line of rail&quot;, which includes the Copperfoelt, is a farming, mining and industrial area which has been largely settled and developed along the railway by a substantial european population).47. Most Europeans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland are in favourof Federation, partly because of the opportunities for economic expansionwhich they consider it has created, and partly because they regard federation as providing greater political security for Europeans. Those who opposeFederation do so either because of the strength of African opposition or because they feel that Africans are not being given a fair deal.Views of the Asian and Coloured Communities48. Most of the Asian and Coloured witnesses we heard were in favourof Federation. But they, too, had certain complaints. They said that theywere given no political representation, and that discrimination was exercisedagainst them in regard to wages and appointments in the public services andthe Federal defence forces. Some complained that their health and education services were inadequate, though in Nyasaland and in the Eastern province of Northern Rhodesia appreciation was expressed of both these services.Asians were dissatisfied over the restriction of Asian immigration into theFederation.Summary49. Although the weight of opinion among Europeans in all three terri-tories, and among Africans in Southern Rhodesia, is for Federation tocontinue, the strength of African opposition in the Northern Territories is such that Federation cannot, in our view, be maintained in its present form.
CHAPTER 4ADVANTAGES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OFFEDERATION50. In spite of political opposition to Federation, the writ of the federal government still runs and much material progress has been made in all three Territories during the last seven years. In this Chapter we examinethe main achievements of Federation and attempt to assess what the con-sequences of its dissolution would be.51. The main arguments for Federation are economic. Briefly sum-marised they are these. First, a common market embracing eight millionpotential customers is much more valuable than three separate marketseach embracing less than three million. Second, this larger unit with all its potentialities is very much more credit worthy than each of its constituent parts. Third, the economies of the three countries are complementary.Nyasaland is a source of manpower and has an economy based on agriculture. Northern Rhodesia has an economy based on mining. SouthernRhodesia has the most diversified economy, including mining, agricultureand secondary industries. In this way the three economies make up a balanced whole.The Expansion of the Federal Economy52. Seven years of Federation have seen a remarkable, if perhaps uneven,economic advance. Capital investment is one yardstick of this advance. in five years from 1954 no less than  805 million were invested in theFederation, of which  581 million came from domestic savings and  224million from overseas. To attract investment at the rate of over  160million a year argues a high degree of public confidence in a healthy and expanding economy. Other yardsticks are to be found in the national income which has risen from  303 million in 1954 to  440 million in 1959 ;in the total of wages and salaries which has increased from  141 million to  232 million ; and in the figures of exports which in the six years beforeFederation increased in volume by 56 per cent and in the six years afterby 74 per cent. An outstanding economic achievement is the building ofKariba Dam and the power grid derived from it now supplying electricityto the Copperbelt and the main industrial centres. Without the advantages of central planning and execution, based upon a market capable of atosorb-ing more and more power, it seems unlikely that such an ambitious projectcould have been financed and undertaken.53. The Federal Government has consistently encouraged industrythrough its taxation policy as well as toy protective duties and throughnegotiations overseas. As a result, more Europeans have come in contributingmuch needed skill and organising ability, and many thousands of Africanshave found work at wages very much higher than they could have earned in agriculture or by continuing in a tribal economy which is anyway nolonger able to absorb them all. In 1959 the Federal Government established
MS&apos;an Industrial Development Corporation to supplement the effortf-bf theTerritorial Governments to provide capital for industry through their LoanBoards.54. From the wealth of statistics available, many could be chosen to illustrate the growth of the Federal economy. In the table opposite we givea selection of those which we consider to be particularly significant. Wedraw special attention to the growth in the Gross National Product per head (item 1), the rise in the percentage of Gross Investment financed from domestic savings (item 6), and the fall in the import content of personal consumption (item 11).55. The percentages stated in items 6 and 11 are inconsistent with theview, which we have heard expressed, that the high rate of growth in the gross National Product per head (item 1) has occurred in spite of, andnot because of, Federation. The falling proportion of consumption expendi-ture on imports (item 11) shows that income is being spent more on homeproducts. This generates income within the Federation rather than abroad,and the tariff, credit and hire purchase policies of the Federal Government,which have been designed to achieve this end, have succeeded. At thesame time the rising percentage of gross investment financed from domesticsavings indicates that increased savings have been successfully channelledinto domestic investment through a developing internal capital market andits institutions. This has strengthened the Federation^ capacity to increase and sustain its economic growth and made it less dependent on externalcapital, although this is still needed. The structural changes in the economy which are illustrated by these two sets of figures, and the economic andfinancial policies on which these changes depend, would not have beenpossible without Federation. Our belief that Federation has been to a largedegree responsible for the increasing prosperity of the last seven years isalso borne out by the statistics of African wages (item 2), Gross domestic product per head in Nyasaland (item 3), Gross Investment (item 4), DomesticSavings (item 6) and the Volume of Exports (item 10). Together thesefigures present a picture of a rapidly expanding economy, a steadily risingstandard of living with wider opportunities both for Africans and forEuropeans, and a satisfactory flow of capital into the Federation to developits resources. It appears to us, therefore, that the high hopes with whichFederation was founded have, on the economic side, been fulfilled.Credit Worthiness of the Federation56. The superior credit worthiness of the area is perhaps the greatestbenefit Federation has achieved. The Central Bank (The Bank of rhodesia and Nyasaland) with about  23 million in circulation has successfully regu-lated the currency, operated the loan machinery and dealt with problems offoreign exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank has made possible the growth of the local money market*. The Federal Power Board has received finance for the Kariba power project totalling some  74 million, and is responsible* Before Federation there was one Currency Board and there is now a Central Bank;before Federation three Commercial Banks, now five; no Merchant Banks, now two; noDiscount Houses, now two; no Instalment Credit Finance Houses, now seven; six building societies, now fourteen; seventy-nine Insurance Companies, now one hundred and seven.

for servicing the loans, for allocating power and for plarining extensions to thescheme. Its operations have already created the confidence which will assistthe financing of other power projects. General confidence in the future of thearea and in its soundness as a field for investment has been established and.until recently, fully maintained.The Position of Nyasaland57. Nyasaland is the poorest of the three Territories. In 1959 the gross domestic Product of Nyasaland was  19 a head, of Northern Rhodesia  82and of Southern Rhodesia  89. Without any significant exploitable mineral resources, with long and expensive communications, a peasant populationswollen by continuing immigration from Portuguese Territories, and withrestricted scope for European enterprise (less than 3 per cent of the landis now in European possession) and for the employment which such enterpriseoffers, the economic opportunities open to Africans under present conditionsare few. Between 160,000 and 200,000 Nyasas out of about 750,000 adultmales are at any one moment employed outside Nyasaland, and at one time or another in his life almost every male Nyasa has to seek work outside hisTerritory.58. Nyasaland takes out of the general revenue of the Federal area about 3  million more each year than it puts in. The gap between its needs andits income is likely to widen as demands for social services increase. unless this shortfall could be met from other sources a break-up of the Federation,or a secession by Nyasaland, would clearly plunge the country into a deeperpit of poverty than before and leave it to grapple with an unemployment problem of a frightening size. Whatever efforts might be made by othercountries to fill the gap, dependence on international charity can hardly be asatisfactory substitute for a share in the equity of an expanding economy.59. Nyasaland is not only the weakest partner economically; it is alsothe most vulnerable because of its dependence on the export of manpower.In 1958 some 123,000 Nyasas were employed in Southern Rhodesia and 21,000in Northern Rhodesia. These opportunities for labour are by no meanssecure. In Southern Rhodesia, partly as a result of the Native LandHusbandry Act, many more Africans are seeking work in the towns, andin Northern Rhodesia the application of modern industrial techniques on theCopperbelt is leading to a higher output from a smaller labour force. Thepopulation is rising rapidly in both the Rhodesias and, if Nyasaland were notsecured by membership of the Federation, its people might well find them-selves in the not very distant future excluded from these labour markets.Unless some unforeseen developments took place in Nyasaland itself, the lossof these opportunities would inevitably lead to widespread unemployment and another twist to the screw of poverty. Although nationalist leaders in nyasaland often speak of large untapped mineral resources, extensive sur-veys have failed to substantiate these claims.The Position of Northern Rhodesia60. In recent years efforts have been made to diversify Northern Rhodesia&apos;economy. The numbers in employment other than mining increased from 198,000 in 1952 to 232,000 in 1958. Agricultural output, notably of maize and dairy products, has increased.  The value of mineral production
other than copper reached  7 million in 1958. These and other industriescould be further expanded given time and capital, but could not reach thesame scale as copper on which the economy so largely depends. Copper isa wasting asset and susceptible to violent price fluctuations (since federation the price has fluctuated between  427 and  160 a ton). So long as copperflourishes Northern Rhodesia will need no outside help ; on the contrary,it will no doubt remain the economic mainstay of the Federation. If, how-ever, copper prices were to fall for a considerable period it might find itself in difficulties. In 1958, for example, when the price of copper fell to  160a ton, Northern Rhodesia was cushioned by general Federal revenuessupported by a more buoyant situation in Southern Rhodesia.The Position of Southern Rhodesia61. Southern Rhodesia&apos;s economy is the best balanced of the three.Flue-cured tobacco maintains its predominance but mining, other primary and secondary industries, agriculture and animal husbandry are growing in importance. Forestry is developing, and the effort being made in the Africanareas to change over from subsistence farming to cash crop production on abasis of individual tenure should result in more crops and a better Africanstandard of living.62. The most spectacular development in Southern Rhodesia sinceFederation has been the growth of secondary industries. Taking the federation as a whole, by 1957/58 the annual gross output of manufacturing industries had reached a value of  127 million and gave employment to 116,500 people whose salaries and wages amounted to over  26 million. Of these totalsSouthern Rhodesia&apos;s share was  105 million in the value of gross output and nearly  22 million in salaries and wages. The diversification of light industries,many of which have built up an export trade to South Africa and overseas,the beginnings of heavy industry such as the iron and steel works at Redcliff,the colliery at Wankie, the opening of big assembly plants, the processing oflocal products such as tobacco and cotton all these bear impressive witnessto the vitality and growth of the Federal economy in general and of SouthernRhodesia&apos;s in particular.63. It is hard to believe that all this could have come about without thecommon market provided by the abolition of internal customs barriers in1954, followed by the introduction of a Federal customs tariff and theabandonment of a special customs arrangement with South Africa which had previously favoured the latter&apos;s products. The main concentration of manu-facturing industry in the Federation is around Bulawayo and Salisbury, andif the common market were to be broken up Southern Rhodesia would sufferwith a corresponding severity. Unemployment and a general recessionwould certainly follow.Complementary Economies64. This brief review supports our contention that the economies of thethree Territories supplement each other. The more advanced agricultureand light industries of Southern Rhodesia are balanced by the heavy extraction-tive industry in Northern Rhodesia and vice versa. Coal from Wankie is used to smelt copper in Northern Rhodesia and the railway system
transports both; tea from Nyasaland is drunk in Salisbury ; meavt/ raised in Matabeleland is eaten on the Copperbelt; cotton cloth woven fromGatooma yarn is sold in the shops of Blantyre, Lusaka and Ndola. Thesharp fluctuations in the price of copper already mentioned, which affectnot only revenues but the foreign exchange earnings of the Federation as awhole, are evened out by Southern Rhodesia&apos;s annual output of tobacco,minerals, beef and hides. Thus the economies of the three countries linkedin a federal association are more broadly based than any of them standingalone.The Social Services65. There have been many advances in the social services since 1953in both the Federal and the Territorial fields. Full details are given inPart II of the &quot; Survey of Developments &quot;. It is significant that the federal government was spending on social services in 1953/54 about  8 million per annum and now spends about  15 million per annum. The territorial governments are now spending nearly  6 million per annum as against 3 million per annum in 1953/54. There is one outstanding achievementin the social field which we feel deserves special mention, and that is thefounding, equipping and opening in July, 1957, in Salisbury, of the university college of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The University is non-racial andthere are, at present, about 50 Africans out of a total enrolment of just over200. The proportion of Africans is certain to rise as the secondary schoolsturn out steadily increasing numbers of candidates. The Federal and theTerritorial Governments, private citizens, the municipalities, the BritishSouth Africa Company, the copper companies and the United KingdomGovernment (which made a grant of  1^ million) have all contributed to an institution which has made a splendid start and of which the inhabitants of the Federation have every reason to be proud.Other Functions66. There are other important Federal functions. Defence is one. TheFederation can maintain its independence and protect its peoples far more effectively as a single entity than if it were divided into three separate States.The Federal Government also handles external affairs, represents theFederation abroad, and negotiates trade agreements. There are the direction and financing of scientific research, the organisation of marketing, thegeneration and distribution of electric power, the keeping of statistics andother essential activities. Most of these would cost more and function lesssatisfactorily were they to be run separately by three units instead of byone larger body.Economic Consequences of a Dissolution of Federation67. If the Federation were now to break up, not only would marketscontract and opportunities for employment diminish, but the credit worthi-ness which has made these advances possible would disappear. Each of thethree separate and economically unbalanced countries would have to seekaid on its own. They would have much less to offer than at present in theway of assets and guarantees. It is unlikely that they would attractinvestors on the open market, and probable that they would have to seek
loans from Governments rather than from banks, finance houses and other private sources of credit. In that case they might find their freedomconsiderably fettered by the usual conditions attached to internationalsubsidies or grants in aid.68. Clearly the United Kingdom would incur heavy liabilities throughFederal loans already guaranteed, and an additional moral obligation toprevent an economic collapse. Assistance might also be obtained through such agencies as the Development Loan Fund and the Export-ImportBank, as well as through international agencies such as the World Bank.But these resources would not normally meet deficits on current account,nor could they keep pace with the growing demands of all the under-developed countries in the world. Such forms of aid would certainly belimited in quantity and difficult to negotiate. And there would be no certainty that they would continue at a level which would match the need.69. One of the greatest arguments in favour of the continuance of federation is the fact that it exists, and has existed for the past seven years.During that period the Governments and the peoples have dome things which otherwise would have been done differently, if at all. To abandonall this, which has been built up by seven years&apos; endeavour, would cause the economy of the area to suffer a set back from which it might take years to recover.Political Consequences of a Dissolution of Federation70. We have been able to estimate with reasonable acouracy the economic consequences for the Territories of a dissolution of Federation. In thepolitical field the same degree of precision is not possible. If the Federationbroke up it might be that the pursuit of divergent political or economic policies would cause serious friction between the Territories. Naturally we hope it would not, but we cannot ignore the possibility.71. The main danger, however, is a much more far-reaching one. It was an expressed intention of Federation to build up a partnership betweenthe races. Although it is clear from the criticisms we have heard that muchremains to be done, some progress has already been made. A dissolutionwould gravely prejudice the attainment of this aim. In theory there is noreason why policies (based on racial partnership should not be pursued byall of the Territories individually. Nevertheless, the immediate reaction tothe dissolution of the Federation, both inside and outside the area, wouldbe that a great experiment in race relations had failed. This experiment isbeing watched with close interest throughout the world. If it couldbe made to succeed it could have a profound effect upon developments,not only in the Territories themselves but in the rest of Africa. With the foundation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, there was estab-lished for the first time in Africa south of the Sahara a politicalentity with partnership and co-operation between the races as its avowedaim, in contrast to states in which the government was dominated either by the white or the black community. In the referendum held in SouthernRhodesia in 1953, for the first time in Africa a resident white communityvoted in favour of a political arrangement involving immediate Africanrepresentation in the Federal Parliament, thereby giving Africans an active
and permanent voice in the country&apos;s affairs. As a result of this Qecision,a new entity has been set up in Central Africa which finds itself uneasilypoised, politically as well as geographically, between the conflictingideologies of countries to the north and to the south. To break it up at this crucial moment in the history of Africa would, we believe, amountto an admission that there is no hope of survival for any multi-racialsociety on the African continent and that differences of colour and race areirreconcilable. We cannot agree to such a conclusion. We believe rather that our object should be to preserve the benefits of Federation by recastingthe structure of the present association in a form more acceDtable to itsinhabitants.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AS TO A SOLUTION72. African distrust of Federation, as we have seen, has a long history.Widespread as the Bledisloe Commission found it to he in 1938, thisdistrust was not their only reason for rejecting a federal scheme. they pointed out that in Central Africa many of the elements which normallyform the basis of successful federal associations are lacking. There is no sense of common nationality. Not only does a racial gulf divide whitefrom black, but tribal gulfs divide the Africans into many communitieswhich, until recently, were often at war with each other. No commonlanguage, history, faith or tradition cements together the various races and tribes which make up the population.73. Nor had the Governments of the three Territories reached similarstages of constitutional development. One was a virtually self-governingColony ; the other two, Protectorates still constitutionally subordinate to theGovernment of the United Kingdom. Control of the one was firmly inthe hands of Europeans ; the other two had already started on a differentroad towards African self-government under an accepted colonial policy.Differences of this magnitude are not normally to be found among countrieswhich come together in a constitutional association. It was largely forthese reasons that the Bledisloe Commission decided that federation wouldbe premature.74. When, thirteen years later, the Government of the day reversed thisdecision, they hoped that their proposals to meet African objections, com-bined with the advantages they foresaw in Federation, would cause achange of heart among the Africans of the Northern Territories. Thesehopes, as we have shown in Chapter 3, have not been fulfilled. Now,after seven years of Federation, African distrust has reached an intensityimpossible, in our opinion, to dispel without drastic and fundamental changes both in the structure of the association itself, and in the racialpolicies of Southern Rhodesia.75. We have heard suggestions that, if it were made clear even now that Federation broadly in its present form was an established fact, opposi-tion would melt away and there would be a growing appreciation of itsbenefits. We are convinced that this view is wrong. Ultimately, Federationmust rest on a general willingness to accept it, or it must be preservedby force. To hold the Federation together by force we regard as outof the question. It follows that, if its advantages are to be maintained,prompt and far-reaching reforms are essential to remove the existing sources of opposition and mistrust.76. That the advantages of Federation are great, and ought to be main-tained, we are equally convinced. In the previous chapter we have givenreasons for this view.   A dissolution would bring hardship, poverty and
distress to many, and entail sacrifices for all. Much has been said aboutthe dangers of balkanisation in newly independent African states. It wouldbe a tragedy if this process were to occur in a region under the BritishCrown.77. Several forms of association other than Federation have been sug-gested to us in evidence. We have considered three. First, the schemeknown as the Central African Alliance. This is, supported mainly by a section of European opinion in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. Its essenceis that the &quot; line of rail&quot;, which includes the Copperbelt and most of theEuropean population, should amalgamate with Southern Rhodesia. Thiscombined territory would form an independent, self-governing Dominion.The rest of the present Federation would be divided into a number of whollyAfrican states, at first under the tutelage of the United Kingdom Govern-ment, but eventually self-governing. These African states would be linkedin a loose alliance with the Dominion which, together with the UnitedKingdom Government, would manage common services such as railways,posts and telegraphs, rather on the lines of the East Africa high commission.  The Dominion would pay subventions to the African states.78. Such a plan would satisfy the Europeans of Southern and northern rhodesia, who would attain self-government and &quot;Dominion status&quot;.Barotseland, Nyasaland and other African areas would achieve self-governmentfree of European control. Nevertheless there are grave objections to thisscheme. The proposal to amalgamate the richer parts of Northern Rhodesiawith Southern Rhodesia runs contrary to Her Majesty&apos;s Governments pledgesconcerning the protected status of the inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia.The two and a half million Africans of Southern Rhodesia, and about halfa million Africans in Northern Rhodesia, would continue to live under a european-controlled government. The inhabitants of the African states might come to feel that they were poor relations and their fears of Europeandomination would deepen. There could be no permanent guarantee thatthe Dominion would continue to give the African states financial aid.Finally, the Africans of Northern Rhodesia would oppose tooth and nail anyproposal to detach the Copperbelt in favour of a &quot; European &quot; Dominion. Inspite of its superficial attractions, therefore, we feel bound to reject this solution as politically unacceptable.79. The second proposal put to us in evidence as an alternative to federation was a loose consultative arrangement similar to the Central AfricanCouncil, to which we referred in Chapter 2. This we reject because it doesnot provide a strong central economic authority. We would regard it as aretrograde step at the present time.80. The third suggestion was to bring the Federation to an end, and thenlink the three Territories in a looser association such as the East AfricaHigh Commission. We have considered this carefully. The East Africa high commission has many merits and considerable administrative powers,inluding control of the railways, posts and telegraphs, a customs union,long-range research and other matters. If the Federation had to be dissolved,such a body would certainly be better than no association at all. But it lacksthe central powers necessary to control and regulate the economy, and so to
achieve-tfhe advantages we describe in Chapter 4. We therefore reject it andbase our recommendations on the view that the three Territories can best go forward if they remain linked in a federal association^81. The Federation is too much disHked to survive in its present shape.We have therefore considered what changes can be made to remove the mainobjections to it. In the following chapters we outline our suggestions. Thefirst group of these, to which we were directed by our terms of reference,concerns the Constitution. We recommend a major operation to reduce thefunctions exercised by the central authority, to change the composition of theAssembly, to widen the franchise, to improve the machinery of co-operationbetween the constituent states, and to introduce safeguards against racial discrimination and for the protection of minorities. Our broad aim has been to return to Territorial control those functions of government which directly affect the day to day life of the people, while retaining at the centre sufficientauthority to direct and regulate the economy, and to manage external affairs and defence. We have also aimed at a true partnership between the racesexpressed through the legislature and the franchise. And we have suggested,by means of safeguards entrenched in the Constitution, ways of allaying thevery real and deep-seated fears which each race holds of being dominated bythe other.82. Although our terms of reference relate to constitutional matters, ithas been made clear that our task is to advise on how the Federation can bestgo forward. We do not think this can be achieved by changes in theConstitution alone. We therefore, in the following chapters, recommendother reforms which we believe will help to make a federal associationacceptable to the people. As we have shown in Chapter 3, many Africans inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland look on Federation as a road-block intheir path of constitutional progress. In order to demonstrate that this view is wrong, we recommend, or endorse, immediate -political advances inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. We also make proposals to root out all forms of racial discrimination, to put into practice a true partnership in dailylife, and to promote economic development. Two topics on which we heardmuch evidence were the site of the capital and the re-naming of the Federation,and we deal with these. Finally, we are convinced that no form of federalassociation, however reformed, can succeed so long as many of its peoplesfeel that they are being kept in it against their will and can break out only by force. We therefore recommend that under certain conditions thereshould be an opportunity to withdraw from the association.83. We are well aware that our recommendations will be unpalatable tomany. Some will think they do not go far enough to remove the politicalcauses of opposition to Federation. Others will think they make it toodifficult to maintain those economic benefits we all wish to see preserved.Others, again, will rightly think that the association they entered into in 1953will be so changed by our proposals, if carried out, as to become a differententity. Taken separately, none of the reforms we suggest would suffice to putmatters right. We have endeavoured to frame a new design into which wehave fitted each of our proposals and we urge that our recommendations should be seen and considered as a whole.* For note of reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Katilungu see page 123.33
84. Certain facts are inescapable. The Federation can continue only ifit can enlist the willing support of its ^habitants. The wisdom of Solomonhimself, were we able to command it, would not suffice to make any con-stitution work without the good will of the people. We cannot create thisgood will. Unless both races genuinely wish to make the association succeed,unless they are prepared to understand and to meet each others&apos; point ofview, and unless both sides are ready to make some sacrifices, the new formswill do no better than the old. We can only recommend measures on whichwe believe partnership and mutual confidence can be built. These we set outin the succeeding chapters.
THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE AND FRANCHISE85. The first Federal Assembly, which was constituted in December,1953, consisted of thirty-five members. Of these, three were european members charged with special responsibility for African interests, and six were African members, two being elected from each Territory under special arrangements. The remaining twenty-six members were elected on qualita-tive franchises varying from Territory to Territory; although these seatswere open to all races, owing to the nature of the franchise all twenty-sixcandidates elected were Europeans.86. By the Constitution Amendment Act, 1957, the Federal Assemblywas enlarged to its present size of fifty-nine members. The three european members with special responsibilities for African interests remained ; fourAfrican members, two each from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were&quot; specially elected &quot; by African bodies ; eight African members were elected on a special Federal franchise, of whom four were from Southern rhodesia and two from each of the Northern Territories. Forty-four members were elected on a higher Federal franchise, twenty-four from Southern Rhodesia,fourteen from Northern Rhodesia and six from Nyasaland. Although allthese forty-four seats were open to all races, as in the case of the previousAssembly, owing to the level of the franchise, all candidates elected were,once again, Europeans.87. At the same time, the first Federal franchise was introduced*. Thisprovided for the establishment of a &quot; special roll&quot;, designed to enable moreAfricans to be registered as voters. These voters were, and still are, eligible to vote only for the eight African elected members and for the SouthernRhodesia European member with special responsibilities for african interests. For the forty-four &quot; elected &quot; members only general voters mayvote. Africans on the general roll number under 2,000, although it isestimated that another 3,000 are eligible to register. Other races alreadyregistered on this roll number approximately 90,000. The African vote,therefore, cannot for an indeterminate period exercise any significantinfluence in the election of three-quarters of the Federal Assembly. In the minds of Africans this position is not offset by the constitutional provision that the Assembly shall include twelve African members, in the election of eight of whom African special voters may vote. All this has createdthe feeling that the Federal Parliament is dominated by Europeans.88. If some form of federal association is to continue, we are convincedthat Africans must in the immediate future have a much higher proportion ofthe seats in the Federal Assembly. We agree that the franchise should remain qualitative, but we are not in favour of any system involving a devalued or weighted vote. We are anxious to ensure that Africans with experience and judgment, even if they do not possess education or income* For fuller details, see Survey of Developments since 1953, Chapter 1, paras. 37-42.35
\ I Jqualifications, should be included. The franchise should, thereiure, bebroadened to bring a larger number of such Africans on to the roll, andshould be designed to secure the election of a Federal Assembly representa-tive of the broad mass of both African and European opinion. Two of us*,however, do not fully agree with these recommendations nor do theysubscribe to most of the detailed proposals which follow.Size of the Assembly89. We shall be recommending in a later chapter the return of severalmajor departments of state from the Federal Government to the territorial governments. This will effect a substantial reduction in the duties of theFederal Government, and we were at first inclined to suggest that thereshould be a corresponding reduction in the size of the Federal Assembly.We are impressed, however, with the arguments in favour of keeping theAssembly approximately the same size as at present. In particular, we recognise that Members of Parliament have an important public relationsfunction. By their work in their constituencies they show the people thatthe Federal Assembly is performing an essential task and is generallylooking after their interests. Moreover, Parliament provides an unrivalledtraining ground for politicians ; until a much larger number of Africansare given experience in the Assembly it will be difficult to find suitableAfrican c andidates for appointment as Ministers. Experience in the federal parliament before the Assembly was enlarged suggests that a PrimeMinisters task may be made unnecessarily difficult if the field from which hecan select his Ministers is too restricted. We have therefore come to theconclusion that the Federal Assembly should not be reduced below itspresent size.90. The appointment of a Cabinet is essentially a matter for the PrimeMinister, and we do not wish to make any recommendations which wouldrestrict his freedom of action to make appointments from the most suitablematerial available to him, whether African or European, in such numbersas he may consider necessary. Nevertheless, in making ministerial appoint-ments he must naturally have regard to the racial composition both of hisown party and of the Assembly as a whole. We consider that the corn-position of the Cabinet is thus bound to reflect the multi-racial character ofthe Assembly and to include both African and European Ministers.Composition of the Assembly91. We next considered what principles should govern the proportionof seats as between Africans and Europeans. We have found this a mostintractable problem and have not been able to reach agreement on it. Wehave, however, not been asked to pass judgment or make an award, butto advise the five Governments to whom we report. We feel free, therefore,to set out several courses of action with arguments for and against eachof them.92. We are well aware of the advantages of allowing members of theFederal Assembly to be elected on an entriely non-racial basis, as is now the case for most members. In this way, as the number af Africans on the* For note of reservation by Mr. Woodrow Cross and Mr. Ellman-Brown, see page 124.
voters&apos; roll increases, so the number of African candidates coming forwardcan be expected to grow and, as time goes on, Africans in increasing numbers will be returned on the common roll as members of the federal assembly.93. It is with this idea of a gradual increase in the number of african members until they obtain a majority that some of us* support a proposalfor the sixty seats (see paragraph 106) to be divided into three categories.Twenty members would be elected on a communal roll of Europeans,twenty would be elected on a communal roll of Africans, the qualifications for the franchise in both cases being low. The remaining twenty would be elected on a common roll of both Europeans and Africans on a franchisebased on the principles set out in paragraph 88. No doubt at thebeginning the majority of these members would be European, but thatwould change as more Africans qualified for the vote. It is, however, argued that the members sitting in these unreserved seats would tend to be more moderate in their racial views than would those occupying reserved seats.There is no magic in these particular numbers, and the same principle couldbe applied in a modified form with twenty-five members being chosen by each of the races in communal electorates and ten being the balancingelement chosen on the common roll. Those who support this proposal believethat from this balancing element would come a number of members who,regardless of their race, would give support to the administrationof the day and so provide stability of government in the Federation.94. Against this, there is a smaller number of the Commission whobelieve that the existence of an enormous majority of Africans among thepopulation as a whole calls for immediate recognition in the form of an african majority in Parliament. Anything less, they argue, would leaveFederation unacceptable to the African people and would be likely to leadto increasing racial antagonism.95. While recognising the force of these arguments, the majority of usthink that both proposals are open to objection. The first would prolongfor an undefined period the probability of a European majority in theAssembly. Although it would ultimately lead to an African majority, theprocess of change might be too slow. Time is not on the Federation^ side,and the majority of us feel that to rely on the process of natural evolutionwould result in the early dissolution of the Federation. The second wouldbe quite unacceptable to the European population and would not, in theview of most of us, be conducive to stable or effective government at thisstage.96. The majority of us feel that the only basis for the division of seatswhich is fair to both Europeans and Africans, and the one which has thebest chance of securing acquiescence by a substantial number of people in both the two principal communities is parity between them ; and that the only way of securing this is by reserving an equal number of seats for europeans and Africans. In the present atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, any other basis is likely to leave either the Africans or the Europeans with the feeling that their community is faced with permanent domination by the other.* For note of reservation by Mrs. Huxley, Professor Jack, Mr. McCleland,Mr. Robinson and Mr. Taylor, see page 128.37
97. Acceptance of parity would mean a sacrifice and a gain for each race.The Europeans are asked to sacrifice their existing predominance in return foran assurance that they will not in turn be dominated by the Africans. the africans for their part are asked to sacrifice, in return for a great immediateadvance, the advantages of a parliamentary majority which they might expect to obtain in the not distant future under a broader franchise.98. Criticism of parity is very largely based on the view that it wouldmake impossible the formation of a stable government. Most of us, however,take the contrary view; that parity, by achieving equal partnership betweenthe races represented in the Assembly, is likely to promote co-operation. if that be so, a multi-racial Government enjoying the loyalty of the majority ofthe people of the Federation is more likely to emerge with parity than without it; and in addition its very existence would impel the largest party of eitherrace to seek support among those of the opposite colour.99. With regard to timing, there are some of us who, while supportingparity as an aim, feel that to reduce the European membership in the federal assembly from forty-seven to thirty immediately would be too sudden achange and might itself lead to the dismemberment of the Federation. Theyrecall that at the Nyasaland Constitutional Conference the Colonial secretary said that he would require to be satisfied that the necessary experience in working the new Nyasaland Constitution had been obtained before he would recommend a further advance. They therefore feel that there should be amore gradual approach to parity, and that it would not be wise at this stage to make any definite recommendations as to the timing of its introduction.They recognise, however, that the advance to parity should not be delayedany longer than absolutely necessary in the interests of maintaining a stableGovernment.100. On the other hand, the largest group of Commissioners think thatit is essential for the continuance of the Federation that parity be introducednow. It should, indeed, be the basis of the new Constitution and written into it. This would meet the present African demand for increased representation,and would also secure the future position of the Europeans in Parliament.It would thus provide the certainty and security which a staged advance towards parity could not supply.Method of Election of Members of the Assembly101. We have given considerable thought to the question of how membersof the Assembly should be elected. At first sight, it seemed logical that, ifmembers are to be elected to fill seats reserved on a racial basis, they shouldbe elected on communal rolls. On closer examination, however, we feltthat such a system would be likely to lead to a hardening of the racial feeling in the Federation, and it would be liable to result in the election of more extreme elements of both communities. This could lead sooner or later toa complete breakdown of the working of the Assembly. We therefore prefer the common roll.102. We are very conscious, however, that under a common roll systemsome African seats might be filled on a majority of European votes and thatan increasing number of European members ultimately perhaps all of them would be elected by a majority of African voters. In these circumstances,
electors would tend to choose candidates of the other race according totheir racial policies. In fact, however, racial alignment is not the only element in the problems of government. To avoid the disadvantages inherent in sucha situation, measures would have to be taken to ensure that all member selected were sufficiently representative of their own racial community. Wewere much interested by the method of election proposed in Kenya. We give some particulars of this in Appendix III. An alternative method makes useof the principle of proportional representation, with a single transferable vote, as now praotised in Southern Rhodesia. This is described in the sameAppendix. The basis of both systems is that a candidate must receive asufficient proportion of the votes of his own community at a primary electionon a communal roll before he can stand at the election on the common roll.The main difficulty which arises in the proposed Kenya system cannot beevaded: if the fixed proportion of votes required at the primary election islow the candidate ultimately selected at the common roll election may beinadequately representative of his own race; if it is high, a common rollelection may be virtually replaced, through the back door, by a communalroll election. For example, if candidates are only required to receive not lessthan 25 per cent of the votes at the primary election, and if at the common roll election a great majority of the voters in a constituency should be of theother community, then it might well be that the candidate least representativeof his own community would be elected. The same would apply if nocandidate received the necessary minimum proportion of votes from his owncommunity at the primary election, and all candidates were therefore allowedto stand at the common roll election. There would be a risk of dummycandidates, not expecting to obtain the quota but hoping to prevent othersfrom doing so. Communal primary elections using the single transferable vote might result in only two European parties going to the polls.103. There are other possible inconveniences in any system involvingprimary elections. Until the primaries have been completed no political partycould know how many candidates it would be able to put into the field at thecommon roll elections, and this might in practice prevent a non-racial political party from contesting at a general election a sufficient number of seats in both racial sections to enable them to form a one party government. this could mean a series of coalition governments. The holding of two elections for different purposes and applying different methods might well confusethe electorate, many of whom are not accustomed even to the simplest formof vote. Human nature being what it is, many electors would not regard a primary election as intended solely to eliminate unsuitable candidates, but would treat it as a rehearsal for the main election. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, we feel that primary elections on communal rolls as a preliminary to common roll elections may well provide the best means of ensuring thatcandidates at the common roll elections are sufficiently representative oftheir own racial communities. The exact requirements for such primaryelections need a much more exhaustive examination than we can given them.104. Some of us are doubtful whether, in the event, the governments will find it possible to resolve by agreement the difficulties inherent in asystem of common roll elections in the special circumstances of theFederation. If they fail to agree, the break-up of Federation could easilyfollow.   Rather than that, it would be preferable for the Governments
to declare the common roll as an objective to be achieved when4changedconditions permit, and to consider whether arrangements should be made,as a last resort and as a purely interim measure, to hold elections oncommunal rolls.Delimitation of Electoral Divisions105. In a system of seats reserved on a racial basis, the delimitation of constituencies presents a special problem. Owing to the irregular distributionof Europeans in the Federation, and because the number of European and African seats will not ibe equal in each Territory, it will ibe necessary todelimit electoral divisions separately for each of the two main racial groups.There are two ways of doing this. In one, the whole country would be divided into electoral divisions, each containing an approximately equal number of the race concerned; in the other, the African constituencieswould cover the whole country, but the European constituencies would coveronly those areas in which the majority of the European population live.The latter arrangement would result in the effective disfranchisement ofcertain Europeans living in the outlying districts so far as the election, ofa member of their own race was concerned. It would, however, avoid thesituation whereby, if Barotseland, for example, were included in a european constituency, the number of African voters would so far out-number the Europeans as virtually to destroy the value of reserved seats.A European returned for such an area would be returned largely on an african vote, no matter what system of primary elections were used. Wethink that this problem will have to be examined very carefully otn the spot.Distribution of Seats between Territories106. If the recommendation of the majority of us is accepted that theFederal Assembly should consist of equal numbers of African and european members, and it remains approximately the same size as at present, weall agree that the most suitable size would be sixty voting members and a Speaker. On this basis, thirty of the voting members would beEuropeans and thirty Africans. We further consider that, since the numberof African inhabitants is approximately equal in each of the three Terri-tories, African representation for each Territory should be identical, i.e. each territory should have ten African members. On this basis, most of us have come to the conclusion that, while there is more than one way inwhich the European seats could toe distributed between the three Territories,the one which appears to raise the fewest difficulties is to allot seventeen to southern Rhodesia, ten to Northern Rhodesia (thus securing for that territory parity between Africans and Europeans) and three to Nyasaland.The distribution might, therefore, be as follows : 	Southern Rhodesia	Northern Rhodesia	Nyasaland	TotalAfricans.........	10	10	10	30Europeans        ...      ...	17	10	&apos; 3  .,	30Total      ......	27	20	13	60
Appointment of Speaker107. In order to avoid disturbing the balance between Africans and europeans, we consider that the Speaker should be appointed from outsidethe Federal Assembly. Alternatively, if it were decided for practical reasons to select the Speaker from within the Assembly, he should be required tovacate his parliamentary seat on appointment, thereby causing a bye-election to be held in his constituency. -The Franchise108. As we have said above, we consider that the level of the franchiseshould be determined with the aim of bringing a larger number of Africanson to the voters&apos; roll, and ensuring that the Federal Assembly can fairly be regarded as representative of the broad mass of both African and european opinion. We, as a Commission, are clearly not qualified to settlefinally the details of the franchise to fulfil these requirements, and themajority of us* recommend that a franchise committee or working party should be set up to make detailed recommendations in the light of theactual conditions obtaining throughout the three Territories. The appoint-ment of this committee would be the responsibility of the federal government, but its composition is a matter of great importance which theFederal Review Conference should, in our view, consider. Most of thismajority feel that it would be useful to give the franchise committee some additional points of guidance. These are as follows : (a) that the present Federal franchise, including the special roll, is quite inadequate to ensure that the Federal Assembly can fairly beregarded as representative of the broad mass of African opinion ;(b) that qualifications for a new franchise, considerably broader thanthe existing general roll, should be worked out having regard tothe following considerations : (i) that any franchise narrower than the present special rollwould disqualify some existing voters, and would preventsome persons at present qualified to register as voters from doing so ;(ii) that members of the Legislative Assembly should have a real measure of support from their own community ;(iii) the desirability of bringing on to the voters&apos; roll those who,even though not literate, yet by virtue of age, position or experience hold a position of standing in their own society ;(iv) that in this connexion account should be taken on the onehand of the level of the present Federal special rollqualifications, and on the other of the proposed lower rollqualifications for Nyasaland agreed at the recent NyasalandConstitutional Conference f.109. We consider that, in addition to the qualifications to be determinedby the franchise committee, the following basic qualifications for the voteshould be required : (a) citizenship of Rhodesia and Nyasaland or being a British protectedperson by virtue of connexion with Northern Rhodesia orNyasaland;_* For note of reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Woodrow Cross, Mr. Ellman-Brown,Professor Jack, Mr. McCleland, Mr. Robinson, Sir Victor Robinson and Mr. Taylor,see page 130.t Cmnd. 1132.
(b) age 21 years or over ;(c) possession of the requisite residential qualifications ;(d) being not otherwise disqualified under the appropriate Electoral Act.A basic literacy test is not compatible with our recommendation in para-graph 108 (b) (iii) above, and we consider that persons otherwise qualifiedshould if necessary be allowed assistance in filling in the registration form.110. We have considered whether the Territorial franchise should be usedfor the election of members of the Federal Assembly. It should be borne in mind that the more voters on the Territorial rolls who are disqualified from voting in Federal elections, the more difficult it will be to obtainthe support of Africans for Federation. We repeatedly heard the argument that Federation was for the European and not for the African; any sug-gestion that the Federal roll is primarily reserved for Europeans could beexpected to reinforce African suspicions of Federation. We have come tothe conclusion that we should not tie the hands of the franchise committee by making any specific recommendation on this, but we do recommendthat the franchise committee should consider whether the Federal franchisequalifications might not vary from Territory to Territory having regardto the differing conditions obtaining.Representation of Minority Groups111. We have considered carefully whether the two minority groups,the Asian and Coloured communities, should be given special representation in the Federal Assembly. Strictly in terms of numbers*, neither of thetwo groups would qualify to elect one member in an Assembly of thepresent size. With regard to the Asian community, however, it will be clear that under a system whereby all seats are reserved for Africans orEuropeans no Asian could stand as a candidate and indeed the Asianswould have little or no chance of making their voice heard. Most of ustherefore recommend that they should be represented in the Assembly byone member who could speak but not vote. We believe that, since in theunlikely event of an even division of view between the two major racessuch a representative could not upset the voting balance, this arrangement should prove acceptable. The Asian member could be selected either byelection on a communal roll or by some system of nomination, but wethink that it should be left to the franchise committee to recommend the precise method to be used.112. As regards the Coloured community, we do not think that theyshould have separate representation. We recommend that it should be made possible for individuals to decide for themselves whether they wish to beregarded as Africans or Europeans for the purpose of standing for election to the Federal Assembly and, in the event of a system of communal rollsbeing adopted, for the purpose of registering as voters.* The latest figures show that there are about 25,000 Asians and 13,500 Coloureds outof a total population of some 8,100,000 of all races.
THE TERRITORIAL CONSTITUTIONS113. The fear that Federation will stand in the way of political progress is, as we have shown in Chapter 3, one of the main reasons for the dislikein which it is held in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The firm promise of immediate and substantial constitutional advance given at the Constitu-tional Conference held in London from 25th July to 4th August this year should have gone far to dispel that fear in Nyasaland. The Report of that conference* stated in paragraph 17 that &quot;if the Advisory Commissionon the Review of the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasa-land (the Monckton Commission) should make any recommendations rele-vant to the matters covered by the conclusions of the Conference, theGovernor should consult, as necessary, those represented at the Conference,with a view to reporting back to the Secretary of State.&quot; This statementclearly leaves us free to make recommendations, even though they might cause Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reconvene the Conference. The majorityof the Commission have, however, no reason or desire to make any such recommendations. They have noted with great satisfaction the unanimous agreement reached. This is the first time that any conference of this nature, including representatives of all races and of widely different points of view in Central Africa, has so agreed.114. The advances now to follow in Nyasaland, particularly the adoptionof the lower level franchise, will make a comparable advance essential inNorthern Rhodesia in the near future. It would now help greatly to dispelthe fear in Northern Rhodesia that Federation is impeding political progressin that Territory if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were publicly to recognisethis need as soon as possible, and declare that further constitutional advance towards full self-government will be made there in the near future. Werecommend that such a declaration be made, and that a conference, similarto that held on the Nyasaland Constitution, and similarly representativeof all the main political and racial groups in Northern Rhodesia, shouldbe held without delay to work out the nature and timing of the necessary changes. Most of us do not wish to make any precise suggestionsf whichmight embarrass these negotiations, but are content to recommend that thereshould be an African majority in the Legislature and an unofficial majority in the Executive Council so constituted as to reflect the composition ofthe Legislature. Some of us feel that the time has not yet come for an african majority in the Legislature. Others feel that there should bean African majority in the Executive Council as well as in the Legislature.In the negotiations, the parties concerned will no doubt pay attention both to the agreements reached at the Conference on the Nyasaland Constitution,and to the recommendations which we ourselves are making as to theFederal Constitution.* Cmnd. 1132.t For note of reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Katilungu, see page 131.
115. Our recommendations in Chapter 12 on the subject of Safeguardswill affect the Constitutions of the Territories. Paragraph 12 of the Nyasa-land Conference Report states that a Bill of Rights is not appropriate tothis stage of constitutional advance in Nyasaland. We are, however, recom-mending &apos;that a Bill of Rights should be included in the Territorial, aswell as in the Federal, Constitutions. If this is agreed, we do no thinkthat any exception should be made for Nyasaland. We are also recom-mending the setting up of Councils of State both for the Federation andfor each Territory, and the inclusion of Nyasaland is essential to the efficient working of the general system of safeguards which we propose forthe Federation and Territories as a whole.116. Finally, we have considered whether we should make any recom-mendations about constitutional advance in Southern Rhodesia. Negotia-tions on this question are in progress between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Government of Southern Rhodesia, and we do not wish to makeany comment other than to draw attention to the recommendation we makein Chapter 12 that a Bill of Rights and a Council of State should be intro-duced into the Southern Rhodesia Constitution. We have commentedin paragraph 43 on the composition of the Southern Rhodesia Parliament.Tribal Authorities117. The tribal authorities in the Northern Territories continue to exer-cise an impressive influence and represent an important body of ruralopinion. We have considered whether they should have special repre-sentation in the Legislatures. If this special representation was regardedas an alternative to a lowering of the franchise qualifications, we would prefer to have the franchise lowered. But if the franchise is not loweredsufficiently to bring a reasonable number on to the voters&apos; roll in anyparticular areas, we think consideration should be given to reserving specialseats for the tribal authorities in those areas, or to electing persons under some system of electoral colleges formed by the tribal authorities.118. During our tour of the Territories we met many Chiefs and wefrequently learnt from them of their very strong desire to remain underthe protection of the Crown. In parts of the Northern Territories theChiefs feared that, as a result of Federation, their powers might be reducedto those of the Chiefs in Southern Rhodesia, particularly in respect of theirjudicial functions. It is unfortunate that there should be such anxieties.Everything possible should be done to dispel them and to obtain widerrecognition of the fact that the Territorial Governments alone are respon-sible for determining the powers and position of the Chiefs.119. Paragraph 16 of the Report of the Nyasaland Constitutional Comference states that:&quot;The Conference recognised that the traditional political institu-tions in Nyasaland must be harmoniously reconciled with the develop-ment of parliamentary government at the centre, so that moderndemocratic government can be established in an orderly manner. TheConference reaffirmed that in this process the Chiefs would have animportant and time honoured role to play.&quot;
We support this view which we consider applies also to Northern Rhodesia.It is important, therefore, that nothing should be done which is likelyto diminish the traditional respect in which Chiefs are usually held bytheir communities. In the Northern Territories the Chiefs are inevitablylosing some of their former authority as a result of constitutional advancesbased on democratic practices. But in the eyes of their people their statusis being lowered mainly by the activities of those who are using intimidate-tion as a weapon. We recognise that intimidation is an intractable problem to deal with, but all possible steps should be taken to stamp it out, notonly if the traditional status of the Chiefs is to be fully maintained, aswe think it should, but if democratic practices are to work, and law andorder is to be maintained.120. In Southern Rhodesia we understand that it is part of Govern-ment policy to increase the prestige, influence and authority of the Chiefsin their tribal areas.   We endorse this policy.Barotseland121. The special position of Barotseland rests on the Lewanika Con-cession (or Treaty) of 1900, to which the Paramount Chief, his Kuta and people continually refer as the basis of their special rights. It was pro-posed in 1907 that Barotseland should be established as a &quot;Native Pro-tectorate &quot; separated from the authority of the British South Africa Com-pany and administered directly under the Imperial Government. this plan was rejected on political and financial grounds, but the ParamountChief was assured at the time that the Company was only the King&apos;sinstrument in administering the Order in Council relating to the status of both Northern Rhodesia and Barotseland. In 1938 the Bledisloe Reportstated that &quot; the status of Barotseland differs from the rest of the territory by virtue of the Concession (or Treaty) of 1900&quot;. It fully recognised the Concession as the basis of the Crown&apos;s position, and endorsed the viewthat the Crown is obliged to respect the terms of the Concession. In 1947,1948 and 1949, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies gave assuranceson behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that no constitutional changesaffecting Barotseland would be made without full consultation with, andthe prior consent of, the Paramount Chief. The special position of Barotse-land, with particular reference to the protection of land rights, is defined in Section 41 of the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council, and also inArticle 33 (2) of the Federal Constitution. As recently as 1958, the thenSecretary of State for the Colonies wrote to the Paramount Chief making it clear that the treaties and agreements between Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Paramount Chiefs of the Barotse would stand until the paramount Chief and the Barotseland Native Government themselvesasked for them to be broken or modified.122. For the past sixty years the desire of the Barotse people to remainsecurely under the direct protection of the British Crown without theinterpolation of any intermediaries has been clear and consistent. in giving evidence before the Commission, the Paramount Chief and repre-sentatives of the Barotseland National Council repeated this demand, and expressed their anxiety lest the attainment of independence by the Federa-tion would cut off Barotseland from the Crown.   There was evidence
of strong public opinion in Barotseland in favour of maintaining close and direct connexion with the Crown. Having regard therefore to thespecial position of Barotseland as set out in the Federal Constitutionitself, and the repeated assurances given to successive Paramount Chiefsand the Barotse people by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, it is clear that,before any decisions are reached which may affect the constitutional status of Barotseland, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will consult with the ParamountChief. The future status of Barotseland, and its relationship with theGovernments of the United Kingdom, the Federation and northern rhodesia, are matters which require further examination and negotiation between the Paramount Chief and these Governments. There would be advantage if the result of this negotiation were to be set out in some freshtreaty or instrument.
CHAPTER 8ALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONS BETWEENGOVERNMENTSIntroduction123. In any federation the relations between the centre and the con-stituent territories depend largely on the manner in which the functions ofgovernment are allocated between them. As one essential means of gaininggeneral acceptance of the Federation, we are recommending a number of changes in the allocation of functions between the Federal and territorial governments. Taken together, these will transfer to the Territories anumber of important functions and leave the central Government in controlof external affairs, defence and the regulation of the economy. We examineeach function separately, and give reasons for the various changes werecommend.124. Part A of this chapter deals with principles and certain general con-siderations ; Part B with proposals for major changes in the allocation of functions ; Part C with other proposed changes. Powers of taxation andfiscal arrangements are dealt with in Chapter 9. Appendix IV sets out theproposed re-allocation in full.A. Principles and General Considerations125. There are several important considerations which support the changes in the allocation of functions which we propose below. The 1951Conference on Closer Association suggested that &quot; those services which havea specially close relation to the day to day life and work of the Africanpeoples should remain the responsibility of the Territorial Governments.&quot;We believe this to be a wise principle of allocation ; and it has helped usto reach the conclusion that the Territories should play a larger part inthe life of the Federation. But we also heard much evidence in favour ofa less racial approach to the problem of the division of powers. We agreethat the ideal of the partnership of races should not be contradicted bythe allocation of functions on a racial basis ; and we recommend that when a subject has a specially close relation to the day to day life and work ofthe people, its control, for all races in the community, should be trans-ferred to the Territorial Governments. Finally, we have already mentioned the strength of the opposition to Federation, and have expressed our con-viction that, if the Federal association is to survive, radical reforms arenecessary. For all these reasons, we conclude that there should be a sub-stantial transfer of functions from the Federal to the territorial governments.126. At the same time, as indicated in Chapter 4, the Federal association has great economic and other advantages. The Federal Government mustbe given powers sufficient to enable it to continue to provide these benefits.
It alone can encourage the economic development and promote the economic prosperity of the Federation as a whole. It alone can maintain the defences and advance the collective interests of the Federation in its relations withforeign powers. The conduct of external affairs, including trade relations,the maintenance of defence, the development and control of the economy as a whole these are broad, basic functions which any federal government must possess if the particular benefits of the federal association are to berealised.127. The reconciliation of these principles is the peculiar problem offederalism. The correct allocation of functions in a federal state must therefore aim at a reasonable balance between these requirements. It maybe difficult to strike this balance, but we consider that for the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland the following basic principles should determine the allocation of the functions of government:  (1) Matters affecting the day to day life of the inhabitants should beTerritorial subjects.(2) No subject should be divided between the Federal and territorial governments on a racial basis.(3) The Federal Government should be responsible for all matters connected with external relations, including trade relations.(4) The Federal Government should enjoy the basic and necessarymeans to regulate the economy of the Federal area, and taxationshould be regarded not only as a means to raise revenue butalso as an essential instrument of this control of the Federaleconomy.128. The Legislative lists in the present Constitution have been drawnup on the principle that any subject not included in the lists is therebyautomatically residual and Territorial, without the need to be specifiedin a separate list. We have considered whether there would be any advan-tage in having a separate Territorial list of powers*. We understand thatsuch a list is liable to raise considerable problems of specification anddefinition, and so to create more dispute and disagreement than it is likelyto remove. We are therefore content that, in the drawing up of the newLegislative lists, exclusively Territorial, and thus residual, subjects shouldnot be specified in a separate list.129. We have considered whether to eliminate the Concurrent Listf and,on balance, decided against it. We are recommending that parts of certainsubjects should be placed on one list and parts on another. Other subjectsshould, in our view, either be removed from the Concurrent to the FederalList, or should fall into the residual. i.e. Territorial, sphere. If these recom-mendations are carried out, they will reduce the size of the ConcurrentList by about one-third.130. The transfer of subjects from one list to another is bound to involveall the Governments concerned in grave difficulties of staffing, finance and efficiency.   In order to reduce these difficulties, and to avoid the danger* Survey of Developments since 1953, page 4, paragraph 19.t Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraph 53 (ii).
of a breakdown of efficient administration, we recommend that Article 32 ofthe Constitution should be amended to enable any Territorial Governmentto delegate its powers to the Federal Government, or vice versa, for so longas it may desire. The arrangements to delegate such powers must be linkedto the working out of the necessary fiscal adjustments. We think the Terri-torial Governments, who will, if our recommendations are accepted, havethe right to resume authority over many important functions, should use thisprovision to leave the control and administration of the subjects they are totake over with the Federal Government until such time as the necessary arrangements can be made to bring about a smooth and phased transfer from Federal to Territorial responsibility.131. To achieve these objects, and at the same time to make each sub-section of Article 32 precisely equal in its effect, we propose amendment ofthe Article, on some such lines as the following:  &quot; 32 (1). The Federal Legislature may, in agreement with the Govern-ment of the Territory concerned, by law confer upon the Legislature ofa Territory authority to make laws for that Territory with respect to any matter included in the Federal or Concurrent Legislative List which maybe specified in the law by which the authority is conferred, and subjectto such conditions, including conditions as to the return of the authorityto the Federal Government, as that law may impose, and so that inno case shall the return of the function to the Federal Governmenttake effect until the revenues of the Governments concerned have been adjusted following the recommendations of a Fiscal Review held interms of Article 96 of the Constitution.&quot; (2) The Legislature of a Territory may, in agreement with theGovernment of the Federation, by law confer upon the Federal Legis-lature authority to make laws for that Territory with respect to any matter not included in the Federal or Concurrent Legislative List whichmay be specified in the law by which the authority is conferred, andsubject to such conditions, including conditions as to the return of theauthority to the Territorial Government, as that law may impose, andso that in no case shall the return of the function to the TerritorialGovernment take effect until the revenues of the Governments concerned have been adjusted following the recommendations of a Fiscal Reviewheld in terms of Article 96 of the Constitution &quot;.Subsections (3) and (4) would remain unchanged.132. If, as we recommend, the Territorial Governments eventually takeover a number of departments, three of which are major ones, they will also have to take over large numbers of civil servants. This will create difficult problems concerning contracts, terms of service, pensions and the like.If they are not successfully solved, losses of trained staff so serious as tocripple good administration might well result. We think these problems canbe solved by negotiation between the Territorial and the Federal Govern-ment and the staff concerned. The principles which should govern these negotiations are for the Governments themselves to decide, but we considerthat the extra cost, if any, of settlements resulting from the transfer of staff should be met by the Government which assumes permanent responsibilityfor the subject concerned, and not by the Government which surrenders it.Further, flexibility in the allocation of functions will need to be matched bysome device designed to achieve greater flexibility in the movement of staffbetween the services of the Federal and Territorial Governments.
mi! .B.  Proposals for Major Changes In the Allocation of Functions133. In this Part we deal with the allocation of six functions of Govern-ment, namely, non-African education, health, marketing, roads, agricultureand prisons. We consider that non-African education and health are of vital importance, both in themselves and in relation to the state of publicopinion, and we therefore deal with them first.Item 30.   The primary and secondary education of persons otherthan Africans*.134. Strong feelings exist in the Federation as to the allocation of educa-tion, and as to its division between the Federal and Territorial governments on a racial basis. In particular, we were impressed with the argument thatthe existence of two separate departments create difficulties for those who wish to develop multi-racial schools. There are also other difficulties,inherent in differences of language, in school going age, and social back-grounds, and we do not advocate the compulsory integration of schools.But we consider that there should be no technical obstacles in the way ofthe establishment of multi-racial schools on the basis of voluntary attendance.We are bound to regard the allocation of this subject as of major importance for the whole future of the Federal association. Its present allocation con-flicts with our principles that subjects should not be divided on a racialbasis, and that matters close to the day to day life of the people should beTerritorial. These principles do not preclude the arrangement of some machinery for the co-ordination of the educational system as a whole. Wetherefore recommend that all education (other than higher education) should become a Territorial responsibility, and that item 30 should be deleted fromthe Federal Legislative List. At the same time we recommend that theConstitution should provide for the setting up of an Education consultative council consisting of the three Territorial Ministers of Education and theFederal Minister responsible for higher education. This Council should beresponsible for planning a national educational policy, including the main-tenance and improvement of standards, and for recommending to theGoverments concerned the steps necessary to carry out that policy. we recognise that the re-allocation of responsibilities for non-African educationwill create a number of problems affecting staff. We think the EducationConsultative Council itself could be responsible for making recommenda-tions as to how those difficulties should be dealt with.135. As regards item 31, Higher education and technological education,we make separate recommendations in paragraph 161 below.Item 64.  Health (other than silicosis in Northern Rhodesia)f.136. With minor exceptions, health is at present entirely regulated and managed by the Federal Government, under the Federal Minister of Health.Although it is not divided on a racial basis it is as much the cause of politi-cal controversy as non-African education. There is probably no function, ordepartment, of the Federal Government, about which we heard a greatervolume of evidence than the health service. It was viewed with dissatisfaction-tion by both Africans and Europeans in Northern Rhodesia ; in Nyasalandwe heard both criticism and praise ; and in Southern Rhodesia we received
complaints from some Europeans to the effect that the Government had&quot; marked time &quot; in the south while concentrating their efforts in the northern territories. Critics of the service included missionaries, employees of theFederal Health Ministry itself, and other medical opinion. Much of the criticism, for example that based on the charges of over-centralisation andneglect of remote rural areas, was certainly directed against the administra-tion of the service rather than the allocation of the function. This criticismdoes not take account of the fact that here has been an overall improve-ment in health services. Between 1953 and 1958, the number of Africansadmitted to hospital rose from 290,000 to 506,000, and out-patient attend-ances (including rural clinics) rose from about 6,000,000 to about 13,000,000.The main basis for the criticism was clearly the feeling that a subject soclose to day to day life would be more sympathetically administered by theless remote agency of the Territorial Governments.137. On these grounds, and on the principle that subjects affectingthe daily life of the people should be Territorial, the majority of us havereached the conclusion that health must be a Territorial subject*f. But inorder to preserve the advantages of uniformity, the application of this principle needs to be modified. We therefore recommend the divisionof health so as to allocate to the Territorial Governments the regulationof hospitals and clinics, public health and sanitation (except for majorpublic health schemes see below), lunacy and liquor. To preserve theadvantages of uniformity in the following aspects of health, we consider thatthese should be exclusively Federal:  Control and regulation of poisons and drugs.Major public health schemes (e.g. for the control of malaria,bilharzia, etc.) in areas and in respect of diseases to be specified bythe Governor-General with the consent of the Governors of the territories in which such schemes are to be carried out.International aspects of health control, e.g. the issue of vaccinationand yellow fever certificates as required by the World Health Organisa-tion, or in accordance with other international agreements ito the extent that this function is not already covered by item 1 (b) of the FederalLegislative List).138. We therefore recommend that the subjects stated immediately above should be included in the Federal Legislative List, leaving the remainder ofhealth to be Territorial.139. But in order not entirely to sacrifice the advantages to be gained from a health service with uniform standards, uniform conditions ofservice and liability to transfer within the whole of the Federal area, werecommend that the Territorial Governments with, or without, theassistance of the Federal Government, should negotiate the setting upof a Central African Health Service, possibly in the form of a statutory commission or corporation to achieve the advantages stated.* For note of reservation by Mr. Woodrow Cross, Professor Jack, Mr. Robinson, SirVictor Robinson, Chief Sigola and Mr. Taylor, see page 132.t For note of reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Ellman-Brown and Mr. McCleland,see page 133.
Item 10. Marketing. The distribution, disposal, purchase and saleof such manufactured and unmanufactured commodities and suchanimals and poultry as the Governor-General may by order specify, thecontrol of the wholesale and retail price of any commodities, animalsor poultry so specified, and the payment by the Federation of subsidiesin respect of any commodities, animals or poultry so specified (subjectto the provisions of Part IJJI of this Schedule), so, however, that a law of the Federal Legislature relating to&apos; animals or poultry made by virtue of this item shall not have effect in relation to any Territoryunless and until the Governor of that Territory has declared by notice in the official Gazette of the Territory that it shall so have effect*.140. We consider a general Federal control over marketing to be oneof the necessary economic controls specified in our statement of principles.At the same time, for local and special reasons, we recognise that control by Territorial Governments of particular commodities, mainly Africanagricultural products, or of commodities in particular areas, may sometimesfoe necessary. (But a proviso to enable a Territorial Government to opt for control of the marketing of a particular commodity, or of a commodityin a particular area, might well lead, if it were abused, to the destructionof the whole purpose of the main control over marketing by the federal government. We think a balance could be struck between these two points of view if the provision to deal with marketing in the Legislative Lists of thenew Constitution were to foe drafted on the following lines:  &quot;The control of the distribution, disposal, purchase, and sale ofsuch manufactured and unmanufactured commodities, and such animalsand poultry, as may foe specified, whether generally, or as producedwithin specified areas, foy notice of the Governor-General in the FederalGazette, such control including control of the wholesale and retail prices of any such commodities and the payment foy the Federation of subsidies in respect of any such commodities:Provided that on giving twelve months&apos; notice, or such less noticeas the Governor-General may agree, the Governor of a Territory mayrequest the exemption from the specification mentioned above, either of a particular commodity, or of a particular commodity produced ina particular area: if the Governor-General accedes to such a request,the exemption shall foe granted accordingly ; but if the Governor-Generaldoes not accede to the request, it shall foe remitted for advice to theEconomic Development Council, on whose advice the Governor-General shall then decide the issue &quot;.Our recommendations as to the Economic Development Council are in chapter 10.Item 19.  Inter-territorial roads.Item 54.   Other roads f.141. For the last seven years the actual construction and maintenanceof all roads has been carried out by the Public Works or Roads Depart-ments of the Territories with funds for inter-territorial roads supplied by the
Federal&quot;Government. The only function which the latter Government hasperformed has been to decide priorities for inter-territorial roads. while there might well toe advantages in continuing this system, we would prefer that each Government should have complete power to decide policy and priorities in each Territory. But we assume that the greater measure of inter-governmental co-operation which we are recommending in Chapter 10will result in a reasonable degree of co-ordination between territories to meet each other&apos;s requirements. We therefore recommend that both the items mentioned above should cease to be Federal and Concurrentrespectively, and toecome Territorial.Items 24, 25 and 26.   Agriculture&apos;^.142. These items refer specifically to agriculture, agricultural research,conservation, veterinary and related services in Southern Rhodesia, butexclude forestry, irrigation and African agriculture. The items must also toe considered in relation to Article 31 of the Constitution, which allowsthe Federal Government in certain circumstances to control correspondingservices in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The present position canbe broadly summarised as follows:  id) The Federal Government are responsible for agriculture, as definedabove, in Southern Rhodesia. In Northern Rhodesia they have assumed responsibility for non-African agriculture but not for animal health or tsetse fly control; in practice, their activities areat present confined to conservation and extension services and specialist advisory services.(b) The Southern Rhodesia Government are generally responsible for african agriculture in the Colony.(c) The Northern Rhodesia Government are responsible for all aspectsof African Agriculture in the Territory and for the balance of services required for non-African agriculture.(d) The Nyasaland Government are responsible for both African and non-African agriculture in the Territory.143. We found that strong opinions were held about the control ofagriculture and related subjects. The division of agriculture on a racialbasis was strongly criticised. Agricultural and veterinary services, it wasoften said, are naturally subjects that ought to come under the direction ofa single Government. But the view that agriculture must be Territorial isbased on its strong connexion with land, a matter of particular concern to Africans, and one specially preserved as Territorial in the Federal Constitu-tion, and mentioned in the Preamble.144. We recognise that there are technical advantages in a single overallcontrol of agriculture. We also appreciate that the weight of Europeanevidence has been in favour of continued Federal control of European agri-culture in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. We are also aware that there isa body of African opinion in Southern Rhodesia in favour of African agri-culture in that Territory coming under Federal control. This may be basedboth on the desire that the same Government should administer both African
and European agriculture, and on the view that the Federal Government ismore liberal and more wealthy than the Territorial Government.145. Despite these facts, the majority of us think that the general prin-ciples we have adopted should be applied to agriculture, as to other functions.The subject should not be divided on a racial basis between European and African agriculture; it should be given as a whole, either to the Federationor to the Territories. Since it is concerned so largely with the activitiesof the individual farmer, and therefore lies so close to the day to day life and work of the people, we believe that it should as a whole become a territorial responsibility*. We are strengthened in this view by the con-viction that a substantial re-allocation of functions is politically necessary;and we believe that the transfer of agriculture, as one subject, to the Terri-torial Governments would help to lessen the present opposition to Federation.It should be left to the Governments concerned to make any necessarydelegation of powers under Article 32 to ensure that the changeover takes place without undue dislocation of existing machinery or lowering of standards.Item 60. Prisons and other institutions for the treatment of and methodof treating offenders against any law, whether or not that law is withinthe legislative competence of the Federal Legislature or, as the case maybe, of the Legislature of the Territory t-146. The major consideration is the connexion of prisons with law andorder which is, and should remain, a Territorial responsibility. We there-fore Tecommend that prisons and similar institutions should become Terri-torial responsibilities, and that in consequence item 60 should be deletedfrom the Concurrent Legislative List. But the Federal Legislature shouldhave power to control by legislation the detention of individuals temporarilydetained under Federal law, and the detention of military offenders againstmilitary law.147. It will be necessary to include in the Constitution a provision on thelines of Article 120 of the Australian Constitution which reads: &quot; Every state shall make provision for the detention in its prisons of persons accused orconvicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of theCommonwealth may make laws to give effect to this provision.&quot;C.   Other Proposed ChangesItem 2. Extradition, fugitive offenders, and the removal of prisoners,both as between Territories and as between the Federation or a Terri-tory and some country outside the Federation.148. Extradition and fugitive offenders should be Concurrent rather thanFederal subjects. This will make it easier for the Territories to arrangeamong themselves, without reference to the Federal Government, to extraditecriminals and pursue fugitive offenders within the Federation, while theFederal Government retains powers to legislate, as a matter of external affairs, for the extradition of offenders from or to foreign countries.   The* For note of reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Woodrow Cross, Mr. Ellman-Brown, Professor Jack, Mr. McCleland, Mr. Robinson, Sir Victor Robinson, Chief Sigolaand Mr. Taylor, see page 134.t Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 176-179.
removal of prisoners should become a Territorial subject by virtue of therecommendation which we make in respect of item 60 that prisons should become Territorial. We accordingly recommend that extradition and fugitiveoffenders should be Concurrent subjects, and the removal of prisoners,Territorial.Item 3. Defence.149. The use of Federal forces in Territorial emergencies was strongly criticised in evidence by Africans in the two Northern Protectorates, eventhough the use of such forces has always been at the specific request of theTerritorial Government concerned. Such forces were sometimes wronglycalled &quot; Southern Rhodesian troops &quot;, in spite of the fact that the defence forces belong to the whole Federation. We recommend that defence should remain Federal on the following understandings:  (a) That   &quot; defence&quot;   means   defence   primarily   against   external aggression.(b) That the defence forces will not be used in any Territory for purposesof internal security except at the request of the Territorial Govern-ment concerned.(c) That the defence forces will not be used outside the boundaries ofthe Federation except with the consent of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(d) That in so far as defence includes the raising, training and main-tenance of military forces in times of peace, it should be laid downin some appropriate place and manner that these matters will bedealt with by the Federal Government only after consultation withthe Territorial Governments.150. We consider that the understandings (a) and (b) could be written intothe Federal Legislative List.151. The understanding (c) is not, in our view, strictly necessary in asmuch as it is covered by the limitation on the entrustment of external affairsby Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the Federal Govern-ment already expressed in item 1 of the Federal Legislative List, cf. thestatement of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in replyto a question in the House of Lords on 14th July, 1960*. Nevertheless, weconsider that this understanding should be expressed in some manner inconnexion with the new Constitution.152. The understanding id), although not covered elsewhere, could not easily be expressed in the Legislative List itself. We therefore think that itshould be laid down in the context of the arrangements to be made for con-sultation and co-ordination of policy between the Federal and territorial governments.Item 4.  Immigration into and emigration from the Federation.153. We have considered a proposal that the Governor of any territory should be enabled, by making a declaration, to prevent the prohibition ofan immigrant in the Federation generally from taking effect in his par-ticular Territory. We think this would only create friction, and would prefer to see the practice established of consultation between the Federal and* Hansard, House of Lords, Vol. 225, No. 104, col. 287.
Territorial Governments before an individual is declared to be a prohibitedimmigrant. We are therefore agreed that Territorial Governments shouldhave the right to ask for consultation with the Federal Government in any individual case.Item 6.  Citizenship of the Federation.154. The Africans of the two Northern Territories are greatly attachedto their status as British protected persons. This feeling is connected intheir minds with the pledges given in the Preamble to the Constitutionrelating to the status of the Northern Territories as British Protectorates.Although we do not think it likely that the Federal Government would at any time take steps to compel a British protected person to become a federal citizen against his will, in order to allay possible fears andsuspicions we recommend that the following words should be added to the description of this function:  &quot; so, however, that no law shall compel a British protected person tobecome a citizen of the Federation.&quot;Item 7.  (part). Control of capital issues.155. At present the Loan Council has the power to approve the Govern-ments&apos; programmes of external borrowing and, in default of unanimous agreement to the contrary, whatever sums are actually raised are dividedin the same proportions as the income tax receipts. We think that theLoan Council&apos;s powers should be extended to include public internal borrow-ing as well as public external borrowing. We recommend that control ofcapital issues should be retained in the Federal Legislative List but thatthe Constitution should be amended to give the Loan Council this additionalpower.Item 9.  Promotion of exports from the Federation.156. We do not consider that it was intended, nor should it be intended,that this Federal power should, if exercised, completely remove the authorityof the Territorial Governments to promote the exports of their Territoriesby such means as displays and trade fairs. However, to remove any doubt,we think that there should be added to the description of this subject the words &quot; provided that the Territorial Governments shall also have powerto promote their own exports &quot;.Item 14. Guarantees by the Federal Government of loans.157. It is clearly necessary that this subject should remain exclusivelyFederal. It is also a Federal function to legislate generally in respectof (borrowing on the public credit. This is a subject included in the federallegislative lists in other federal constitutions. We think that this shouldbe clarified and recommend the addition to the Federal Legislative List ofa separate item &quot; Borrowing on the public credit&quot;.Item 21. Shipping, harbours, and ancillary services, including ancillarytransport services.158. We have felt some difficulty in including in this item legislation relating to small fishing or other craft normally owned by Africans, whichmight more properly foe a Territorial subject.   We therefore propose that
the item be amended by adding &quot;except the licensing and registration of small craft on inland waters &quot;. We leave it to the Governments to agree on the definition of &quot; small craft&quot;.159. The control of harbours presents a difficulty. There are not now,nor are there likely to be, many major harbours in the Federation, andmost of the minor harbours or jetties on lakes or rivers would be moreproperly controlled by the Territorial Governments, and in particular bythe Native Authorities on whose lands such minor harbours are likely tobe. On the other hand, some provision should be made whereby, as largerharbours develop, the legislative power to regulate them would belong tothe authority in control of shipping and railways, i.e. the Federal Govern-ment. To meet this situation, we therefore propose the introduction ofthe following item into the Federal Legislative List:  &quot; Item 21 A. Such harbours (and ancillary services) as the Governor-General with the consent of the Governor of the Territory concerned,may by notice in the Federal Gazette schedule as Federal harbours.&quot;Item 28. Such irrigation works and water works as the Governor-General may by order designate as major irrigation or water works or as works ancillary to such major works (subject to the provisions ofPart III of this Schedule).160. We think that the Territorial Governments should exercise, if they so wish, control and regulation of irrigation and water works in respect ofwhich there may be doubt whether they are of such a size as to makeFederal control and regulation necessary. We therefore propose that in this item the words &quot; with the consent of the Governor of the Territory con-cerned &quot; should be inserted after the words &quot; the Governor-General may &quot;.This will provide a reasonable safeguard to enable Territorial governments to undertake irrigation and water works.Item 31. Higher education (including higher education of Africans),that is to say, institutions or other bodies offering courses of a university, technological or professional character.161. The only Federal activity so far has been to set up the university college of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In practice any Territory can, if itso wishes, set up its own institutions of higher education. But the listingof the subject as exclusively Federal has created the feeling that the Terri-tories are debarred from starting institutions which many of their inhatoi-tants would like to see locally based. Further, there have been instances,particularly in the field of technological education, in which it has appeared,whatever the facts may be, that the Federal Government was in someway inhibiting one of the Territorial Governments from setting up an institution of higher education. It would remove friction and anxiety ifthis subject were to become Concurrent. We therefor recommend thatthe item should be removed to the Concurrent Legislative List. By virtueof our recommendation that all other forms of education should be Terri-torial, and since we do not want to see racial stipulations included in thelegislative lists, the words &quot; (including higher education of Africans) &quot; shouldbe removed.
162. Some confusion has (been caused by the difficulty in distinguishingclearly between &quot; technological&quot; and &quot; technical&quot; education. If higher education becomes Concurrent this confusion will disappear, since either the Federal or a Territorial Government can set up institutions of eithertechnical or technological training.Item 36. The establishment, training, maintenance and administrationof a Federal police force for service in the employment of, or use in,-any Territory at the request and under the operational control of theGovernor of that Territory in addition to or in substitution for the police force of that Territory; and the conditions (including conditions as to payment by the Territory) on which the Federation will make that police force available for such use or employment^163. Law and order is an exclusively Territorial responsibility. We have considered various suggestions for altering this arrangement so as to give some authority in this field to the Federal Government. We do not consider any change appropriate. So long as the Northern Territories are Protectorates,law and order must remain a Territorial subject, under the ultimate controlof the United Kingdom Government.164. The power given under this item to the Federal Government toestablish a Federal police force has not in fact been exercised. The main reason for this, we understand, is that in normal times there would be noduties for a Federal force to perform. So long as the item remains in theFederal Legislative List we consider that, apart from being unnecessary, itis liable to arouse fears and suspicions among Africans in the northern territories. We therefore recommend its removal from the list. The effectof this will not be to make a Federal subject residual but simply to remove the power from the Federal Government.Item 41. The payment of old age pensions by the FederalGovernmentf.165. Old age pensions, as a social service, would more satisfactorily beTerritorial than Federal. We therefore recommend the removal of this itemfrom the Federal Legislative List, and that it should become residual.Item 42. The control of any area which may be designated as aNational Park by an order made by the Governor-General with theconsent of the Governor of the Territory in which that area is situated,being control with respect to such matters and to such extent as may be specified in that order (subject to the provisions of Part III of this schedule).166. In Southern Rhodesia the National Parks are under Federal, and land and game under Territorial, control. Difficulties have naturally arisen.The Governments of the Northern Territories have declined to hand over toFederal control the National Parks they had themselves set up. This is largely because the parks are so closely connected with African land use and occupation. For this same reason it seems improbable that the northern territories will agree to hand over National Parks to the Federal government at least for some time to come.
167. Our aim should be to recognise the facts as they exist in theNorthern Territories, and to remove a possible cause of friction in SouthernRhodesia. We therefore recommend that National Parks should be left inthe Federal Legislative List in the same terms as at present, which give to theTerritorial Governments the right to keep control of any National Park.At the same time we draw attention to the difficulties which have been experienced in Southern Rhodesia and recommend that, if these difficultiespersist, the Federal Government should hand back the National Parks in southern Rhodesia to the Southern Rhodesian Government, making use ofArticle 32 of the Constitution. We do not think that the same considerations apply to National Monuments (item 43) and we recommend that this itemshould remain in the list as at present.New Item.  Disputes with and among employees of Federal statutoryorganisations (part of labour)*.168. We do not recommend any substantial change in the present alloca-tion of labour to the Territorial Governments. We consider it would be reasonable to give to the Federal Government the same exclusive respon-sibility for the settlement of disputes with and among employees of Federalstatutory organisations as they possess for the settlement of disputes betweenthe Federal Government and Federal officers under Article 30 (2) of theFederal Constitution. That Article should therefore be amended accordingly.This need not involve any addition to the Federal Legislative List.Item 45. Deportation.169. We think that this subject, by virtue of its connexion with external affairs, should not be included in the Concurrent Legislative List. Werecommend its transfer to the Federal Legislative List, but amended to read &quot; Deportation from the Federation of criminals and undesirable aliens &quot;.This limitation should make clear the intended scope of the subject.Item 46.  Naturalisation.170. We think it unnecessary for the Territorial Governments to have any power of legislation in the field of naturalisation. This would more appro-appropriately be exercised by the Federal Government in connexion with item 6 citizenship of the Federation. We therefore propose the removal of thissubject from the Concurrent to the Federal Legislative List.Item 47.   Control of the voluntary movement of persons betweenTerritories.171. Restriction on the voluntary movement of persons within the Federalboundaries should be reduced to the very minimum. In other words, theFederal and the Territorial Governments should legislate as little as possible on this subject. We have considered whether a statement of this principlecould be included in the Federal Constitution itself. But the need to specifyexceptions to this rule would remove much of the force from such a statement.We have therefore concluded, with some regret, that the subject should remain in the Concurrent List. Nevertheless, we wish to stress die importanceof securing freedom of movement of persons throughout the Federation, not least to remove the fears of Africans ; and to impress on all the Governments
the importance of consulting with each other when any restriction is imposed.We also recommend that all four Governments should aim progressively atthe ideal of general freedom of movement of persons within the Federation.Item 50. Land banks, that is to say, Government institutions orinstitutions set up Iby or under a law of the Federal Legislature or ofthe Legislature of a Territory, being institutions of which the main purpose is the granting of credits for housing or agricultural purposes.Item 51.   Co-operative societies and co-operative companies, beingsuch societies and companies with objects connected with agriculture,except where a majority of the members are African.172. These subjects are closely related to agriculture, and we have recommended that all agriculture should become a Territorial subject.   it follows that these subjects also should become Territorial and thereforeremoved from the Concurrent Legislative List.Item 52.   Bankruptcy and insolvency ; assignments to and composi-tions with creditors.Item 53.  Hire purchase.173. Both these functions are closely connected with the general controlof the economy.   We recommend their removal from the Concurrent to theFederal Legislative List.Item 54.   Roads other than those referred to in item 19.174. We have recommended that this item should become residual1 see paragraph 141.Item 55.  Road-rail crossings.175. We consider that there is likely to be continuous friction betweenthe Federal and Territorial Governments unless this subject is allocated toone or the other. It can be argued that it should follow roads and beTerritorial, or that it should follow railways and be Federal. On balancewe think the subject should be Federal and recommend its transfer fromthe Concurent to the Federal Legislative List.Item 58. Scientific and industrial research, including, in relation to northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, agricultural, veterinary and tsetseresearch.176. The Federal Government has achieved some notable successes inthe field of agricultural research. Although agriculture should becomeTerritorial, we consider that a Federal interest in research should continue.We recommend that this item should remain in the Concurrent List andbe re-defined as follows : &quot; Scientific and industrial research ; all agricultural research, includingpasture, veterinary and tsetse research ; together with the provision and use of specialist services in connexion with agriculture and agricultural products, including veterinary services and services dealingwith chemistry, entomology and plant pathology &quot;.Item 61. Care and protection of minors*.177. This is a social service, and we therefore recommend that it beremoved from the Concurrent Legislative List and be made residual.
Item 62.  Fingerprints, identification, and criminal records.178. Since law and order and police matters are exclusively Territorial,and since we have also recommended the exclusion from the FederalLegislative List of item 36 (Federal police force), we can see no need forFederal legislation on this subject. we therefore recommend its removal from the Concurrent Legislative List, and that it be made residual.Item 66.   Town planning*.179. Owing to its connexion with land we consider that this subject should be Territorial. We therefore recommend that it be removed from theConcurrent Legislative List, and toe made residual.Item 67.   Geological, trigonometrical, topographical and cadastralsurveys180. On the evidence we have heard, we see no reason why cadastraland geological surveys should be regulated by the Federal Government.Professional opinion, we understand, supports the view that they can best be managed on a Territorial or local basis. We therefore recommend the division of this subject trigonometrical and topographical surveys should remain Concurrent, while geological and cadastral surveys should beremoved from the Concurrent Legislative List, and be made residual.Item 73.   Registration of births and deaths^.181. This subject is a social service and in the rural areas may requirethe co-operation of Native Authorities. It should therefore be excludedfrom the Concurrent Legislative List, and be made residual.New Item.   Building societies $.182. This subject is at present residual. We were impressed by theview that there is a need for Federal regulation of building societies. Wehave therefore concluded that building societies should toe added to theConcurrent Legislative List.183. We have considered whether the following items need foe includedin either of the Legislative Lists:  Item9.   Promotion of exports from the Federation.14.  Guarantees by the Federal Government of loans.34.  Federal public relations.35.   Audit of Federal public accounts.63.  Security information.65.   Promotion of tourist traffic.68.   Production and distribution of Government films.74.  Registration and record of printed publications.75.   Commissions of inquiry.It might toe supposed that the Federal Government could deal with anyof these subjects without their specific mention in the two Legislative Lists.* Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 162, 163.t Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 160, 161.j Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 96-99.8 Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 158, 159.
But there is a technical objection. If they were not so included, it mightbe argued that their omission indicated that they were residual and con-sequently that the Federal Government had no power to legislate orappropriate funds for these matters. We see no reason for removing these subjects from Federal control, and therefore recommend that they shouldbe left where they are.New Item. Non-African land*.184. When the new Constitution is drawn up, it is desirable to remove any doubt which may exist that the Federal Government has a right, underthe prescribed conditions, to acquire non-African land compulsorily. Wethink it probable that this could be done by amendment of Article 33 (1)of the Federal Constitution, but, if that is not the case, then the right ofthe Federal Government in this respect must be made clear in some other way.185. Some of the recommendations in Parts B and C of this chaptermay, if accepted, make it necessary for Part III of the Second Schedule ofthe Federal Constitution to be amended.* Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 110-113.62
POWERS OF TAXATION AND FISCALARRANGEMENTS186. In this chapter we deal with the division of the powers of taxationbetween the Federal and Territorial Governments, and with the fiscal resultsof the reallocation of functions which we recommend in Chapter 8. Theseare closely related subjects. The relative items of- the Federal LegislativeList are Item 11. Duties of customs and excise (including export duties) otherthan duties on motor spirit, whether the proceeds of those duties areto toe used for Federal or for Territorial purposes (subject to theprovisions of article eighty-three of this Constitution).Item 12. Taxes on income and profits, and taxes on amounts paidor payable on the sale of goods other than motor spirit, whether the proceeds of those taxes are to be used for Federal or for Territorialpurposes (subject to the provisions of articles eighty to eighty-two and eighty-four of this Constitution).Articles 80-87 of the Federal Constitution are also relevant.187. We assume that a Fiscal Commission will be appointed to allocate the proceeds of taxation between the four Governments, whether on a percentage system as in the present Constitution, or on a grants system(see paragraph 189 (a)). We make a distinction between this allocation of revenue and the actual powers and responsibilities for the raising of taxes, and determining tariffs and rates of taxation.188. There are in our view three general principles, linked to those forthe allocation of functions stated in paragraph 127.  These are (a) If financial responsibility, as well as political experience, are to be encouraged, especially in the two Northern Protectorates, the range of taxes under the rating control of the Territorial governments should be as wide as possible.(b) On the other hand, the Federal Government should be able toexercise a general regulation of the economy, both directly andin collaboration with the Central Bank, without restricting undulythe fiscal powers of the Territorial Governments.(c) In addition, the Federal Government should be able to promote theeconomic development of the more backward parts of the Federalarea by means of grants or loans.It is clear that in any field of taxation these principles must pull inopposite directions, owing to the conflict between the desire for Territorialautonomy and the desire for economic advancement. But we considerthat some reconciliation of these two objectives must be achieved if a Federalrelationship is to survive.
189. Before dealing with the main problem of taxation ift will toe con-venient to set out our views on certain relatively minor aspects of taxation and of fiscal arrangements which have an important bearing on thatproblem.(a) The question of dividing revenue according to percentages or ona grants system. As indicated by Article 80 of the Federal Con-stitution (as amended in 1958), the principle accepted for the divisionof income tax in 1953 was that it should ibe based on fixedpercentages alterable from time to time on the recommendationsof statutorily appointed Fiscal Commissions as provided for inArticle 96 of the Constitution. There is, however, an alternative method, which is used in some other Federations, of stating inthe Constitution specific annual grants in money terms (or ofempowering the Fiscal Commission to determine such grants fora definite period of years), to be paid from the divisible pool oftaxation by the Federal Government to the three Territories. Thepercentage method is considered to give each of the Territoriesan equity in the taxable potential of the Federation, and to limit the field of argument between the Federal and Territorial Govern-menlts in relation to their annual budgets and financial plans. the grants method is considered to have the merit of giving to theTerritorial Governments a greater degree of certainty as the basis for their annual budget, and at the same time to give to theFederal Government scope for raising additional revenue for thepurpose of making grants to a poorer Territory, as for example,Nyasaland. The percentage method is already familiar in theFederation, and we heard no evidence adverse to it. Indeed, weconsider that it has worked well. We therefore make no recom-mendation as to which of the two methods is preferable.(b) Additional Grants or Loans.  If, however, it is decided to continuethe use of the percentage method, we think it important thatthere should still be scope for the Federal Government to makeadditional grants or loans to individual Territories in the mannerfor which provision exists in Article 95 of the Constitution. Thisis a necessary consequence of the third of the principles stated above. ((c) Territorial Surcharge on Income Tax.   Whatever method may beadopted for the solution of the main taxation problem there willremain scope for the three Territorial Governments to impose a territorial surcharge on either the whole range of income taxesor on company tax alone*. We see no necessity to make funda-mental changes in the present system, and we think it will benecessary for the Fiscal Commission, rather than ourselves, torecommend the necessary upper limit of the surcharge. But weare anxious to avoid a situation in which the Federal Governmentcould cause embarrassment to the Territorial Governments by
some rapid variation of the basic income tax. We therefore recom-mend that, in reviewing the proportions of basic tax to foe dis-tributed to the Territorial Governments, the Fiscal commission should work on the basis of permitting the Territorial government greater power of manoeuvre in the field of the Territorial sur-charge. In order to avoid the necessity for the surcharge movingin direct proportion to the basic tax, its upper limit should be expressed as a money sum per  1 of income or profits, insteadof as a percentage of basic tax. We are assuming that both the tax itself and the surcharge will continue to be levied under aunform tax code throughout the Federal area.(d) Graduated Poll Tax*.   We consider it important that the territorial governments should toe given power to levy a graduated poll tax(on a non-racial basis) regardless of the fact that such a tax wouldbe an income tax. The Constitution should therefore provide that,if the Federal Government continues to have full responsibility for income tax, the Territorial Governments will not be deprived ofthe power to levy a graduated poll tax if they wish to do so. Itwill toe reasonable, however, to make provisions designed to prevent any overlap of liability for the payment of both income tax andgraduated poll tax. It is also desirable, in framing the regulations for graduated poll tax, to ensure that Native Authorities in theNorthern Territories are placed at no fiscal disadvantage.(e) Sales or Purchase Tax. We consider that, if either of the schemes which we set out in paragraphs 199 and 200 is adopted, salestax as provided for in Article 84 of the Constitution should be leviedby the Federal Government at rates determined by that Govern-ment. We have considered the alternative arrangement of givingthe Territorial Governments the responsibility for this field of taxa-tion, but we have rejected it, both because it is most undesirable that there should be differential rates of sales or purchase tax withinthe Federal area, and because of the potential value of this tax asa regulator of the economy. If, however, some scheme is adopted for the solution of the main problem other than one of those werecommend, then our recommendation relating to sales tax wouldhave to toe reconsidered, having regard to the principle that theTerritorial Governments should have as wide a range of taxesunder their control as possible.190. We now come to a recommendation which we regard not only as ofintrinsic value, but as likely to be of assistance in the solution of the taxationproblem. Under the basic fiscal arrangement which has been in force since1953, the Federal Government has retained for its sole use the proceeds of customs and excise (other than duties on motor spirit). It has, however,been obliged to divide with the Territories the product of taxes on income and profits in accordance with the percentages laid down in Article 80 of theConstitution (as subsequently amended). There were originally good reasonsfor this arrangement since, on the basis of the allocation of the functionsof Government at that time, income tax was regarded as the main adjusting* Possible Constitutional Changes, paragraphs 202-205.65
factor between the budgets of the Federal Government and the three Terri-torial Governments. Under the new allocation of functions which we arerecommending, income tax would no longer be the main adjusting factor,since within two or three million pounds the yield of other revenues is likelyto be sufficient for the actual needs of the Federal Government. But, evenapart from that, we think that it would be preferable for the proceeds of customs and excise and also income and profits taxes to be pooled fordivision between the Federal and Territorial Governments. If the federal government were to impose sales or purchase tax, these proceeds alsoshould be added to the divisible pool. (This would entail amendment ofArticle 84 of the Constitution.) The basis of the division of the pool may, aswe have said in paragraph 189 (a), be either on a percentage basis as atpresent, or on a fixed grant basis. The Constitution itself would have toexpress whatever percentages, or alternatively fixed grants, were recommendedby the Fiscal Commission and subsequently agreed. One reason for holdingthis view is that the pooling of the yield of the taxes would enable SouthernRhodesia, with its large African and European population, and Nyasaland,with its large African population, to contribute more to the divisible pool ofrevenue, and thus remove some of the complaint that Northern Rhodesiacontributes disproportionately to this pool under the present arrangements whereby the yield of income and profits taxes alone is divided. The arrange-ment would also establish an immediate Federal interest in the pool to theextent of the customs and excise duties, which are now running at the rate ofabout  14 million per annum. Further, in relation to the regulation of the economy, customs and excise and income and profits tax are frequentlycomplementary in their effect. The fiscal protection of a particular industry will, if effective, remove one source of revenue from the customs duty on imports which will be at a lower level than formerly, but it will establishanother source from the profits of the industry which otherwise would not exist, and from the earnings of its employees.191. If this recommendation, that the total proceeds of customs and excise and of income and profits taxes should form the divisible pool, is accepted, we think that the Federal Government should have the sole responsi-bility for making the laws and regulations governing the collection of customs and excise and income and profits taxes ; for actually collecting such taxes ;for dividing the proceeds of the taxes between itself and the territorial governments, subject to such deductions of the cost of collection as maybe agreed ; and finally, for fixing the customs tariffs and rates of excise duty.192. We come now to the main problem, which is whether, on the basisof the new allocation of functions which we have proposed, the Federalor the Territorial Governments, or both in certain proportions, should havethe power of fixing the rates of income and profits taxes.193. This question is related to the reallocation of functions in the follow-ing way. A full exposition of the methods originally employed is containedin the Report of the Fiscal Commission of 1952*. That Commission foundthat the revenue from taxes on income was likely to account for more than half of the total revenue from the three Territories, and that it was impossibleto allocate the whole proceeds of such taxes either to the Federal or to theTerritorial Governments.  It was therefore decided &quot; to treat taxes on income*Cmnd. 8672.
(   )as the main adjusting head whereby to secure the necessary balance in thefour budgets &quot;. In arriving at the percentages which it recommended, theCommission took into account &quot; both the source from which the revenue is derived, and the needs of the respective Territories&quot;. There were thenprepared for each Government pro forma expenditure budgets based on theproposed distribution of governmental functions as subsequently embodied inthe legislative lists. Certain additional sums were added to these budgets for particular purposes. In this way the totals of the expenditure budgets of thefour Governments were estimated as follows :  Federal Government ...      ......      26,919,000Southern Rhodesia Government   ......      12,723,000Northern Rhodesia Government   ......       8,317,000Nyasaland Government     .........       2,774,000Revenue budgets were also prepared. Customs and excise amounting to  12million was given to the Federal Government. This was  14,895,000 lessthan the Federal expenditure budget. The Territorial Governments were givenall other revenues, except the yield of basic income tax. The shortfall ofrevenue to each Government was then calculated. The proceeds of the basicincome tax were then distributed so as to yield to each of the four Govern-ments sufficient to balance its pro forma budget and leave a small surplus.Allowance was also made for the yield of the Territorial surcharge which wasto be imposed. This was the way in which the basic income tax was used as the main adjusting factor between the budgets. After the amendment ofthe Constitution in 1958, following the report of the second Fiscal Commis-sion, the tax was divided in the following proportions: Federal Govern-ment, 62 per cent; Southern Rhodesia Government, 14 per cent; northern rhodesia Government, 18 per cent; and Nyasaland Government, 6 per cent.194. The reallocation of the general functions of Government which weare recommending will fundamentally alter the balance of the expenditurebudgets of the Federal and Territorial Governments. Expenditure of  19million will cease to be the responsibility of the Federal Government and willbecome that of the three Territorial Governments in varying proportions. the approximate distribution of this reallocated expenditure as between services is shown in the following table : Non-African Education   ......	  6-lm.Health       ...      .........	6-5m.Non-African Agriculture (excluding	research and specialist services) ...	......      2-5m.Inter-Territorial Roads   ......	......      2-4m.Prisons       ...      ...      ...	......      0-7m.Old Age Pensions         ......	0-6m.Corresponding Works Services	......     0-2m.	 19-00m.195. The manner in which these sums are likely to be distributed betweenthe three Territorial Governments, and also the consequential reductionin the total expenditure of the Federal Government, are shown inAppendix V.67
196. Assuming that, as we recommend, the yield of customs and excise duties and the taxes on income and profits are to be pooled and thendivided, the question arises as to which of the Governments should havethe power to fix the rates of taxes on income and profits. There are three possible answers.(i) The first solution is that the Federal Government could continue tohave the power to fix the rates, and so be able to use income taxas a means of regulating the economy. This would supplement the means employed through its other economic functions, includ-ing the regulation of tariffs, marketing and capital issues. But thereare objections to this method. First, it would impose on theFederal Government the duty of assessing the rate of incometax solely, or nearly solely, for the purpose of meeting expendi-ture voted by the Territorial Governments. The arrangement would therefore be likely to cause friction between the Terri-torial Governments themselves, and between them and the federal government. This difficulty might be reduced if there were acommittee of all four Governments established for the purpose of agreeing both the rates of expenditure and the consequential ratesof taxation, but it is likely that much of the friction would merelybe transferred to the committee. A second difficulty (which alsoapplies to the third solution discussed below) is that direct federal government expenditure on the major subjects which we recom-mend should be transferred to the Territories would no longer bepossible. The Federal tax-payer would thus have no say in theway in which part of what he paid in tax was spent. Finally,there is the function of income tax as an economic regulator.Every Government wishes to be in a position to tax more than itspends, or conversely to spend more than it taxes. To use thisregulator efficiently it is desirable that the Government should bein control both of the taxing power and also of expenditure, andshould be able to use both to keep the gap on the side it requiresat any time, since neither revenue nor expenditure is very flexible.This applies with even greater force to the third solution.(ii) The second alternative is to give to the Territorial Governmentsindependent powers for determining the rates of tax on income and profits. This was the arrangement operating in Australia for fortyyears, and now in the Federation of the West Indies. However, itcuts deeply into the conception of federation. In the present case it would, for example, prevent Nyasaland from sharing as of right in the prosperity of its neighbours. It would also strike at the conception of the Federation as an entity stronger than thesum of its parts. It would deprive the Federal Government of animportant regulator of the economy. Finally, it would almost certainly entail different rates of income tax in the three Terri-tories, and even the possibility of different scales of allowances.(iii) There is a third possible solution.   Various arrangements couldbe made under which the rates of income tax were partly deter-mined by the Federal, and partly by the Territorial Governments.For example, the Federal Government could impose its own
income tax, presumably at a low rate appropriate to its lowerrevenue requirements, and allow the Territorial Governments toimpose their rates, which would be added to the Federal rate.Under these arrangements, the four Governments could agree to operate uniform assessment laws, and to employ a single collectingauthority. Possibly too, by agreement and in an endeavour toavoid the complications which would arise in connexion withinter-territorial companies, the yield of company tax could be allotted to the Federal Government. This arrangement would atleast have the merit that the Federal Government in servicingexternal loans would have a certain yield of income tax at itscommand, and as a result its status as a borrower in internationalmarkets would be enhanced. Nevertheless, it would still be pos-sible that the gross rates of income tax would vary considerablybetween Territories, and that they would have to be highest in nyasaland which is the poorest of the Territories. The federal government would also be deprived of income tax as an economicregulator, since there could be no assurance that a change inFederal income tax would be reflected in the gross rate of taxin the three Territories. Other variants of this arrangement based,for example, on giving the Federal Government sufficient incometax revenue to service loan charges, are open fo the same criticisms.197. After reviewing these three possibilities, and their variants, wehave reached the conclusion that there are only two courses which aregenuinely feasible in relation to the major redistribution of functions whichwe have recommended. Neither course is entirely satisfactory. Althoughboth give to the Federal Government considerable control of the economythrough the raising of revenue, nevertheless they still deny to that Govern-ment the desirable degree of control on the side of expenditure. On strictlyeconomic grounds, therefore, we would have preferred to recommend that a lesser range of functions should be transferred to the Territorial Govern-ments, but, for the reasons stated in Chapter 8, we consider that this transferof functions is essential if Federation is to be made acceptable.198. We now set out the two possible schemes, taking into each ele-ments of the recommendations which we have already made in paragraphs189 and 190. Both these schemes are based on the assumptions that there,will be a single pool of divisible revenue from customs and excise, taxeson income and profits, and sales or purchase tax, if raised; that theFederal Government will frame the law and regulations relating to all the taxes, save those, such as graduated poll tax, which are to be fully Terri-torial; and that the Federal Government will collect on behalf of itself and the three Territories the customs and excise duties and the taxes onincome and profits. Both schemes also assume that the aggregated revenue from the taxes will be distributed to the Federal and Territorial Govern-ments according to proportions laid down in the Constitution following a Fiscal Review, whether those proportions be by fixed percentages orby fixed grants.Scheme I199. The Federal Government would determine not only tariffs and excise duties, but also the rates of income tax.   The objections to this
arrangement are set out in paragraph 196 (i). The system would alsofail to give that degree of power over taxation which the territorial governments are likely to desire for political reasons. Nevertheless, if,in the interests of the economy, the Territorial Governments were willingto allow the Federal Government to exercise that power, we consider thatthe system would work, even if it might involve the possibility of friction between the Federal and Territorial Governments. But this seems to beinherent in any type of federation, and the objection applies also toScheme II below.Scheme II200. The Federal Government would determine the rates of companytax, while the Territorial Governments would determine the rates of allpersonal income tax. Under this arrangement, the Federal Governmentwould retain an important degree of control over the economy of theFederation, and the proposal would be in harmony with the Federal Govern-menfs responsibility for controlling commerce and industry. The arrange-ment would also permit the Territorial Governments to impose a surcharge on company tax, thus allowing that degree of flexibility which wouldenable the Territories, if they wished, to provide special funds for thedevelopment of their own areas. The merits of this solution are that itwould give the Territories a greater range of taxation ; it would fit in wellwith our recommendation on graduated poll tax ; from a political point ofview each Territory would be exercising a taxing power directly affectingthe daily lives of the people ; and the arrangement would ensure that theactual rate of personal taxation applied by a particular Territory couldbe directly related to the demands of that Territory for increased services.201. These two schemes can be summarised as follows:  Scheme ICustoms and Excise Duties ...

We have found it extremely difficult to make a choice between these two courses, although the majority of us would prefer the former.We consider that the Governments at the Review Conference should decide between themselves which course will give the greater advantage in the totalsettlement.203. The work of the Fiscal Commission will be of crucial importance.In the present climate of opinion, its work must necessarily be a matterof political controversy, particularly where the interests of the four Govern-ments conflict. We feel confident that special care will be taken to ensurethat the Commission will, as in the past, be so composed as to demon-strate its independence and impartiality.
MACHINERY OF CO-OPERATION BETWEENGOVERNMENTS204. In any federal state it is essential that there should be effectiveconsultation between governments. The constitution divides legislativepower between a federation on the one hand and states or territories onthe other; but in a complex, modern society, with its closely related andinterdependent activities, the actual work of government is not so neatlydivisible. At innumerable points, the responsibilities of the federation and its states meet and mingle. Their duties are intimately interwovenbecause, at bottom, they have the same purpose in view. They seek the welfare of the same people and the prosperity of the same economy. Theyare simply two different agencies co-operating for the public interest; anytendencies they may show, as autonomous governments, to become rivalcentres of power, must be resisted and overcome. The success of theirjoint enterprise depends largely upon co-operation. In any federation, itis essential that friendly, constant, and efficient co-operation among govern-ments should be developed in every possible way.205. Article 42 (2) of the Federal Constitution provides that the Govern-ments of the Federation and the Territories shall in so far as practicableconsult on all matters which are of common interest and concern. Almosteverything within the field of government falls within this description. Agood deal of consultation between Governments takes place already throughcommittees and meetings of Ministers and senior officials. But we becameconvinced during our tour of the Federation that the machinery of consulta-tion needs to be strengthened and improved.206. Except in the economic field, to which we refer below, we do notconsider that this can be done by expanding the provisions of the Con-stitution. We believe, however, that better administrative arrangements could be made for carrying out the intention of Article 42 (2). We con-sider that much would be gained if definite arrangements were made for holding meetings at regular and fairly frequent intervals. If, moreover,these conferences could take place in turn in the three capitals, Salisbury,Lusaka and Zomba, it would further emphasise the co-operative natureof the Federal enterprise and the important part which each Governmentplays in it. The need for more effective consultation is greatest in theeconomic field, and a transfer of functions from the centre to the Terri-torial Governments on the lines we have recommended will make that need more pressing still.207. The Report of the Conference on Closer Association in 1951*recommended (paragraphs 53 and 54) that there should be a &quot;Develop-ment Commission composed of representatives of the central and the threeterritorial Governments and Legislatures and that, working in the closest
mtouch with it, there should be a Central Planning Staff, with the necessaryexperts, forming part of the appropriate federal Ministry. It would bethe function of the Development Commission and the Central planning staff to co-ordinate and keep under review the development needs and programmes of Central Africa as a whole.&quot;208. In 1956, an inter-Territorial Development Planning Groupappointed to consider the 1957/61 developments plans of the four Govern-ments, did little more than co-ordinate the presentation of those plans.Each Government planned developments in its own sphere within the limits of its own resources, and there was no assessment of priorities either asbetween Federal and Territorial spheres within each Territory, or asbetween the three Territories. In November, 1958, the question arose of extending the lives of the development plans to 1963. Once again, theGroup became responsible only for summarising and co-ordinating the presentation of the plans after they had been approved by each Government.This summary represented the overall plan for the Federation. No specific provision was made for a further meeting of the Group to consider thedevelopment plans beyond 1963.209. We think the recommendation of the 1951 Report was imaginative,but that the planning machinery actually set up was inadequate for the task of full economic development. While, as we have said in Chapter 4, muchhas been accomplished since 1953, in our opinion more could have beendone had permanent economic planning machinery been set up as theReport of 1951 recommended.210. We now therefore come to a recommendation to which we attachparticular importance. It is that the Constitution should provide for apermanent body, to be called the Economic Development Council, to co-ordinate at Ministerial level all plans for economic development. By this we do not mean a body with supra-governmental powers, but a Councilcomposed of Ministers responsible to their own Governments and Legis-Legislatures. The Council would be advisory. At the same time, its Ministerialcomposition should enable it to gain such prestige and authority as toexercise great influence over all four Governments. Nothing less than a council of Ministers will serve the purpose in view.211. This Economic Development Council should be charged with thetask of keeping all four Governments continuously advised on the co-ordination of their development plans and on their general economic policies. It should be made clear in the Constitution itself that responsibilityfor carrying out development plans, or other economic policies, would lie with the respective Governments, according to their constitutional powers.212. The Report of 1951 recommended a permanent planning staff. Wethink that, subject to what we say in paragraph 214, it should be a matter for the Council itself to decide what staff it required.213. We considered whether the Economic Development Council should,like the present Loan Council, consist solely of the Finance Ministers of thefour Governments. We think, however, that each Government should send to the Council two Ministers, one of whom would be the Minister of Finance.If there should be another Minister charged by his Government with respon-sibility for development projects, it would seem right that he should
sit with the Minister of Finance at meetings of this Council. Moreover, weare aware that, at any rate for some time, the Finance Ministers from eachof the Northern Territories are likely to be civil servants, and we see advan-tage in associating political Ministers with them in this work. Both ministers from each Government would necessarily be bound by the principle of collective responsibility within their own Cabinets or Executive Councils,and would act as representatives of their Governments in the co-ordination and adjustment of the Federal and Territorial development plans, and inthe mutual adjustment of other aspects of economic policy.214. In Chapter 14 we recommend that more Africans should be trainedto take over higher responsibilities in government. If each Governmentsends two Ministers to the Economic Development Council, one of them is likely soon to be an African, at any rate in the two Northern Territories.We hope this will be so, and also that the Ministers who serve on the council will be assisted by advisers, whether from the Legislatures or the civilservices, some of whom will be Africans.215. The Constitution should also make provision for deputy ministers to be appointed to act for both the Finance Minister and the other minister from each Government. We consider that the appointment of such deputiesshould be in the hands of the Prime Ministers or Governors as the case may be.216. The work of the Loan Council and of the Economic development council will be closely related. The necessary liaison between them will be assured by the presence on both Councils of the Ministers of Finance ofthe four Governments.217. The Report of 1951 recommended the setting up of a Tariff AdvisoryCommittee. In any country there is a conflict of interest between those whobenefit from free imports and those who benefit from protective tariffs. Thisconflict of interests can set up strains in a Federation if some of the con-stituent units are likely to benefit more than others from protective tariffs.It is desirable to have some machinery for consideration of adjustments to relieve such strains. Whether this should take the shape of a TariffAdvisory Committee, possibly as a subsidiary of the Economic development council, is a question about which we do not propose to make any definiterecommendation. It is one which, we consider, can best be examined bythe Economic Development Council itself.
CHAPTER 11THE REMOVAL OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ANDTHE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIP218. Racial discrimination, though diminishing, remains one of the moreimportant forces working against Federation. The reference to &quot;partner-ship &quot; in the Preamble to the 1953 Constitution led Africans to believe thatdiscrimination would quickly disappear. The fact that it did not, and thatthe term itself has remained undefined, has resulted in growing suspicionand disillusion. We think that Governments should take positive stepsto remove unfair discrimination, particularly in those spheres for which theyare directly responsible. Some discriminatory laws are desirable becausethey protect the interests of weaker communities or respect establishedhabits and customs which vary from community to community. In con-sidering reforms it is important to distinguish such laws from those whichare unfairly discriminatory.219. Throughout our tours of the three Territories we heard muchevidence of racial discrimination. Such discrimination operates mainly tothe disadvantage of non-Europeans, particularly Africans, and is one of their basic grievances*. Discrimination is more rigid, and is entrenched by more comprehensive legislation, in Southern Rhodesia than in the two northern territories, and more so in Northern Rhodesia than in Nyasaland.220. Unlike the two Northern Protectorates, Southern Rhodesia was established by conquest over the Matabele, Mashona and allied tribes asa field for European enterprise and settlement. It was administered by theBritish South Africa Company until it attained &quot;responsible Government, andthe Colonial Office policies of indirect rule, and the training of Africansfor self-government, were never applied to it. For thirty-seven years it hasbeen ruled with efficiency and energy by its white community of settlers andtheir descendants, who are justly proud of their achievements in turningwilderness into fertile farms, in founding industries and cities, and in pro-promoting African welfare and education. The African population, whichpreviously was continuously ravaged by tribal wars, epidemics and famine,has not only trebled in number since the Europeans entered the country,but has enjoyed security and a steadily rising standard of living.221. But in spite of this history of peaceful development, the maintenanceof the colour bar and the prevalence of discrimination in SouthernRhodesia has turned the Africans of the Northern Territories, and many ofthose within Southern Rhodesia itself, against the Europeans who controlit. It follows that no new form of association is likely to succeed unless.Southern Rhodesia is willing to make drastic changes in its racial policies..We recognise that much progress has lately been made in this direction.Certain hotels can now apply for multi-racial licences and several have done* For note of reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Katilungu, see page 135.
so. Legislative steps have been taken to promote the establishment of non-racial trades unions and ito provide for workmen&apos;s compensation and appren-ticeships on a non-racial basis. The Southern Rhodesia Government recentlyplayed its part with the Federal Government, the Northern rhodesia government and the Railways Administration in extending the range of jobs open to Africans on the Rhodesia Railways. In addition, a numberof irritations have been removed, such as certain restrictions on betting andbuying alcoholic liquor. Multi-racial sport is beginning to be an acceptedpart of Southern Rhodesian recreations. While these are only beginnings,they do mark a trend which is accelerating and is moving in precisely the opposite direction to the trend of present government policy in the Unionof South Africa. Even since we were working in the Federation, a SelectCommittee has recommended the radical reform of the Land ApportionmentAot. But what has been done, however good, is not enough, if the fearswhich have bedevilled Federation are to be allayed. To say that events aremoving fast in Africa is a truism. They are moving like an avalanche, andit appears only too likely that those who merely cling to their familiarpositions will be swept away. We strognly urge, therefore, that, if it is thegenuine desire of the Europeans of Southern Rhodesia to preserve an asso-ciation with their neighbours in the north, they should remove as quickly as possible from their laws and practices all instances of unfair racial discrimination.222. The unfairly discriminatory laws and practices which we thinkshould be removed, wherever they exist throughout the Federation, includerelatively minor, if irritating, matters such as restrictions on the use byAfricans of cinemas, hotels, bars, restaurants, cafes and public lavatories andon their buying certain types of liquor. They also include the followingmore important matters about which we have heard particular criticism.The Pass Laws in Southern Rhodesia223. These not only hamper an African in travel, but oblige him to carry the appropriate pass whenever he is in a town, and particularly when he goesout at night. We think that, except in so far as certificates of identity maybe required for all inhabitants irrespective of race, passes should be abolished. We understand that the Southern Rhodesia Government is atpresent considering legislation on this subject.Urban Local Government224. The present system whereby electors for municipal and other local councils are limited to ratepayers results in inadequate representation of african interests. Even where African representatives are elected, this isat present limited to special African advisory bodies. We think that Africansshould be able to qualify for the vote in municipal and other local councilelections. We also think that they should be directly represented on the council&apos;s themselves and not merely on advisory bodies associated with them.The Public Services225. Much dissatisfaction exists among Africans because opportunities for their advancement in the public services are still so limited, and, in asmuch as special facilities for training in certain branches of the service
are provided for Europeans and not for Africans, there is discrimination.No Africans have yet been promoted to commissioned rank in the police forces of the Territories or in any branch of the defence forces of theFederation*. Although the Senior Branch (Branch I) of the Federal CivilService is open to all races and some Africans are now employed in it,Europeans are eligible for direct entry whereas non-Europeans, other thandoctors, can enter only through Branch II. There are at present no non-Europeans serving in the Southern Rhodesia Civil Service, though theSouthern Rhodesia Government have announced their intention of takingearly action to admit them.Advancement in Industry226. Discrimination exists in a number of industries, where Africansget much lower pay than Europeans even when they have the same quali-fications. They are still often not admitted to apprenticeships, nor are theytrained in sufficient numbers for the more skilled posts in industry and com-merce; this applies not only to private firms but also to industries directly or indirectly controlled by Governments.The Southern Rhodesia Land Apportionment Act227. This Act is regarded by Africans as a major discriminatory measure.It reserves for the sole use of Europeans some 48 million acres of land,and prevents Africans from occupying plots in the main towns of SouthernRhodesia. It also contains provisions which protect African land and trading rights. Without these, Africans would not have been able, in the face of direct competition from European businessmen with capital resources and wide experience, to build up businesses in African townships. And,although the 21 million acres of the Native Reserves were already securedto them under the Constitution, the additional 21 million acres of Africanland in the Native Purchase Areas and in the Special Native Areas wouldhave been a fraction of what they are today if protection had not been givenby the Act against European purchase. The value of these protective aspectstends to be overlooked by Africans because of the intensity of their feelingsabout those aspects which discriminate against them. The Act was intro-duced as a result of the Morris Carter Land Commission of 1925, and the thirty-five years which have elapsed since then have made many of its provisions out of date. This was recognised by the Government of SouthernRhodesia when they appointed a Select Committee two years ago to examinethe resettlement of Africans and other related matters. This committee reported on 16th August, 1960, and made a number of recommendations which, we believe, if accepted, will go a long way to remove the majorcauses of African dissatisfaction.228. The Select Committee heard evidence from many people and went into this complex and difficult matter far more thoroughly than we could have done. As a result of its Report, the Government of Southern Rhodesiawill no doubt reconsider its whole attitude to the question of the tenure, use and occupation of land. We do not, therefore, wish ourselves to makeany specific recommendations. However, evidence we heard suggested to us that African dissatisfaction would be considerably relieved if, in the* For note of reservation by Mr. Crawley, Mr. Gondwe, Mr. Katilungu and Mr. Molson,see page 135.
towns where new development is taking place, land could toe set aside for purchase toy all races!; if, in the European urban areas, Africans couldacquire or occupy land for trading or professional purposes; if the powerof proprietors of hotels, places of entertainment and the like to- refuse entry to Africans could be withdrawn ; and if, in the african rural areas, freeholdtitle to any land could be acquired by any African. We would also liketo endorse the views expressed toy the Select Committee in the following passage of their Report:  &quot; One of the major difficulties arising from the operation of the Actis the illogicality of reserving land in a particular area for purchaseexclusively toy members of one race, to the exclusion of members ofthe other race. For example, an African or a European, with thenecessary financial resources and other qualifications, who wishes to buy a particular piece of land, may be debarred from doing so solely on the grounds that the land in which he is interested is situated in an area reserved for occupation toy members of the other race. Whateverjustifications there may originally have been for this attitude it isdifficult to justify this artificial barrier in 1960 when the crying need is for more development and for an increase in the national output.This demands the freeing of all land from unnecessary restrictions.&quot;The Select Committee recognises that the protective aspects of the Actare still of some importance, and, although the repeal of the Act should bethe ultimate objective, this clearly cannot be attained until certainprerequisites have been met. With this view we agree.General229. We shall recommend in the next chapter that Councils of state should ibe set up at the Federal and Territorial levels to examine, and where necessary delay, new legislation and to report on any existing legislation which they regard as unfairly discriminatory. We here further recommendthat the Governments should remove as quickly as possible all the unfairlydiscriminatory practices which remain, in order not only to eliminate griev-ances, but to give a positive impetus to the development of partnership.In particular, we consider that the Governments should give the lead byrooting out instances of discrimination which have grown up in thoseenterprises over which they have direct control. We think that theyshould consider carefully how to apply the principle of equay pay for equal responsibility in the public services.230. We consider that in the field of social, economic and commercialpractice it is both possible and indeed desirable for Governments to legislateto make unfairly discriminatory practices, except in the sphere of purelyprivate relationships, illegal. The view is often put forward that suchpractices will ultimately foe reformed through changes in public opinion,and that legislation is therefore unnecessary and also undesirable. We donot believe that this is the correct approach. In a multi-racialcommunity it is the duty of Governments in matters of this kind to leadpublic opinion. In particular, we hope that the Governments will legislateto ensure that no person who conducts a trade, profession or businessby virtue of some sanction of the state, shall be permitted under the law to admit in the conduct of his business any discriminatory practices on grounds of colour, race or creed.
SAFEGUARDSThe Need for Safeguards231. We attach great importance to the constitutional reforms which wehave already recommended. But we do not believe that these changes willalone suffice to solve the political problems of a multi-racial Central Africa.We are convinced that parliamentary government, on the Westminstermodel, as it exists in the older Commonwealth Federations, will not by itself meet the special needs of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Africans do not trust the legislatures of the present; Europeans have grave doubts about the legislatures of the future. AH races cannot help but fear that their rights may be infringed and their interests prejudiced by the legislatures of either the Federation or the Territories. Many of the witnesses who appeared before us insisted that, before Federation wentforward to full membership of the Commonwealth, new or more effectivesafeguards should be provided and fundamental human rights guaranteed.We agree with this view. We believe that it is essential to improve theexisting safeguards, to devise new ones, and to ensure that their effectivenesscontinues.232. In both the Federal and the Territorial spheres, various safeguardsalready exist Which either protect collective rights or prevent discrimination against particular groups. The African Affairs Board, a standing committeeof the Federal Assembly, was established to oppose the passage of legisla-tion unfairly discriminating against Africans. The powers possessed bythe Government of the United Kingdom and its officers, including those ofreservation and disallowance, can also be used to stop objectionablelegislation. In addition there are provisions in the Territorial Constitutionswhich protect Africans&apos; land rights ; and by Section 33 (2) of the federal constitution, the special Treaty rights of the Barotse people in relation toland are guaranteed.233. These safeguards are important so far as they go. But they havelimitations, and some of these limitations are already clear. The AfricanAffairs Board has in recent years lost the confidence of the Africans. TheBoard&apos;s prestige and usefulness were seriously injured when it triedunsuccessfully to ikeep the Federal Constitution Amendment Act of 1957and the Federal Electoral Act of 1958 off the statute book. In the eyes of many, this failure was a convincing proof of the Board&apos;s ineffectivenessas a safeguard.234. This however is not the only defect in the existing safeguards.They have other and equally important limitations. They guarantee collec-tive but not individual rights ; and they protect Africans but not other groups. These limitations will grow more serious as the nature of theFederal and Territorial Governments changes. At present an injured partycan still appeal to Her Majesty&apos;s Government through a Secretary of State ;
but the strength of this &quot; element of subordination &quot; has declined, and willdecline further as the Territories and the Federation advance along the path of self-government. New safeguards should be devised to meet these developments. Old safeguards must be broadened and strengthened. It isessential to widen the scope of the existing protection and extend it to individuals as well as to groups.Fundamental Rights and Freedoms235. Safeguards may be of two kinds, legal or political; protection maybe supplied by the courts or by political institutions designed for this purpose.In Enghsh-speaking countries the fundamental liberties of the subject are expressed in common law rights which are protected by the courts, and insome countries the United States is an example these rights have beenembodied in a written constitution. Great Britain and several of the older members of the Commonwealth have not followed the American example,but the Parliament of Canada is now considering the enactment of a Bill of rights. Bills of Rights are part of the Constitutions of Nigeria and Malaya,and at the recent Nyasaland Constitutional Conference in London it wasagreed that a list of fundamental liberties might in future be written into theconstitution of that Territory. We have come to the conclusion that, in theinterest of greater security, a Bill of Rights ought to be included in theConstitution of the Federation.   Such a Bill of Rights would in particular:(a) help to allay the fears of domination which disturb the main sectionsof the population, and give them greater confidence in the future;(b) provide a criterion or standard upon which institutions, whetherpolitical or judicial, could base their protection of the people&apos;srights; and(c) guard the liberties of all persons whether they were Federal citizens,British subjects, British protected persons or aliens.Provisions of the Bill of Rights236. We believe that the Bill of Rights should be drawn up in accordancewith the traditions of the English-speaking world and the current practice ofthe multi-racial Commonwealth ; and we hope that, though comprehensivein scope, it may be made a fairly brief document expressed in general terms.We include here, as an illustration of what we have in mind, the mainportions of a new Bill of Rights proposed in the Parliament of Canada:&quot; It is hereby recognised and declared that in Canada there have always existed and shall continue to exist the following human rightsand fundamental freedoms, namely:(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprivedthereof except by due process of law ;(b) the right of the individual to protection of the law without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religionor sex;(c) freedom of religion;id) freedom of speech;(e) freedom of assembly and association; andif) freedom of the press.
All the Acts of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after thecommencement of this Part, all orders, rules and regulations thereunder,and all laws in force in Canada or in any part of Canada at thecommencement of this Part that are subject to be repealed, abolished oraltered by the Parliament of Canada, shall, unless it is otherwise expresslystated in any Act of the Parliament of Canada hereafter enacted, be soconstrued and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or toauthorise the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of any of therights or freedoms recognised by this Part, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no such Act, order, rule, regulation orlaw shall be construed or applied so as to(a) authorise or effect the arbitrary detention, imprisonment or exileof any person;(b) impose or authorise the imposition of torture, or cruel, inhumanor degrading treatment or punishment;(c) deprive a person who has been arrested or detained(i) of the right to be informed promptly of the reason forhis arrest or detention,(ii) the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, or(iii) of the remedy by way of habeas corpus for the deter-mination of the validity of his detention and for his release if the detention is not lawful;id) authorise a court, tribunal, commission, board or other authorityto compel a person to give evidence if he is denied counsel,protection against self crimination or other constitutionalsafeguards;(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordancewith the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations; or if) deprive a person of the right to a fair and public hearing by anindependent and impartial tribunal for the determination ofany criminal charge against him.The Minister of Justice shall, in accordance with such regulations asmay be prescribed by the Governor in Council, examine every proposedregulation submitted in draft form to the Clerk of the Privy Councilpursuant to the Regulations Act and every bill introduced in the Houseof Commons, in order to ascertain whether any of the provisions thereofare inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of this Part.Nothing in this Act shall be construed to abrogate or abridge anyhuman right or fundamental freedom not enumerated therein that mayhave existed in Canada at the commencement of this Act&quot;.237. Without seeking to draft the precise terms of a Bill of Rights forthe Federation, we think that something on the lines of the Canadian modelis required.The Enforcement of the Bill of Rights238. The enforcement of the Bill of Rights will be the duty of the courts of the Federation, with a right of appeal from the Supreme Court to the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Articles 54 and 55 of the presentFederal Constitution already provide for the settlement of constitutionalcases within the Federation. The entrenchment of a list of fundamentalrights in the Constitution will enable any citizen, corporate body, or anyone of the four Governments concerned, to question in the courts theconstitutionality of any piece of legislation or any executive action on theground that it has violated the provisions of the Bill of Rights. Anaccused person or litigant will be able to rely on the Bill of Rights in the presentation of his case. It may be advisable to require the FederalAttorney General or the Attorney General of a Territory, in a proper case,at the instance of any person or corporate body, to bring the matter beforethe Federal Supreme Court.239. It is essential that the Bill of Rights should bind the TerritorialLegislatures and Governments just as effectively as it binds the federal legislature and Government. At present section 14 of the Order in council which brought the Federation into being subjects the Territories to theprovisions of the Federal Constitution. In future it might be advisable to write into the Constitution a provision which declares the Constitutionitself, including the Bill of Rights, to be the supreme law of the land. Asan additional safeguard we think that the Federal Bill of Rights shouldbe incorporated, in exactly the same terms, in each of the TerritorialConstitutions. This list of fundamental liberties should be constantlybefore the Territorial Legislatures as well as before the Federal Parliament.The Need for a Political Safeguard240. A Bill of Rights, however comprehensive, will not by itself providea completely satisfactory safeguard for the inhabitants of the Federation.There remains the problem peculiar to a multi-racial state, that of dis-crimination on grounds of race, colour or religion. This is a matter of deep and anxious concern to both Africans and Europeans. Discrimina-tion, open or disguised, is present in many kinds of human activity andmay occur in a wide range of laws and executive actions. It is oftenharmful, but it may at times be beneficial where it is used to protect theinterests of weaker classes or groups. To distinguish between beneficialand harmful discrimination is a difficult and delicate task which the courtscannot appropriately be asked to undertake. We believe that this is apolitical problem for which a different safeguard is needed. In additionto the Bill of Rights there should be established a political body speciallycharged with the prevention of unfair discrimination. In the present Con-stitution the African Affairs Board partly serves this purpose. But it is highly desirable that in future the protection which the Board attempts to afford to Africans should be extended to all racial communities. Theproblem is to devise the political institution which will most effectivelyachieve this end.241. Various possibilities have been suggested to us in evidence. Anumber of witnesses have proposed an Upper House or Senate in theFederal Legislature. We have decided against this. A Senate would beable to deal only with Federal legislation, but the Territorial Legislatureswould be just as likely and, with increased functions, have even morescope to introduce discriminatory measures.    It would be possible of
course to establish Upper Houses or Senates in all the Territories as wellas in the Federation, but this would mean a much more cumbrous and expensive political system than most people would probably be willingto accept and pay for. A Senate could review all legislation submittedto it, but would not be able to delay or reject money Bills, and moneyBills might very well contain discriminatory features. Moreover, it is very likely that a Senate would lose that impartiality which it is so desirablethat an institutional safeguard should possess. In the parliamentary system the Upper House or Senate is invariably subjected to the strong pressuresof party politics. Senators, whether appointed or elected, usually tend tofollow the party line fairly faithfully. The Senates in other Common-wealth federations have not been very conspicuous for their successfuldefence of regional or minority interests.Councils of State242. We have examined other possible institutional safeguards and con-cluded that Councils of State, modelled on the lines of the Council ofState in Kenya, would most satisfactorily attain the object we have inview. A Council of State is a relatively new institution, and its consti-tutional position and function should be clearly understood. It wouldnot be an integral part of the Legislature of the Federation or of any territory. Its function would be to deal with one aspect only of the Billslaid before the particular Legislature with which it was concerned. its main task would be to distinguish between beneficial and harmful dis-crimination and to protect persons against the enactment of legislationunfairly discriminatory on grounds of race, colour or creed. The councils of State would have no power to make, amend or annul any law. Theywould perform their protective task by drawing attention to any legisla-tion which was in their opinion unfairly discriminatory in order that itsobjectionable features might be removed or modified. By an &quot; unfairlydiscriminatory &quot; measure we mean any Bill or legislative instrument any ofthe provisions of which are, or are likely in their practical application tobe, disadvantageous to persons of any racial or religious community andnot equally disadvantageous to persons of other communities, either directly,by prejudicing persons in that community, or indirectly, by giving an advantage to persons of another community. The Councils of State wouldintervene in the legislative process only when a proposed provision wasdiscriminatory and might in its practical application differentiate un-warrantably, and with a disparity of advantage or disadvantage, as betweenpersons of different communities. Discrimination should be the one con-cern of the Councils of State ; the prevention and removal of unfair dis-crimination should be their sole, all-important duty. The defence of theliberties set out in the Bill of Rights should be left to the courts and thecourts alone.243. We have considered whether there should be separate councils of State for the three Territories as well as for the Federation, or whethera single Council would suffice. Unlike a Senate or Upper House, a Councilof State would not be a part of the Legislature of the Federation or a territory. It would, on the contrary, be outside the legislative machineof any Government and therefore outside them all. A single Council might
perhaps serve the needs of the Federation as a whole with obvious advan-tages in the interests of both economy and uniformity of standards. But,while this may well be an ideal to pursue in the future, we do not think thatit would be wise to attempt to realise it at present. There are tensionsbetween Territory and Territory as well as between race and race, and atthis stage we feel that these would be more readily reduced by independentCouncils of State for each of the three Territories. A separate but closely associated Federal Council of State, made up of an equal number ofmembers from each of the three Territories&apos; Councils of State, could thenbe established to review Federal legislation. Another argument against asingle Council of State is that the simultaneous meeting of two or moreLegislatures might produce a mass of legislation which would be too largefor a single body to scrutinise efficiently.Composition of the Councils of State244. We have given a great deal of thought to the composition of the council&apos;s of State, and we have reached agreement on several important points. We think that every member of the Federal Council of state must be a member of a Territorial Council of State and that none shouldbe a member of any Legislature. We are convinced that members of the council&apos;s of State should be selected solely on grounds of their personaleminence, experience and detachment, and we hope that they will act aswise and impartial men and not as spokesmen of their race or Territory.The Federal Council of State should, we believe, consist of twelve persons and have an equal number of members chosen from each of the three territories. We recommend that the Governor-General and the fourChief Justices of the Federation should appoint the members of the federal council of State from the membership of the Territorial Councils of State,and additionally choose an independent chairman with a casting vote only.So long as Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs protection extends to the northern territories, each Governor of those Territories, in consultation with his chief Justice and with the approval of the Secretary of State, should appoint the members of the Council of State for his Territory. There shouldbe not less than six members and an independent chairman.245. We have rejected the idea of a Senate or Upper House as an effective constitutional safeguard for the Federation and the Territories.Southern Rhodesia however may decide that it should have a Senate. Evenif it does, we still believe it should write the Bill of Rights into its Con-stitution, establish a Council of State, and lay down a definite procedure for amending any entrenched clauses in its Constitution. We agree that southern Rhodesia should devise its own system for appointing membersof its Council of State, but this must be in such manner as will ensure itsindependence and freedom from political control. We suggest that the membership should be not less than six with an independent chairman.246. We have not, however, been able to agree about the racial corn-position of the Councils of State. Appointments to the Councils couldbe made either without any necessary regard to race or, alternatively, withthe purpose of producing some kind of racial balance. There are three possible solutions of the problem, none of which is favoured by an overallmajority of Commissioners.   We set these out below.
247. The chief purpose of the Councils of State is to prevent racial discrimination and to protect the interests of all races. Some of us believethat this purpose could be more certainly achieved if the composition ofthe Councils were to be racially balanced. Such a balance could takeone of two forms: first, parity between the two principal racial com-munities, Europeans and Africans; or, secondly, a less exclusive paritywhich would not preclude the appointment of Asians and Coloureds. Thefirst solution, which would divide the entire membership of each Councilequally between Africans and Europeans, unquestionably possesses strong political advantages. It would provide the greatest possible security for both the main racial communities and, as a result, it would be most likelyto win their confidence from the start. Those, however, who oppose this solution consider it undesirable in principle as being based upon a purelyand rather narrowly racial approach to the problem. more over it would not achieve the absolute parity desired. An independent chairman, with a casting vote, is a necessity for each Council of State,however composed ; and the chairman might upset the racial balance.248. The second solution is a modified version of the first. Here againequal numbers of Europeans and Africans would be appointed; but inthis case such appointments would not necessarily complete the full mem-membership of each Council of State and would therefore not preclude theappointment of members drawn from other races. Asians and Coloureds,Federal citizens qualified in other respects for public life, might thus havea place on the Councils of State ; and representation could be given tominorities very likely to be affected by racial discrimination. This alsois a racial solution of the problem a less exclusive racial solution whichwould not, however, give quite as much sense of security to Europeans andAfricans as the first scheme. Moreover, it has other weaknesses. Ifequality of Europeans and Africans in a Federal Council of twelve is to bemaintained this would mean that representatives of other races would always have to be appointed in pairs. The same requirements would existfor the Territorial Councils of State from which the Federal Council ofState is to be drawn. Those charged with the appointment of the membersof the Councils of State might find it difficult to make these double appoint-ments from the relatively small Asian and Coloured communities.249. The third solution is that appointments to the Councils of state should be made without a required regard to race. In principle this is obviously the most desirable solution. It would be one of the best means of ensuring that Councils which are created to prevent unfair racial discrimination should themselves rise above all considerations of race. Itis the ideal solution for a genuine multi-racial state ; but it is less politicallyacceptable, because less reassuring, than the two others. It would not, onthe face of it, provide the same security for the two main racial com-munities ; it might not inspire so much confidence.Functions of the Councils of State250. The Councils of State should be charged with the continuing dutyof reviewing proposed legislation with power under the different Constitu-tions to delay its passage through the Legislature if it is unfairly discrimination -natory.   They should also be required to recommend the introduction of
legislation to remove existing unfair discrimination. We believe that thetask of reviewing existing legislation for this purpose is one which theyshould be able to complete without great difficulty and in a comparatively short time. In addition the Councils of State should examine and report onany unfairly discriminatory trends that may develop. They should set upchannels by which news of such trends may reach them. But they shouldnot deal with the grievances of individuals as such. We recommendaccordingly that the Councils of State should have the followingfunctions:  (a) to consider proposed substantive legislation ; and if this was foundto be unfairly discriminatory to report accordingly to theLegislature;(b) to consider existing legislation and subsidiary legislation, and ifthis was found in any respect to be unfairly discriminatory toreport to the Government and the Legislature ;(c) to acquaint themselves with any unfairly discriminatory trends andto report thereon, while not dealing directly with individualcomplaints or grievances. In Northern Rhodesia the Central race relations Committee might be required to furnish reports tothe Council of State, and we suggest that the other governments should consider introducing legislation similar to the northern rhodesia Race Relations Ordinance of 1960. An alternative method would be for the Councils of State themselves to make arrangements by which they could be provided with the necessary information.Procedure251. On the question of procedure we feel that, even if we were in aposition to make detailed suggestions, it would be undesirable to do so.It would be better for each Council of State to make its own rules and lay down its own procedure. In general we commend the system adopted bythe Kenya Council of State ; but we are strongly, opposed to a Council ofState holding meetings in public with formal debate.Powers of Delay252. We have debated whether the Councils of State should have a power of veto and have decided against it. They should only have a powerof delay. The right to exercise an absolute veto would give the Councilsvirtually sovereign power and this would be constitutionally objectionable.At the same tima, if the Councils of State are to be effective instruments,adequate powers of delay must be conferred upon them, and formidablelegislative obstacles erected which the Bills they have reported adverselyupon must overcome before they become law. In the paragraphs which follow we set out our recommendations on the different processes whichshould be applied to ordinary legislation, money Bills, emergency legislation and subsidiary legislation.Ordinary Legislation253. In the first place each Bill would be submitted to the Council ofState not later than a definite period, fixed by the Constitution, before the
First Reading. If the Council reported the Bill as a whole, or any clause of it, as toeing unfairly discriminatory, then. (a) it would not toe possible for the Bill as a whole, or any clause ofthe Bill that was unfairly discriminatory, to be introduced in thatsession, or in any case within nine months of the date of the council&apos;s report;(b) thereafter the Bill could be introduced into the House without further reference to the Council of State. If it then received an affirmativevote of less than three-quarters of all the members of the House,it would be held not to have been passed ; but, if on the other hand it received an affirmative vote of three-quarters or more, it wouldtoe referred once more to the Council of State ;(c) if the Council again reported against the Bill and the government wished to proceed with it, it would toe necessary for the Bill togo to a referendum. To pass into law it would require the approvalof a majority of the electors in each of the main racial groups inmajority of the Territories and, in addition, a majority of all theelectors in each of the main racial groups throughout theFederation.254. The procedure set out atoove would toe applied to objections bythe Federal Council of State. As far as the Territorial Councils areconcerned (a) and (b) would apply ; as regards (c) the referendum would necessarily be confined to Territorial voters, and here we believe that themajority required should be two-thirds of those voting in each of the mainracial groups.Special Procedure during Protectorate Status255. During the period that a Territory enjoys protectorate status, the referendum procedure is inappropriate and should not be followed.During this period the effect of the final adverse report of the Council ofState should toe to require the Governor to reserve the Bill for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure.Money Bills256. The manner in which the Council of State should deal with moneyBills poses a problem which is peculiarly difficult. Such Bills might possibly be vehicles of seriously unfair discrimination ; tout to subject appro-appropriations to the scrutiny of a Council of State would give it virtual controlover the details of this aspect of government policy. Taxation or ChargingBills which impose general burdens upon the community are in a rather different category. We accordingly recommend that Taxation Bills should,and Appropriation Bills should not, toe sulbject to review and report bythe Councils of State.Emergency Legislation257. In Chapter 8 we have recommended that the maintenance oflaw and order should remain an exclusively Territorial function, and it follows that there should toe Territorial autonomy in the field of emergency legislation. Accordingly the Federal Legislature should have authority to enact emergency legislation only under its defence power in relationi to
war ; and in time of war we believe that the Council of State should not beempowered to scrutinise and question Federal defence measures. Thepowers of Territorial Governments to deal with an emergency should be exercisable even if their emergency provisions conflict with the Bill of rights, and the Councils of State should have no power to review and report upon such legislation. The duration of any emergency legislation shouldbe limited to two months unless the Legislature concerned resolves that itshall endure for a further stated period. The reserve powers of the governor should remain unaffected.Subsidiary Legislation other than Emergency Subsidiary Legislation258. It is of great importance that the Councils of State should be em-powered to review all subsidiary legislation, including regulations andby-laws made by local authorities, even though such review could only becarried out after such subsidiary legislation had been promulgated. If any provision in any piece of new subsidiary legislation is considered by a council of State to be unfairly discriminatory, the Council should recom-mend that it should become null and void. In practice, before making anysuch report, the Council would doubtless obtain the views of the minister or the local authority concerned. The Legislature, on receiving the report,should thereupon consider such subsidiary legislation and, unless within aperiod of three months of the receipt of the report it were approved by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of all the members of theHouse, the subsidiary legislation would become null and void.Amendments during the Passage of Bills259. Machinery will have to be provided to ensure that during thepassage of a Bill amendments of am unfairly discriminatory nature are notintroduced without the Council of State being made aware of them and given time to make a further report to the Legislature, if necessary.The Constitution260. The ultimate legal safeguard is the Federal Constitution itself. Itmust be made strong enough to resist hasty and ill-considered alterations.The greatest care will have to be taken to ensure that the provisions relatingto the Bill of Rights and the Council of State are specially entrenched. the safeguards mentioned should certainly be no less strongly protected than are the powers of the Council of State itself in relation to the passing of discriminatory legislation. We recommend that any amendment of theConstitution in respect of the provisions containing these safeguards shouldbe required to be approved by:id) the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of all the membersof the Legislature ; and(b) a referendum in which a majority of electors in each of the mainracial groups in a majority of the Territories and, in addition, amajority of the electors in each of the main racial groups votingthroughout the Federation approve the proposed amendment.These safeguards should be similarly entrenched in the Territorial Constitu-tions.
261. We wish to emphasise the importance we attach to the Bill of rights and the Councils of State being regarded not as temporary but as permanent features of the Federal and Territorial Constitutions. We trust that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will ensure that these two safeguards and themanner of their entrenchment will be retained in the constitutional instru-ments agreed upon at the time a Territory achieves self-government or, if itwishes to secede, at the time of its secession.262. There are certain other constitutionally significant Articles which weconsider should be more firmly entrenched in the Constitution than in themanner provided in the existing Article 97. These are the Articles whichgovern the composition of the Federal Legislature, the establishment ofthe Supreme Court, and the special right of appeal to the Privy Council.
OTHER REFORMSThe Site of the Federal Capital263. The siting of the Federal capital in Salisbury has undoubtedlycaused dissatisfaction and suspicion in ithe Northern Territories. We were told this by both Africans and Europeans. The latter maintain that thecapital should have been placed in one or other of the less developedNorthern Territories, thus stimulating development there, and that itslocation in Salisbury has led to a greater concentration of economic activity in Southern Rhodesia than is equitable. The African objections are partlypsychological, because it is felt that the Federal Government by being in salisbury comes too much under the influence of the Southern rhodesia government, and partly due to the racial discrimination which still exists in salisbury. It is difficult for Europeans to understand the strength of feelingaroused in Africans, who come to the capital of a multi-racial state and find that most of the amenities of the city are denied to them. There is therefore a strong case for moving the Federal capital from Southern Rhodesiaaltogether.264. On the other hand, to move the capital would involve very greatexpense and inconvenience. It would mean moving many hundreds ofcivil servants. The headquarters of a number of important business housesmight also find it necessary to move. A new city, possibly a new inter-national airport, would have to be built at a cost of many millions of pounds.265. If the recommendations for removing racial discrimination which we make in Chapter 11 are acted upon promptly, a main reason for Africandislike of Salisbury would disappear. The whole attitude to the siting of thecapital might change. In that event, the question of moving the capitalout of Salisbury to Warren Hills, which is an area set aside for that purpose,would again arise.266. We recommend that for the moment the administrative capitalshould remain in Salisbury, but that the Federal Legislature should meet ineach of the three Territories in turn, the first two meetings after the ReviewConference taking place in Lusaka and Zomba. This arrangement would admittedly involve inconvenience and some additional expense. If, there-fore, it appears at the end of two or three years that the removal of racial discrimination has made Salisbury acceptable as a capital to Africans, thenthis arrangement could be reconsidered. But, if Salisbury does not becomeacceptable, we think that the Governments will have to assess whether thepolitical objections to a Federal capital in Salisbury or its vicinity will notoutweigh the administrative and financial disadvantages of moving it else-where.The Name of the Federation267. So strong is African opposition in the Northern Territories to federation in its present form that the very word has become a term of
abuse. We are convinced that the term &quot; Federation &quot; has in itself become a serious political liability, and that the Federal association in its new formmust start with a new name.268. Of the many suggestions we have considered, the first groupembodies the idea of Central Africa, for example New Central Africa, the associated States of Central Africa, the Central African States, the Common-wealth of Central Africa or the Kingdom of Central Africa. The attractionof using the words &quot; Central Africa&quot; is that it is already familiar. Forexample, Nyasaland was once called the Central African Protectorate.Further, if these words were embodied in the title, nationals could callthemselves Central Africans. An objection is that there is already a federa-tion called the Union Republicaine D&apos;Afrique Centrale.269. Another group of suggestions includes the words &quot; Rhodesia and nyasaland&quot;. Many people would like to see the word &quot; Rhodesia&quot;preserved. Examples are Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Commonwealth of rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Associated States of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,and the Kingdom of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Yet another suggestionis Zambesia or Zambia.270. Nevertheless, we feel that, when the new form of Federation hasbeen settled at the Review Conference, the Governments themselves will want to choose the new name.
THE PUBLIC SERVICES271. In Chapter 8 we dealt with the need to transfer to the territorial governments responsibility for those functions of Government affecting theday to day life of the inhabitants of the Federation. If this recommendation is accepted, three major departments and several smaller ones will betransferred to the Territorial Governments. This will involve the eventualtransfer of thousands of public servants.272. We do not think we can advise the Governments concerned inany detail on how they should carry out this transfer. We have suggestedthat the immediate difficulties can foe minimised by the amendment ofArticle 32 of the Federal Constitution to enable the Territories to delegate to the Federal Government power to continue to administer these functionsuntil such time as the Territories are ready to assume the responsibilitythemselves. At that stage, the Territorial Governments will have to workout, in consultation with the Federal Government, the Public Service Corn-mission and the staff associations concerned, machinery for transferring thenecessary staffs with the least possible dislocation.273. Besides the question of transferring civil servants from one Govern-ment to another, there is also the need to build up, even more quickly thanat present, the number of locally recruited civil servants. Few africans in the Federation have as yet received training in the arts of government.We are well aware that time is needed for this, but the pressure of eventsis mounting rapidly. While we were sitting in London, the independence of the Congo brought with it bloodshed and violence, mutiny of the armed forces, the dangerous breakdown of essential services, and the calling in ofUnited Nations troops and professional and technical assistance. Fearsaroused by this Congolese tragedy have not made our task easier, for theyhave tended to harden opinion on both sides. Many Europeans, alarmedat the results of premature independence, incline more towards a slowing down of the pace of political advance. On the other hand, most Africanshave read the lesson of the Congo as a warning against going too slowly inthe training of Africans to take over the reins of Government. In ouropinion these recent events, and the rising temper of nationalism in Africagenerally, demand an intensification of effort in training local men toassume higher responsibilities in every field of government, including defence and internal security.274. In the Joint Announcement of 27th April, 1957, the United Kingdomand Federal Governments accepted in principle that all civil services in theFederation would eventually toe locally based and that steps should betaken to work towards this objective. The position in the Federation isunusual, in that there are a substantial number of local Europeans whoare available for recruitment to the public services. Thus the building upof a local service is not synonymous with &quot; Africanisation&quot; as it is in
most other parts of Africa ; but the public services in the Federation should,by including Africans, Europeans, Asians and Coloureds, reflect the multi-racial character of the Federation itself. This process is complicated bythe fact that the public services in the two Northern Territories contain a substantial number of members of Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas Civil Service,who are available for service in any of the British dependent territories and not merely in Central Africa. On the other hand, the public servicesof the Federation and Southern Rhodesia are largely recruited locally. Thusthere are at present four distinct public services, whose members serve on different salaries and conditions.275. We heard much evidence from Europeans in favour of a locallybased civil service with a much greater degree of local recruitment. Itwas argued that civil servants should have a stake in the country inwhich they serve and should not be transient residents, returning regularlyto the United Kingdom on leave and eventually retiring there. against this, we heard much evidence of the loyal and disinterested service givenby expatriate civil servants. Although there is a general desire amongthe African population to accelerate the Africanisation of the public services,there is also wide recognition in the two Northern Territories of the need to retain the services of senior members of Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas CivilService. This is not merely because of their expert knowledge, but also because the people look to them to carry out the role of the UnitedKingdom Government as protecting power. By many Africans, indeed,they are regarded as a visible symbol of the direct link of the two northern territories with the Crown. On the other hand, Africans do not wish theretention of such civil servants to retard entry of Africans into higherposts.276. We recommend that the Governments concerned should withoutdelay put in hand a comprehensive review of the public services in theFederation, having regard to the special problems we have described. Thisshould include examination of the method of establishing an entirely locallybased service of members from all races in the Federation. Such an enquiry will have the benefit of a wide field of experience elsewhere, asis borne out by the constructive thought given to this subject by the public services Conference held in London in February and March, 1960. we also wish to draw attention to the announcement by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies in the House of Commons on 27th July, 1960, and therecommendations contained in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the report of therecent Conference on Nyasaland*.277. We also recommend that the Governments should, together, plan to establish joint machinery for recruiting candidates, both local and overseas,for the public service. They will need to arrange for regular authoritativesurveys of the expected demands for educated manpower. They shouldalso aim at unifying conditions of service under all four Governments.This would facilitate the interchange of officers between the different servicesand provide a flexibility in staffing which would enable any future transfers of functions to or from the Federal Government to ibe carried out with greater smoothness.* Cmnd. 1132.
m278. It is particularly important to ensure that enough local candidatesof the required standard come forward for entry to the public services. Thisdemands an educational system which will provide more Africans withthe necessary qualifications. The provision of universal primary education is a principle accepted in most countries. But, where resources are limited,this is not necessarily the best way of using the available money and teachers. The expansion of higher and secondary education for Africansis preferable in the interests of providing an adequate supply of qualifiedcandidates for the public services and of redressing the present lack of balance between Africans and Europeans in their higher branches. Butreform of the educational structure may not by itself ibe sufficient for thispurpose, and would in any case take time to carry out and produce results.All four Governments should therefore give urgent consideration to settingup special institutions to train, both before and during service, civil servants of all races, possibly on the model of the Institute of Administration atZaria in Northern Nigeria. The present practice of sending selected studentsoverseas for training should, of course, continue.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT279. We have recommended in previous chapters a pattern of politicalinstitutions, both Federal and Territorial, designed to remove tensions,fears and suspicions and to meet reasonable and legitimate political aspira-tions. Peace and contentment are naturally enhanced if the satisfaction ofpolitical desires is accompanied by economic prosperity and the developedsocial services which can be built only on that prosperity. But this necessaryprosperity will not be sufficiently guaranteed merely by the political stabilitywhich our earlier recommendations seek to secure. Specific measures topromote economic progress must go hand in hand with those required inthe political field. In this chapter, therefore, we consider this complementaryquestion.280. Our investigations in the Federation made it abundantly clear thatthere is a vast scope for future development, both economic and social.Where so much needs to be done it is difficult to single out particular fieldswhere development should be concentrated. In any case, priorities must inthe end be decided by the Governments in the Federation in consultationwith each other. But we should like to mention in particular the need in all three Territories to develop African agriculture and to convert the existingsubsistence economy into a full cash economy ; to develop African educa-tion, with particular emphasis on technical and other post-primary educa-tion ; and, no less great, to expand industrial development. The Africanpopulation may well double itself within the next twenty-five years. to pursue these major aims of economic policy is, therefore, the more urgent and inescapable. It is as necessary as it was when the Fiscal Commission*made a similar recommendation in 1952 (endorsed by the Conference onFederation of January, 1953f) that economic policy should give specialweight to developing the poorer areas of the Northern Territories, so thata more uniform level of development throughout the Federation may beachieved. In particular, in Nyasaland the combination of a relatively smallland area with a large and growing population and grave poverty poses aspecial problem which must necessarily dominate all future economicthinking in the Federation. Without the solution of this problem political stability cannot be secured for long. Expenditure on current account alreadyexceeds revenue derived from Nyasaland itself by about  3^ million a year,and this figure is certain to increase. This shortfall has hitherto been metlargely by income derived from Northern Rhodesia. But there are areas inNorthern Rhodesia also where economic development, especially in agri-culture, needs urgently to be fostered, notably in the north-eastern parts andin Barotseland. It is becoming increasingly clear that development schemes both agricultural and industrial are no less urgent in Northern Rhodesiathan in other parts of the Federation, and Northern Rhodesia can ill afford to* Cmd. 8672, paragraph 17.t Cmd. 8753, paragraph 54.
divert elsewhere funds needed for these purposes. We hope that the UnitedKingdom Government will consider means of relieving the situation. Thereis also a great need for economic development in Southern Rhodesia moreparticularly in parts of the Native Reserves. We are not able to calculatewith any hope of accuracy what sums are likely to be required for all these purposes over the next five or ten years; it must be for the Governmentsthemselves to draw up plans and estimate their cost.281. In making these judgments we do not imply that no efforts havebeen made in the last seven years to improve the economy and to step upthe social services. Chapter 4 gives ample evidence of such efforts. But itis essential that the economic impetus which past expenditures have intro-duced should not be lost. Private investment in the future will be determinedby, among other things, the degree of political stability which it is possibleto achieve. Investment in the public sector will depend on the ability of thepublic authorities to attract both internal and external savings, and thatin turn will depend upon the confidence which investors repose in theFederation itself. To maintain the impetus of recent years the federal government must be able to raise regularly in the London market or inother overseas capital markets sums of the order of  10 million a year. recent events in the Federation and elsewhere in Africa have made it difficultto achieve that aim, and it is possible that the Federal Government may be unable, for some time to come, to borrow external funds of this magnitude.This situation may arise even if the Federal structure in its amended formshould be preserved. If, in the event, this does not happen, the problemof financing development in the three Territories will, in our view, beeven more intractable.282. For these reasons we are convinced that special measures are neededif the pace of development achieved in recent years is to be maintained and still more if it is to be accelerated. The implications of this conclusionare important. The Federal and Territorial Governments will naturallyseek whatever financial assistance they can get from international agencies,but we cannot ignore the special problems of negotiation and amortisationwhich are associated with borrowing from these sources. For example,borrowings from the World Bank involve a guarantee by the UnitedKingdom Government. Moreover, most international agencies prefer to lendmoney for specific projects rather than for general development. although there have been exceptions, we are not aware that the policy itself has been generally abandoned. There is the further disadvantage that the period for which loans are made by these agencies is invariably much shorter thanthe life of the assets to which they give rise. A burden of amortisation maythus be created.283. The Governments in the Federation may, therefore, be unable to rely entirely on international agencies for their needs. They may, however,hope to receive in the normal course from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom assistance from the Colonial Development and Welfarefunds now voted every five years for the development of all colonial areas.But something more than this is required in the Federation and it is something that the United Kingdom can most appropriately provide. Werecommend* that the United Kingdom Government should provide the* For note of reservation by Mr. Molson and Dr. Shepherd, see page 136.
Federation, through the machinery of the Loan Council, with exchequer loans at the lowest possible rates of interest, so as to make good so faras possible the shortfall which is likely to occur on borrowing in Londonand other capital markets.284. For the first few years this proposal might involve a considerablecommitment for the United Kingdom Government, but thereafter the commitment should decrease as the strength of the Federal economy grows.We are well aware that the resources of the United Kingdom for thispurpose are limited and that there are many claims upon them. We realisetoo that excessive overseas lending by the United Kingdom could create,as on occasion has happened in the past, a balance of payments problem which could react adversely on lenders and borrowers alike. For these reasons we think it important that the Governments of the Federation shouldnot rely wholly on external sources for the financial help they need, andthat they should continue to do all in their power to stimulate internalsaving and investment, thereby increasing their own contribution to thepolitical and economic stability of the Federal area.285. We have assumed that the Governments of the Federation willcontinue to endeavour to borrow on the capital markets of the world.In the normal course access to these markets disqualifies a country forconsideration for an Exchequer Loan. We hope that the United KingdomGovernment can find some way of surmounting this technical difficulty.If that Government agree to make Exchequer Loans, the Treasury will naturally continue to be concerned in the development plans on which theyare to be spent, and the extent to which these plans can reasonably be financed from internal sources. Nevertheless, we think it is primarily forthe Governments in the Federation themselves to plan their developmentjointly and to decide upon priorities, using the machinery of the existingLoan Council, and also of the Economic Development Council which wehave recommended.286. In recommending the provision of Exchequer Loans to theFederation, we do not wish to imply that grants may not continue to be both necessary and appropriate, but we think they should be related toprojects which cannot be expected to be largely self-supporting.
THE QUESTION OF SECESSION287. As we have already shown, a constant complaint of Africans inthe Northern Territories has been that Federation was imposed, not onlywithout full consultation with the majority of the inhabitants but against their wishes, and we were all too often met with the cry of &quot; secession)&quot;,particularly in Nyasaland. It has ailso frequently been questioned whetherthe individual Territories have or should have a legal right to secede.This has been1 the subject of much discussion and some misunderstanding.The Legal Position288. We therefore think it is desirable briefly to state our view of theposition in constitutional law.(a) The origin of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is unusual.Such an association normally arises when a number of states haveagreed upon a measure of delegation of their powers to a centralgovernment, and may thus be regarded as having a contractualbasis. This Federation cannot be so regarded, since it was created by the sovereign power of the United Kingdom exercised, in thecase of the (Northern Territories, as protectorates, under the ForeignJurisdiction Act, 1890, and in the case of Southern Rhodesia, as a colony, under the inherent power of the United Kingdom Parlia-ment to legislate for any part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions.(6) The Federation was established and its constitution was defined by anOrder in Council made by Her Majesty under the authority of an act of the United Kingdom parliament (the Rhodesia and NyasalandAct, 1953)*, section 1 (2) of which expressly reserves the right ofParliament to revoke or amend the Order in Council. Thus her majesty&apos;s Government retain unfettered power to make provisionfor the future of the Federation in any manner they may think fit.(c) The present Constitution does not confer on any of the TerritorialLegislatures any right, express or implied, to secede from theFederation.(d) The attainment of responsible government by any one of the territories does not import any such right.(e) In these circumstances there is no legal right on the part of any territory to secede from the Federation. To create a right of secession an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament would berequired.(/) It is provided by Article 99 that the Constitution shall be reviewed at a Conference to be convened not less than seven nor more thannine years from the date of its coming into force. This is an unprecedented provision in a federal constitution, as far as can be* 1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2.
ascertained, and there can ibe no legal justification for excludingfrom consideration at the Review Conference any part of theConstitution, including Article 1 which provides that the Federa-tion shall consist of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland. After the review, therefore, it must be for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to decide what is to be the future of the federation and to put its proposals before Parliament as to whether, and if soin what respects, the Constitution of the Federation should be amended or changed.Possible Courses of Action289. The following courses are open to Her Majesty&apos;s Government:  (i) The matter could be left entirely open, in which event the power ofthe United Kingdom Parliament to allow or refuse secession would remain unaffected.(ii) A new or amended Constitution could contain a provision expresslynegativing secession.(iii) A new or amended Constitution could provide, either expressly orby necessary implication, that a right of secession should in certaincircumstances accrue to each Territory.(iv) As an alternative to (ii) or (iii), instead of granting or prohibitingany specific right of secession in the body of the Constitution, her majesty&apos;s Government could state their intentions in a Declarationbefore the new or amended Constitution was promulgated, and thesubstance of the Declaration could be recited in the Preamble.290. There is nothing in the constitutional theory of this matter which makes a right of secession incompatible with the federal concept. It is said by some writers that the existence of such a right is difficult to reconcile with good or strong federal government, but the expediency of a provision forsecession in any particular case must depend upon the circumstances which led to federation. Given proper safeguards for determining the desires ofthe inhabitants of a territory contemplating secession and for preserving the interests of the remainder of the federation (for instance, in the main-tenance of services which ought obviously to be jointly operated, or in financial or customs matters), a right of secession may provide a valuablesafety valve. It is not difficult to envisage political and economic circum-stances in which the mere legal tie without any formal right of secessionwould be insufficient to prevent armed rebellion with the object of breakingaway. It is no more difficult to contemplate circumstances in a developingcommunity in which the existence of a right to secede would, far fromweakening a federation, enable it to survive. As a leading authority observesin his discussion of the subject, &quot; There are cases where to grant the rightto secede is to ensure that states will never exercise it &quot;*.291. The Preamble to the Federal Constitution cannot be interpreted asimposing any legal limitation on the power of the United Kingdom Govern-ment in respect of secession. But it clearly indicates the intention of theUnited Kingdom Parliament that the inhabitants should have the opportunityof deciding at the appropriate time whether the Federation should proceed* See Wheare, &quot; Federal Government &quot;, 3rd Edition, pages 90-92.99
to full membership of the Commonwealth, that is complete &quot; Statute of West-minster &quot; status, after which the Federal Government might be able to insist on the indissolubility of the Federation. It might also be read as a politicaldeclaration implying that the Territories of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would, on attaining self-government, have a right to decide whether to remainin the Federation or not.Secession and the Review Conference292. We are required to give our advice to the five Governments in preparation for the 1960 Review.293. In the declaration regarding the Review Conference annexed to theJoint Announcement by the Governments of the United Kingdom and theFederation made on 27th April, 1957, this statement appears:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Govern-ment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland have already made it clear that they are opposed to any proposal either for the amalgama-tion into a Unitary State of the territories now composing the Federationor for the secession of any of those territories from the Federation.&quot;294. As already pointed out, under the present Federal Constitution noquestion can arise of any legal right of secession; this would require a furtherAct of the United Kingdom Parliament. But in view of the provisions ofArticle 99 of the Constitution it is impossible to exclude the subject from consideration at the Review (see paragraph 288 (/)). The Secretary of Statefor the Colonies* has stated that African opinion will be represented at the review Conference; and it is inevitable that the question of secession will arise for discussion there. Further, the political situation has changedgreatly since the Joint Announcement was made, and the opposition to federation has hardened. The outstanding consideration is the existence ofan unfettered right in the United Kingdom Parliament to control the futuredestinies of the Territories, and its consequent responsibility for consideringand giving effect to the views of the inhabitants. Because of the importanceof the question of secession in the minds of many Africans, we think it shouldbe made clear before the Conference that this subject will in fact be discussedthere. This would no doubt affect the attitude of Africans towards theConference.295. In these circumstances we should be fading in our duty if we did notdeal with the question of secession in this Report. Before doing this,however, we wish to re-affirm the views already expressed in Chapters 4 and5. For the reasons stated there, we have no doubt that the continuedassociation of the three Territories is of vital importance to their inhabitantsand we regard with great concern the possibility of a break up of theFederation. Far from encouraging this we seek to secure the greatest possible measure of support for a new form of federal association; and we believethat, if the problem of secession is faced with courage and imagination onthe lines suggested in this chapter, the chances of success after a further periodof trial will be greatly increased.296. We have carefully considered the possible courses of action out-lined in paragraph 289.  If the question of secession were left entirely at
large after the Review, we are convinced that political controversy wouldbecome acute, and this would play into the hands of the extremists.We can see no advantage in this course and we therefore reject it.297. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to declare the Federation indis-soluble, as in the case of the Commonwealth of Australia, this mightremove uncertainty and promote external confidence, assuming that internalstability could also be maintained. No such assumption is justified. Onthe contrary this course would be seen again to involve the imposition of federation this time as a permanency without regard to the wishes of the inhabitants. In the prevailing atmosphere in the Northern Territorieswe believe that such a declaration would give rise immediately to serious political disturbance which would soon destroy any external confidencecreated by the declaration itself. We cannot, therefore, recommend thiscourse.298. On the other hand, we consider that a declaration of the intentionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government to permit secession by any of the Territories,if so requested after a stated time or at a particular stage of constitutional development, would have a very favourable effect and might be decisivein securing a fair trial for the new association. In the Northern Territorieswe have no doubt that such a declaration would ease the political tensiongreatly. In Southern Rhodesia many Europeans, although strongly favour-ing the continuance of the Federation, fear that if African Governmentscome into power in the North it may in the future become impossible tomaintain the association. We believe that those holding such views would welcome a contingent right of secession as a real safeguard.299. We believe that such a declaration would encourage those of moderate views among all races and would stimulate the growth of multi-racial political parties. It is inevitable that uncertainty would prevailduring the intervening period and we recognise that this would affectexternal confidence ; but neither of the courses discussed in paragraphs296 and 297 is free from this objection.300. We have reached the conclusion that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould make a declaration of intention to consider a request from theGovernment of a Territory to secede from the Federation. It thereforebecomes necessary to consider the time at which such a request shouldbe permitted, and whether any conditions should be attached.301. The time at which Her Majesty&apos;s Government might consider a request from a Territory to secede could either be related to the attainment of a certain stage of constitutional advance in the Territory itself, or basedon a particular period of years from the inception of the new federal constitution. The main argument for relating the time to a stage of con-stitutional advance is that the request for secession by a Government couldthereby be linked to an expression of the wishes of the inhabitants of theTerritory made through proper constitutional machinery. On the otherhand, since Territories might reach the required stage of constitutional advance at different times, this method might involve difficult questions as to the relation of one Territory&apos;s right to request secession to that ofthe other Territories. The main argument for stipulating a number ofyears from the inception of the new Constitution is not, however, that it101
would avoid such difficult questions, but that it would give a degree ofcertainty in the matter and thereby serve to remove agitation.302. On the basis of a fixed period of years, it would be necessary todecide the precise period. Some of us think that a reasonable period would be seven years. This period is based on the assumption that it might take between four and five years from now for the Northern territories to reach the stage of responsible government, and that thereafter it wouldbe reasonable for those Governments to enjoy responsibility and gainexperience before reaching a decision whether or not to make a request to secede from the Federation. Others, however, consider that feelings onthis subject in the Federation are such that it would not be possible to prescribe a period of more than five years ; such a period would, forexample, take account of the wishes both of Chiefs and Native Authoritiesto remain under British protection, and also of political parties to reach the stage of responsible government, coupled with a right to secede, assoon as possible. Others, again, consider that a rather longer period than seven years should be laid down.303. If, on the other hand, the timing of a request to secede were linked to a stage of constitutional advance in a Territory, we think thatthe stage at which it would be reasonable to permit a Territory the rightto request secession would be when it attains self-government. For thispurpose we use the expression &quot; self-government&quot; to describe the positionreached when the final stage of progress to responsible government hasbeen attained through the disappearance of civil service Ministers, and through Ministers ceasing to be responsible to the Governor and becomingresponsible to a Legislature answerable to the electorate.304. A seceding Territory ought clearly to inherit certain obligationsarising from its membership of the Federation. Since 1953, many millions of pounds have been borrowed for development purposes on the credit of the Federation, and on more favourable terms than could have beenobtained by any one of the Territories borrowing on its own account.It is right and proper in these circumstances that a seceding Territory should accept responsibility for its share of the public debt of the Federal Govern-ment, and we think that this could be a condition of any arrangement forsecession. No doubt, however, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would take into account the financial ability of the Territory to meet this condition in full when considering the Territory&apos;s need for financial assistance atthat time.305. We also think that in the event of any Territory seceding fromthe Federation it would be advantageous to all three Territories if, fora number of years, a form of customs union was preserved between them.The industrial development which has occurred, and which we hope willbe maintained, has been designed to cater for a market which covers the entire Federation. If this market should be broken up by the erection of tariff barriers within the present Federal area, considerable and unneces-sary injury would be inflicted upon many enterprises and their employees,and new industrial development would be impeded by this prospect.306. We considered the question of making it a condition of secessionthat a customs union should be preserved for a period of, say, ten years.
We found it very difficult to see how this requirement could be imposedas a positive condition, but we nevertheless think it important that a customs union should be maintained under conditions which the secedingTerritory could freely accept without damage to its status.307. Secession under the second of our alternative proposals (see para-graph 310) could take place either before or after the seceding Territoryhad obtained self-government. If before, we do not doubt that her majesty&apos;s Government, in the exercise of its authority as the protecting power, would prevent the erection of internal tariff barriers. If after, theposition would be less simple. But we expect that any seceding territory would be anxious to obtain financial support from the United Kingdomeven if that only meant access to capital markets. In these circumstances we think it would not be unreasonable for Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto request the seceding Territory to enter into an undertaking to participate in a customs union for at least a number of years.308. We consider that the right to request secession should not remain open indefinitely and that it would be reasonable to set a time limit forits exercise.   We provide for this in our specific proposals in paragraph 310.309. We also considered whether some special constitutional procedure should be laid down to provide the necessary evidence within a territory of the genuine wish of the majority of its inhabitants to secede from theFederation. For example, there might be provision for a special vote ofthe Legislature, followed by a referendum, perhaps requiring a sixty percent majority. Since however it is impossible to foresee the exact con-ditions which would prevail at the time and also because the entire legalresponsibility in this matter rests with Her Majesty&apos;s Government, themajority of us have concluded that it would be better to provide thatthe manner in which the wishes of the inhabitants would be ascertainedshould be determined entirely by Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the time*f.We have no doubt that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would impose strictconditions to ensure that the genuine wishes of the inhabitants were fullyascertained, and that the issues were fully explained in an atmospherefree from intimidation. Some of us consider that the manner in whichthe wishes of the inhabitants are ascertained should be set out in theConstitution or in its Preamble.310. With these considerations in mind, we put forward two alterna-tive formulae which Her Majesty&apos;s Government might use as a basis fora declaration about secession. It would be for the Review conference to advise Her Majesty&apos;s Government which should be adopted.(a) The first formula is as follows:  &quot;After a Territory has attained self-government [as defined in paragraph 303], if the Government of that Territory so requests,Her Majesty&apos;s Government will take the necessary steps to ascer-tain, in such manner as Her Majesty&apos;s Government shall thendetermine, the wishes of the inhabitants of that Territory on thequestion whether they shall remain within the Federation, and* For note of reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Katilungu, see page 137.t For note of reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Woodrow Cross, Mr. Ellman-Brown, Mrs. Huxley, Mr. Robinson and Sir Victor Robinson, see page 137.103
will proceed to give effect to those wishes. The right to makethe request shall not, however, be exercised later than twelvemonths after all the Territories have attained self-government.Meanwhile, nothing will be done in the Northern Territories to diminish their Protectorate status. The possibility that a Terri-tory may make use of its right to request secession is not a con-sideration which will he taken into account in determining therate of that Territory&apos;s advance towards self-government.&quot;(b) The alternative formula, based on a stipulated number of years,would be:&quot; When [a stated number of]* years have passed from the timeof the coming into effect of the new Federal Constitution, if theGovernment of any Territory so requests within twelve months, her majesty&apos;s Government will take the necessary steps to ascertainin such manner as Her Majesty&apos;s Government shall then deter-mine, the wishes of the inhabitants of that Territory on the ques-tion whether they wish to remain within the Federation, and willgive effect to those wishes before the protection of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment over the Northern Territories is withdrawn and beforethe Federation attains fully independent status.&quot;311. Both these formulae give to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and notto the Government of the Territory concerned, or that of the Federation,the right to decide how the wishes of the inhabitants at the time shouldbe ascertained. We consider this necessary so that it should not be leftto one section of the community to determine the question whether ornot the Territory should secede. By the term &quot; the inhabitants &quot;, we donot mean merely those inhabitants who happen to be qualified for theTerritorial franchise at the time when their wishes are to be ascertained.312. Both formulae are designed to remove any doubts or misconcep-tion as to the willingness of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to afford protection to the Northern Territories until such time as the wishes of their inhabitants with regard to their future are clear. The first alsomakes it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not permit con-siderations relating to the request of a Territory to secede from the Federa-tion to affect their views on the pace at which constitutional advances in that Territory should be granted. The second formula, which is basedon a fixed number of years, would operate independently of the timing of a Territory&apos;s advance towards self-government, and its adoption couldnot give rise to any suspicion that secession was a consideration whichmight affect Her Majesty&apos;s Governments judgment in regard to a Territory&apos;sreadiness for self-government.313. When the actual time arrived for considering a Territory&apos;s request to secede, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to decide how best toensure the smooth transition of that Territory to a position of independ-ence from the Federation. The credit worthiness of the remaining mem-bers of the Federation, as well as of the seceding Territory should be preserved. Arrangements for the apportionment of assets and liabilities,for the assignment and control of the defence forces and for many othermatters would also have to be considered.* See paragraph 302.
314. If a declaration of intention were made by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in terms of either of the formulae, we consider it would be neitherappropriate nor necessary for it to be embodied in the new Constitution,but we recommend that the Preamble should foe amended to include an appropriate reference to it. We attach importance to this, since it wouldlend added authority to. the declaration and since, if the Preamble as wellas the Constitution were silent upon the matter, the declaration might not come as readily to public attention.315. No doubt from some points of view it would be preferable thatthe (Federation should be declared indissoluble. We have, however, shownwhy we cannot recommend such a course. It might in the last resortinvolve keeping the Federation together by force. We hope therefore thatif a right to request secession is recognised by the United Kingdom, theTerritorial and Federal Governments will make every effort to render theFederal association acceptable to their peoples.Accession of Other Territories316. We recommend that a provision be inserted in the Constitutionpermitting the accession of other territories. Such a provision exists in several Commonwealth constitutions.
THE ELEMENTS OF SUBORDINATION317. The Federation was established as a political entity under theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (Constitution) Order in Council,1953, in accordance with that Constitution. A wide measure of autonomywas conferred on the Federal Government under Her Majesty&apos;s sovereigntywith the ultimate goal of full membership of the Commonwealth. Incertain respects, however, the Federation remains subordinate to theGovernment of the United Kingdom, and to Parliament at (Westminster.In this chapter we deal with these so-called &quot;elements of subordination&quot;.318. The Federation^ full membership of the Commonwealth, implyinga status of independence from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, to which reference is made in the Preamble to the Constitution,can only be achieved through the removal of these elements of subordina-tion. It is therefore necessary to consider what they are, what effect theremoval of each would have, and the conditions under which they could beremoved. Of the eight elements of subordination we deal with below, thefirst and second relate to the exercise of a degree of formal authority whichis normally acquired by a member of the Commonwealth only when it becomes fully independent; the third is not directly an &quot; element ofsubordination&quot; ; the fourth has already virtually been removed by decisionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and the remainder are concerned with thesubstance of political control toy Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.The Royal Style and Titles319. The Preamble to the Statute of Westminster refers to the convention that any alteration in the law touching the succession to the Throne orthe Royal Style and Titles requires the assent of the Parliaments of all theDominions as well as that of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to anysuch alteration. The convention between the Dominions whereby eachadopts such Style and Titles as best suit its own particular circumstanceswas recognised in the Royal Titles Act, 1953, of the United Kingdom.This convention does not apply to the Federation, and any Federal lawproviding for separate Style and Titles for use by Her Majesty would berepugnant to the Royal Titles Act and would consequently be void by virtue of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, which applies to Federallegislation. Any alteration of this situation would require an amendmentof the Royal Titles Act.320. We consider that the application of the convention mentionedabove to the Federation would, apart from any arguments connected withthe Protectorate status of the Northern Territories, be appropriate only atthe time when the Federation attains full independence within theCommonwealth.
Appointment of the Governor-General321. The Governor-General is appointed on the advice of Her Majesty&apos;ministers in the United Kingdom after consultation with the federal government. Only after full independence is attained would a Governor-General be appointed by Her Majesty on the advice of Ministers of theFederation, and at that stage he would become the representative of her majesty and would have to act solely on the advice of Federal Ministers. Thisfollows the agreement reached at the Imperial Conference in 1926.322. Under the Joint Announcement by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the Federation of 27th April, 1957, a measure of direct access to the Sovereign was accorded the Prime Minister of the Federation onFederal matters affecting the Sovereign personally, on the award of Honoursfor services to the Federation and on a number of ceremonial matters.323. We consider that the Governor-General should not be appointed onthe advice of Federal Ministers until the Federation attains full independence within the Commonwealth, and that meanwhile the present arrangements should continue.Appeals by Special Leave to the Privy Council324. Article 63 of the Constitution preserves the right of Her majesty in Council to grant special leave to appeal to the Privy Council from the superior courts in the Federation, and the Federal Legislature cannot of itsown motion restrict or abolish such right.325. This is one of the provisions in the Constitution which we considershould be preserved and, in view of our recommendations concerning theintroduction of a Bill of Rights, specially entrenched. Even when theFederation attains full independence within the Commonwealth there is noreason why appeals should not continue to he to the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council in the same way as they still lie from a number of independent Commonwealth countries.The Rule against Extra-Territoriality326. There is a widely held doctrine that a Colonial Legislature has no general power to enact laws having extra-territorial effect. This doctrinehas sometimes been questioned and specific exceptions to it have beenestablished by judicial decision. In consequence, a doubt exists at present as to whether the Federal Legislature has power to pass legislation withextra-territorial effect. All doubts regarding the competence of the dominions to legislate with extra-territorial effect were settled by the Statute of West-minster. This doctrine embodies no important constitutional principle andinvolves no safeguard for any of the inhabitants of the Federation. It was represented to the United Kingdom Government that the Federal Legislatureshould have a similar power and, in the Joint Announcement of 1957, theUnited Kingdom Government agreed that legislation for this purpose wouldbe introduced into Parliament at a convenient opportunity. There is noreason why, even before achieving full independence, the Federation shouldnot enjoy this right. We therefore recommend that effect should now be givento this agreement by Act of the United Kingdom Parliament.
327. The Committee of Officials on page 75 of Possible constitutional changes, set out the present position as follows:  &quot; The fact that the Federation is not a full international person isnot the result of the wording of Item 1 (a) of the Federal LegislativeList. The Federation falls short of the status of a full internationalperson because, having regard to its Constitution as a whole, it is not an independent sovereign state; and it is questionable whether it wouldbe so regarded internationally so long as the United Kingdom Parlia-ment and Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom retainedany substantial degree of authority in relation to the Protectorates. Atpresent, in the context of public international law other states are entitledto look to the United Kingdom as the authority responsible for theinternational relations of the Federation. The Federal Government canassume international commitments and participate in international nego-tiations only to the extent to which the United Kingdom Governmentare prepared to authorise them and other states are prepared to treatwith them; and even in these circumstances it is the United KingdomGovernment who remain ultimately responsible in international law.&quot;328. We agree with this statement of the constitutional position. we also note that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to entrust responsibilityfor external affairs to the Federal Government to the fullest possible extentconsistent with Her Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibilities in internationallaw.  We have no change to recommend.Reservation of Bills329. Articles 10, 75 and 97 of the Constitution oblige the Governor-General to reserve for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure Bills inconnexion with the franchise, with a request by the African Affairs Board,and with the amendment of the Constitution. Article 24 confers upon theGovernor-General a discretion, on behalf of Her Majesty, to withhold assentfrom other Bills or to reserve them ; that is to say, the exercise of this power will not necessarily be in accordance with the advice of the ExecutiveCouncil.330. This reference to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and that dealt with inthe following paragraph may soon become increasingly anomalous and con-stitutionally objectionable. We have recommended in Chapter 12 that certain articles of the Constitution dealing with the Bill of Rights and the Councilof State and other important elements should be rigidly entrenched. It is onaccount of the inadequacy of the present safeguards and of the fear of anyweakening of the link with the Crown that African opinion has attachedsuch importance to the retention of these powers of reservation in the handsof Her Majesty&apos;s Government.331. Provided that our recommendations relating to safeguards are accepted, and when they have been embodied in the new Constitution, therewould in our view be no longer any need for the Governor-General to berequired to reserve for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure any bill introduced within the competence of the Federal Legislature. Equally, iwesuggest there would in those circumstances be no need for the retention any longer of the Governor-General&apos;s discretionary power to withhold assent
to a Bill. Nevertheless, as an interim measure we think that the Governor-General should still be required to reserve any Bill relating to the amendmentof the Constitution itself.Disallowance of Laws332. Article 25 provides for the disallowance by Her Majesty, through a secretary of State, of any law assented to by the Governor-General at anytime within twelve months of such assent. In the event of disallowance,annulment of the law follows.333. We have recommended in Chapter 12 the adoption of certain safeguards which are of such importance that they should be rigidly entrenched in any new Federal Constitution. A question accordingly arises whether it wouldany longer be necessary to preserve the power of disallowance. There seemsto be no reason why a law which has been validly passed, to which assenthas been given and which will probably have come into operation, shouldbe subject to a twelve months&apos; period of uncertainty as to whether or not itis going to be disallowed. As in the case of reservation of Bills, african opinion has attached importance to this power of disallowance, but, providedthat effect is given to our recommendations for safeguards, most of usconsider that the power of disallowance need not be retained*.Powers of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for the federation and the Rule of Repugnancy334. The United Kingdom Parliament has inherent power to legislate for any part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions except in so far as this has beenqualified by the Statute of Westminster. As far as the Federation is con-cerned, the Statute of Westminster does not apply and the overriding authorityof the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not affected either by the rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation Act, 1953f, or by the Order in council made under it.335. In the Joint Announcement of 1957 it was stated:&quot; The United Kingdom recognise the existence of a conventionapplicable to the present stage of the constitutional evolution of theFederation, whereby the United Kingdom Government in practice doesnot initiate any legislation to amend or to repeal any Federal Act orto deal with any matter included within the competence of the federal legislature except at the request of the Federal Government&quot;.This Announcement refers only to powers conferred upon the federal legislature by the Constitution and it cannot affect the legislative authorityof the United Kingdom Parliament to provide for the future constitutional development of the Federation and, for this purpose, to make any necessary amendments to the Constitution itself. It is essential that this right shouldbe retained.336. The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, which provides that anyFederal law that is repugnant to an Act of the United Kingdom Parliamentextending to the Federation is void, is a necessary accompaniment of theauthority of that Parliament to legislate for the Federation and its applica-tion to the Federation must also be retained.* For note of reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Katilungu, see page 138.t 1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2.
PROGRAMME OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADVANCES337. In our terms of reference we were instructed to advise the fiveGovernments in preparation for the 1960 Review on the constitutionalprogramme and framework best suited to the achievement of the objectscontained in the Constitution of 1953, including the Preamble. In thecourse of the foregoing Chapters we have set out the constitutional changes which we hope, if adopted, will enable the Federal association to continue.We have pointed out in Chapter 5 that, taken separately, none of the reforms we suggest would suffice to put matters right, and we have urgedthat our recommendations should be seen and considered as a whole.338. The many far-reaching reforms we have recommended cannot beput into effect by a stroke of the pen. It is, however, implicit in our recom-mendations that, in order to ensure the continuance of the Federal associa-tion, the carrying out of our recommendations should not be delayed.Certain important processes are involved: the amendment of the federal constitution ; the election of a new Federal Assembly ; the passing of anew Federal franchise law following the recommendations of the proposedfranchise committee ; the amendment of the Territorial Constitutions to incorporate a Bill of Rights and to establish Councils of State; theassumption of new functions by the Territorial Governments. All these processes must be closely co-ordinated in order to produce the new recom-mended pattern at the earliest date. Nevertheless, this will take time. Wetherefore recommend that a new Constitution for Northern Rhodesia, andsuch constitutional changes as may be desirable in Southern Rhodesia,should be negotiated and put into effect without awaiting the full revision ofthe Federal structure.339. Looking to the future, we believe that in terms of the Preamble tothe 1953 Constitution the Federation can only go ahead to its final goal of full independence within the Commonwealth at the stage when all three territories have achieved full self-government in the Territorial sphere.The period in which this might happen is related to our recommendations on the question of secession. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government decide to makea declaration of intention to entertain requests for secession from all three territories when a fixed period of years has elapsed from the inception ofthe new Constitution, the same period might be adopted as the minimum tobe allowed to elapse before all three Territories can be granted full self-government. If, on the other hand, the right of a Territory to requestsecession is linked to its attainment of self-government as defined in para-graph 303, it might be agreed that when all three Territories have reached that stage, and have decided not to request secession, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would at that time consider granting to the Federation independent status within the Commonwealth.
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS340. After an Introduction (Chapter 1), Chapter 2 describes the historicalbackground to Federation. Chapters 3 and 4 set out the dilemma presented by the present situation in the Federation, the conflict between the numer-ous, varied and deep-seated criticisms of the present arrangements, andthe clear evidence of the economic, material and also political advantages of Federation. Federation cannot, in our view, be maintained in itspresent form. On the other hand, to break it up at this crucial moment in the history of Africa would he an admission that there is no hope ofsurvival for any multi-racial society on the African continent, and thatdifferences of colour and race are irreconcilable. We cannot agree to sucha conclusion. In Chapter 5 we express the view that while the Federationcannot continue unless it commands general acceptance, a dissolution would lead to hardship, poverty and distress. We have considered and rejectedthree alternative forms of association, and state our view that the three territories could best go forward if they remained linked in a Federalassociation, but that it is too much disliked to survive in its present shape.We proceed to outline a number of changes, constitutional and other, toremove the main Objections. We endeavour to frame a new design into which all our proposals should be fitted and urge that our recommendations should he considered as a whole.341. In Chapters 6-18 we have set out these proposals in detail, andwe now summarise in the order of those chapters our main conclusions andrecommendations.Chapter 6 The Federal Legislature and Franchise(1) Two of us make proposals in regard to the composition of theFederal Legislature and the franchise which are in most respects at variance with all other members (paragraph 88 and Reservation (2)).(2) If some form of federal association is to continue, Africans mustin the immediate future have a much higher proportion of the seats inthe Federal Assembly (paragraph 88).(3) The franchise should remain qualitative, and there should be nodevalued or weighted votes ; it should be broadened to bring a larger numberof Africans on to the voters&apos; roll; it should include Africans with experience and judgment, even if without education or income qualifications ;and it should be designed to secure the election of a Federal Assemblyrepresentative of the broad mass of both African and European opinion(paragraph 88).(4) The Federal Assembly should not he reduced below its present size(paragraph 89).Ill
(5) We have not been able to reach agreement on the principles whichshould govern the proportion of seats as between Africans and Europeans.We therefore set out, with arguments, several possible courses (i) Some of us favour the traditional policy of staged development.A possible next stage would be an arrangement whereby some members are elected on communal rolls and others on a common roll. There would be three categories of seats. Taking, forexample, an Assembly of sixty members with twenty seats in eachcategory, twenty members would be elected on a communal roll of europeans, and twenty on a communal roll of Africans, both on a low franchise. The remaining twenty would be elected on acommon roll, on a franchise based on the principles stated in (3)above. Alternatively, the balancing element on the common rollmight be ten seats, with two sets of twenty-five communal seats(paragraph 93 and Reservation (3)).(ii) A smaller number of us believe that the enormous majority of africans in the population calls for an African majority in Parlia-ment (paragraph 94).(iii) The majority of us consider that the only basis for the division which is fair both to Europeans and Africans, and the one whichhas the best chance of securing acquiescence by a substantial numberof people in both the two principal communities, is parity betweenthem, secured by reserving an equal number of seats for europeans and Africans [paragraph 96).(iv) Some of us, while supporting parity as an aim, feel that thereshould be a gradual approach to it, and that at this stage no definite recommendations should be made as to the timing of its introduction, although it should not be delayed longer than necessary.But the largest group of us think that it should be introducednow (paragraphs 99 and 100).(6) All members should be elected on a common roll. But measures willhave to be taken to ensure that they are sufficiently representative of theirown racial community. This might be done through primary electionson communal rolls. If, however, the Governments cannot agree a methodof election using a common roll, it might be preferable for them to declarethe common roll as an objective, and to consider whether arrangements should be made, as a last resort and as a purely interim measure, to holdelections on communal rolls (paragraphs 101-104).(7) Electoral divisions would have to be deUmited separately for eachof the two main racial groups. The choice between two possible methodswould have to be examined carefully on the spot (paragraph 105).(8) We think that the Assembly should consist of sixty voting members and a Speaker. As to the distribution of seats between the Territories,there should be ten Africans from each. European seats could be distributed in various ways, but most of us suggest seventeen for Southern Rhodesia,ten for Northern Rhodesia, and three for Nyasaland (paragraph 106).(9) The Speaker should be appointed from outside the Federal Assembly.Alternatively, if it were decided to select him from within the Assembly,
he should vacate bis seat, which would be filled by a bye-election (para-graph 107).(10) The majority of us consider that a committee should be appointedto make recommendations as to the details of the franchise, and that the review Conference should consider the composition of such a committee.Most members of this majority consider that this franchise committee shouldbe given additional guidance on broad requirements (paragraph 108). Someof us believe that the Review Conference could settle the terms of the franchise without the need for a special franchise committee (Reservation(4)).(11) We also make recommendations on the basic qualifications for the vote. We see no need for a basic literacy test for persons otherwise qualified(paragraph 109).(12) The franchise committee should also consider whether the Federalfranchise qualifications should vary from Territory to Territory, bearing inmind that the more voters on the Territorial roll who are disqualified from voting in Federal elections, the more difficult it will be to obtain Africansupport for Federation (paragraph 110).(13) Most of us recommend that the Asian community should be repre-sented in the Assembly by one non-voting member. The franchise com-mittee should consider in what way he should he chosen (paragraph 111).(14) It should be made possible for individual members of the Colouredcommunity to decide for themselves whether they wish to be regarded asAfricans or Europeans for the purpose of standing for election and, ifcommunal rolls are adopted, being registered as voters (paragraph 112).Chapter 7 The Territorial Constitutions(15) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should declare as soon as possible that further constitutional advance towards full self-government will be made inthe near future in Northern Rhodesia (paragraph 114).(16) A Conference similar to that held recently on the NyasalandConstitution, and similarly representative of all the main political and racialgroups, should be held without delay to work out the nature and timing ofthe necessary changes (paragraph 114).(17) Most of us recommend that there should be in Northern Rhodesiaan African majority in the Legislature, and an unofficial majority in theExecutive Council, so constituted as to reflect the composition of theLegislative Council. Some of us consider that the time has not yet comefor an African majority in the Legislative Council (paragraph 114). Othersthink that there should be an African majority in the Executive Council aswell as in the Legislative Council (Reservation (5)).(18) If the franchise is not lowered sufficiently to bring a reasonablenumber on to the voters&apos; roll in any particular area, consideration should begiven to reserving special seats for the tribal authorities in those areas, orto electing persons under some system whereby the tribal authorities would form electoral colleges (paragraph 117).(19) It is important that nothing should he done to diminish the traditional respect in which Chiefs are usually held by their communities.
All possible steps should toe taken to stamp out the intimidation which,apart from its other effects, is undermining the authority and status of theChiefs (paragraph 119).(20) Barotseland enjoys a special position. Its future status, and itsrelationship with the Federation and with Northern Rhodesia, require futher detailed examination and negotiations between the Paramount chief and the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Federation and northern rhodesia (paragraphs 121 and 122).Chapter 8 Allocation of Functions between Governments(21) The basic principles which should govern the allocation of functions are (1) Matters affecting the day to day life of the inhabitants should beTerritorial subjects.(2) No subject should toe divided toefcween the Federal and territorial governments on a racial basis.(3) The Federal Government should be responsible for all matters connected with external relations, including trade relations.(4) The Federal Government should enjoy the basic and necessarymeans to regulate the economy of the Federal area, and taxationshould toe regarded as an essential instrument of control of the economy (paragraph 127).(22) To facilitate the transfer of functions from the Territorial to theFederal Governments, and vice versa, we suggest the lines on whichArticle 32 of the Constitution should toe revised (paragraphs 130 arid 131).(23) Extra costs arising from transfer of staff should lie with theGovernment which assumes permanent responsibility for a reallocatedfunction (paragraph 132).(24) Non-African education, all roads and prisons should becomeTerritorial subjects (Part B). The majority of us recommend that health and non-African agriculture should also become Territorial subjects. But someof us have reservations in regard to health (Part B and Reservations (6)and (7)). Some of us consider that non-African agriculture in northern and Southern Rhodesia should remain Federal (Reservation (8)).(25) The definition of marketing should toe altered (paragraph 140).(26) The Loan Council which at present controls all external publiccapital issues should in future also control all internal public capital issues(paragraph 155).(27) A number of other proposed changes in allocation of functions, ordefinitions, are set out in Part C of Chapter 8 and Appendix IV.Chapter 9 Powers of Taxation and Fiscal Arrangements(28) Revenue can toe divided on a percentage or on an annual grantsbasis. We have considered the respective merits of the two systems butmake no recommendation as to which is preferable (paragraph 189 (a)).(29) Provision for making additional grants or loans (Article 95 of theConstitution) should remain (paragraph 189 (bj).
(30) Territorial surcharge on income tax should continue to he leviable,but its upper limit should be expressed as a money sum per  1 of incomeor profits, not as a percentage of basic tax (paragraph 189 (c)).(31) The Territorial Governments should have power to levy a graduated poll tax on a non-racial basis (paragraph 189 (d)).(32) On the assumption that one of the two taxation schemes werecommend (see (34) below) is adopted, the Federal Government shouldhave the power to levy sales or purchase tax, the proceeds to be added tothe pool of revenue referred to below (paragraph 189 (e)).(33) The proceeds of customs and excise, and of the income and profitstaxes, should be pooled for division between the Federal and territorial governments (paragraph 190).(34) We have considered two alternative schemes of taxation, sum-marised in paragraphs 199 and 200. We leave it to the Review conference to decide between them. The majority of us prefer Scheme I.Chapter 10 Machinery of Co-operation between Governments(35) The machinery of consultation needs to foe strengthened and improved (paragraph 205).(36) To carry out the intention of Article 42 (2) of the Constitution,definite arrangements should be made for holding inter-governmentalmeetings, at regular and fairly frequent intervals, in turn in Salisbury,Lusaka and Zomfoa. This will emphasise the co-operative nature of federation and the important part to be played by each Government(paragraph 206).(37) The Constitution should provide for setting up an advisoryEconomic Development Council, composed of two Ministers, one of whom would foe the Finance Minister, from each Government, to co-ordinate allplans for economic development (paragraphs 210, 211 and 213).(38) We hope that Ministers and advisers on this Council will includeAfricans (pamgraph 214).(39) The question whether to set up a Tariff Advisory Committee,possibly as a subsidiary to the Economic Development Council, is forconsideration by the Economic Development Council itself (paragraph 217).Chapter 11 The Removal of Racial Discrimination and theDevelopment of Partnership(40) Racial discrimination, though diminishing, remains one of the moreimportant forces working against Federation. In considering reforms itis important to distinguish discriminatory laws which are desirable fromthose which are unfairly discriminatory (paragraph 218).(41) Racial discrimination exists in all parts of the Federation, but ismore rigid and more comprehensively entrenched in Southern Rhodesia.No form of association between the Territories is likely to succeed unlessSouthern Rhodesia is willing to make further and drastic changes in its racialpolicies (paragraphs. 219-221).(42) The more important discriminatory laws and practices which shouldbe removed or amended include the Pass Laws in Southern Rhodesia,
discrimination in Local Government in urban areas, in the public servicesand in industry, and the Southern Rhodesia Land Apportionment Act(paragraphs 222-228).(43) Governments should take the lead in removing, as quickly as possible,particularly in those enterprises over which they have direct control, all theunfairly discriminatory practices which remain, in order not only to eliminategrievances, but to give a positive impetus to the development of partnership.(paragraph 229).(44) In the field of social, economic and commercial practice, it is bothpossible and desirable for Governments to legislate to make unfairly dis-criminatory practices, except in purely private relationships, illegal (paragraph230).(45) We hope that Governments will legislate so as to ensure that no person who conducts a trade, profession or business by virtue of some sanction of the state, shall be permitted to admit in the conduct of his business anydiscriminatory practices on grounds of colour, race or creed (paragraph 230).Chapter 12 Safeguards(46) It is essential to improve the existing safeguards, to devise new ones,and to ensure that their effectiveness continues (paragraph 231).(47) The safeguards should be extended to guarantee individual as well ascollective rights (paragraph 234).(48) A Bill of Rights should be included in the Constitution of theFederation (paragraph 235).(49) The Bill of Rights should be drawn up in accordance with the tradi-tions of the English-speaking world, and the current practice of the multi-racial Commonwealth (paragraphs 236 and 237).(50) The Bill of Rights would be enforced by the courts, with a right ofappeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (paragraph 238).(51) The Bill of Rights in the Federal Constitution should be in-corporated, in identical terms, in each of the Territorial Constitutions (para-graph 239).(52) Federal and Territorial Councils of State should be set up, modelledon the Kenya Council of State (paragraph 242).(53) These Councils of State should not be integral parts of any Legis-kture. Their main task would be to protect persons against the enactment of legislation unfairly discriminatory on grounds of race, colour or creed(paragraph 242).(54) There should be separate Councils of State for the Federation and foreach of the three Territories (paragraph 243).(55) Every member of the Federal Council of State should be a memberof a Territorial Council of State, and not a member of any Legislature.Members should be selected on grounds of personal eminence, experience and detachment, to act as wise and impartial men and not as representativesOf races or Territories (paragraph 244).(56) The Federal Council of State should consist of twelve persons, withan equal number of members from each Territorial Council of State,appointed by the Governor-General and the four Chief Justices of the
Federation, who would also choose an independent chairman having acasting vote only (paragraph 244).(57) While the Northern Territories remain under Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs protection, each Governor, in consultation with his Chief Justice andwith the approval of the Secretary of State, should appoint the members ofthe Territorial Council of State, which should be composed of not less than six members and an independent Chairman (paragraph 244).(58) Southern Rhodesia should devise its own system of appointingmembers of its Council of State, but in such a manner as will ensure itsindependence and freedom from political control; there should be not lessthan six members and an independent chairman (paragraph 245).(59) We have been unable to agree about the racial composition of the council&apos;s of State (paragraph 246).   There are three possible solutions:(i) An absolute parity between the European and African communities(paragraph 247).(ii) A less exclusive parity which would not preclude the appointmentof Asians and Coloureds (paragraph 248).(iii) Appointments made without regard to race (paragraph 249).(60) The functions of the Councils of State should he (a) to consider proposed substantive legislation and, if it is found to beunfairly discriminatory, to report accordingly to the Legislature ;(b) to consider existing legislation and subsidiary legislation, and, if it isfound to be unfairly discriminatory, to report accordingly to theGovernment and the Legislature.(c) to acquaint themselves with any unfairly discriminatory trends andreport thereon, without dealing directly with individual complaints(paragraph 250).(61) The Councils of State should not have a power of veto, but only of delay (paragraph 252).(62) The application of their powers to ordinary legislation, moneyBills and subsidiary legislation are differentiated (paragraphs 253-258)(63) The Councils of State should have no powers in relation to emergency legislation. The duration of such legislation should be limited to two months,unless the Legislature concerned resolves that it should endure for a furtherstated period (paragraph 257).(64) While a Territory enjoys Protectorate status, a special procedure should apply. If the Council should make a final adverse report, the bill would be reserved for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure (paragraph255).(65) The provisions relating to the Bill of Rights and the Councils of state should be specially entrenched in the Federal and Territorial Constitutions.In the Federal Constitution, amendment of provisions for these safeguardsshould require (a) the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of allthe members of the Assembly, and also (b) a special referendum with re-quirements as stated in paragraph 260.
(66) The Bill of Rights and the Councils of State should be regarded as permanent features in the Federal and Territorial Constitutions, and we trust that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will ensure that these safeguards, and themanner of their entrenchment, will be retained at the time when a Territoryachieves self-government, and if it wishes to secede, at the time of itssecession (paragraph 261).(67) Certain other Articles in the Constitution should be more firmly en-trenched than in the manner provided in Article 97 (paragraph 262).Chapter 13 Other Reforms(68) The administrative capital should remain for the present in Salis-bury, but the Federal Legislature should meet in each of the three territories in turn, the first two meetings after the Review Conference being in Lusakaand Zomba (paragraph 266).(69) If in two or three years time the removal of racial discriminationhas made Salisbury acceptable as a capital to Africans, the above arrange-ment could be reconsidered. If not, the Governments will have to assesswhether the political objections to a Federal capital in&apos; Salisbury or itsvicinity will not outweigh the administrative and financial disadvantages of moving it elsewhere (paragraph 266).(70) The term &quot; Federation &quot; has in itself become a serious politicalliability, and the Federal association in its new form must start with anew name (paragraph 267).Chapter 14 The Public Services(71) There is a need to build up, even more quickly than at present,the number of locally recruited civil servants (paragraph 273).(72) The presence in the Federation of civil servants drawn from different sources, serving on different conditions, raises special problems.The Governments should without delay put in hand a comprehensive review,and consider the method of estabhshing a locally-based service with membersof all races (paragraph 276).(73) The Governments should plan joint machinery for recruitment fromall sources ; and aim at unifying conditions of service under all four Govern-ments to promote flexibility in the transfer of staff between them (paragraph277).(74) In present circumstances, the expansion of higher and secondary education is more essential than universal primary education on account ofthe need to provide sufficient local candidates of the required standardfor entry to the public services, and in order to redress the present lackof balance between Africans and Europeans in the higher branches of theservices (paragraph 278).(75) The Governments should give urgent consideration to setting upspecial institutions for training civil servants of all races, while continuing to send selected students for training overseas (paragraph 278).
Chapter 16 The Question of Secession(80) The question has frequently been raised whether Territories have,or should have, legal right of secession. Our view is that the present constitution does not confer on any of the Territorial Legislatures any rightexpress or implied to secede from the Federation, and that the attainment of responsible Government does not import any such right. This couldonly be created by an act of the United Kingdom Parliament. We statefour possible courses open to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in settling a new or amended Constitution. Nothing in constitutional theory makes a rightof secession incompatible with the Federal concept (paragraphs 287 to 290).. (81) It should foe made clear before the Review Conference that thequestion of secession will foe discussed there (paragraph 294).(82) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should neither leave the question of secession entirely open nor declare the Federation indissoluble (paragraphs296 and 297).(83) A declaration of the intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government topermit secession toy any of the Territories, if so requested after a stated(76) There is a vast scope for economic and social development in thewhole area. The grave poverty and over-population of Nyasaland pose aspecial problem, tout there are also other areas in which economic develop-ment is badly needed. Economic policy should continue to give specialweight to developing the poorer areas of the Northern Territories, in orderto achieve a more uniform level of development throughout the Federation(paragraph 280).(77) We hope that the United Kingdom Government will consider meansof relieving the situation at present caused toy the diversion of funds, needed for development in Northern Rhodesia, to meet the shortfall in Nyasaland&apos;scurrent account (paragraph 280).(78) The economic impetus achieved through expenditure on economicprojects in the last seven years should not toe lost. Reliance cannot beplaced solely on aid from international agencies, or on normal grants from the United Kingdom Government. To maintain the impetus the federal government must toe able to borrow in capital markets sums of the orderof  10 million per annum. Because of recent difficulties in the Federation and elsewhere in Africa, this may not toe possible (paragraphs 281-283).(79) A majority of us consider that the United Kingdom Governmentshould be willing to provide the Federation, through the machinery of theLoan Council, with Exchequer Loans at the lowest possible rates of interest,to make good so far as possible the shortfall likely to occur in borrowingon the markets. Access to these markets should not disqualify the Federa-tion for consideration for such Exchequer Loans (paragraphs 283-285 andReservation (1.1)).
time or at a particular stage of constitutional development, would havea very favourable effect and might be decisive in securing a fair trial forthe new association. Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make such adeclaration of intention (paragraphs 298 to 300).(84) The timing of a request for secession should be related to a certainstage of constitutional advance in the Territory concerned, or to a periodof years from the inception of the new Federal Constitution. If the formeris chosen, we consider that the stage should be the attainment of self-government as defined in paragraph 303 (paragraphs 301 to 303).(85) A seceding Territory should accept responsibility for its share ofthe public debt of the Federation, and this could be a condition of any arrangement for secession (paragraph 304).(86) We do not see how it could be made a positive condition of secession that a customs union should be preserved for a number of years,but we think it important that a customs union should be maintainedunder conditions which the seceding Territory could freely accept withoutdamage to its status (paragraphs 305 and 306).(87) A majority of us consider that no special constitutional procedure should be laid down as to the manner in which the wishes of the inhabitants of a Territory with respect to secession should be ascertained. It shouldbe determined by Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the time (paragraph 309).Some of us recommend that this procedure should be decided at the ReviewConference (Reservations (12) and (13)).(88) Two alternative formulae as a basis for a declaration of intentionby Her Majesty&apos;s Government are put forward for consideration by the review Conference (paragraph 310).(89) Both give to Her Majesty&apos;s Government the right to determine how the wishes of the inhabitants of the Territory at the time should be ascer-tained. By &quot; the inhabitants1&quot; we do not merely mean those qualified forthe Territorial franchise at the time (paragraph 311).(90) Under both formulae it is made clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould continue to afford protection to the Northern Territories until such time as the wishes of their inhabitants with regard to their future are clear,The first formula also makes it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldnot permit considerations relating to a request of a Territory to secede to affect their views on the pace at which constitutional advances in that territory should be granted. The second formula would operate indepen-dentiy of a Territory&apos;s advance towards self-government (paragraph 312).(91) The declaration of intention should not be embodied in the newConstitution, but the Preamble should be amended so as to include an appropriate reference to it (paragraph 314).(92) Provision for the accession of other territories should be inserted in the Constitution (paragraph 316).
(93) The application to the Federation of a convention enabling it todetermine for itself the Royal Style and Titles would only be appropriateat the time when Federation attains full independence within the Common-wealth (paragraph 320).(94) The Governor-General should not be appointed on the advice of federal Ministers until the Federation attains full independence within theCommonwealth. Meanwhile the present arrangements should continue(paragraph 323).(95) The right of appeal by special leave to the Privy Council shouldbe entrenched. Even when the Federation attains full independence withinthe Commonwealth there is no reason why this right should not continueto exist (paragraph 325).(96) Effect should now be given, by Act of the United kingdom parliament, to Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ agreement of 1957 to give theFederal Government power to legislate with extra-territorial effect(paragraph 326).(97) We recommend no change as regards the powers of the federal government to conduct such of its external affairs as may be entrusted to it by Her Majesty&apos;s Government (paragraph 328).(98) Provided that our recommendations relating to safeguards are accepted and entrenched in the Constitution, the Governor-General should no longer be required to reserve for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasureany Bill within the competence of the Federal Legislature ; but, as an interim measure, he should still be required to reserve any Bill relating to theamendment of the Constitution itself (paragraph 331).(99) Most of us consider that, provided our recommendations as tosafeguards are accepted and entrenched, the power of disallowance of lawsshould be removed from the Federal Constitution (paragraph 333 andReservation (14)).(100) The right of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for theFederation, and the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865,must be retained in order to provide for the future constitutional develop-ment of the Federation (paragraphs 335 and 336).Chapter 18 Programme of Constitutional Advances(101) The legislative and administrative processes involved in carryingout the reforms which we have recommended must take time, but these shouldnot be delayed (paragraph 338).(102) A new constitution for Northern Rhodesia, and such constitutional changes as may be desirable in Southern Rhodesia, should be negotiatedand put into effect without awaiting the full revision of the Federal structure(paragraph 338).(103) The Federation can only attain full independence within theCommonwealth at the stage when all three Territories have attained
self-government in the Territorial sphere. The period in which that might occur can be related to our alternative recommendations regarding secession (paragraph 339).

*NOTE

Those Commissioners whose signatures are marked with an asterisk have signed the Report subject to their Notes of Reservation in the immediately following section.
RESERVATIONSCHAPTER 5.-GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AS TO A SOLUTION(1) Note of Reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. KatilunguWe want to make it clear that we have signed the Commission^Report, with reservations, only because it contains important recom-mendations which, in our view, are in the best interests of the country.By signing the Report we have not committed African Chiefs who gave evidence before the Commission as to their declared intentions and position regarding Federation.  The recommendations we refer to are (i) The opportunity for any Territory to secede from the Federation.We recall that the African political parties boycotted the Corn-mission because they wrongly thought that the terms of referencewould prevent discussion of the question of secession, which, infact, the Commission has now recommended.(ii) The transfer of some major Federal functions to the territorial governments.(iii) Constitutional advancement in the Northern Territories, with amajority of Africans in the Legislative Councils.(iv) Northern Rhodesia Constitutional Conference to be heldimmediately.(v) Removing in every sphere all discriminatory practices even, when necessary, by legislation.(vi) No granting to the Federation of Dominion status before each andall Territories have achieved self-government and have declared their intention to withdraw from or remain in the Federation.(vii) Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to continue as Protectoratesunder Her Majesty&apos;s Government until their full independence.(viii) The Commission recognise that no Federal association would be successful without the support of the African people in theNorthern Territories, unless held by force of arms.(ix) The Commission&apos;s majority recommendations for parity in theFederal Assembly.(x) The broadening of the Territorial and Federal franchises.2. Nevertheless, we wish to record our grave doubts whether any Federalassociation, even that recommended in this Report, will in fact gain theacceptance of Africans in the two Northern Territories. We considerthat, if the Review Conference fails to agree on the recommendations for some form of Federal association, the Conference should give immediate consideration to its replacement by a High Commission form of Govern-ment, similar to the East Africa High Commission. In our view the east african Territories have achieved a considerable measure of economic prosperity and social and political progress with this form of government,
Iand we consider that it would operate equally successfully in the caseof Central Africa. The Commission has, in fact, discussed, but rejected,in paragraph 80, this form of government; but concluded that, if Federa-tion is dissolved, this form of government would be better than nothingat all. We therefore feel that, in addition to other recommendations madeby the Commission, such as constitutional reforms, franchise and thequestion of secession, this matter should be discussed at the Review Con-ference so that Africans may be able to decide freely what form of govern-ment they prefer. We endorse the Commission^ recommendations inparagraph 82.CHAPTER 6.-FEDERAL LEGISLATURE AND FRANCHISE(2) Note of Reservation by Mr. Woodrow Cross and Mr. Elhnan-BrownWe are unable to support the majority recommendations of racialparity in the Federal Assembly, the suggested method of electing candidates,the implied lowering of franchise qualifications and the alteration in territorial representation.2. These majority recommendations, in our view, contradict themselvesin that there is apparently a desire to eliminate racial distinction so faras functions of Government are concerned yet, by adopting parity repre-sentation, racial politics are being introduced for the first time into thehighest instrument of Government in the land. Of much greater significance,however, is the fact that the introduction of racial parity would be a reversal of the underlying principles that parliamentary representations should be based on responsibility and not colour.3. For many years it has been the consistent policy of governments in Central Africa, fully supported by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in britain, that the only sound and sure method of building up a harmoniousmulti-racial state is to ensure that there is no racial distinction in parlia-mentary representation. Developments in recent years and the factthat only a few emergent Africans have as yet succeeded in being acceptedby the responsible voter has undoubtedly strained the policy, hut wesubmit that the alternative of racial representation on communal rolls orcommon roles with communal primaries will plunge the country intoracial blocs, eliminate the moderate elements in both communities and make an effective and progressive Government difficult, if not impossible.4. Racial parity will also result in a considerable lowering of standardsnot only in the Legislature but in the quality of Government. To suggestthat the Colony of Southern Rhodesia which has maintained an efficientstandard of Government since it was granted independence in 1923 should now be expected to entrust important functions such as defence and finance to a central Government which most likely will be unable to rely on adequate support of the Assembly is quite unrealistic.5. Any constitutional advance must be accompanied by an absoluteassurance of a sound and stable administration. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment has recognised this in the non-self-governing territories by insisting on official representation in Legislative Councils, and we submit that it
is logical and reasonable for self-governing territories to demand the samestandards. The Commission has rightly, in our view, stressed the impor-tance of training Africans to enable them to play their full part in theadministration of the country in the future, but any hasty action at thepresent time can only lead to the appalling conditions being witnessedin the Congo today.6. We therefore recommend that the wiser course to adopt is not toabandon the policy of political advance by staged development, but to eliminate its defects in the light of the many developments that are takingplace in Africa today. This we believe has been achieved in the general recommendations of the Commission on Safeguards, Discrimination andSecession and the recommendations, which we submit hereunder, onFranchise and the composition of the Federal Assembly.Communal Elections7. We are opposed to the majority recommendation of electionson common rolls with communal primaries, not only on the grounds thatit is introducing racialism into politics but also that it will eliminate the moderate elements of both races. This latter point is, in our view, of theutmost importance if the Federation is to achieve co-operation and mutual confidence among the races. This we believe can only be assured by main-taining the common roll, and for these reasons we reject the minority recom-mendations on either staged parity or the suggestion of electing twentyEuropeans and twenty Africans on communal rolls and the remainingtwenty seats on a common roll.Territorial Representation in the Federal Assembly8. The Commission has recommended an alteration in the Territorialrepresentation to the Federal Assembly which in the main increases the representation from Nyasaland at the expense of Southern Rhodesia. whilst the latter Territory has no right, and indeed has never had any desire, toplay a dominating roll in the Federation, nevertheless we consider thatit is unreasonable for her to be now asked, after thirty-seven years of self-government, to accept a position in which she is expected to forgo animportant element of independence.9. We hold the view that the friction that this reoommendation willengender in Southern Rhodesia will far outweigh the fears of Africans in nyasaland of domination from the south which has no foundation in fact.We do consider, however, that on the one hand Northern Rhodesia has a claim for greater representation and, on the other, the present Europeanrepresentation from Nyasaland is excessive and should be reduced by three members.10. If the Commission^ recommendations on the creation of councils of State are accepted then we recommend that the three European members with special responsibilities for African interests should be abolished.Franchise11. During the course of the Commission^ investigations in the three territories much evidence was heard that the existing qualifications in the
and we consider that it would operate equally successfully in the caseof Central Africa. The Commission has, in fact, discussed, but rejected,in paragraph 80, this form of government; but concluded that, if Federa-tion is dissolved, this form of government would be better than nothingat all. We therefore feel that, in addition to other recommendations madeby the Commission, such as constitutional reforms, franchise and thequestion of secession, this matter should be discussed at the Review Con-ference so that Africans may be able to decide freely what form of govern-ment they prefer. We endorse the Commission^ recommendations inparagraph 82.CHAPTER 6.-FEDERAL LEGISLATURE AND FRANCHISE(2) Note ol Reservation by Mr. Woodrow Cross and Mr. EHman-BrownWe are unable to support the majority recommendations of racialparity in the Federal Assembly, the suggested method of electing candidates,the implied lowering of franchise qualifications and the alteration in territorial representation.2. These majority recommendations, in our view, contradict themselvesin that there is apparently a desire to eliminate racial distinction so faras functions of Government are concerned yet, by adopting parity repre-sentation, racial politics are being introduced for the first time into thehighest instrument of Government in the land. Of much greater significance,however, is the fact that the introduction of racial parity would be a reversal of the underlying principles that parliamentary representations should be based on responsibility and not colour.3. For many years it has been the consistent policy of governments in Central Africa, fully supported by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in britain, that the only sound and sure method of building up a harmoniousmulti-racial state is to ensure that there is no racial distinction in parlia-mentary representation. Developments in recent years and the factthat only a few emergent Africans have as yet succeeded in being acceptedby the responsible voter has undoubtedly strained the policy, but wesubmit that the alternative of racial representation on communal rolls orcommon roles with communal primaries will plunge the country intoracial blocs, eliminate the moderate elements in both communities and make an effective and progressive Government difficult, if not impossible.4. Racial parity will also result in a considerable lowering of standardsnot only in the Legislature but in the quality of Government. To suggestthat the Colony of Southern Rhodesia which has maintained an efficientstandard of Government since it was granted independence in 1923 should now be expected to entrust important functions such as defence and finance to a central Government which most likely will be unable to rely on adequate support of the Assembly is quite unrealistic.5. Any constitutional advance must be accompanied by an absoluteassurance of a sound and stable administration. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment has recognised this in the non-self-governing territories by insisting on official representation in Legislative Councils, and we submit that it
is logical and reasonable for self-governing territories to demand the samestandards. The Commission has rightly, in our view, stressed the impor-tance of training Africans to enable them to play their full part in theadministration of the country in the future, but any hasty action at thepresent time can only lead to the appalling conditions being witnessedin the Congo today.6. We therefore recommend that the wiser course to adopt is not toabandon the policy of political advance by staged development, but to eliminate its defects in the light of the many developments that are takingplace in Africa today. This we believe has been achieved in the general recommendations of the Commission on Safeguards, Discrimination andSecession and the recommendations, which we submit hereunder, onFranchise and the composition of the Federal Assembly.Communal Elections7. We are opposed to the majority recommendation of election?on common rolls with communal primaries, not only on the grounds thatit is introducing racialism into politics but also that it will eliminate the moderate elements of both races. This latter point is, in our view, of theutmost importance if the Federation is to achieve co-operation and mutual confidence among the races. This we believe can only be assured by main-taining the common roll, and for these reasons we reject the minority recom-mendations on either staged parity or the suggestion of electing twentyEuropeans and twenty Africans on communal rolls and the remainingtwenty seats on a common roll.Territorial Representation in the Federal Assembly8. The Commission has recommended an alteration in the Territorialrepresentation to the Federal Assembly which in the main increases the representation from Nyasailand at the expense of Southern Rhodesia. whilst the latter Territory has mo right, and indeed has never had any desire, toplay a dominating roll in the Federation, nevertheless we consider thatit is unreasonable for her to be now asked, after thirty-seven years of self-government, to accept a position in which she is expected to forgo animportant element of independence.9. We hold the view that the friction that this recommendation willengender in Southern Rhodesia will far outweigh the fears of Africans in nyasaland of domination from the south which has no foundation in fact.We do consider, however, that on the one hand Northern Rhodesia has a claim for greater representation and, on the other, the present Europeanrepresentation from Nyasaland is excessive and should be reduced by three members.10. If the Commission^ recommendations on the creation of councils of State are accepted then we recommend that the three European members with special responsibilities for African interests should be abolished.Franchise11. During the course of the Commission^ investigations in the three territories much evidence was heard that the existing qualifications in the
Federal franchise laws excluded a large number of responsible Africancitizens such as Councillors, Headmen and even Chiefs, and we recommendthat the franchise qualifications should be amended so as to ensure thatall responsible Africans by virtue of their age, position and experience are brought on to the voters&apos; roll. We realise that the prestige and status of chiefs and their Councillors vary considerably but we believe that, in alarge number of cases, it would be appropriate to admit such people to the&quot; ordinary &quot; roll, and in others it would be more appropriate that theyshould exercise a &quot; special&quot; vote. It is a matter for the Government todecide where the dividing line should be drawn. In making this recom-mendation we are aware that this will broaden the franchise both on theordinary and special rolls, but we regard it as important that the Africanvote should be more balanced by including the rural tribal leaders, eldersand persons holding positions of responsibility.12. We wish, however, to record firmly the fact that we consider themaintenance of the present franchise qualifications (with the above excep-tions) as not only reasonable but essential if stable Government and progressive development is to be ensured in Central Africa. These franchiselaws have only recently been enacted after detailed investigation by a specialcommittee and after receiving the full approval of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. To alter them again now, as the majority of the Commis-sioners recommend, will only tend to harden opinion in Southern Rhodesiaagainst Federation. If the Commission^ general recommendations onfunctions are accepted, the Federal Assembly will be mainly responsiblefor defence, external affairs, finance and economic development, functions which demand the highest degree of administrative efficiency if confidenceis to be maintained. Any suggestion, therefore, of weakening standards inthe highest instrument of Government in the land will, in our view, destroy the only factor which keeps the Federation in beings namely, the economic stability of the area as a whole.Non-European representation in the Federal Assembly13. Considerable evidence was led during the Commission^ tour ofthe Federation that there was insufficient African representation in theFederal Assembly and that Asians and Coloureds should at lease have some recognition. The majority have met these requests by recommendingracial parity amongst the two main communities and a non-voting Asianrepresentative. As already stated, we are unable to agree with these recommendations, but consider that the requests for greater representationare reasonable.14. Considerable difficulty will undoubtedly be experienced in findingsufficient Africans with the necessary ability and experience to man notonly the suggested greater representation in the Federal House but alsothe various Territorial Legislatures and the Councils of State. these difficulties are inherent in Africa, but we believe that if the co-operation ofthe races is to be fostered these problems must be overcome, and the best way is to place more responsibility on the emergent Africans and for thosewho have had the experience to give a helping hand.15. The suggestion that there should be a non-voting Asian representa-tive is, in our view, an insult to that community.   What is of more
significance however is the fact that the majority recommendation of refusing to give Asians a voting representative clearly acknowledges theview that the main communities are likely to vote on a racial basis. This,as we have described above, is one of our main arguments for rejectingparity representation. We accordingly recommend that the Asians&apos; claim should be recognised and provision made to ensure that they are given a full voting representative in the Federal Assembly.16. The special committee recommended to investigate the broadeningof the responsible African vote could also, be charged with advising on thebest method of electing this representative.17. We accordingly recommend:(1) That the present method of electing representatives to the federal assembly be maintained.(2) That the Federal franchise be broadened to ensure that responsibleAfricans by virtue of their age, position and experience are broughton to the voters&apos; roll.(3) That Northern Rhodesia&apos;s Territorial representation in the federal assembly be increased by three members and that the NyasalandEuropean representation be reduced by three members.(4) That non-European representation in the Federal Assembly beincreased by (a) eliminating European members with special responsibilityfor African interests ; and(6) increasing the elected African members from the present figure of eight members to seventeen members and reducing the present forty-four &quot;elected&quot; members tothirty-eight.(5) That the provisions of Article 9 (2) of the Constitution as amended in 1957 should be maintained.(6) That in the Constitution provision be made for one representativeof the Asian community.18. If the above recommendations are accepted the composition of theFederal Assembly would comprise sixty members as follows:  RecommendationsSouthernRhodesiaNorthernRhodesiaNyasalandWholeFederationElected Members.........Elected African Members......Specially Elected African member selected Asian Member21814329219
(3) Note of Reservation by Mrs. Huxley, Professor Jack, Mr. McCIeland,Mr. Robinson and Mr. TaylorWe are unable to accept the Commission^ majority recommendation for a Federal Assembly consisting of sixty members of whom thirty wouldbe Europeans and thirty Africans, elected on a common roll after com-munal primaries. We are much attracted by the idea of a racial partner-ship expressed by this arrangement. But the concept of parity has anapparent simplicity which disguises the fact that it will not work.2. We reject it because we consider that it would be extremely diffi-cult, if not impossible, to procure a stable Government by the normalworkings of the party system in an Assembly bisected on racial lines. our reasons for this view are as follows:  (a) To have the whole House elected on racial lines conflicts with thegeneral principle of a non-racial approach in the main functionsof government accepted by the Commission and which is the traditional policy of the Governments in Central Africa supportedby Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. Therecent Nyasaland Constitutional Agreement is the latest example of this approach. The majority proposal, in our view, invites the electorate to act on racial lines, and gives no encouragement tothe multi-racial outlook.In the new Assembly thirty Europeans of one political flavourmay well face thirty Africans with opposing views, resulting ina stalemate. In an effort to ensure that their own community is best placed to form a Government, Europeans and Africansalike will be driven to support a single party on each side. Other-wise they will risk dividing their own numbers with a chance of finding themselves confronted by a solid bloc of thirty membersof the other race.(b) Experience elsewhere has shown that fixed racial proportions in legislative bodies never endure. Rather do they become an invita-tion to change this proportion and remain a constant source of racial friction.(c) We think that in the present climate of opinion a stable Govern-ment could not be drawn from a racially bisected Assembly basedon communal primaries. It is unlikely that a multi-racial partycould secure a majority of African and European seats, and theFederation would be condemned to a series of coalition Govern-ments between a multi-racial party and one or other of the extremist wings. Coalitions are notoriously unstable, even in countries with long experience of democracy. They have failedin France, and in the United Kingdom worked only in times ofwar or grave national emergency. In African countries wherethere is no long experience of democratic procedures we think the chances of success are even less.(d) So far as we know equal communal representation has been triedfor any length of time only in United Canada before 1867. TheEnglish Canadians in Canada West (now Ontario) were at first
fewer in number than the French Canadians in Canada East(now Quebec), but the two divisions of the colony had equalrepresentation. The system was a failure. Effectively there were two Prime Ministers, and the Government had to have a majorityamong the members of both divisions. When that situation couldnot be obtained there were frequent and unstable Governments.Within ten years there were ten Governments ; and in three years there were four Governments and two General Elections. Themajority recommendation would condemn the Federation to a comparable experience.(e) In the Federation the African electorate will continue to growand will eventually exceed the number of European voters. Natur-ally, this electorate will expect the number of its representatives to increase. They will then come up against the rigid barrierof parity. We would much prefer to see development take placenaturally, by leaving a number of seats in the Assembly opento all races, than by means of periodic, and no doubt acrimonious,bargaining sessions.(f) We are not convinced that racial, or communal, primary electionsas a preliminary to common roll elections are workable or desir-able. Under the suggested system a candidate who secures onlyone-quarter of the support of his voters may nevertheless besubsequently elected. As the proportion of African to Europeanvoters on the common roll increases, Africans will in many casesdecide which of two or three Europeans is to represent theEuropean community. The Report describes other objections.If there are to be reserved seats, that is to say racial representation,it is only logical that the race concerned should be able to say whois to represent it. Communal primaries are a device to avoidcommunal elections and, in our opinion, do not necessarily achieve the object of allowing the voters to choose the people they wouldlike to represent them. They fall between two stools, and open the way to a great deal of political chicanery.3. The normal British method of political advance is by staged develop-ment. The majority recommendation would abandon this principle. Wesupport it. Our aim is to create an Assembly with open seats on a common roll based on a franchise widened and enlarged according to the principles laid down in paragraph 88. We do not agree that it is necessary to giveadditional guidance to the franchise committee to the extent that this is done in paragraph 108. Broadly speaking, the Federal franchise should ensure that the increase in the African electorate will not arouse Europeanfears that their political influence will be suddenly undermined. On the otherhand, it must not be maintained at a level which will give Africans legitimatecause for complaint that they are unable to participate adequately and pro-gressively in the Federal Assembly. It should be enough to direct the franchise committee to endeavour to reconcile these two fears.4. The next stage towards our aim, we think, might be to reserve a proportion of the seats for each of the main races. The following is an example of such an arrangement which is mentioned in the majority report.
5. In a House of sixty, there could be twenty Europeans and twentyAfrican members, elected in each case on a communal roll. The remainingtwenty seats should be non-racial, and the members should be elected on acommon roll. This would have, to our minds, the following advantages:  (a) Partnership between the races would be expressed by the equal number of communally elected seats allotted to Africans and europeans.(b) The twenty open seats would give multi-racial parties the oppor-tunity to appeal to all races for support. Each party would haveto put both European and African candidates into the field if ithoped to be able to call upon members of both races to form aCabinet. The system of communal primaries suggested in themajority report would tend to eliminate men of moderate views,whereas under this open system, such candidates could be putforward by both races. Thus the open seats would form a bridgebetween the two communities, and make the working of the partysystem possible.6. The normal British system of transferring responsibility by stagesinvolves a period of training for those to whom the power is being trans-ferred. There are today no African Federal Cabinet Ministers. Under thesystem of racial parity, an extremist party with no experience whateverof government or administration could immediately find itself the majorityparty in the Federal Assembly. Under our system again, there would pre-sumably be a non-racial Cabinet, and a number of Africans would gainpractical experience of managing Federal affairs. There would thus be asmooth constitutional evolution. As the Federation develops, it should bethe aim to reduce the proportion of seats elected communally, until even-tually the bulk of the Assembly would be elected to open seats on a common roll.7. Our proposals would allow Coloureds and Asians to become fullMembers of Parliament which the majority report prevents.8. We believe that our proposals offer a much better chance of providing a workable administration, of training Africans to the wise use of respori-sibility; and, above all, of enabling Africans and Europeans to share the burdens and responsibilities of Government three objectives which wethink of overriding importance if the Federation is not to be destroyed byracial strife.(4) Note of Reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Woodrow Cross,Mr. Ellman-Brown, Professor Jack, Mr. McCleland, Mr. Robinson,Sir Victor Robinson and Mr. TaylorWe refer to the suggestion in paragraph 108 that a committee or working party should be appointed to make detailed recommendations on the quali-fications for the Federal franchise. We would point out that at the recentNyasaland Constitutional Conference it was found possible to arrive at adecision in this matter without the appointment of a Commission or Com-mittee to advise the Conference what to decide. What one Con-ference has done another should be able to do. Moreover what is achieved
by the normal process of give and take round a Conference table is likely inthe end to prove more acceptable and enduring than the recommendationsof the Committee suggested.2. It may be, therefore, that the Conference will decide to resolve thismatter itself. In our view this would be preferable.3. What we have said in regard to the franchise qualifications appliesequally to the other matters set out in paragraphs 110 and 111 on which it issuggested the committee should advise.CHAPTER 7.-THE TERRITORIAL CONSTITUTIONS(5) Note of Reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. KatilunguWe do not think that the Commission has gone far enough to ensureAfricans&apos; acceptance of the new form of association without fully satisfyingthem through Territorial constitutional advancement towards self-govern-ment. We consider that the new Constitutions for Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland should contain the following features.2. The Executive Council should be composed of ex-officio and unofficial members of the Legislative Council with an unofficial majority. Thereshould be a majority of Africans. Normally each Member should beresponsible for portfolio. The Executive Council should be responsible tothe Legislative Council and, through it, to the electorate. This would not preclude the Governor from retaining his reserve powers, such as those ofdissolving the Legislative Council and ordering the holding of a new generalelection, or suspending the Constitution should the need arise. The leader of the majority in the Legislative Council should be asked by the governor to form a Government.  He should be designated &quot; Chief Minister &quot;.3. Such a Constitution would give immediate responsible governmentto the Northern Territories. The Nyasaland Constitution proposals fall short of this, so far as the Executive Council is concerned, though,admittedly, the agreement on the Legislative Council is satisfactory. HereAfricans have a clear majority over the Official and Non-Official european members. Logically, this clear African majority in the Legislative council should reflect itself in the Executive Council, which is the Government ofthe country.4. We endorse the majority view that a Conference, similar to the onerecently held on the Nyasland Constitution and similarly representative ofthe political and racial elements of the population of Northern Rhodesia,should be held without delay ; but we do not subscribe to the view thatthe making of any precise suggestions as to the new form of the Northern Rhodesian Constitution would hamper or prejudice the Conference nego-tiations. On the contrary, we feel they would form the basis of negotiations in exactly the same way as do the Commission^ recommendations on theFederal Constitution.5. It must be borne in mind that Northern Rhodesia already enjoys amore advanced Constitution than that now suggested for Nyasaland.  The
next step for her, therefore, should be full responsible government approxi-mating to that of Southern Rhodesia, with the proviso that there should beoverall African majorities in both the Legislative and Executive Councils,the latter to be designated the &quot; Cabinet&quot;.6. We feel that such action would at least try to satisfy Africans in theNorthern Territories that Federation was not blocking their way to self-government and eventually to full independence.CHAPTER 8.-ALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONS between governments(6) Note of Reservation on Health by Mr. Woodrow Cross, Professor Jack,Mr. Robinson, Sir Victor Robinson, Chief Sigola and Mr. TaylorWe are unable to accept the majority view in this recommendation. Theevidence submitted to us did not reveal a general dissatisfaction with theFederal Health Service. The main criticism came from the rural areas ofNorthern Rhodesia. In the other Territories the Service was frequentlydescribed as an improvement on previous arrangements. Nor can we ignore the very great expansion of the Service which has in fact occurred. *2. The criticisms which we received were not as a rule directed againstthe constitutional arrangement whereby health is a Federal subject. Apartfrom those cases where the criticism was absorbed in an expressed dissatis-faction with Federation in general the main comment concerned the allegedover-centralisation of the administration and the practical problems whichare associated with the exercise of remote control.3. We have made far-reaching recommendations in this Report designedto remove the major legitimate objections to Federation and to this end, wehave proposed, inter alia, that certain subjects should be transferred from theFederal Government to the Territorial Governments. But such a trans-ference of responsibility in the case of health does not of itself eliminatedangers and defects of over-centralisation. A Territorial service couldreveal administrative weaknesses of the same kind. As we see it, theproblem is one of ensuring a great degree of decentralisation and a largermeasure of effective regional control with which the Territorial governments and the local authorities could be associated. This decentralisation can and should be effected without removing health entirely from the purview ofthe Federal Government. Indeed we see in the proposal to make health solelya Territorial responsibility a real danger that different health standardswould develop in the three Territories.4. We see other administrative difficulties in implementing the reeom-mendation of the majority. The staff of the Ministry of Health number11,000 out of a total of 32,000 employed by the Federal Government. Manyof these employees were recruited direct to the Federal Service and have hadno previous experience under a Territorial Government. In the process ofsplitting the present Federal Service into three self-contained TerritorialServices, these employees must be offered &quot; abolition of office &quot; terms and itmay be expected that many doctors and nurses will take advantage of* Survey of Developments since 1953, Chapter 9.
the opportunity so created to seek alternative employment. This is a danger which we cannot ignore and we do not feel justified in supporting a proposal which threatens to weaken an important public service for the sake of meeting a line of criticism which was not generally advanced and which wasfrequently misplaced.5. We think that the Federal Government should initiate a study by representatives of all four Governments which would have as its object thepreparation of a scheme which would provide inter alia, for:  (a) the maintenance of existing employer /employee relationships ;ib) the maintenance of common standards of health services throughoutthe Federation ;(c) the maximum amount of decentralisation compatible with efficient management;-id) the setting up of a permanent body representative of all four Govern-ments in which will rest responsibility for the administration of allhealth matters, and(e) the manner in which this body will be provided with finance fromthe four Governments concerned.6. The proposal of the majority that the three Territorial Governments&quot;with or without the assistance of the Federal Government, should nego-tiate the setting up of a Central African Health Service, possibly in theform of a statutory Commission or Corporation&quot; seems to us to be im-precise. A statutory Commission which served the whole of central africa and which aimed, among other things, at the maintenance of-uniform standards would hardly be distinguishable from a Health Serviceoperated by the Federal Government. To that extent little would hegained by removing health from the Federal list. Indeed, the proposed commission or Corporation might he seriously inconvenienced and its position rendered insecure if the legislation which brought it into being,and kept it in being, had to be passed through three separate legislatures.(7) Note of Reservation on Health by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Ellman-Brownand Mr. McClelandOur appreciation of the evidence we received on this function is similarto that expressed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the note of reservation byMr. Woodrow Cross, Professor Jack, Mr. Robinson, Sir Victor Robinson,Chief Sigola and Mr. Taylor.2. We agree with the majority of the members of the Commission,however, that the Territorial Governments should have the ultimate rightto take over the administration of this function should they so desire,but we regard it of the utmost importance that the administrative problemsof finance and staffing should be fully recognised.3. We accordingly recommend that the Territorial Governments shouldmake use of amended Article 32, and in conjunction with the federal government set up a National Health Service, administered by a statutory commission, which will ensure the maintenance of existing employer/employee relationships and the provision of finance from all four governments.
(8) Note of Reservation on Non-African Agriculture by Mr. Justice Beadle,Mr. Woodrow Cross, Mr. Ellman-Brown, Professor Jack, Mr.McCleland, Mr. Robinson, Sir Victor Robinson, Chief Sigola andMr. TaylorWe cannot support the recommendation that the greater part of non-African agriculture should be transferred from the Federal Governmentto the Territorial Governments.2. Although this recommendation conforms with one of the principlesadopted by the Commission as a guide, viz. that no function of govern-ment should be divided on a racial basis, it is made, in our opinion, againstthe weight of the evidence submitted to the Commission.3. The postion revealed by the evidence is as follows:  (1) European farmers in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesiaare anxious that European agriculture should remain a Federalsubject.(2) Few Africans in any Territory expressed any objection to Europeanagriculture in Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia beingFederal.(3) Southern Rhodesian Africans would like African agriculture in southern Rhodesia to be Federal.(4) Africans in Northern Rhodesia do not wish African agriculture inNorthern Rhodesia to be Federal.(5) Africans in Nyasaland do not want either African or Europeanagriculture in Nyasaland to be Federal.4. We are strongly of the opinion that for technical, administrative,and economic reasons most agricultural matters should be the responsi-bility of the Federal Government. It has to be admitted, however, thatin the present political climate it would not be possible to transfer Africanagriculture to the Federal Government in the Northern Territories.5. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in this direction and it seems to us to be wrong to dismantle what has been created in the shape of unified control merely because it is not possible at present toproceed to the logical conclusion and also because the present divisionoffends a principle adopted as a guide.6. Although the majority of the Commission recognise the administra-tive difficulties of &quot;unscrambling&quot; this subject, and ask the territorial governments to take heed of this, as well as of the expressed wishes ofthe inhabitants, they conclude that these facts point to the necessity oftemporarily leaving parts of the subject where they are at present.7. In our view this is a wrong conclusion and we consider that theright solution is to leave the present constitutional position unchangedin the hope that, in the fullness of time, the Territorial Governments andthe Federal Government will find it possible to achieve a greater degreeof unified control on a non-racial basis by the process of delegation ofpowers under the amended Article 32 of the Constitution. We do not suggest that every aspect should necessarily be Federal.
8. This proposal has the additional advantage that it makes possiblethe early transfer of African agriculture in Southern Rhodesia to Federalcontrol, which is the clearly expressed wish of the people concerned. More-over, although it offends immediately against the principle that no subject should be divided on a racial basis it conforms with another general viewof the Commission which is that subjects with a strong economic importanceshould be under the control of the Federal Government. In 1959 agri-culture contributed 19 per cent, of the Federation^ gross domestic product,being second only to mining with a contribution of 20-8 per cent.Staff9. The Federal agricultural staff are recognised not only in Africa butelsewhere as providing one of the finest agricultural services possible. If,through the immediate transfer of this subject to the Territories, abolition of office terms which the Governments would be obliged to offer were accepted by a large majority then the service would be seriously impaired ifnot destroyed. This would do irreparable harm to the economy of the rhodesias.CHAPTER 11.-THE REMOVAL OF RACIAL discrimination and THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIP(9) Note of Reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. KatilunguWe do not agree with all that is said by the Commission in Chapter 4,that Federation has brought economic advantages to all the people in theFederation. It is true to say that the economic advantages which accruedfrom the Federation resulted in high standards of living for Europeans only and created some employment for Africans in Southern Rhodesia and in nyasaland, but wages are still very low compared with the present high standard of living in Central Africa.2. Discriminatory practices still remain in industry, African advancementhas been slow and Africans are denied opportunities of apprenticeshiptraining. The ordinary labourer in secondary industries in northern rhodesia receives an average wage of  5 per month inclusive, while theordinary labourer on the farm in Southern Rhodesia receives identically thesame when account is taken of the value of his rations and housing, estimatedat  2 10s. Od.3. It is wrong in our view for the Commission, when dealing with Kariba,to say that Africans were going to benefit as a result of this hydro-electricscheme. The Commission visited most of the African municipal townshipsin the Federation, and saw that in the majority of cases hardly any of thesetownships were supplied with electricity at all. Most of the benefits fromKariba will, in our view, be enjoyed by Europeans.(10) Note of Reservation by Mr. Crawley, Mr. Gondwe,Mr. Katilungu and Mr. MolsonWe consider that the Commission^ treatment of this subject of discrimination -nation is incomplete without reference to a development in the Federal135
Defence Forces. Since the recent civil disturbances in Southern Rhodesiait has apparently been decided to form certain new regular army unitsrecruited exclusively from Europeans. Hitherto, so far as we know, allregular army units have had Africans in the ranks. To raise exclusivelyEuropean units now is a new example of discrimination and is quite incon-sistent with the principle of partnership.2. We understand that it has also been decided to raise an exclusivelyEuropean Home Guard on the Copperbelt. This is apparently intended asa defensive force against civil disturbance and intimidation. Africans areas much threatened as Europeans. Indeed the fact that they live in Africantownships means that they are more isolated in the face of danger. TheHome Guard should therefore, in our view, operate in the African town-ships as well as in the European areas. It should by multi-racial and apractical demonstration of partnership.CHAPTER 15.-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT(11) Note of Reservation by Mr. Molson and Dr. ShepherdWhile we agree that economic development in the Northern Territoriesis urgent and desirable and that the United Kingdom should continue to givegenerous support in suitable cases, we cannot entirely endorse the recom-mendations of this chapter. They contemplate not only the continuation of help from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund, but exchequer loans and grants on whatever scale is needed &quot; to make good so far aspossible the shortfall which is likely to occur on borrowing in London andother capital markets.&quot; This might prove to be a tall order.2. If African nationalism fails to reassure investors, in the federation and overseas, economic development will be retarded or halted. There is noreason why the United Kingdom Government should attempt to preventthe natural effect from following the cause.3. In any case it could not do so. There exist cases already where themoney is available for developments, but Africans are too rooted in theirsuspicion of European innovation to make use of it.4. It is often suggested that the over-population and poverty of SouthernNyasaland is discreditable to British administration and could be rectifiedif only more financial assistance were given. Forty years ago SouthernNyasaland was sparsely populated. The present excessive population ischiefly due to immigration from Portuguese East Africa of Africans who findconditions better in the British Protectorate. The condition of the Nyasa-land farmer cannot be greatly improved by the expenditure of money unless he is willing to abandon the matrilineal system of land occupation andadopt improved methods of cultivation.5. Help provided by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund hasin some instances been more enthusiastic than wise. All financial assistance should be based on a realistic assessment of the development planned andnot given unconditionally.
CHAPTER 16.-THE QUESTION OF SECESSION(12) Note of Reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. KatilunguWe regret that, while agreeing in principle to the right of secession byany Territory comprising the Federation, we are unable to agree with themethod recommended by the majority of the Commission that only her majesty&apos;s Government should determine and ascertain the wishes of theinhabitants of the Territories. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government alone will Deleft to determine the method and ascertain the inhabitants&apos; wishes, thiswill be contrary to the democratic principle, which is government by thepeople and for the people and government by consent of the people. In1953, when Federation was established, Southern Rhodesia, already a self-governing colony, conducted a referendum in order to ascertain whether itsinhabitants agreed to enter into the Federation of Central Africa. this opportunity was not afforded to either Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland.As a result, Africans regard the present Federation as imposed against theirwishes. We therefore consider it desirable and necessary that, in orderto strengthen the question of the right of secession by any Territory, thisshould be set out either in the Constitution of the Federation or in the preamble to the Constitution, but preferably in the Constitution. It is ourconsidered view that the whole question, as well as the timing, of theright to secede should be left to the Review Conference, at which Confer-ence Africans will be fully represented and therefore participate in determining the details.(13) Note of Reservation by Mr. Justice Beadle, Mr. Woodrow Cross,Mr. Ellman Brown, Mrs. Huxley, Mr. Robinson andSir Victor RobinsonWe regret that we find ourselves unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the majority of the members of the Commission (paragraph309), that the wishes of the inhabitants of the Territories on the question of secession should be ascertained in a manner &quot; determined entirely by her majesty&apos;s Government at the time &quot;.2. To leave this matter entirely in the hands of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment means asking the Territories to give any Government in the UnitedKingdom who might happen to be in power at the time a &quot; blank cheque &quot;for what might be to the Territory concerned a vitally important matter.3. Southern Rhodesia, as a self-governing Colony, is accustomed to making her own. decisions in matters such as this. For example, in deciding whether or not she would federate with the Northern Territories, the mannerin which the wishes of her inhabitants should be ascertained was determinedby herself and not by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. It would be logical, there-fore, to argue, that any decision on the question of secession should be ascertained in a manner which Southern Rhodesia herself should determine.We appreciate, however, that to leave the question entirely to the SouthernRhodesia Government in power at the time the question arises is open to objection. The recognition of a right to secede is one of the most farreaching recommendations made by the Commission and the people of theFederation will want to know in advance the manner in which that right
may foe exercised should they wish to exercise it. They should not be left in doubt on this. We therefore consider it desirable that the manner inwhich the wishes of the inhabitants of any Territory should be ascertainedon the question of secession should foe set out in the Constitution itself orin the Preamble.4. We have considered whether we should make definite recommenda-tions on the precise manner in which the wishes of the inhabitants shouldbe ascertained, but in view of the fact that we think that we have heardinsufficient evidence on this subject to justify the making of firm recom-mendations. we prefer to leave the details to the Governments themselvesto decide at the Review Conference.CHAPTER 17.-THE ELEMENTS OF SUBORDINATION(14) Note on Reservation by Mr. Gondwe and Mr. Kalilungu onDisallowance of LawsIn our view Article 25 forms the basis of Her Majesty&apos;s protectionover the African inhabitants of Central Africa, particularly those of theNorthern Territories. If the power of disallowance were now to. be removedthe Federation would virtually have Dominion Status. the very thing the africans are afraid of. If the Bill of Rights and the Councils of State areentrenched in the Constitutions in the manner proposed by the Commissionthese safeguards against discriminatory legislation will certainly be stronger than those at present provided through the African Affairs Board. But itwould still be possible for the Federal Legislature to initiate and passother legislation, not within the purview of the Council of State, which,while it could not be regarded as unfairly discriminatory on racial grounds,might nevertheless be detrimental to the interests of the Northern territories and the African majority therein now still under Her Majesty&apos;s protection.2. We feel that if the Federal and Territorial Governments had not beenafraid of the reaction of Her Majesty&apos;s Government with power of dis-allowance in reserve, the Africans would by now have been subjected to more laws contrary to their interests. In view of the foregoing, we wantthis power to be retained so as to reinforce the proposed Council of state in protecting the inhabitants from discriminatory and unjust laws.
MINORITY report we, the undersigned members of the Commission, have in the course ofof our deliberations brought to the Commission^ notice matters in the drafts of the Commission^ Report with which we cannot agree. We now know thatwe have failed to persuade the majority to accept our views. We ourselveshave not been persuaded to adopt the views put forward by the majority.We feel that there is no other course open to us but that of presentinga Minority Report. In doing so we wish to acknowledge that many conces-sions have been made to our point of view in the course of the Commission^work and there are, of course, many points in the Majority Report withwhich we wholeheartedly agree.We differ from the majority of our colleagues on two questions ofprinciple (i) We are unable to accept the continued existence of a Federationnot based on CONSENT and which, in our view, has not proved tobe of benefit to the majority of the inhabitants.(ii) We consider that the Majority Report fails to deal effectively withthe all-important question of constitutional advance in the territories.These differences of principle are considered by us in Part I of our Report.In Part II of our Report, we make certain comments on recommenda-tions of the majority which assume the continued existence of the Federation.We know that the final decisions of the Constitutional Conference on thequestion of secession may go against our hopes, and we think we ought to clarify our views on these questions. The comments which we make shouldnot in any way to be construed to mean that we accept Federation.PART government by ConsentThe most important respect in which our views differ from those of themajority is in our inability to accept the continued existence of a Federationnot based on consent.. Federation was imposed in 1953 in disregard of african opinion. In our view it is not open to question that an overwhelming majority of Africans in the Protectorates were opposed from the outset to federation or any other form of political association with Southern Rhodesia.We know from our own experience, and from the evidence received by theCommission that since 1953 the opposition to Federation has steadily in-creased. We do not believe that any change in the constitutional structure of the Federation, which may result from the Review Conference, could bring about a sudden shift in African opinion on this issue. It follows,therefore, that the continued existence of the Federation in the future mustnecessarily involve a further period of dictatorial rule with a constitutional
settlement imposed against the wishes of the majority of inhabitants ofNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This we regard as intolerable. The basisof all civilised government is consent, whether the governed are African orEuropean, educated or uneducated.Referendum2. Although we have no doubt that our assessment of African opinion in the Federation is correct and, as we understand, would not be disputed by our colleagues, we do not ask Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United King-dom to dissolve Federation without first putting the question of consent to the test. Accordingly we consider that the first task of the Review conference should be to provide effective machinery for holding a referendum in eachof the Territories. The inhabitants should be asked to say whether they wish their Territory to remain in the Federation or to secede from it. the referendum in all three Territories should be on the basis of universal adultsuffrage.The Right of Secession3. From the foregoing paragraphs it will be clear that we are unable toaccept the conclusions reached on the question of secession in Chapter 16of the Majority Report. We have no quarrel however with the legal basis on which the recommendations are made. Indeed we welcome the fact thatthe Majority Report makes clear that neither the Constitution of 1953 asamended, nor the so-called Convention of 1957, has limited the sovereignty of Parliament in the United Kingdom which may provide for the constitu-tional future of the Federation as it sees fit, with or without the right of secession. Our objection to the majority view, whichever alternative formulais preferred, is that it involves a period of delay for the Protectorates duringwhich our people must continue to live under an imposed settlement. Weconsider, therefore, that a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament should provide for secession to follow automatically, should the inhabitants in any territory decide against Federation in the referendum envisaged in thepreceding paragraph. Alternatively, if it were thought more appropriateHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom might undertake at the review Conference to provide for secession by subsequent legislation if thedecision of the inhabitants in any Territory should go against Federation.Inconsistency of the Majority report. In considering the recommendations of the Majority Report on thequestion of secession, we have found great difficulty in understanding why our colleagues should be prepared to allow the inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia,predominantly African, to decide immediately for or against Federation whileinsisting that a similar choice for the inhabitants of Protectorates, also pre-dominantly African, should be postponed to an indefinite date in the future.5. Under the first of the alternative formulae proposed in the majority report, &quot; After a Territory has achieved self-government if the governmentof that Territory so requests, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will take the neces-sary steps to ascertain, in such manner as Her Majesty&apos;s Government shall then determine, the wishes of the inhabitants of that Territory on the questionwhether they shall remain within the Federation, and will proceed to giveeffect to those wishes &quot;.  Self-government is defined for this purpose as the
&quot; position reached when the final stage of progress to responsible governmenthas been attained through the disappearance of civil service Ministers, and through Ministers ceasing to be responsible to the Governor and becomingresponsible to a Legislature answerable to the electorate&quot;. Although theMajority Report does not expressly say so, Southern Rhodesia has already achieved self-government in this sense. It follows, therefore, that in SouthernRhodesia, the right to invoke the secession machinery under this formulawould accrue immediately. It is clear also that in proposing that her majesty&apos;s Government should ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants our colleagues understand the word &quot; inhabitants &quot; in its ordinary sense and donot recommend that the choice should be confined to those who may be on the electoral roll at the moment when the issue of cessation arises. In itself thisis admirable and accords with the principle of consent, which we regard asfundamental. It means, however, that the majority of the Commission see no objection to giving the normally disenfranchised Africans of SouthernRhodesia an immediate right to decide in their own Territory for or againstFederation.6. In view of this we are at a loss to understand what objection there canbe to granting a similar right to the Africans of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland. Our people in the Protectorates are no less intelligent and responsible than the Africans of Southern Rhodesia and we can see nopossible reason for relegating them to an inferior status.Dislike and Fear of Federation7. We have tried to explain in the preceding paragraphs that our first objection to Federation is that it has been imposed on our peoplewithout their consent. We must now make it clear that we think they are justified in disliking and fearing Federation. Federation involves a politicalassociation with Southern Rhodesia. It is this that we find objectionable.The constitution of Southern Rhodesia is undemocratic, being deliberatelyframed so as to exclude Africans from any share of political power. Thereare no African members in the Parliament of Southern Rhodesia and thenumber of Africans entitled to vote is negligible. The Government ofSouthern Rhodesia practises racial discrimination. Some of the moreintolerable instances of this are set out in Chapter 11 of the Majority Report.We have noted with approval the warning given by the majority that anyfurther association of Southern Rhodesia with the Protectorates can only besecured by the removal of instances of racial discrimination embedded in southern Rhodesian laws and practices. We know that all members of theCommission have made great efforts to understand how Africans feel on this issue, but we believe that it is impossible for any white man, however under-standing, to appreciate fully the sense of degradation and feelings of angeraroused by racial discrimination and by the contempt openly shown by manyEuropeans for Africans. These things are a particular source of bitternesswhen they receive support from the law and from the authorities as they do in southern Rhodesia.8. We know that there is now talk of allowing Africans to sit in the parliament of Southern Rhodesia. We welcome this as a beginning, butwe are sorry to say that we think it will ibe a long time before that countryattains a democratic form of Government which would be acceptable to the
IAfricans of the Northern Territories. From what we heard in evidence wethink that the Southern Rhodesian Europeans would strongly resist anychange in the franchise which would put the majority of Africans on thevoters&apos; roll. In Nyasaland the new franchise will have the effect of makingthe majority of voters African. We trust and hope that similar proposals will be made for Northern Rhodesia in the very near future. Although thisis not an application of universal suffrage it goes far beyond anything thatwould be acceptable to the European minority in Southern Rhodesia. Withincompatibilities of this sort we do not think Southern Rhodesia can be ahappy associate of the two Northern Territories.9. We know that the Europeans in Nyasaland would be willing to acceptmajority rule and those of Northern Rhodesia could be persuaded to do so ifthey were not associated with the European settlers of Southern Rhodesia.The Europeans in the -Northern Territories would be willing to come to terms with the Africans so that their future could be assured. But in our view solong as Southern Rhodesia is a party to any association, these Territorieswill be held back by constant strife which could eventually lead to bloodshed.Defence10. There is one particular feature of the political association between theProtectorates and Southern Rhodesia which requires special mention in this context. The treaties which the British officials entered into with our Chiefshave always been regarded by our people as treaties of protection. TheChiefs in their wisdom felt that their people and their lands were in dangerand gave concessions to Queen Victoria&apos;s emissaries in return for herprotection. When Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were forced into an association with Southern Rhodesia, control of defence forces passed fromthe Government of the United Kingdom to the Federal Government. this transfer of control may have been inevitable if the Federation was to be setup at all, hut we regard it as a betrayal; something contrary to the spirit inwhich the treaties were originally made.11. Apart from the question of the treaties we are worried about the use to which defence forces might be put with external affairs under the controlof the Federal Government. Schemes are advocated from time to time bythe Europeans of Southern Rhodesia for a defensive alliance of the govern-ments of Southern Africa. It seems to us very terrible to contemplate thatour men and our revenues might be used in support of apartheid in SouthAfrica or the forced labour system of the Portguese dependencies.The Federal Economy12. The main argument of the Majority Report for the continuation of federation is the economic one. We have already argued on political groundswhy Federation cannot continue in its present form, or even in the modifiedform suggested by our colleagues who have signed the Majority Report. Wehave already stated that the Federation does not rest on the consent of thepeople it governs ; this is a matter of principle, a principle of such importance that we do not believe an argument based on economic expediency shouldbe permitted to override it. In addition, as we hope to show in the rest ofthis section, we believe that the economic development of Central Africasince Federation has been distorted and unbalanced, and has benefited the african population far less than the Majority Report implies.
13. In making our comments on the economic argument for the Federation,we would draw the attention of the Governments concerned to &quot; Nyasaland,The Economics of Federation &quot; by Arthur Hazlewood and P. D. Henderson,&quot; Central Africa, The Economics of Inequality &quot; by Shirley Williams, and&quot; New Deal in Central Africa &quot; (the economic contribution made by ProfessorBarber). We have studied these contributions and related them to theevidence given to us by various witnesses with reference to the economicsof Central Africa.14. We would question a basic conclusion of the Majority Report:&quot;... the high hopes with which Federation was founded have, on theeconomic side, been fulfilled&quot; (Chapter 4). It is in this belief, above all,that the majority has rested its case for the continuation of Federation.15. The majority does not dispute the unpopularity of the Federationamong Africans, notably Africans in the two Northern Territories :&quot;The dislike of Federation among Africans in the two- northern territories is widespread, sincere and of long standing. It is almostpathological.&quot;  (Chapter 3.)16. Nor does the majority fail to realise that the Africans in the twoNorthern Territories are dubious about the economic benefits. Referring to southern Rhodesian Africans, the Majority Report states that &quot;... they havea clearer appreciation of the economic benefits which have come fromFederation since so much of the development has taken place in their territory.&quot; (Chapter 3.) We would question the word &quot; clearer &quot;. It isnot that Africans in the Northern Territories are unclear about economic benefits; they have had far fewer. Economic development of the threeCentral African Territories since Federation has been a notably unbalancedone.Uneven Development17. The Majority Report concedes that the economic development ofthe Federal area has been &quot;uneven&quot; as well as &quot;remarkable&quot;. We donot deny that there has been economic advance under Federation, although we note that there have also been striking economic advances in other african states, which are not federated, over the last seven years, e.g. in Ghana and east African Territories.18. To support its case, the majority has produced a number of statistics(Chapter 4). These statistics appear impressive, but they represent only part of the truth. We feel that we must comment on one or two of them, to balance the picture being presented.19. The first set of figures shows the growth of the money and sub-sistence economics taken together. The figures must, however, be seen in thelight of two facts ; first, that the majority of Africans, who still depend onthe subsistence economy for a living, have incomes of only about a third ofthe average figures given here; and second, that the increase in income of people living in the subsistence economy our poorest citizens has been less than half that of those in the money economy, and of the european community our richest citizens. There is plently of evidence to showthat the Federal Government does not greatly concern itself with thisgrowing gap in incomes, and indeed, has no effective policy for redistribution-buting income to benefit the hundreds of thousands living in poverty.
20. The second set of figures indicates the increase in African wages.We would point out that these wages remain very low indeed ; and thatthe other side of the picture is the fantastic difference between Europeanwages and African wages. We know that skill and knowledge commandbetter pay ; we know also that African workers sometimes produce lessthan European workers, because of poor diets and so on. But thedifference in the Federation is vast between ten and twenty times asmuch is paid to Europeans as to Africans. There has been no indicationat all since Federation that this difference in rates of pay is changing toany reasonable and just difference based on skill or ability. When wecompare the pay of unskilled workers as against highly skilled workersin the United Kingdom with differences in the Federation, we can onlyconclude, and evidence we have heard bears us out, that race has been and remains a major factor in the level of wages paid to the two com-munities in Central Africa.21. We mention below our objections to the third set of figures onNyasaland&apos;s growth, which is not comparative, and therefore gives no indication of the rate of growth reached in Nyasaland before Federation.The money economy in Nyasaland is tiny and unrepresentative. If thewhole economy is taken, the record since Federation as compared withbefore Federation is not particularly impressive. Finally, on the figureson exports in item 10 we would point out that Professor Jack, in his report on Nyasaland, indicated that exports of Nyasaland&apos;s chief agricul-tural crops rose much faster in the four years before Federation than inthe four years after.22. It is argued by the majority that Federation must be responsiblefor the rapid rate of growth because the proportion of expenditure onnrports is dropping. Certainly this means that the manufacturers ofSouthern Rhodesia have benefitted from the Federal tariff ; but we do notthink it proves anything more than that. Any country can reduce theproportion of its expenditure it spends on imports by imposing high tariffs.We understand that countries much richer than ours may actually have arising proportion of imports in their consumer expenditure, if they areliberal in their tariff policies. Nor are we convinced that our people would save less if Federation was to end. After all, other African countries(like Ghana) manage to finance a large part of their capital investment programmes by their own domestic savings.23. It is because we believe that Federal economic policy has been one of distortion that we question its economic value. First, the majoritybears out there has been at best an inadequate development of the back-ward areas of Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and the Southern Rhodesiareserves. Little money has been spent on African agriculture less thanon European agriculture, which is a less important part of the Europeans&apos;livelihood. The lion&apos;s share of industrial development has gone to SouthernRhodesia ( 105 million out of  127 million as the Majority Report states)and has been protected against competition from outside the Federal area.Most of the development money has gone to the Kariba Dam and the rhodesia Railways which obviously benefit the European business com-munity more than Africans in the North who have no electricity and are
far removed from the line of rail. Furthermore, the difference in costs of production (such as power, water supply and transport) between SouthernRhodesia and the Copperbelt on the one hand and heavily populatedNyasaland on the other, are being still further weighted against Nyasa-land (and for that matter most of Northern Rhodesia) by the speed ofdevelopment of basic utilities in the European areas. In short, we do notthink Federation has done much to increase the standard of life of the poor majority of the people: we believe it has helped most those whowere already well-off.24. Some economists have contended that Nyasaland&apos;s economic expan-sion before Federation was higher in the five years before 1953 than in thefive years since ; and that much more was done in the years before toencourage the growth of African cash crops than has been done by theFederal Government. We are convinced that this view is correct. (&quot; central africa, The Economics of Inequality &quot;, by S. Williams and &quot; New Deal in central Africa &quot;, ed. Colin Leys).Lack of Co-ordination25. We would also point out that the lack of co-ordination betweenthe Territories and the Federal Government has been serious and hasled to a questionable system of priorities. In many cases, Federal scheme shave gone ahead while Territorial schemes of greater importance to theinhabitants have been held back for lack of finance. For example, theKafue and Shire hydro-electric schemes have been shelved in the interestsof the development of the Kariba Dam. We see no reason to believe thatthe Federal Government will give a greater priority to schemes operating in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in future, where these will mainlybenefit the African people. It has, as the Majority Report points out,done little to try to work out priorities or to co-ordinate development.We therefore doubt whether the return of certain political powers to the territories would in any way influence the Federal Government towardsgiving priority development in the mainly African areas of the Federalregion. In saying this, we are happy to endorse a statement by our col-leagues who have signed the Majority Report which mentions the recom-mendation of the 1952 Fiscal Commission that the economic policy of theFederation should give special weight to development of the poor areasof the North. Our colleagues go on to recommend this, and continue:&quot;... so that a more uniform level of development throughout the Federa-tion may be achieved. In particular in Nyasaland the combination of a relatively small land area with a large and growing population and gravepoverty poses a special problem which must necessarily dominate all future economic thinking in the Federation. Without the solution of this problem,political stability cannot be secured for long&quot;.26. Why do we not believe that the Federal Government would give any more weight to this recommendation in future than it has in thepast? Because we do not believe that proposals in the Majority report will provide for a Federation in which the majority of inhabitants havepolitical powers in the democratic sense of deciding who shall rule them.The Majority Report cannot do more than suggest a better line ofbehaviour to the Government of Southern Rhodesia, arid experience of
IPprevious attempts to reform the franchise in that Territory (like that ofMr. Garfield Todd) suggests1 to us that the Commission^ suggestions willbe disregarded. The proposed widening of the Federal franchise does not go far enough and is stated in terms too uncertain to guarantee thatthe political opinions of the majority of Africans will be adequately repre-sented in a reformed Federal Parliament. Therefore, we believe that theFederal Government, still largely under the domination of the european community, will use the powerful economic weapons that the majority report believes it should retain, to continue a policy of distorted economic development in which the European community continues to be favouredboth in current and development expenditure. We cannot believe thatthere can be any spectacular changes in the economic development patternin African areas until the Africans themselves take control both of theTerritorial Governments and of any co-ordinating associations which theymay wish to form among themselves.The Majority Case27. The Majority Report points out what it regards as the economic benefits of Federation. The first of these is the existence of a large market.We admit this is an advantage, but it seems to us an advantage which hasup to now been of benefit almost entirely to one territory, SouthernRhodesia. We understand that the common tariff around the Federationmay even have increased the prices of certain goods that used to be importedand are now made in Southern Rhodesia without the two Northern Terri-tories having been given much chance to develop themselves the new indus-tries they need. However, we believe that the development of the common market should come at a later stage when industries have been able todevelop in each of the Territories, and when the democratic governments may decide what is of best value to them. Otherwise the &quot;common market&quot; will benefit overwhelmingly the Territory that is economicallystrongest in the manufacturing field -Southern Rhodesia.28. The second advantage is, the majority states, the greater creditworthiness of the Federation as compared to the three separate Territories.Again, we agree this might be true in theory, but the argument depends onthe Federation being a politically stable and contented state. We do notbelieve that the changes suggested by the majority are sufficient to makeit so. Considering the rapid decline in the credit worthiness of SouthAfrica and of the Congo, we consider it very unwise to rely on the creditworthiness of any country whose political situation is unstable, as we believe the Federation^ to be. This instability will continue as long as politicalpower lies in the hands of a minority which lacks the support of the majorityof the inhabitants. Indeed, the majority recognises this, when it states :&quot; General confidence in the future of the area and in its soundness as a field for investment has been established, and, until recently, fully maintained.&quot;29. We would draw the attention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to&quot; until recently &quot; in that phrase. It is clear that, as the Africans becomedaily more adamant in their opposition to Federation, and as attempts to suppress that opposition become more extreme, the Federation^ creditworthiness is increasingly questioned.
30. We are not happy either about the argument that the three territories are complementary economies, if &quot; manpower &quot; is taken to be the product of Nyasaland. Certainly, manpower is at present the main product of nyasaland, but this seems to us a situation that should be corrected, not an assumption on which an argument for Federation is based. At present,Nyasaland is involved in the cost of producing health services for mothersand children, educating the children, seeing them leave for other territoriesfor a large part of their best working years, and returning home when theyare old or ill, after having assisted to produce wealth for other territories.This means that Nyasaland has to bear a large part of the cost for men whose main production is given outside her borders. The Majority Reportsays that Nyasaland will suffer if she leaves Federation because labourmarkets in Southern Rhodesia will be closed to her workers, but this alreadyis happening ; Southern Rhodesia already restricts emigrants from going into manfacturing and may restrict further when Southern RhodesianAfricans leave the reserves in thousands owing to the Native LandHusbandry Act.Future Economic Association31. For the reasons we have given, both political and economic, our own view remains this: that the Federation of Central Africa should be dissolvedforthwith. We recognise that there should be some mechanism for economicconsultation between the three Territories, and we see no reason why thismechanism needs to affect any Territory&apos;s independence. We would therefore propose the setting up of an Inter-Territorial Economic Council at Minis-terial level. Naturally the precise functions of such a Council will have tobe worked out by the Governments of the Territories concerned. Such a council would, of course, only work successfully if each Territory recog-nised the other Territories as equal members, and did not seek to dominatethem politically or economically. Such a Council would be able to administer the Kariba scheme through a subordinate power board on behalf of thethree Governments, and possibly railways and harbours also. other functions might be given to it as the three Territorial Governments mightfrom time to time decide. We understand that the East Africa high commission has satisfactorily discharged functions of a similar kind. we also note that there are other examples of co-operation between african territories which have not involved substantial sacrifices of sovereignty.We believe also that loans have been made by international bodies to co-ordinating boards, backed by a Government guarantee, for example, to theEast African Railways and Harbours Board.32. We are interested to notice that our colleagues who have signed theMajority Report seem to believe that similar methods of co-co-ordination between the Territories are prefeotly possible in the case of education (their proposal for an Education Consultative Council) and for health (their pro-posal for a Central African Health Service). Furthermore, they think so little of the co-ordination between Territorial economic programmes of thepresent Federation that they recommend the establishment of a new body,an Economic Development Council. We are pleased that our colleagueshave recognised the lack of attention that has been paid by the federal government to establishing priorities as between Territorial programmes and the Federal programme.  As we have argued, this has led to a system
in which Territorial schemes in the North, devised to improve African living standards, have had to go begging for funds while less essential Federalschemes were given the money to go ahead.33. In short, our colleagues believe inter-territorial co-operation is quite possible in two vital fields, education and health. We believe that, to theextent that the Territorial Governments believe it to foe necessary, similarbodies can be established in the economic field.34. We have no objection to closer economic association or eveneconomic union between countries enjoying a democratically elected, repre-sentative Government. Such Governments will enter economic associationsbecause they believe they will benefit their inhabitants not a section ofthem, or a particular group; and they are answerable to their electorate for what they have done again, to a wide, representative electorate and notto one that is limited by considerations of income or race. Such Govern-ments will have to make sure that the economic policies of an associationare acceptable to the majority of their inhabitants.35. We believe, therefore, that if the Governments of the northern territories should decide, at a time when they are genuinely representativeof their peoples, that there should be a closer economic association between themselves, or between themselves and other states with similar governments and sharing similar ideals, such a closer association might be of great benefit.It is because the Federation is a distorted association, largely serving theends of a minority of its people that we oppose it and will continue to oppose it.Constitutional Advance in the Territories36. Before we set out our objections to the way in which this question has foeen dealt with in the Majority Report there is a preliminary point we feel bound to make with the greatest possible emphasis. Rapid con-stitutional advance in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland is essential. Weconsider that because of their association with the Federation these territories have since 1953 lagged behind other comparable territories underthe jurisdiction of the Colonial Office. However, even if the most thorough-going reforms are introduced immediately, giving Africans a proper share in the government of the Protectorates, we do not think this will affecttheir attitude to Federation so long as Southern Rhodesia continues to be ruled under an undemocratic constitution in the interests of a Europeanminority. Constitutional reform in the Protectorates is necessary for the sake of justice and good government but it would be an illusion to suppose that it could of itself bring about a change of heart on the question of federation.37. This preliminary point leads naturally to our first objection to thereoommendations of the majority. They do not deal with constitutional advance in Southern Rhodesia. We appreciate that there are negotiations in progress between the Southern Rhodesia Government and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment concerned with the conditions under which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would foe prepared to relinquish the reserved powers overSouthern Rhodesian legislation. However we cannot see why this shouldpreclude the Commission from making recommendations afoout theSouthern Rhodesia Constitution. Indeed it seems to us that the recom-mendations of the Commission would be a factor which Her Majesty&apos;s
government would want to take into consideration in the negotiations nowin progress.38. Our second objection is the failure of the Majority Report to makeany recommendations about the ultimate objective of constitutional progressin the Territories. In our view what is really needed to reassure african opinion is a solemn declaration by the Government of the United kingdom that the goal for the Protectorates is a fully democratic system of govern-ment based on universal adult franchise. If such a declaration by her majesty&apos;s Government could be accompanied by a similar declaration bythe Government of Southern Rhodesia in relation to that Territory thepolitical situation throughout the entire Federation would be transformed.We appreciate of course that progress must be made in stages and we wouldbe quite prepared to recommend to our people reasonable interim measures(as hereafter set out), provided we were certain that the ultimate objective was the abolition of racial privilege in the Government of our countries.39. Finally we cannot agree that the substance of the majority recom-mendations on this subject are sufficiently explicit or far-reaching.40. We urge the British Government to accelerate the rate of con-stitutional advance in the Protectorates. We believe that the agreement reached between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Nyasalanddelegations is only a temporary expedient because it falls far short of african aims. The Africans there expect self-government on terms similarto those agreed for Tanganyika. The present agreement cannot hope to bethe basis of a stable government. There is need, therefore, to review thelatest constitutional advance at the Federal Review Conference in order togrant Nyasaland a constitution similar to that recently proposed forTanganyika. The failure of the British Government to grant a new con-stitution to Northern Rhodesia simultaneously with that of Nyasaland hasled to a great deal of unrest in the minds of Africans in that Territory, andit is becoming increasingly difficult for the African leaders to control their followers. We strongly urge the British Government to call an immediateconference to discuss a new constitution for Northern Rhodesia beforethe Federal Constitutional Review Conference. Such a constitution for northern Rhodesia should give the Africans a stage of constitutional advance similar to that recently proposed for Tanganyika.41. We believe that nothing less than this will give satisfaction to the africans. We want to emphasise that there can be no long-term and stableeconomic prosperity in these Territories unless and until the Africans, dulyelected by their people, are in control of their own governments. We,therefore, make the following recommendations for Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland which, in our opinion, if put into effect, will ease tension inthe Protectorates.Legislative Council(a) Effective African majorities of elected members.(b) Minimum representation of minorities through reserved seats elected on a common roll.(c) A minimum of two official members (Finance Secretary and attorney general).
Executive Council(a) Effective African majorities of elected members.(b) A minimum of minority representation.(c) Two officials.(d) The leader of the majority party to be the Chief Minister.(e) All ministers to hold ministerial portfolios and be responsible to theLegislature.(f) All members of the Executive Council except as in (c) above to bedrawn from among the elected members of the Legislative Council.(g) The Governor not to be a member of the Executive Council but toact on its advice. He should retain reserved powers which heshould use as an accepted and not abnormal political practice,linked by a constitutional reference to a referendum or to a generalelection.Franchise42. We will not surrender our belief in the fundamental basic principleof &quot; one man one vote &quot; for the election of the peoples&apos; representatives inthe Legislative Council. Representative government does not mean a greatdeal unless every adult inhabitant exercises his right to vote for the person of his own choice. But we do realise to our great disappointment that inorder to allay the strong psychological fears of the Europeans, it is necessaryto accept as a purely temporary measure a qualitative franchise which muststill reflect the wishes of the majority of the people. It follows therefore that such a franchise must be as broad as possible to include as many people as is feasible under the existing circumstances. We therefore recom-mend that in order to overcome this fear and win the co-operation of the europeans, Africans should be prepared to accept for the time being afranchise that gives substantial representation to minorities, beyond whatthey would achieve through universal suffrage. Qualifications for the franchise should, therefore, be linked to service to the community over acourse of years through payment of an agreed number of annual taxes.Women should have a vote when they reach the same age, proved or apparent,as the male taxpayer when he first qualifies.43. Persons exempted through infirmity or age should have the vote. Wedo not believe in any vote based on literacy or income or property qualifica-tions. A person&apos;s right to vote should not be determined by the ability to read or write or any capacity for making money. We were impressed duringour course of enquiry by the wisdom that manifests itself among the elderlypeople who could neither read nor write.Southern Rhodesia44. We feel that it would not be appropriate for us to make detailed recommendations about Southern Rhodesia of the kind set out above. Wethink it sufficient to say that not less than two-thirds of the Members of theLegislative Assembly and Cabinet should be Africans elected on a franchisesimilar to that which we have recommended for Nyasaland and northern rhodesia.
Introductory Remarks45. we want to say once again that we are unable to accept the continued existence of a Federation not based on consent.46. Life will not proceed peacefully under any form of Federal Govern-ment, and its continuation will be disrupted and insecure and will destroy the credit worthiness of our countries. A refusal of Africans to co-operate with Governments will upset educational, agricultural and constructionalplans.  Inter-racial hatred will greatly hinder industry and commerce.47. In the allocation of functions between the Federal and territorial governments, we are conscious of a sense of unreality. We are forced to comment on the allocation of functions because of the ugly thought that britain may reimpose the Federal scheme against the wishes of the Africansalthough such a course of action would lead to unhappiness and disaster in central Africa. In making these comments, nothing should be construed as implying our acceptance of the Federation. They are an attempt to showthat even such allocations would not be satisfactory to the African peopleunder any form of Federation.48. There is another reason why we feel that it is necessary for us to comment on the proposals made by the majority for continuing some formof Federation in spite of our intense dislike of it. We feel that it is our duty to make proposals that would reduce to some extent the disastrousresult of its further imposition.49. Accordingly we propose to deal in this part with three topics (i) Safe-guards, (ii) Reallocation of Responsibility and (iii) Federal Legislatureand Franchise.Safeguards50. We entirely agree with the Majority Report in attaching the utmost importance to the Bill of Rights. We think a Bill of Rights will help to reassure Europeans and Asians who find themselves outnumbered by africans in all three Territories. We consider also that irrespective of race thereis an urgent need for the ordinary citizen to have some protection againstthe alarming growth of repressive legislation and police powers which havetaken place in the Federation since 1953.51. Unfortunately, after considering the matter ourselves, and takinglegal advice, we are unable to agree that legislation along the lines of theCanadian Bill of Rights would provide a satisfactory safeguard. There aretwo difficulties about the provisions of the Bill in the context of central africa :(a) It is not clear what the effect of such provisions would be on theexisting body of legislation in the Territories and in the Federation.If a Bill of Rights of this type were intended to provide no morethan rules of construction we consider that it would fall far short of what is required. If on the other hand it operated so as to in-validate existing legislation inconsistent with its provisions wethink it would lead to great uncertainty particularly in the adminis-tration of criminal law.  It will be appreciated that the Canadian
Bill purports to be declaratory, and this no doubt reflects the factthat Canada has for generations enjoyed a high standard of per-sonal and political freedom. Unfortunately in the Federation thesituation is very different. In all three territories there are aconsiderable number of repressive laws on the statute book whichare prima facie inconsistent with the wide general provisions ofthe Bill. It would take many years and much expensive litigationbefore the validity of these enactments could be tested in Court.(b) A more serious objection to the Canadian Bill is that it contains a proviso permitting the rights and freedoms declared in the Billto be abrogated by the express provisions of a subsequent Act ofParliament. This is a fatal flaw. It is essential that a Bill of rights should form part of the entrenched clauses of the Constitu-tion, and that any subsequent legislation inconsistent with its provisions should be null and void, howsoever drafted. We do notthink a Bill of Rights would be adequate if its provisions couldbe evaded by the simple expedient of introducing repressive ordiscriminatory legislation with the words &quot;Notwithstanding any-thing contained in the Bill of Rights   .   .   .&quot;52. We appreciate, of course, that the Canadian Bill is cited in theMajority Report only by way of illustration. However there is no otherindication of the mind of the Commission on this vital problem, and we have therefore thought it right to place on record these objections.53. We are reluctant to make any detailed suggestions for an alternativeBill of Rights. On the whole our preference would be for somethingfollowing the European Convention for the Protection of Fluman rights which is, of course, the basis of provisions now included in the Constitutionof Nigeria. There is however one point on which we must be specific. Wethink that legislation to make racial discrimination illegal in the field of social, economic and commercial practice envisaged in Chapter 11 of theMajority Report ought to be written into any Bill of Rights that may beadopted.Councils of State54. While we are prepared to accept the majority view that the councils of State should not deal with individual cases we think that there is room for the Councils to play a part in enforcing the provisions of the Bill of rights prohibiting racial discrimination in cases which affect a community or substantial group. For this purpose we think that the Councils shouldbe empowered to initiate action in court in the interests of the public. Wethink this would help to overcome the difficulty that there is no effectivescheme for legal aid in the Federation, and the average African, who maybe the victim of discrimination, cannot afford to pay for the services ofa lawyer.Reallocation of Responsibility55. We welcome the proposals to make agriculture, health, prisons and education Territorial responsibilities, together with inter-territorial roads andother comparatively minor functions.
56. In spite of the reasons given in Chapter 14 of the Majority report we do not agree that these transfers should be made gradually as recom-mended by the majority both in that Chapter and in Chapter 8. Whenthe Federation was established new services had to be formed and it tooktime to persuade civil servants to transfer to them. Re-transfers will mean a return to familiar conditions which are still remembered by the majorityof the personnel and no delay should be necessary. We consider that agricultural policies will not be truly independent of the Federal Governmentwhile marketing remains in that Governmenfs hands. Marketing has been used in the Federation effectively to help European farmers and the cropswhich European farmers produce as against African farmers, and we believethat even if agriculture is returned to the Territories, the Federal Governmentwill still be able to use marketing policies to favour the European farming community. The encouragement of the growth of cash crops by Africansdepends to a great extent on marketing policies which will help farmers in the more remote areas of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia.57. We are not happy that higher education is to be left Concurrent(Chapter 8). The provision of the Constitution that any Federal legislationshall override Territorial legislation on the same subject still remains inforce. Territorial provisions for higher education may be frustrated byFederal interference. The co-ordination of higher education between thethree Territories would be far better left in the hands of an autonomousboard established for that purpose, to which the necessary revenues shouldbe paid (on the same pattern as the University Grants Commission of theUnited Kingdom). This would lead to a control that was more flexible andmore closely in touch with pupils, parents and teachers. If the Federationprovided none of the revenues for higher education, it could be kept entirelyout of this field in which it has shown itself to have a malign and reactionaryattitude in favour of racialism and conformity. For example, the refusal to employ Dr. Chidzero at the University of Rhodesia purely for thereason that he had married a white woman should demonstrate the dangerof leaving higher education in the hands of the Federal Government. Theuse of Federal immigration laws excluding Mr. Faber from his teachingpost at the University of Rhodesia is an instance of Federal influence in higher education; but even more serious than these two examples is the exclusion of Africans from Federal technical training institutions and theFederal opinion towards segregation of the races at Gwebi AgriculturalCollege and the Post Office Training School in Salisbury, and the denial ofeducation to Africans in polytechnic schools.58. It is surely old-fashioned to think that higher education is not a day to day concern of the people. We believe that it is and that it should bea Territorial responsibility, with the co-ordinating body we have outlined.Immigration and Deportation59. We much regret the majority&apos;s decision to leave immigration amongthe Federal Governments responsibilities.60. The Federal Government has used its powers to exclude from ourTerritories a number of our friends. In particular we are distressed thatMr. John Stonehouse, a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom,has been deported from the Federation and is at the time of writing in danger of being excluded again.   The United Kingdom Parliament is
responsible for our welfare in the Protectorates and to a lesser degree forthe welfare of the Africans of Southern Rhodesia, and it is intolerable thatits Members should not be able to visit us and see the way in which we live.Economic Changes61. The main objection to the changes suggested by the majority, in theeconomic field, is that these changes attempt to divorce political andeconomic powers, returning some of the former to the Territories, butretaining all the major economic powers in Federal hands. We do notbelieve that such a divorce is practicable, nor do we feel that it will leadto a contented State. The Territorial governments will find their policiesfrustrated by their impotence in the financial field.62. We doubt whether any economic policy advanced by the federal government will be equally acceptable to the Governments of the twoNorthern Territories and the Government of Southern Rhodesia. In the consequent debate, the Federal Government will find it extremely difficultto reconcile the differing aims of the Territorial Governments or to avoidserious political consequences if it attempts to override their aims. We donot believe that semi-responsible Governments in the Territories would prove to be a permanent solution to the present political and economic tensionsof the Federation; and we do not see in the near future much UkeHhoodof the four Governments sharing similar aims. The position would bebetter if the two Northern Territories were democratic, independent states.This would remove the economic as well as the political instability in those areas. Similarly, we see the danger of European domination in SouthernRhodesia, which will lead to serious increasing tensions between the Africanmasses and the governing European minority, which will intensify economicinstability in that Territory as well. The future of the whole Federal area is therefore one of uncertainty for investors and cannot attract much capital investment unless there is political stability.Greater Powers for Territories63. If the Territorial Governments are to be genuinely responsible totheir electorates, they will need greater powers than the Majority Reportrecommends. While the main powers of taxation remain in other hands,&quot;responsible government&quot; in the Territories will be little more than a sopto public opinion. We do not think that economic policy and social andpolitical policy can be divorced in an arbitrary manner.64. Nevertheless, we feel that the proposal in Scheme II in Chapter 9 ofthe Majority Report which would return the power to set rates of personalincome tax to the Territories is an improvement on the present situation.65. We accept, also, that more flexibility in the Territorial tax surchargerates is an improvement on the present situation.The Loans Council66. We dislike the proposal to increase the powers of the Loans Councilwhile retaining the present membership of that Council in the hands of theFinance Ministers of the four governments.67. The Governor-General and the Territorial Governors have alwaysnominated the Finance Ministers as members of the Loans Council. TheFinance Ministers are likely to be drawn from the civil service for sometime to come in the Northern Territories, and they are likely to be drawn
from among European politicians in Southern Rhodesia and in the federal government. We do not believe that a body with such great powers as the Loans Council will enjoy should not have any African representatives on it. Accordingly, we would insist that the Loans Council should haveAfrican Ministers in equal numbers. This would need an amendment to article 88 of the Constitution of 1953, under which the Governor-Generaland Territorial Governors nominate one member each.Outside Economic. Aid68. We have limited our comments on the Majority Report proposals tothe most outstanding differences we have with them. We do not believethat the continuation of Federation will solve the problem of the under-developament of our Territories, and we believe that countries outside, notably the United Kingdom, will have to aid us whether or not this detested formof Government continues.69. The Majority Report indicates (Chapter 15) that the United KingdomGovernment has a continuing responsibility for the Northern Territories,even if the Federation continues. The majority states &quot; It is becoming increasingly clear that development schemes both agricultural and industrial are no less urgent in Northern Rhodesia than in other parts of theFederation, and Northern Rhodesia can ill afford to divert elsewhere fundsneeded for these purposes. We hope that the United Kingdom Governmentwill consider means of relieving the situation.&quot; We accept this view. Webelieve that Northern Rhodesian funds are being diverted to SouthernRhodesia and Nyasaland, and believe that the end of the Federation wouldenable the Northern Rhodesian Government to spend its own revenue onthe development of that Territory, which is of first importance. Nyasaland would then depend in part on assistance from the United Kingdom Govern-ment (in this we do not differ from the majority), aided also, we hopeand believe, by assistance from international bodies such as the WorldBank, the U.N. Technical Assistance Scheme, the International development fund, and the Special Fund for Development of the United Nations. It isalso possible that the British Government could seek the co-operation ofthe Government of the United States under its African programme in thedevelopment of the two Northern Territories, and particularly in the educa-tional and economic schemes which the United States Government makesavailable to under-developed territories. We would also endorse the majorityproposal that low interest Exchequer Loans should be made available forgeneral economic development.Federal Legislature and Franchise70. We cannot agree with the majority as to the allocation of seatsbetween the three Territories. We cannot understand why Southern Rhodesiashould have such a large number as 27 members whereas Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland are given far less. Moreover, there are a large numberof seats allocated to Europeans of Southern Rhodesia at the expense ofthe Africans in that Territory. By implication the majority think that the europeans in Southern Rhodesia must still play a dominant part in the affairs of Central Africa. We do not hold this view and we believe that theEuropean minority group should not be accorded a larger number of seats in that Territory. We also note that in Northern Rhodesia there is to bean equal number of seats between Europeans and Africans.   There can
be no justification for this arbitrary arrangement. It does not take intoaccount the numbers of the population of each community. By virtue oftheir numbers the Africans of Northern Rhodesia should have a muchbigger representation. In regard to Nyasaland, we cannot understand whya country with a larger population than either of the other territories should have only 13 seats which is less -than half of what is allocated to southern Rhodesia. To any unbiased person it would be clear that thisis an unfair way of allocating seats, and we cannot accept it.71. At present every African Federal member is supposed to represent600,000 Africans. In fact 10 out of 12 are not representative of african opinion at all, being elected on European votes or nominated by a Governor.Every European Member of Parliament represents 7,000 Europeans. Ifthe majority recommendations are accepted each African Member ofParliament will represent 230,000 Africans and each European Memberof Parliament will represent 10,000 Europeans. The figures can be taken as the measure of advance which the majority has thought satisfactory.As we have stated elsewhere nothing will satisfy the Africans at this stageexcept an African majority in the Federal Assembly and its Cabinet.72. The Commission leaves the question of the quahfications for the franchise with the recommendation that they should bring a larger numberof Africans on the roll and ensure &quot;that the Federal Assembly can fairly be regarded as representative of the broad mass of both African and european opinion&quot;, and some other general principles which would tendto widen the franchise and do away with some of the worst practices of thepast. We wish that the majority had directed more of their attention tothe claims of universal adult franchise to be the only known form of franchisewhich successfully secures the loyalty and acceptance of modern electorates.73. We feel that primary elections for minority candidates is a confusingdevice and believe that it would be sufficient safeguard that a candidatestanding for a minority seat has the nomination of a reasonably largenumber of voters of the race he is to represent. We consider that 20, withhis relatives excluded, would be sufficient safeguard. The majority thinkthat it as a great thing to have &quot; parity &quot; between the European and african representatives in the Federal Assembly as a principle, but we do not accept this view. It might have been acceptable to the Africans in 1953 but it isnow too late in view of the fact that Africans in the neighbouring territorieshave achieved self-government. The African inhabitants of Central Africafeel that they have the same right to govern their Territories as their neighbours.74. We feel that it is very important that Europeans should not feelinsecure. We want them to live and work amongst us and bring up their children in security. Their value to society as teachers, technicians, pro-ducers or traders assures them of safety and continued prosperity, just asit assures to the rich and salaried classes in England their accepted placein society. The Europeans in the West Indies play their role under a democratic system of government and the Europeans in Central Africa can do the same. It is on value to -the community that we must all rest oursafety. This has been proved true in a number of countries where whiteminorities live without being dominant.(Signed)   W. M. CHIRWA.H. G.

appendix HICOMMUNAL PRIMARY ELECTIONS1. Proposals for the conduct of primary elections on communal rolls were made inJune, 1960, by a working party consisting of the Chief Secretary and the attorney general of Kenya (Kenya Sessional Paper No. 7 of 1959-60). There has as yet been no practical experience of their working. The following summary of them is quotedfrom that paper: &quot; (i) ballot papers at primary elections should bear the names of all personsoffering themselves for nomination as candidates for the subsequent common roll elections;(ii) each person voting should be required to enter &apos; yes &apos; or &apos; no &apos; against eachname on the ballot paper; incomplete ballot papers would be rejected;(iii) at the count of the poll, the &apos; yes&apos;s &apos; against each name should be countedand expressed as a percentage of the total number of valid ballot papers;(iv) the candidature of any candidate securing 25 per cent, or more should be declared as endorsed by the voters in the primary, and that candidate shouldbe declared as nominated to contest the common roll election;(v) if only one candidate has secured 25 per cent, or more, then the candidatureof that one candidate should be declared as endorsed by the voters in the primary, and that candidate should be declared as elected unopposed;(vi) if no candidate has secured 25 per cent., all candidates participating in the primary should be declared as nominated to contest the common roll election,and if there is only one candidate he should be declared as elected un-opposed.&quot;The Single Transferable Vote2. An alternative method of determining the views of the communal electoratebefore the election on the common roll, could be provided by the adaptation forthis purpose of the single transferable vote system already in operation in SouthernRhodesia. This method would avoid the disadvantages inherent in the Kenyaproposal that, if no candidate received the required percentage of the original votescast, all persons nominated would qualify as candidates. Under it, each voter wouldbe required to state his second, as well as his first, choice of candidate. The candidatereceiving the smallest number of votes is then eUminated and the votes cast for himare transferred to the second-choice candidates appearing on the ballot papersconcerned until the number of persons seeking to stand is reduced to two only. Thesetwo alone would then qualify to go forward as candidates for the main election.Such a scheme would prevent a candidate going forward for election who did not enjoy a substantial measure of support from his own community.
