Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1960C. (60) 1404th October, 1960CABINETFINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE BUILDING SOCIETIESIN EAST africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies difficult economic and financial situation is developing in East Africa, andin Kenya in particular, owing to the lack of European and Asian confidence andthe consequent serious outflow of capital. One important aspect of this is underconsideration by the Cabinet Committee on Land Tenure in Kenya. Othermanifestations are the extremely illiquid position of the banks in East Africa due largely to the increase in their advances which have been used primarily to repatriate private capital and excessive withdrawals from the building societies.Action will shortly be taken to strengthen the banks&apos; position by a policy of creditrestriction introduced by an increase in bank interest rates. This memorandumdeals with the problem of the building societies.The problem. Three societies are concerned the Savings and Loan Society, the KenyaBuilding Society, and the First Permanent Building Society. The first two are established only in Kenya: the third is registered in Northern Rhodesia and hasexpanded into East Africa, where its branches are now, like the other two societies,unable from their own resources to meet the continued exceptionally high levelof withdrawals. In the first seven months of this year withdrawals by shareholdersand depositors of the three societies (together exceeded new investments by 1-7 millions in Kenya and by  0-3 millions in Tanganyika. It is estimated thatwithdrawals will exceed new investments in the period August 1960 to June 1961by  1 -8 millions in Kenya and by  0-4 millions in Tanganyika. Investigation hasshown that the plight of the societies is due to the fears of shareholders anddepositors about future political instability and financial controls in East Africa,particularly Kenya, and not to any inherent defects in the management of the societies.,3. The Savings and Loan Society is a wholly owned subsidiary of the PearlAssurance Company and the latter&apos;s credit is intimately involved with that of thesociety. The society is not registered as a building society, due partly to the historical accident in that it was established before legislation to permit and control the operation of building societies was enacted. For these reasons it would bedifficult to justify Government assistance to this society and what follows relatesonly to the other two societies.Possible Courses of Action4.   There is a choice between the following courses of action:(a) For the East African Governments to refuse Government assistance and to forbid the acceptance of new deposits by those societies unable to showthat they can meet expected withdrawals. Such societies would have to declare a moratorium and the Governments might, to relieve hardship,offer support to enable all investors to withdraw up to (say)  100 each.Copy No.57
(b) For the East African Governments, backed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government,to keep the societies in funds until 30th June, 1961, and to reconsider the position at that time. This was recommended by the colonial development Corporation consultant.(c) For the East African Governments, backed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government,to decide now that they will, on certain conditions, enable the building societies to meet all their withdrawal obligations until such time as they.  . have attained a satisfactory liquidity position.5. I do not believe that short-term support as in course (b) is either a practicalor a responsible policy for Government to adopt. If the short-term operationwere not successful and there seems no prima facie reason to suppose thatconfidence will be restored in East Africa within the next year the Governmentwould be morally compelled to continue support thereafter. Moreover, only open and complete governmental support is likely to staunch the flow of withdrawals and enable the societies to improve their liquidity. The choice must, therefore, be made between a moratorium and full Government support.Costs of the Alternative Courses6. Moratorium. If the limit on withdrawals was set at  100 it is estimated the assistance required would amount to less than  1 million.7. Full Government Support. It is estimated that the maximum liability,excluding the Savings and Loan Society, would not exceed  5^ millions. If the east african Governments announced that with the support of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment they were guaranteeing the building societies in this way, it is likely that the outflow of money would be stopped if not reversed but, whateverGovernment funds were engaged, they could not be fully repaid until the end of12 years.8. It would be essential for the success of the second alternative for it to be known that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were behind the Governments concerned.The sole guarantee of the East African Governments would not at this time givethe required degree of confidence. Moreover, the East African Governments arealready gravely short of finance for their development programmes.Arguments for Full Government Support9.   The main arguments for full Government support are:(a) A moratorium would constitute a default on contractual obligations by aGovernment-regulated savings institution: it would confirm investorsin their doubts of the wisdom of investing in Kenya and would givecolour to current rumours that &quot; assets are to be frozen &quot;. It might thus precipitate a financial crisis by further damaging confidence andaccelerating the transfer of funds from East Africa.(b) In the view of the Finance Minister of Northern Rhodesia and thePermanent Secretary to the Federal Minister of Finance a moratoriumin East Africa would have consequential effects in Central Africa onthe building society movement (worth about  70 millions) and on confidence generally. There would be likely to be a run on the FirstPermanent Building Society in Northern Rhodesia, and if this led to a moratorium there pressures would fall on other building societies inNorthern Rhodesia and throughout the Federation.(c) The cause of the present difficulties is political and a moratorium by thebuilding societies in East Africa would have political repercussions, bothin East and Central Africa. A Government guarantee of limitedwithdrawals only would be taken as a sign that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Colonial Governments were abandoning theEuropean investor while safeguarding the African.(d) Immediate action by the East African Governments, backed by HerMajestys Government to support the societies, might of itself halt the, increase in withdrawals and attract new investment and a financial crisis in East Africa might be averted altogether.
Arguments Against Full Government Support10.   There are two principal arguments against full Government support:  (a) It would in effect be guaranteeing the repatriation of capital to the UnitedKingdom. This is in itself undesirable if it can be avoided, but it could also have serious repercussions on our land policy in so far as theEuropean farmers in Kenya would seize on such action as an argument for meeting their requests for compensation schemes to enable them to repatriate their investment in the territory.I believe, however, that a distinction can validly be drawn betweenassistance to the building societies and the sort of compensationschemes for which owners of land in the Highlands have been asking.The building societies are Government-regulated institutions for the soundness of which the Government have some moral responsibility.The support proposed is not solely in the interests of the depositors, but is in the interests of the economy of Kenya as a whole. If investors&apos;confidence in Kenya were destroyed, everyone would suffer. Moreover,the collapse of the building societies is immediately imminent. the threat to land titles is a potential threat which could not mature tillafter independence.(b) if Government assistance, with Her Majesty&apos;s Governments backing, weregiven in East Africa, this would create a precedent which would be bound to be invoked if the building society movement foundered inNorthern Rhodesia as a result of a crisis of confidence following theReport of the Commission on the Review of the Constitution of rhodesia and Nyasaland under the Chairmanship of Lord Monckton.This would greatly extend Her Majesty&apos;s Governments maximumultimate liability from  5-1- millions in East Africa to over  15 millionsincluding all the building societies in Northern Rhodesia. If thebuilding societies in Southern Rhodesia were included the liability wouldbe further increased by  45 millions.As building societies are a territorial responsibility, it might wellbe difficult to refuse Government support for the building societiesin Northern Rhodesia if they fell into a position from which we hadrescued the East African societies. The Southern Rhodesia societiesare, however, financially stronger and are less likely to require support.While such support to Southern Rhodesia is not ruled out by purelyconstitutional reasons, in practice our relationship with SouthernRhodesia is such that support by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to building societies in the other territories need not be regarded as committingus to support in Southern Rhodesia.Recommendation11. The Finance Ministers of East Africa and Northern Rhodesia consider it essential to avoid a moratorium on the building societies in East Africa whichwould, in their view, be likely to precipitate a desperate financial and politicalsituation in East and Central Africa. On balance, I agree with them and i recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should back the East african governments in measures to support the building societies.12. This support should be conditional on acceptance by the building societies of a reorganisation and of conditions (including Government control solong as Government support is required) designed to strengthen their futureliquidity position and improve the regulation of their business. This crisis ofconfidence has revealed the weakness inherent in the establishment of branches ofthe First Permanent in each of the East African territories and it should be acondition of Government support that the First Permanent should withdraw from east Africa and confine its activities in future to Central Africa; new societies being formed in each of the East African territories to take over the assets and liabilities.This reorganisation would make a suitable context in which to offer government support and ensure that it could be withdrawn when the societies have attained asatisfactory liquidity position.13. Although I have not as yet consulted them, I hope that the colonial development Corporation might be willing to participate in the building society
movement in East Africa when it is reorganised. But if not, any funds needed toenable the Societies to meet their obligations would need to be new funds providedby Parliament except, of course, to the extent that my colleagues might feel thatEast African Governments ought to find a proportion even at the expense ofdevelopment (see paragraph 8 above).14. If my recommendation is accepted I propose that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should make an announcement on the lines of the Annex to thisMemorandum; but, before the precise terms of the announcement were settled,I should wish to consult the East African Governments on its drafting.I. M.Colonial Office,3rd October, 1960.ANNEXSTATEMENT TO BE MADE BY HER MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTThe opportunity was taken during the presence in London of the finance ministers of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika for the recent commonwealth economic Consultative Council meeting to discuss with them the position of thebuilding societies in East Africa in the light of the heavy withdrawals made bydepositors and shareholders during the current year.2. It was agreed that fresh legislation was needed to regulate the activitiesof the building societies and that, as in the United Kingdom, no building societyshould be allowed to operate in more than one territory. It was decided that early action should be taken to reorganise the operation of the building societies onthis basis.3. During the period of readjustment and until satisfactory liquidity ratiosare attained, the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika will, with thefull support of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, assume control of the assets of thebuilding societies and will be responsible for their liabilities.October, 1960.
