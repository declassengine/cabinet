(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 103 COPY NO.12th July, I960CABINETHUMAN ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATIONNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Secretary of State for scotland we have received the report of the Departmental Committee on human Artificial Insemination, and we propose to publish and present itto Parliament on 21st July.     We attach, at Annex A, a note on the contents of the report and, at Annex B, an uncorrected proof.2.        The Cabinet will recall that when this subject was discussed in1958 (C.C.(58) 18th Conclusions, Minute 3 and 47th Conclusions, Minute 5)some doubt was expressed about the expediency of appointing a Committeeto enquire into the moral and social aspects of artificial insemination ofwomen, since if the Committee recommended that the practice should be prohibited or regulated the Government would be confronted with an embarrassing responsibility.    In the event, the Committee have reachedthe conclusion that it would not be practicable or desirable for humanartificial insemination to be prohibited or regulated by law, although themajority express strong disapproval of artificial insemination with the seedof a donor other than the husband.     The only changes in the law whichare recommended by the majority concern divorce, nullity of marriage and maintenance, and these changes do not go much further than therecommendations already made by the Royal Commission on Marriage andDivorce.3.        We invite our colleagues to take note of the Committee&apos;s report.R. A. B.J. S. M.12th July, I960.-1-
ANNEX ANOTE ON REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEEON ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATIONThe Committee were appointed on 3rd September, 1958, with thefollowing terms of reference:-&quot;To enquire into the existing practice of humanartificial insemination and its legal consequences andto consider whether, taking account of the interests of individuals involved and of society as a whole, anychange in the law is necessary or desirable. &quot;The report is signed by seven members of the Committee.    The other two members, Mrs. Jay and Mr. John Ross (a former Assistant Under-Secretary of State in charge of the Children&apos;s Department of the HomeOffice) have written a memorandum of dissent (see paragraph 4 below).2.        The first chapter of the report summarises the information obtained by the Committee about the practice of human artificial insemina-tion and draws attention to its very limited extent (the number of childrenconceived by artificial insemination with the seed of a donor (A. I. D. ) appearto be not much more than 100 per year).     The second chapter sets out theexisting legal consequences of the practice.     The third chapter gives theCommittee&apos;s views on artificial insemination with the seed of the husband(A. I. H. ) as a practice which in its social consequences does not differ inprinciple from the conception of children by normal means.     Theremainder of the report is devoted to the Committee^ views on A. I. D. ,as it affects the individuals concerned - the husband and wife, the child,the donor and the doctor - and as it affects society.     Briefly, theCommittee strongly disapprove of A.I.D. for the reasons, amongst others,that it is a handicap for the intended child and a threat to the institution of marriage .    The Committee would like to see the practice discouraged,but they do not consider that it would be practicable or desirable to prohibit or regulate it by law.    The report ends with the hope that,although the law does not deal with A. I. D. , those concerned will appreciate the dangers and desist from the practice.3.        The only recommended changes in the law which are put forward by the majority of the Committee concern divorce, nullity of marriage and maintenance, and these recommendations are supported by the minority.    They can be summarised as follows:-(a) A. I. D. without the husband&apos;s consent should be a newground for divorce.(b) If a child has been born as a result of artificial insemination to which the husband has consented,neither husband nor wife should be able to petitionfor the marriage to be annulled on the ground ofimpotence.-2-
CONFIDENTIAL27(c)    Insofar as it is not already the law, a husband should berequired to maintain a child born to his wife as a resultof A.I.D. to which he has consented.4.        In the memorandum of dissent the minority make it clear that theyare not in favour of encouraging A. I. D. , but that they consider that it may properly be employed in a limited number of marriages, provided that bothapplicants and donors are carefully and expertly selected.     They alsorecommend that in the interests of children conceived in this way the definition of legitimacy should be extended to include a child born as aresult of A. I. D. to which the husband of the child&apos;s mother has consented.July, I960.-3-

The following abbreviations are used throughout the report:

A.I.H. is the abbreviation for artificial insemination with the husband&apos;s semen, and is sometimes described as "homologous" insemination. It is carried out when the husband&apos;s semen is fertile but is unable to reach the ovum by natural means. 1

A.I.D. stands for artificial insemination with the semen of a donor-i.e. a man other than the husband, and is sometimes described as "heterologous" insemination. It is normally carried out when the husband&apos;s semen is infertile. 2 The husband is usually capable of penetration and emission of semen, but since his semen is infertile conception does not, or is unlikely to occur. Infertility is not synonymous with impotence.

A.I.H.D. indicates artificial insemination with the combined semen of the husband and a donor. 3

REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON HUMAN ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION

To the Right Honourable R. A. Butler, C.H., M.P., Secretary of State for the Home Department, and the Right Honourable J. S. MACLAY, C.M.G., M.P., Secretary of State for Scotland.

INTRODUCTION

Appointment and Terms of Reference

1. We were appointed on 3rd September, 1958. Our terms of reference were:

"to enquire into the existing practice of human artificial insemination and its legal consequences and to consider whether, taking account of the interests of individuals involved and of society as a whole, any change in the law is necessary or desirable."

2. The occasion which gave rise to our appointment was an action in the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 10th January, 1958, for divorce on the ground of adultery. 1 In the course of the action the wife alleged that a child who appeared to have been born to her as a result of an adulterous union was conceived in consequence of artificial insemination by a donor. In this case Lord Wheatley decided that artificial insemination with the seed of a donor did not constitute adultery according to the law of Scotland. Subsequently, the Archbishop of Canterbury referred to the subject in an address to the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury. These two events set in train much public discussion. Estimates were made, most of which now appear to have been greatly exaggerated, of the number of children thought to have been conceived by A.I.D. There was considerable public anxiety. At the conclusion of a debate initiated by Lord Blackford in the House of Lords on 26th February, 1958, the Lord Chancellor announced that a committee would be appointed.

Membership

3. The death of Dr. D. T. McDonald on 14th June, 1959, deprived us of a member whose long experience of medical practice was of great value to us during the early stages of our enquiry. Most fortunately, Dr. S. R. Matthews was able, at very short notice, to accept the Home Secretary&apos;s invitation to serve in place of Dr. McDonald.

Meetings

4. We have had eighteen meetings, occupying thirty-seven days in all. Oral evidence was taken at ten meetings. Except for one two-day session in Edinburgh, we met always in London.

5. All our meetings were held in private, and we have published no report of our proceedings. We had a verbatim record made of our oral examination of witnesses, but this was purely for the convenience of

members of the committee.   We made it clear to those who gave evident ythat the record would never be published, and in this way we found tW &apos;our witnesses readily agreed to discuss with us fully and freely the intimatedetails of the practice into which we were enquiring.Evidence6. When we began our enquiry we found that the only authenticinformation about the practice of human artificial insemination in thiscountry was contained in a small number of articles in medical journalswritten by doctors engaged in the practice. We accordingly invited thesedoctors, and one or two others with whom we were put into touch, toprovide us with certain information relating to their work. Nearly everypractitioner of artificial insemination&apos; whom we approached willingly agreedto help us, and they went to considerable trouble to produce figures andother particulars drawn from their confidential records extending overmany years. The first chapter of our report is based almost entirely on information obtained in this way.7. Our terms of reference enjoined us to take account of the interestsof society as a whole. We therefore decided to seek the views of a wide range of bodies, including a large number of religious denominations,medical and legal bodies and others concerned in particular with marriage,family life and the welfare of children. We also sought information andopinions from individuals. The Press announcement of our appointmentinvited correspondence on the sulbject of our enquiry, and notices were subsequently inserted in various medical and legal publications, inviting the views of memibers of these professions.8. A list of those who gave evidence to us will be found in Appendix II.We are most grateful to all our witnesses for the help which they gave us.Many of them had devoted months of study to the subject before pre-senting us with their views. Other persons, not mentioned in the list, helpedus in various ways, for instance by suggesting sources of information andthe names of possible witnesses.Secretaries9. We wish to put on record our appreciation of the outstandingefficiency of our Secretary, Mr. R. F. D. Shuffrey (of the Home Office),whose incisive thought and administrative skill have proved to be aninvaluable contribution to the working of the committee. Mr. Shuffreyhas pursued exhaustive enquiries on our behalf and in addition his readyhelp has always been available and warmly welcomed by us. We arealso grateful for the help given to him and to us by our Assistant Secretary,Mr. J. J. Hunter, D.F.C. (of the Scottish Home Department), who hasrendered valuable assistance in every way and especially in those matters affecting Scotland.Information from Overseas10. While we were not required by our terms of reference to take intoaccount developments outside Great Britain, we considered that it mightbe an advantage to us to learn about the law and practice in certainforeign and Commonwealth countries. The Foreign Office and Common-wealth Relations Office accordingly instituted enquiries abroad on our
jphalf, and we are indebted to Her Majesty&apos;s representatives in many countries overseas for much interesting and useful information, whichwas of real assistance to us in considering what our own recommendations should be. We were also able to correspond direct with a number offoreign doctors concerned with artificial insemination. We were put into touch with many of them by Dr. A. M. C. M. Schellen of &quot;the Departmentof Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University Hospital, Groningen, theNetherlands. Dr. Schellen is the author of a full length treatise on thesubject,1 and he was good enough to come over to London and answeiquestions arising out of what he had written.Scope o  Report11. We decided that in setting out the result of our enquiry we should begin by describing what we had discovered about the existing practiceof human artificial insemination and what appeared to us to be itspresent legal consequences. These matters are accordingly comprised inPart I of our report. In Part II, after giving our views on A.I.H., we discuss A.I.D. and its consequences as they affect, in turn, the husband and wife, the child, the donor, the doctor and society as a whole, aadwe recommend a number of amendments of the law relating to nullity,divorce, separation and maintenance ; finally we consider whether thopractice of A.I.D. should be prohibited or regulated&quot; in any way.1 &quot; Artificial Insemination in the Human &quot; by A. M. C. M. Schellen, Elsevier PublisbCompany, 1957.
BARTr ONE:.:: THE: EXISTING PRACTICE AND&apos;/ ITScLEGAL. CONSEQUENCES;CHARTER IThe: Existing Practice of Human Artificial InseminationA. Origins of the Practice12. According to tradition certain Arab tribes practised artificial insemination of horses as early as the fourteenth century.- Pour hundred:years slater anTtalian, priest, and professor, Lazara SpaHanzani, performedsuccessful, experiments. with fish, reptiles, and, dogs. The. first recordedcase, of&quot; human, artificial insemination was,, about 1790, when a, Scottishdoctor, John Hunter, succeeded.in inseminating the wife.of a linen draper,in. London withthe seed, of her husband whawas suffering,from.a disabilitywhich made, normal intercourse: impossible. It. was. apparently accepted that the child subsequently born was the outcome.of the insemination..13,: . AtLH,-. is^reported to have; been; practised to a?certain, extent; duringthe: nineteenth;century in- France, the; United Stateso America,,Britainand Germany. The: first successful; insemination of;a;,woman?with dOnorfs jsemen is said to have been performed in Philadelphia in 1884 ; duringthe next forty years there was discussion of A.I.D. and one or two cases were reported in medical journals, chiefly in the U.S.A. but also inGermany. In France some interest was shown in the subject from 1930onwards. In Britain there have no doubt been sporadic cases of A.I.H.and A.I.D. ever since John Hunter&apos;s success with A.I.H. in 1790, but theevidence we have received suggests that human artificial inseminationwas not practised in this country to any extent until between twenty andtwenty-five years ago ; it was not until towards the end of the second world War that the practice came to the notice of the general public.B. Developments Overseas114. So far as we have been able to ascertain, human artificial insemina-tion has been practised in the United States on a considerable scale for over thirty years. It is not possible to give a reliable estimate either ofthe number of practitioners engaged or of the number of children who may have been conceived in this way. From the information we havereceived it appears that over 10,000 A.I.D. children may have been born in the U.S.A. since the practice began. But it can be said that the practice in the U.S.A. appears to be on a larger scale than elsewhere in the world,even taking into account the population figures. In most other countries the total number of A.I.D. births is estimated-if a figure is given at all-in hundreds rather than in thousands. Apart from the U.S.A., it may wellbe that in proportion to population Israel is the country where A.I.D. ispractised most, in spite of the opposition of the Orthodox Jewish religion.It is also practised, but usually on a very small scale, in many othercountries including Australia, South Africa, France, Germany, Scandinavia,Belgium and the-Netherlands.1 For more detailed information see Appendix I. ,&apos;; ;:&apos;; &quot;-r ,
^15. In no country in the world has legislation dealing with humanrtificial insemination yet been passed. The only official action which appears ever to have been taken to control the practice was the institutionin 1947 by the Department of Health of New York City of regulations governing the use of donors. Bills have been introduced in a number of american States, mainly for the purpose of regularising the status ofA.I.D. children, but no legislation has yet been passed. Governmentcommittees in Norway, Sweden and Denmark have recommended legisla-tion to control A.I.D., but no action has yet been taken to implement their recommendations. In the Federal Republic of Germany the GreatCommission on Penal Law has proposed that, except where A.I.H. iscarried out with the consent of husband and wife, artificial humaninsemination should be a criminal offence ; but it has yet to be seen whether this proposal will be accepted by the German Government. Theofficial attitude in France appears to be that A.I.D. is not &quot; recognised &quot;by the law and should be left to the consciences of the persons concerned.We have been told, however, that in Italy a Bill prohibiting humanartificial insemination is to be introduced into the Chamber of Deputies.Total prohibition of artificial insemination1 would accord with the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. Most other Christian denominations are,we understand, opposed to A.I.D. but not to A.I.H.C.  Artificial Insemination of Livestock16. In the meantime, artificial insemination of certain farm animals, inparticular of cattle, has been developed on a very large scale in the UnitedStates and in a number ol European countries. In England and Walesabout two million cattle are now being artificially inseminated annually,leading to the births of about three-fifths of the country&apos;s calves. Thepractice is controlled by statutory regulations.2 The main objects of this control are to ensure so far as possible that bulls of higher than averagebreeding potential are used and that effective veterinary supervision is exer-cised. There is no evidence that the technique of artificial inseminationhas led to any malformation or weakness in the stock.17. Artificial insemination of pigs may well become a commercial pro-position in this country in the future. At present some two or three thousandpigs are artificially inseminated each year. It is, however, more difficultto collect boars&apos; semen than that of bulls, and more difficult to inseminateat the right time. Bulls&apos; semen is also easier to preserve than that of otheranimals : it can be stored at low temperatures for a period of days Or at avery low temperature for several years. Some experimental work has beendone in this country with artificial insemination of sheep but so far thereis no indication that this is likely to be adopted for commercial sheep breed-ing here. Artificial insemination has been carried out successfully inI poultry and is now practised quite extensively in some turkey breedingI   -units. ,1^1,      v;.;!&apos;i/ WB ?,u      fejtlrnlto   5rris/%t6iornsriij 18. Having enquired into the procedure of artificial insemination of animals, we consider that it is relevant to the human practice only in sofar as research into the techniques of preservation of animal semen and into* But not necessarily of&apos; assisted &apos; insemination (see paragraph 102).&quot;The Artificial Insemination of Cattle (England and Wales) Regulations, 1957, made i     under Section 17 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1943.
its physiological properties may assist similar research in the field of huma?semen.   For the rest, the purpose of the artificial insemination of livestock,being largely to improve productivity by the maximum use of superior sires,is so different from that of human artificial insemination that no usefulcomparison can be made between the two.D.  A.I.D. in Great Britain19. Origins. The possibility of A.I.D. was discussed in this country inthe decade before the Second World War, as much from the point of viewof improving the race as of dealing with sterile marriages.1 There are saidto have been in the inter-war period several gynaecologists in London and elsewhere willing to undertake the practice,2 and we have heard evidence from one medical practitioner who carried out A.I.D. in cases of infertilitybetween 1934 and 1939, though without much success. Two. of the presentpractitioners of A.I.D&quot; began in 1940, and others in 1942, 1943 and subse-quently. Advances in medical science had made it more and more clearthat in a considerable proportion of childless marriages the husband wasthe cause of the infertility, rather than the wife as had hitherto been sup-posed. The extension of the study of male infertility and the developmentof a climate of opinion more favourable than hitherto to such experimentsencouraged certain doctors to begin using donors&apos; semen to effect preg-nancies. The doctors who began the practice twenty years ago and have since developed it have been for the most, part infertility specialists whoturned to A.I.D. because it appeared to be the only solution in a small number of cases where prolonged investigation had proved the wife fertileand the husband sterile. Often A.I.D. was tried after A.I.H. had provedunsuccessful.20. A.I.D. seems to have remained virtually unknown to the general public until towards the end of the Second World War. In a debate onartificial insemination in the House of Lords on 28th July, 1943, LordBrabazon drew attention to the dangers of A.I.D. by reference to develop-ments in the United States, and the practice was discussed to a certain extent in correspondence and articles in the medical journals during the next twoyears. The first comprehensive account of the technique and results achievedappears to have been an article in the British Medical Journal for January1945.3 Thereafter artificial insemination received a good deal of attention in Parliament and the Press, and at the end of that year the archbishop of Canterbury appointed a Commission to consider the matter. The Corn-mission^ report was published in 1948.4 On 16th March, 1949, there was afurther debate on the subject in the House of Lords, initiated by lord reading and Lord Brabazon.Present Extent of the Practice21. From a&apos;l the enquiries we have made, it is clear to us that so farA.I.D. has taken place on a very small scale in this country. In amemorandum5 submitted to &apos;us the British Medical Association estimatedthat &quot;the number of practitioners known to be regularly engaged in the1 Eugenics Review, July 1935, p. 121.2 Eugenics Review, January 1957, p. 210.3 British Medical Journal, 13th January, 1945, &quot; Artificial Insemination &quot; by Mary Barton,Kenneth Walker and B. P. Wiesner.4 &quot; Artificial Human Insemination &quot;.

practice of donor insemination is small certainly less than 20 &quot;. We thinkrihe figure of 20 may well be too high1. We have received written andoral evidence from twelve doctors who practised A.I.D. at one time or another. Five of those whom we interviewed no longer practise it. Anotherhas had less than a dozen cases in fifteen years. We have been informedthat other gynaecologists and family doctors have practised A.I.D. fromtime to time, but it seems likely that most of this casual practice ceasedfairly soon, in some cases because of the difficulty of obtaining donors andthe number of inseminations required. It has also been suggested to us that the sporadic practice of A.I.D. by family doctors and others haslargely died out since the names of the regular practitioners have become more widely known. We have received evidence that patients seeking a.I.D. come from a wide area in this country and from overseas, and wethink it can be inferred from this that the number of doctors regularlyengaged in the practice is very small. Even those who undertake artificial insemination regularly find that it comprises only a very small pant oftheir total infertility practice. All our witnesses confirm that A.I.D. is neverundertaken in hospitals.22. Not all the practitioners have kept complete records and it is not of course possible to say with certainty in which cases A.I.D. has been successful, but we have been informed altogether of between 1,100 and 1,150births during the past two decades which are considered to have been due to A.I.D. or A.I.H.D. Out of this total three practitioners betweenthem have been concerned with over 1,000 births, and the remainder havebeen responsible for little over 100. We do not suggest that these figuresrepresent the total number of A.I.D. children who have been born in thiscountry but, bearing in mind the apparently very small number of regularpractitioners, we think it unlikely that the actual total is greatly in excessof 1,150. Undoubtedly the practice now takes place on a larger scale than twenty years ago. From the information given to us we think it fair to estimate that somewhat more than 100 children have been conceived as aresult of A.I.D. during each of the last few years.23. The following figures of conceptions considered to be due to A.I.D.or A.I.H.D. administered by him during the ten years 1948 to 1957 were provided by one of the three practitioners referred to in the last paragraph.The figures give some indication of the rate of growth of A.I.D. duringthe ten years immediately preceding our appointment: 1948     ............        231949195019511952195319541955195619573130353942404543481948-1957...........       376** 336 women conceived once; 17 womei conceived twice; 2. women conceived three times.7
Medical Indications24. The primary reason for A.I.D. as practised at the present time kjthis country is sterility or gross infertility on the part of the husband. It 11very occasionally undertaken for other reasons, such as where it wouildbe inadvisable for a wife to have a child by her husband. It may be thatthe husband suffers from severe hereditary disease which is likely to be transmitted to his children. Examples that have been suggested to us areHuntington&apos;s choice, haemophilia, hereditary blindness and certain types of muscular dystrophy. These severe diseases are, however, extremelyrare, and we have no grounds for supposing that in this country A.I.D. isperformed merely for the purpose of eliminating minor hereditary defects.Another possible reason is rhesus antagonism. In these days total exchangeblood transfusion has made it possible to save all except the most severecases; in these few cases, which result in stillbirths, A.I.D. might beregarded as a solution. One practitioner who has dealt with several thousandcases of infertility in the past 20 years has encountered only three casesof rhesus antagonism. Another suggested reason is where a wife has had repeated abortions which may have been due to abnormalities in her husband&apos;s semen. But we understand that very little is at present known about the relationship between abortion and abnormal semen.25. In the great majority of cases, however, A.I.D. has been undertakenbecause the husband&apos;s semen has not been able to fertilise his wife. Semenis composed of two elements: the seeds or spermatozoa and the seminalfluid or plasma, the liquid medium in which the spermatozoa are contained.A man&apos;s infertility may be due to the fact that very few spermatozoa areejaculated: this is described as &quot; oligospermia&quot;; or there may be nospermatozoa, or none that are alive: both these conditions are commonlydescribed as &quot;azoospermia &quot; i1 or the spermatozoa may be lacking in mobilityor contain a high proportion of abnormal forms. Any of these factorsmay mean that a husband is unable to fertilise his wife.26. When human semen is analysed a count is made of the numberof spermatozoa per cubic centimetre of semen. In a normal man theremay be a hundred million or more. Sixty million may be regarded as below normal, but not low enough for A.I.D. to be considered. The practitionersfrom whom we have received evidence have, as a rule, not been preparedto undertake A.I.D. unless there were fewer than ten million sperm present.Many have insisted oh an even lower figure, and some require a completeabsence of living sperm. It is not possible to say that a man with lessthan a certain number of sperm is completely sterile, in the sense that hecan be guaranteed incapable of begetting a child. We have been informed of cases where men with less than a million sperm have fathered children in the normal way.2 The number of sperm per cubic centimetre is by no means constant-we have heard of a rise of from three million to sixtymillion in a year-and a significant change can occur from one week toanother. For this reason the husband&apos;s semen is usually examined on several occasions before a decision is made to undertake A.I.D. In thisway it is hoped to avoid the undesirable situation where a donor child isfollowed by a child or children of whom the husband is the father.i Strictly speaking a complete absence of sperm ought to be described as &apos; aspermia&apos;,and &apos; azoospermia&apos; should be used only to denote an absence of living sperm.2 See British Medical Journal, 1952, Vol. II, pages 409 and following; in particular,Tables IV and V, according to which conception occurred in 19 out of 57 cases where therewas a sperm count of less than ten million, including 4 out of 16 cases where the count wasunder a million.
-Wmj&apos; 27? If the tester are absent;a man can.undoubtedly be pronounced sterile.But we understand: that; even in-these circumstances it would be possiblei for a new- testis to be engrafted after being transplanted from another; man,and-that this operation is reported to have been performed, although not for the purpose of overcomiirg infertility. We have been: told, however,that if such an operation were performed it is unlikely that the productionof spermatozoa would continue for long. In so far as spermatozoa were produced they would be those of the donor of the testis, so that if it became possible as a result of this operation for av husband; to inseminatehis. Wife he would merely be. acting as a vehicle for the injection of theseed-of another man; that is to say the consequences so; far as hereditywas concerned would be the same as with A.I.D. But the whole procedure,is. scarcely., within. our terms of reference and it seems most unlikely that many men could be found who would be prepared to donate a testis.28. A.very small number.of men are both grossly infertile and impotent(i.e/ incapable of penetration). We understand that A.I.D. has. been employedArofawrsiuchr&apos; easess irr: the past.1 On&apos;the whole, however, the practitionerswho gave evidence to us were inclined. to regard impotence as a conltrarindication for A-JL-D.- in the first place, impotence is often susceptible totreatment particularly psydhiatric treatment. Secondly^ in so far as thecause ofnthe. impotence was psychological rather than physical it might wellindicate: an: unsatisfactory relationship between: husband and wife, whichwould! not augur; well for the future of the. child: The practitioners ofA;I.*D/, are therefore reluctant to proceed if the husband is incapable ofsexual intercourse r with his wife.A.I.H.D.29. Since, except in the circumstances referred to in. paragraph:, 27-.above, it is impossible to ibe certain that a man is sterile, some practitionershave adopted a procedure whereby the husband&apos;s semen is injected, aithe same time as that of the donor. We refer to this as A.I.H.D. It hasbeen put to us Iby one practitioner who&apos; now invariably uses A.I-H.D.rather than A:LD.; and! inserts the husiband&apos;s semen before that of the donor,that in almost every case - there is a chance, although&apos; usually a remotechance, that the husband: may be able to father a child. If conceptiontakes&quot; place, the- fact that the husband&apos;s. semen was introduced as well as-the - donor&apos;s means that; the couple need never assume that someone otherthan: the husbaiid3wasj the-father cfthe Child; and this, we-are informed;1 canbe of great psychological help to them during the child&apos;s upbringing.30. Other practitioners made it clear that they called, in--a: donor, only,when in their own opinion there was virtually no possibility of the husbandbegetting a-- child&apos; They took the- view that there was in any case nopointj in AvIvHfD. if,&apos; as was desirable, the woman inseminated5 was having&apos;normal maritai relations with-her husband: It was put to us-that in thesecircumstances - theuprocess of -injecting the husband^semen artificially-couldbe irto&apos;imore-efficacious than; normal intercourse-,..and&apos; that the consolationthat; the child&apos;might, after all, be the husband&apos;s came just as- easily inthese circumstances-. We have therefore made careful enquiries to try toestablish what, if-any, teehnicar advantages AI.IH.D. might. have, over1 See paragraph 71.
A.I.D. combined with normal intercourse.   In some cases it may well that the techniques used in artificial insemination succeed in selecting1 themore fertile semen from the husband and depositing it further than it isable to reach in normal intercourse. Apart from this, we have also beeninformed that there may now be grounds for holding that the seminalplasma of a donor can assist a husiband&apos;s spermatozoa to penetrate theovum.2Technique of Insemination31. The technique of artificial insemination is comparatively simple.Within three or four hours of collection a small quantity of semen is placedin or near the cervix, usually by means of a syringe. This takes only afew minutes. Afterwards the patient may toe asked to rest for a short time.Insemination is carried out at the point in the menstrual cycle whenovulation is believed to take place. The most difficult part of the techniqueis to determine precisely the time of ovulation. One or at the mosttwo inseminations are carried out each month until conception occurs or until it is decided to cease treatment. From figures supplied to us by six practitioners of A.I.D. the number of patients accepted for treatmentwho appear to have conceived as a result of A.I.D. is between 60 per cent,and 70 per cent.; the remaining 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, discontinuedthe treatment, usually because it was unsuccessful. The numtoer who havegiven birth to live children is between 50 per cent, and 60 per cent, (thedifference being accounted for by miscarriages and stillbirths). The averagetime taken to achieve conception was between four and six months. Somewomen conceived within the first month and some took as long as two and a half years. One practitioner, however, made a point of never con-tinuing treatment beyond a year.32. So far as we are able to ascertain, the fee charged for a courseof inseminations, including preliminary examination and investigation offertility, has varied from fifteen guineas, or less, to as much as a hundredand twenty-five guineas. The amount partly depends on the time takento achieve conception. An average fee charged in London appears to beabout fifty-guineas for six months&apos; treatment. One practitioner has told us that he is prepared to reduce or waive the fee for persons of limitedmeans.Donation of Semen33. Donors are chosen for the purpose by practitioners of A.I.D., virtually all of whom have told us that it is extremely difficult to find suitablemen. Usually, young married men are selected, preferably with children oftheir own. Many of them are husbands of patients or of former patientsof the practitioner. The patient may have been cured of her infertility bythe practitioner, and out of gratitude towards him the.husband is preparedto act as a donor.  Some donors are personal friends of the practitioner,* See parajgraph 67.2 See paragraph 70.Fees
J&amp;Sj are known to him through friends or acquaintances, and this group has^BEeluded members of the medical profession who sympathise with A.I.D.and take a scientific interest in it. Almost invariably it is the practitionerwho approaches the potential donor and not vice-versa. Strangers whooffer themselves as donors are not accepted, and we have heard of only two instances of a practitioner obtaining semen from a colleague&apos;s practice.34. Apart from a semen analysis, donors have to have a thorough medical examination, and in particular it is necessary to ensure that they are free from any transmissible hereditary disease or disability. They have to beready to produce semen by masturbation not more than three or four hoursbefore the time of insemination and to deliver it at the doctor&apos;s rooms.Some doctors make a small payment to the donor very rarely amountingto more than two or three guineas to cover his expenses, such as travelling and medical examination ; others make no payment at all. It was suggestedby one of our witnesses that if donors were paid a fee the transaction mightbe placed on a more objective basis, which would to a certain extentrelieve the practitioner of having to rely on his personal friends and thosewho felt themselves under an obligation to him. But the fact that in thiscountry1 donors have not been paid for their services has, we understand,had the effect of excluding from the field undesirable persons.35. The practitioners of A.I.D. generally try so far as possible on each occasion to use a donor who resembles both physically and mentally the husband of the woman who is to be inseminated. They make certain thathe is of the same race and colour as the couple, and some try to ensurethat he is also of the same religion. We have heard of a Moslem donorbeing provided for a Moslem couple, and of Jewish couples asking for and receiving donated semen from Jewish donors. An attempt is made to match such features as colour of hair, eyes and general build, or at least to ensure that the donor has no prominent physical characteristics whichwould be likely to result in the child looking markedly unlike his supposedfather. Most donors are of above average intelligence, and some at least of the practitioners go to considerable trouble to find persons who are similarto the couple in intellectual background and general outlook. Somepractitioners try always to use the same donor for the same woman ; othersvary the donor from month to month. If a woman asks for a second orthird child by A.I.D. it is sometimes possible to use the same donor again,but this is often difficult to arrange since few donors are prepared to help for more than a limited period.36. We understand that when AID; was first beginning in this countrypersons such as the hu&apos;sfoand&apos;s brother or best, friend were occasionallyused as donors, but that it soon became apparent that there would bedanger to the marriage unless the donor was anonymous. Since then theprinciple that the donor must not know the couple and they must not knowhim has, so far as we are aware, been rigidly maintained. The donorknows no more than that he has contributed semen for the purpose of A.I.D.1 See Appendix I, paragraph 45.
37; Some practitioners have thought it best to obtain the written eqnse^Y )jiof-the donor to the use of his semen for AID.   The following form has- been recommended for this purpose by the Medical Defence Union:Document for Completion by DonorI, ofhereby consent to supply semen to Dr. for thepurpose of, artificially inseminating a woman whose name has. not been disclosed to, me. It. has been explained to me that the.-use, of semensupplied,by me for this purpose might be held to be adultery, and-1 have;accordingly only consented to supply semen on condition that (a) my name,be.-not disclosed and (b) the written consent of the woman.and the husband1to. the procedure be obtained.Dated; this day-of 19Witness -38. Nearly all practitioners ask donors to ensure that their wivesapprove of their acting as donors, and it has been found that many wivesobject. In at least one practice both the donor and his wife are requiredto consent in writing his semen being used.39. It has been supposed that one of the greatest dangers of A.I.D. isthat children sired by the same donor may afterwards meet and marry.It is now clear to us, however, that this danger is at present minimal.We have been informed2 that if 2,000 live children per year were to beborn in Great Britain as a result of the successful use of A.I.D. and ifeach donor were responsible for 5 children, an unwitting incestuousmarriage is unlikely to occur more than once in about fifty to a hundred years. Thus even if there were a twenty-fold increase in the.use of .AXD.,as compared with our estimate of its present incidence, the possibility that two children having the. same father would-marry would be. remote,although, if. a much wider: use. were.made, of each donor.and if-practitionersdrew their patients from small areas, the possibility would be; increased.But careful selection of. donors. could reduce the possibility below what might otherwise-occur. It should at the same time be noted that thenumber of. incestuous marriages occurring as a result of A.I.D. would bemuch smaller than,that resulting from fornication and adultery.40. We understand that while one donor has in fact-been responsibleforras many as seventeen live births most: practitioners limit each-donorto tenn conceptions;-or lass and few have i reached even that. figure.. Sincefew men are prepared to remain donors for:long::and-;severaliinseminaitioHS:are usually required before pregnancy is achieved, it is in the nature ofthings^ unlikely that any oner donor would r exceed this limit. One prac-titionerwho attributes 82 births to A.LD. or A.I.H.D. from theend of r 1940to the end ofi 1958 has had about thirty regular donors^ and anothertwenty who have: been used less regularly. Two other practitioners-have provided figures for the number of, inseminations forr which each-donorhas-been used, and. the number of pregnancies or live births forr which each has been: responsible.   These are set out in. the following: tablesv1 See paragraph 49.2 By Professor D. V. Glass, Professor of Sociology in the University of,London; see twopapers in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, I960; Part II:- &quot;HumanInfertility and Artificial Insemination: the Demographic Background &quot; by D.

Occasionally one donor V specimen is used for theinsemination of more than one woman, but, since human semen cannot: at present be preserved for more than a few hours without losing itsfertilising capacity, this is only possible where more than one woman isj due for insemination on the same day.41. If it became possible to preserve human semen for a longer period,1: the task of obtaining donated semen would be very much easier.  Donorswould then be able to produce semen at any time rather than within aI few hours of the time fixed for insemination.   Furthermore, if humanitarian semen could be preserved the practitioner could be relieved of theI embarrassing and time-consuming task of finding donors. An organisationj described as a &quot; semen bank &quot; could be set up, which would be responsibleI for obtaining human semen, clasifying it according to the donor&apos;scharacteristics and making it available to practitioners.   None of our witnesses was, however, particularly attracted towards this system, evenI if it became practicable.   It would mean that the practitioner was noI longer personally responsible for ensuring that the donor was suited toI the couple.  He would not be acquainted with the donor, and the &quot; bank &quot;; would not be acquainted with the couple.I Applicants ;42. When. A.LD. first began in this country very few people knewi that it;was being practised or who practised it.   Occasionally patientsI found out and came of their own accord to the practitioner.  More often,1 AID. would be suggested to the patient by the practitioner, as the only  solution where investigation had proved the wife fertile and the husbandI sterile. . But&quot;, as the practice grew, and in particular after the publicationI of the article in the British Medical Journal for January, 1945,1 patientsI began to be sent by general practitioners, gynaecologists and others toI the few specialists known to be engaged in A.I.D.   Increased publicityI led to an increased demand.   At the present time probably the great1 majority of patients are referred by family doctors or consultants; butI many, both of those who are referred and of those who approach the1 See paragraph 68. 2 See paragraph 20.
practitioner direct, come not specifically for A.I.D., but for infertile ^treatment, which may or may not lead on to A.I.D.   A few have-rek habout A.I.D. in a newspaper or magazine which has provided them ;withthe practitioners name.   However, most of those who enquire throughnewspapers or other non-medical sources are referred back to their family doctor.43. We found that some gynaecologists and others who were themselvesopposed to A.I.D. were nevertheless prepared to refer patients to prac-practitioners known to be engaged in this work. Some would do so only after pointing out all the difficulties and doing their best to dissuadethe couple from pursuing the matter further. Other doctors would have nothing to do with A.I.D. on any account and gave no assistance topatients who suggested it, as they did not consider that it could ever bein the patienfs best interests. It was clear to us that in this way several years could often elapse before a patient got into touch with a doctorpractising A.I.D. Instances were quoted to us of couples who had waitedeight years, and in one case as long as ten years.44. Even when the couple have found a practitioner, the procedure isby no means short and simple, and a large number are turned down asunsuitable. Often it is found that the wife&apos;s fertility is not satisfactory:one practitioner told us that in as many as 75 per cent, of the wivesinvestigation revealed factors rendering conception unlikely, inadvisableor impossible. The husband&apos;s semen will of course have to be analysedon several occasions, at suitable intervals, if this has not been donealready. The general health of husband and wife will have to be carefullychecked. In all, a series of consultations is necessary before a decision can be taken to employ A.I.D.45. Apart from the physical factors, many applicants are rejectedbecause they are found to be unsuitable in other respects. Some prac-practitioners told us that they refused as many as half of those who applied for A.I.D., some by correspondence without interview and some after theyhad been seen. Quite often the couple themselves abandon the idea onlearning how long it is likely to take and realising that a child cannot be guaranteed. A surprising number apply under the impression that a singleinsemination will invariably produce a pregnancy. Some are turned awaybecause it appears that one spouse has persuaded the other against hisor her better judgment. Others have given long and anxious considerationto the matter and are both prepared to go through with it; the wife is anxious to bear her own child and the husband is equally anxious to havea child which is at least the wife&apos;s. Not infrequently it is the husbandwho has made the first move; he may feel himself responsible fordepriving his wife of maternity and want to do everything in his powerto make amends. But even though the couple are apparently reconciledto A.I.D. and all that it entails, they may yet be considered unsuited torear an A.I.D. child. The practitioner tries to establish not only that the child is likely to have a secure material background, but also that the marriage is likely to remain stable and harmonious ; that husband and wife are entirely suited, in personality and temperament, to have a donorchild, and aware of the responsibilities they are undertaking.46. The facilities which the practitioner has for assessing the suitability of applicants for A.I.D. consist of a report from the family doctor, if the
couple have been referred by him, and such information as the practitionerk, himself able to obtain in a series of interviews in his consulting roomsith hnshnnrl  and  wifp.   hnth  scnaratfilv anrl  tr\opthpr 1    wp hnpc  tint iricitfcPPith husband and wife, both separately and together.1 He does not visittheir home. He may refer the couple to another specialist for advice, forinstance to a psychiatrist. Some practitioners would, however, regard thefact that it was necessary to seek a psychiatric opinion as in itself a reasonfor not undertaking A.I.D. Likewise, some are not prepared to acceptfor A.I.D. persons who are recommended on psychiatric grounds. It wasmade clear to us by many witnesses that A.I.D. was not regarded as away of preventing a marriage from &quot; going on the rocks &quot;.47. We found that the great majority of those who received A.I.D.were members of the middle classes, many of them well-educated persons whose husbands held responsible positions. One London practitioner gave us the husband&apos;s occupation in all his cases. These included doctors,dentists, chartered accountants, university teachers, scientists, companydirectors, members of the Foreign Service, civil servants, engineers, elec-tricians, a stockbroker, a hotel manager, a taxi cab owner and a windowcleaner. A list provided by a provincial practitioner included, in additionto some of the above, clergymen, surveyors, farmers, policemen, carpenters,grocers, butchers, transport workers and miners. We think that these twolists together are probably typical of the cases dealt with by all the presentpractitioners.48. Our witnesses made it clear to us that in this country A.I.D. was never undertaken unless both husband and wife were in agreement withthis course. We understood that occasionally practitioners received enquiriesfrom single women but did not proceed with them.49. Most practitioners, when they have decided to undertake A.I.D.,require the husband to give his consent in writing. Some ask both the husband and wife to make a joint written request for A.I.D., which maybe on the basis of the following form, recommended for use by the MedicalDefence Union.Document for Completion by the Husband and WifeTo Dr. of1) Full name    We (x) and (2)of husband    0f (3)being lawfully married(2)of wifeamC   and desirous of having a child and having been advised thatthis is impossible to achieve by normal sexual intercourse(3)Full between us hereby request and authorise you to inseminateaddress      artificially (2)by means of semen supplied by a donor selected by you.We hereby assure you that the birth of such a child will notdefeat the claims of any person to any titles, estates, interests or funds.Dated this day of 19   .Witness to the Signature of Mr. &amp; Mrs.Signature of Witnesses:Address:Occupation:1 We heard of only one practitioner who had, in some cases, under taken A.I.D. withoutseeing the husband, but the husband&apos;s consent was always obtained in writing, and he hadbeen interviewed by the family doctor who had discussed the position with the couplebefore referring the case for A.I.D.
50. The consent forms are retained by the practitioners, one of wh/ vinformed us that he had deposited them at his bank, with instructions tiOthey were to be destroyed in the event of his death. Nearly all practitionershave maintained confidential records of their A.I.D. cases. Some of the records show which donor was responsible for each conception, while othersdo not. Some are in code, and none is accessible to anyone other thanthe doctor and his secretary or nurse.51. Most practitioners find it necessary to give guidance to the husband and wife on the legal implications of A.I.D. The couple are advised tobring the child up as if the husband were the father. It is pointed out tothem that they will have to ask for the husband&apos;s name to be entered as thefather in the Register of Births, unless they are prepared to leave the spaceblank and thus bastardize the child.1 We understood that in some cases,particularly where A.I.H.D. had been applied, the couple never entirely gaveup hope that the husband might not after all be the father. The MedicalDefence Union&apos;s form refers to titles and estates. The attitude of most prac-practitioners was that they would not undertake A.I.D. if they knew that titlesor estates were involved, but that this was mainly a matter for the couplethemselves to decide. One practitioner told us that it was rarely necessaryto give any advice on the legal implications since the couple had nearlyalways thought the matter out very carefully before they came to him.Follow-up52. We have found that very little is known of what happens, after a.I.D. has been successful, to the husband, wife and child. The doctors who at present practice A.I.D. do not follow up their cases systematically.Some consider that this would be ah unjustifiable infringement of thepatienfs privacy and an unnecessary reminder of the child&apos;s origin ; they feel that significance might be attached to factors which had nothing to do with A.I.D., and that the care with which they select couples should ensure, so far as it is possible to do so, that the marriage remains a happyone. Wives and, to a lesser extent, husbands keep in touch with the doctorfor the first few years, by means of letters, Christmas cards and an occasionalvisit, and a considerable number ask for a second child by A.I.D.- Theinformation received by this means has hitherto been almost entirely favour-able, but it normally covers only the first few years of the chikFs life.Thereafter the doctor loses sight of the family. As a rule he advises thecouple not to tell the child that he is believed to have.been born as aresult of A.I.D. ; but none of the doctors whom we saw was able to say whether any of the children had been told.53. One practitioner has, however, made, it a rule ,to send an annualletter to all mothers of A.I.D. children, asking how the child is developingat school and whether the couple have had any regrets. No regrets havebeen expressed. By this means and by personal interviews-some 50 percent, of the wives have returned to see the practitioner since the birthof the child-it has, we understand, been possible in this practice to keepin touch with all the families except two. The children have developedwell, in contrast to some adopted children of whom the practitioner has also had experience. The oldest child was seventeen and a half at the time this evidence was submitted to us.i See. paragraphs 89-90. . &quot;
54. We heard of a few cases where either a woman who had received A.I.D., or her husband or child, subsequently showed signs of unhappiness or instability. In some of these cases there was no means of knowing whether, in so far as the wife or husband was concerned, the condition was due to A.I.D. or would have arisen in any event. The particulars which follow relate to four cases brought to our notice where unfortunate results were attributed by our witnesses to A.I.D. Some of the cases may be said to illustrate the dangerous consequences of undertaking A.I.D. where the couple are not entirely stable, and we therefore wish to make it clear that, so far as we are aware, none of these cases concerns the doctors who at present practise A.I.D.

55. In the first case the husband suffered from a congenital defect which made normal intercourse impossible, and the wife from cerebral dysrythmia. They were refused adoption on account of the wife&apos;s condition, and after A.I.D. had been tried several times without success the husband had a nervous breakdown. In the second case, the wife attempted to treat the doctor as the father. In another an A.I.D. child was followed by two children of the husband and tension developed in the family because the husband viewed the A.I.D. child differently from the other two. In the fourth case, the wife of an infertile husband became so desperate that she attempted to commit suicide; A.I.D. was performed and resulted in pregnancy; but six months later the wife again attempted suicide; one year later the husband was himself a patient in a mental home.

Possible Future Scope of A.I.D.

56. So far as can be said on present evidence the question whether the incidence of A.I.D. will continue to increase and, if so, at what rate, depends on a number of factors, which may be summarised as follows:

(a) The number of suitable couples.

(b) The availability of donated semen.

(c) The extent to which the practice is (i) publicised and (ii) officially recognised.

(a) The number of suitable couples.

57. Since the primary reason for A.I.D. is that the husband is infertile, the number of cases where A.I.D is undertaken depends to a certain extent on the number of marriages where the husband is infertile. In Great Britain there have been on an average, during the last five years, 390,000 marriages a year. It has been estimated that between 7 per cent. and 9 per cent. 1 of all marriages in this country (i.e. between 27,000 and 35,000 a year) are childless because either husband or wife or both are infertile. A.I.D. could of course only be considered in those cases where the infertility was due entirely to the husband. The number of such cases is very difficult to determine mainly because in a large proportion the precise cause of the infertility has never been established. But it appears to be accepted in medical circles that the husband may be solely responsible in about 30 per cent. of infertile marriages, i.e. some 9,000 to 10,000 a year. It seems also to be accepted that only in a very small proportion of cases is

1 This figure was accepted by most of our medical witnesses. It will be seen that Professor Glass, in the article referred to in the footnote on page 17, prefers a figure 6 or 7%.
the husband &quot; azoospermic &quot;x perhaps in as few as 10 per cent, of t^ vcases where he is responsible for the infertility, i.e. 1,000 each year.358. It would, however, be misleading to suggest that 1,000 cases a yearrepresents the possible scope for AjLD., for two reasons : first, A.I.D.may be undertaken where the husband is only slightly subfertile. We haveno evidence to suggest that this is at present the case, but whether the husband&apos;s infertility is considered so severe as to justify A.I.D. dependsmainly on the standard of infertility set toy the practitioner, and this will vary from one practice to another. There is no agreed standard of malesterility. Secondly, in many cases hitherto where A.I.D. has been medicallyindicated a couple have not been considered suitable for it on psychologicalor other grounds ; for example, because the marriage is unlikely to remainstable. The number of persons rejected on these grounds also depends onthe standards adhered to toy practitioners and the care they use in selectingapplicants.59. In considering whether the actual number of cases of A.I.D. islikely to approach an estimated total number of possible cases, it is necessaryto bear in mind (i) the number of people who are involuntarily infertileand do nothing about it; (ii) the many who object on principle to A.I.D. ;and (iii) those who might accept A.I.D. but do not know how to obtainit. We understand that at the beginning of the present century many people tended to accept infertility as a God-given affliction, about whichnothing should be done, but to which attention should not, if possible, bedrawn since it was regarded as a stigma or, by some, as a kind of punish-ment. This attitude is now changing, with the result that the number of people who seek treatment for infertility has increased and will probablycontinue to increase. Whether there will be a decrease in the number ofobjectors to A.I.D. and of those who do not object tout are unable to obtainit depends, we think, to a large extent on the degree &apos;0f recognition given tothe practice during the next few years (see (c) below).(b) The availability of donated semen60. Undoubtedly, A.I.D. would be easier if more men were prepared tobecome donors or if it became possible to preserve human semen for morethan a few hours. The availability of donors depends, as does the numberof couples considered suitable for AID., to a large extent on the standardsadopted by practitioners. If standards were lowered, more donors couldbe found. So far, no satisfactory means have been established of preservinghuman semen for a longer period.3(c) The extent to which the practice is (i) publicised and (ii) officiallyrecognised61. Several practitioners informed us that the number of requests forA.I.D. increased considerably in the early months of 1958, as a direct resultof the great publicity which the practice received at that time, and wehave already seen4 that an article in the British Medical Journal in 1945encouraged the medical profession to consider AJ.D. as a possible solution.1 See paragraph 25.2 We tried to establish whether the male infertility was at present increasing or decreasing,but found that there was not sufficient evidence either way.3 See paragraph 68.4 Paragraph 42.
&apos;;;.ich time A.I.D. is widely publicised, the field of possible applicants isImlarged. But one of the main reasons why the extent of A.I.D. in thiscountry is at present very limited is that it is disapproved of by a largesection of the medical profession and of the public. Much of this antipathyto it is based on religious and ethical convictions in no way dependenton the legal position or the attitude of the Government. But we believenevertheless that any amendment of the law that might be construed as implying official recognition or approval of A.I.D. would lead to an increasein the practice. Some of the doctors who at present refrain from practisingwould take up the practice. Couples who now hesitate to consider A.I.D.would be encouraged to pursue the idea and would find A.I.D. easier toobtain than hitherto.  More donors would be forthcoming.E.  A.I.H. in Great BritainPresent Extent of the Practice62. As we have seen, A.I.H. is reputed to have been practised inLondon as early as 1790. We have been informed that in recent years it hasbeen carried out occasionally in at least 40 hospitals in Great Britain.Specialists have reported to us some three or four hundred births considered to be due to A.I.H. during the past twenty-five years. It has also beenpractised by family doctors. Out of 318 members of the Research register of the College of General Practitioners who replied to a questionnairelast year, 1,2 had practised A.I.H. (in 21 cases in all). We understandthat some patients carry out A.I.H. at home, using a syringe devised bythe late Dr. Joan Mailleson, whereby the wife can inseminate herself with her busband&apos;s semen. The technique of insemination is, generally speaking,the same as for A.I.D. ;l there can be certain technical differences, butwe did not consider these relevant to the purpose of our enquiry.263. AH our witnesses have emphasised that A.I.H. is only rarelyindicated as a suitable treatment. The information we received from hospitalsshowed that most of them regarded it as of very limited value and hadnot used it in more than a handful of cases over the past ten years. Thepractitioners of artificial insemination who undertake both A.I.H. andA.I.D. use the former less frequently than the latter. Furthermore, A.I.H.is not a very successful form of treatment. The practitioner who bad thelargest number of cases reported only 170 pregnancies out of 468 caseswhere A.I.H. had been applied; another reported 21 out of 113; another11 out of 59.Medical Indications64. A.I.H. may be carried out when there are factors present in eitherpartner preventing the achievement of intercourse, but when the fertilityof both is otherwise adequate. It is generally accepted that the treatment is justified where spermatozoa cannot enter the vagina or uterus because ofdeformity of the male or female organs, or, in a few rare oases, becauseof erratic ejaculation on the part of the husband.1 See paragraph 31.2 The technique of what is sometimes called &apos; assisted insemination &apos; (see paragraph 102)is different, since the semen is obtained not by masturbation but from the vaginal pool afterintercourse.
65. More commonly, A.I.H. is used where the husband is impotefPprovided he is :able to produce semen by masturbation, and we understandthat most of . the births regarded as due to A.I.H. haveebeen aohievediincases M impotence. Some practitioners, however, hesitate to accept 3 thesecases for A:TH., since if the impotence is due to psychological causes the relationship between ^husbarid and wife may not be satisfactory, and this may affect the security of the child. We were informed of two cases wherechildren conceived by A.I.H. were emotionally disturbed and requiredpsychiatric treatment, and of another case where a couple who were notwell adjusted^ resorted to A.LH. and thereby failed to deal with their; basicproblem of marital maladjustment. On the other hand, the birth of a child by A.I.H. has been known to cure impotence : in these cases the tension is relieved and normal intercourse is possible thereafter.66. The condition known as vaginismus (a painful spasm of the vaginaassociated with aversion from intercourse) is considered by some, practitionersto be a justification for A.I.H. But we have been informed that manygynaecologists would hesitate to use A.I.H. in these circumstances. Vaginismusin a woman may produce the same sort of psychological difficulties asimpotence in a man, but the birth of a child is not as likely to;put. an end to the woman&apos;s aversion from intercourse.67.:.Some success is said,to have been achieved with the use of A.I.H.where the husband is suhfertile because of defective spermatozoa. It may befound that part of the husband&apos;s semen is more fertile than. the rest, andit is said that if this part can be separated from the rest and&apos; inseminatedartificially the chances of conception are improved. Other witnesses * havetaken the view that A.I.H. offers as yet no more hope of pregnancy thandoes normal, coitus in cases where the spermatozoa are defective in number or quality. If, however, it became possible to preserve human semen for any length of time several specimens of the husband&apos;s semen could be collected,&quot;pooled&quot; together and used for a single insemination, which might wellbe more effective than natural intercourse where the husband was subfertile.Preservation of Semen68., At y present human semen cannot be stored at room temperature If ormore than a few hours. There have been reports that children have beenborn in the United States as a result of artificial insemination withhusband&apos;s semen which had been frozen for several weeks, butt we understandthat no method has so far been found of preserving human semen even at low temperatures without impairing its fertilizing power. We were,however, informed by expert witnesses that there was no fundamental reason why a satisfactory method of preservation should not in time be found,if further research were carried out. If this should become practicable, itwould be possible for A.I.H. to be carried out when a wife and husbandwere living apart, or even after the husband&apos;s death.&apos;)Sex determination69. We understand that methods are being sought whereby spermatozoacan be separated into those carrying male and those carrying female genes.If these methods are found to be successful it seems likely that A.I.H.may be requested to an increasing extent by couples who have no difficultyin achieving pregnancy by normal intercourse, but who wish to have a boyrather than a girl or vice-versa.
mfe of Donor&apos;s Seminal Plasma70. At a late stage in our enquiry it was brought to our notice that recent experiments suggested that A.I.H. might in some cases be more effective if the husband&apos;s spermatozoa could be detached from their ownseminal plasma and combined with that of a donor, since in this way themotility of the husband&apos;s spermatozoa might be increased. We understoodthat it was considered passible to separate the donor&apos;s seminal plasmaentirely from the donor&apos;s spermatozoa, so that there could be no questionof the donor&apos;s spermatozoa being responsible for conception. We have notheard that this process has yet been used in Great Britain, but Dr. SamuelRozin of Jerusalem has reported1 that it has been successful in producingpregnancy in two out of five cases of infertility of long duration, in oneof which A.I.H. had previously been attempted without success. It is too early to say how this matter will develop, but if it means that greater usecan be made of A.I.H. in cases of &quot; oligospermia&quot; it may be that thedemand for A.I.D. can be correspondingly reduced.CHAPTER IIThe Existing Legal ConsequencesA.  Nullity oi Marriage71. In English law, one of the grounds on which a marriage may beannulled by the Divorce Court is that the marriage has not been con-summated owing to the wilful refusal or incapacity of the husband or wifeto consummate the marriage. It is clear that for this purpose the artificial insemination of the wife, with the seed of her husband or of a donor,would not constitute consummation of the marriage, even if it had resultedin the birth of a child. Thus in R.E.L. (otherwise R.) v. E.L. [1949] P.211,a wife whose husband had been unable for psychological reasons to haveintercourse with her but who had been successfully artificially, inseminatedwith his seed was granted a decree of nullity on the ground of the !hus!band&apos;sincapacity. In this case the main question was not whether the marriagehad been consummated but whether the wife&apos;s conduct in submitting toartificial insemination disentitled her to relief ; for in English law a decreeof nullity may be refused where the petitioner with knowledge of herrights has by her conduct approbated the marriage. On the facts of thecase, Mr. Justice Pearce (as he then was) held that there was no intentionon the part off the wife to acquiesce in the marriage if her husband remainedimpotent after the birth of the child and accordingly she was not debarred from relief. In W v. W f.1952] P.211 it was held that the adoption of a child by both spouses debarred either of them from obtaining a decree ofnullity. However, in Slater v. Slater [1953] P.252 the wife was granted adecree off nullity although she had received A.I.D. with tlhe consent of her husband and she and he had adopted a child, since the view was taken that she had not at the time been aware of her legal remedy. Similarlyin Q v. Q (reported in &quot; The Times &quot;, 12th May, 1960) it was held that thefact that the wife had given birth to a child as the result of A.I.D. did not1 Acta Med. Orient (1958) Vol. XVII, No. 1-2.
amount to approbation of the marriage by her, since at the time of receivh? IA.I.D. sihe had no knowledge of the legal remedy open to her in view csrthe husband&apos;s incapacity ; a decree of nullity was therefore granted.72. In Scotland, wilful refusal to consummate the marriage is not of itself a ground for nullity, although the court may infer impotence fromcontinuous refusal. As in England an action for nullity on the ground of impotency may be barred if it is shown that the pursuer has, with full knowledge of the facts and the law, approbated the contract he or she isseeking to get rid of, or has taken advantages and derived benefits fromthe matrimonial relation which it would be inequitable to permit him or her to treat as if the relation had never existed. (L v. L [1931] S.C. 477.)The question whether artificial insemination constitutes a bar to nullity hasnot yet been before a Scottish court.B.   DivorceCondonation73. A matrimonial offence is said to be condoned when the innocentspouse has with knowledge of all the material facts reinstated the guiltyspouse in his or her former marital position with the intention of forgivingor remitting the wrong. This intention will be conclusively presumed wherea husband has sexual intercourse with his wife with knowledge that she hascommitted a matrimonial offence. The question may arise whether the artificial insemination of a guilty wife with the husband&apos;s seed, or, if the husband consents, with a donor&apos;s seed, would have the same effect. no clear answer can be given to this question as the law now stands and thecourt&apos;s decision might well turn on whether or not the insemination had resulted in the birth of a child.Adultery74. The question whether the artificial insemination of a wife by adonor constitutes adultery has never been considered by the English courts in any reported case. Extra-judicial opinion is divided on the question,but the preponderant view seems to be that A.I.D. without the consent ofthe husband, though a grave injury to him, is not adultery in the sensein which that term is understood by the divorce law of this country. Thosewho take the contrary view rely on the speech of Lord Dunedin in thecase of Russell v. Russell [1924] A.C.721. Speaking of the appellant LordDunedin said obiter : &quot; The jury came to the conclusion that she had beenfecundated ab extra by another man unknown, and fecundation ab extra is,I doubt not, adultery.&quot; No question of artificial insemination arose inthat case, but it is argued that there can be no difference in this respectbetween fertilisation from outside (fecundation ab extra) and AID. Thesecond case relied upon by those who take this view is Orford v. Orjord[1921] 58 D.L.R. 251, which was decided by the Supreme Court of Ontario.In that case the wife had given birth to a child which she alleged had beenconceived as the result of AID. without her husband&apos;s knowledge. Thecourt found that in fact sexual intercourse had taken place between herand the actual father and she was therefore guilty of adultery. The courtalso expressed the view that, even if the child had been conceived as theresult of A.I.D. Without the husband&apos;s consent, she would still have been
Jty of adultery, since in their opinion the essence of the offence ofultery consisted &quot;not in the moral turpitude of the act of sexual inter-Icourse, but in the voluntary surrender to another person of the reproductivepowers or faculties of the guilty person&quot;. Mr. Justice Vaisey and sir henry Willink, Q.C., in the chapter which they contributed to the Reportof the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Commission on Artificial HumanInsemination, reached the same conclusion, differing from the Ontarioj Supreme Court only in thinking that adultery involved the surrender eitherI of the reproductive powers or of the organs of generation, whether capableI of actual generation or not. This view was not, however, accepted by! the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division when he spoke;in the debate on artificial insemination which took place in the House ofI Lords on 16th March, 1949.75. More recently, the question has been considered by the Court of. Session in Maclennan v. Maclennan [1958] S.L.T.7. In this case, unlikeOrford v. Orford, the question whether A.I.D. without the husband&apos;s con-sent amounted to adultery arose directly for the court&apos;s decision. In answer to a husband&apos;s action for divorce on the ground of his wife&apos;s adultery the wife alleged that the child to which she had given birth was conceived asi the result of A.I.D. The &quot;husband contended that this defence was irrelevant because A.I.D. without the husband&apos;s consent was adultery in theI eyes of the law. On a preliminary bearing to determine this point, LordjWheatley exhaustively surveyed the authorities (including the English cases1 of Russell v. Russell, mentioned above, and Clark (otherwise Talbot) v.\Clark [1943] 2 All E.R. 540, in which Mr. Justice Pilcher held that ai marriage had not been consummated although the wife had been fecundatedjab extra by her husband) and came to the conclusion that A.I.D. did not\ constitute adultery according to the law of Scotland. In the course ofhis judgment Lord Wheatley said: &quot;I have quoted these English cases atI some length since it seems possible to derive therefrom the following propositions, according at least to the law of England. (1) For adultery to1 be committed there must be the two parties physically present and engag-jing in the sexual act at the same time. (2) To constitute the sexual actthere must be an act of union involving some degree of penetration of! the female organ by the male organ. (3) It is not a necessary concomitantI of adultery that male seed should be deposited in the female&apos;s ovum.I (4) The placing of the male seed in the female ovum need not necessarilyj result from the sexual act, and if it does not, but is placed there by some other means, there is no sexual intercourse. I appreciate that the secondj of these findings does not square with Lord Dunedin&apos;s obiter dictum inI Russell (supra) which seems to conflict with the decision of Pilcher, J., in\Clark (supra), but even on Lord Dunedin&apos;s standard the physical presence\ of the male organ and its Close proximity and juxtaposition to the femalej organ seem to me to be essential ingredients of the act.&quot;76. In the debate in the House of Lords on 26th February, 1958, LordMerrirnan referred to Lord Wheatley&apos;s decision and reaffirmed his own view that A.I.D. was not adultery.   It seems likely that this is the view which would prevail if the question arose for decision by an English court.
Other Matters \\.77. A.I.D. without the husband&apos;s consent, though not amounting to&apos;-adultery, may have a number of important consequences in a matrimonialdispute. If the wife&apos;s conduct in submitting to A.I.D. was &quot; aimed at&quot;the husband and had an adverse effect on his mental health it might wellamount to cruelty so as to entitle him to a decree of divorce. It may also be that, in proceedings for divorce for desertion at the instance of a wife, the fact that she had submitted herself to A.I.D. without his consentwould afford to the husband a defence to the proceedings, as being ajustification for his leaving the matrimonial home.C. Other Matrimonial Proceedings78. What has been said in the preceding paragraphs in relation to proceedings for divorce would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings forjudicial separation (including those before the Sheriff in Scotland). Similarquestions are also likely to arise in connection with matrimonial proceedings in magistrates&apos; courts in England. For example, adultery and crueltyare among the grounds on which such proceedings can be taken in amagistrates&apos; court; and magistrates&apos; courts are guided, in exercising theirmatrimonial jurisdiction, by the practice and pronouncements of the HighCourt in its divorce jurisdiction, where these are relevant.D. Legitimacy and Devolution of PropertyLegitimacy79. We have no doubt that a child born to a married woman as aresult of artificial insemination with her husband&apos;s semen during his lifetime1is the legitimate child of the woman and her husband. This would beso even if their marriage were afterwards annulled on the ground of the husband&apos;s incapacity because the law provides2 that where a decree ofnullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage any child who wouldhave been the legitimate child of the parties if the marriage had been dissolved instead of being annulled shall be deemed to be their legitimatechild notwithstanding the annulment.80. Equally, there is no doubt that a child born as the result of A.I.D.is illegitimate. The fact that the husband has consented to the artificial insemination is immaterial. He can no more legitimate the child by giving his consent than he can legitimate the issue Of an adulterous union byconsenting to the adultery. But to state these self-evident propositionsis not the end of the matter. There is a presumption that a Child bornto a wife during wedlock is the legitimate child of the spouses &quot; pater estquern nuptiae demonstrant&quot;. The courts will not regard the presumption oflegitimacy as being displaced by a mere balance of probability ; &quot; theevidence for the purpose of repelling it must be strong, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive&quot; (per Lord Lyndhurst in Moms v. Davies [1837] 51 Cl. &amp;Fin. 215, at p. 265 and see Cotton v. Cotton [1945] P.305).3   If, however,1 See paragraph 68.2 In England, section 9 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1950, and in Scotland, section 4(1)of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1949.3 In Scotland the presumption is not considered to be quite so strong rebutting evidencemay not require to go so far as to be &apos; conclusive &apos; (See the opinions of the Lord Justice ClerkThomson and Lord Patrick in Ballantine v. Douglas [1953] S.L.T. notes 10 and 11).
&apos;ljtfeevidence is strong.enough,the presumption can be rebutted in certainiPJProumstanees.   Thus where a widow (remarries and subsequently : gives1 birth ito .a -ichild within nine months of her first huslband&apos;s death the\ , presumption that the child is a child of the second marriage will be displacedI .and the^child will be regarded, as the-legitimate issue, of the first,marriagej . (Re -Over bury [1954] 3 All E.R. 308).   Similarly, if it is proved that the husband did not have access to his wife during the time when i the. childmust have been conceived, the child will be regarded as the result of anadulterous union.   If it is not proved beyond doubt either that the&apos;husbandwas incapable of procreating a child or that he did not have access to.his wife during the relevant period, the presumption of legitimacy will not berebutted.81. It wiirbe clear, from what has been said in the previous chapter that\ in.many cases where a child has been born as a result of A.I.D. it would be very difficult to establish that the child was illegitimate.   If ATJH.D.I has&apos;been used or if the couple have had sexual intercourse during the period when A.LD. was being used, it.cannot be said that the husband did not1 have access.   The question would have to be determined in the light ofI such medical evidence as was available to show whether, or not the husbandwas, at the relevant time, capable of procreation.   In the great majority, of cases, evidence that might rebut the presumption of legitimacy maynever be brought to light.1  The matter seems likely to arise.chiefly-wherethe husband has not consented to A.I.D., or where he consented at theItime but afterwards attempts to disown the child. Otherwise, it is very unlikely that the couple would disclose A.I.D. In fact, no court in thiscountry has yet had to consider the legitimacy of a person believed tohave been conceived as a result of A.I.D.82. While, however, the question of legitimacy will rarely, if ever, arisefj in practice, we feel bound to record that most of the doctors practisingA.I.D. whom we interviewed had no hesitation in producing figures showingj the number of conceptions or births achieved by A.I.D.   In other words,in most cases there is very little doubt in the minds of the-doctor or,j probably, of the couple that the child is of A.I.D. origin.   Most of these -children are therefore -illegitimate.I Devolution of Property83. An illegitimate child has no right to succeed to property on an&apos; intestacy unless the intestate is his mother (assuming she has died leaving1 no legitimate issue) or his own issue.  Conversely, where an illegitimatej child dies intestate, the.only persons entitled to succeed to his property are;]-his.-mother and his own issue.   The law recognises no kinship betweenj .him..and his.father or his parents&apos;.relations.   Similarly, the term &quot; children &quot;1 inany disposition prima facie means legitimate children or childrenI legitimated before . the disposition comes into operation.   There are two-exceptions. to-this general -rule, viz. (1) where it is impossible from, the1 * circumstances of the case that any legitimate child could take under. the disposition and (2) where upon a true interpretation of the dispositionj the term &quot;children&quot; must have been -intended -to include illegitimate1 It is, however, possible that if A.I.D. were to become more prevalent this.o5 itself would. i weaken the strength ;of.the presumption of! legitimacy.
children. Thus, if property were limited to A for life and subsequent to his children, a child born to A&apos;s wife as a result of A.I.D. would bVunable to take under the disposition. &apos;But if property were limited to Afor life and subsequently to his son and at the date of the disposition the wife, having no son of the marriage by natural intercourse, had, as theresult of A.I.D., given birth to a son whom A had treated as his own, theson would presumably be held entitled to take under the disposition.E.   Maintenance of ChildrenEngland(i) AIM.84. The liability of the parents for the maintenance of a child conceivedas a result of A.I.H. differs in no respect from their liability to maintainother legitimate children. As we have seen,1 even if the marriage is annulledthe children are deemed to be the legitimate children of the parties. In theevent of annulment, divorce or judicial separation, the court has power,under section 26 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1950, to make such provision as appears just with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of the children of the marriage.(ii) A.I.D.(a) Liability of the HusbandThe existing law85. Under the Summary Jurisdiction (Separation and Maintenance) Acts,1895 to 1949, and the National Assistance Act, 1948, a man can be requiredto maintain only his wife and his children under the age of 16. If, there-fore, a husband could show that a child of his wife&apos;s was born as the resultof A.I.D. he would not at present be liable to maintain the child either at the suit of the National Assistance Board or at the suit of his wife. If,however, he had accepted the child as one of the family (as no doubt hewould be held to have done by consenting to his wife&apos;s insemination) the divorce Court would have power, in proceedings for divorce or judicialseparation, to provide for the custody, maintenance and education of the child and, if the child were under the age of 16, no final decree couldbe made until the court was satisfied that proper arrangements had beenmade for his or her care and upbringing.2The Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates&apos; Courts) Bill, 196086. This Bill, which is now before Parliament, amends and consolidatesthe law at present contained in the Summary Jurisdiction (Separation andMaintenance) Acts, 1895 to 1949. In particular, it provides that a magistrates&apos;court shall have power, in any matrimonial proceedings brought underthe provisions of the Bill, to order the payment by the husband of maintenancefor any child born to the wife and accepted by the husband as one of the family. If, as is expected, the Bill is enacted during the present parliamentary session, a husband who has consented to his wife receiving A.I.D. will notthereafter be able to evade his responsibility for maintaining any childborn as a result of her insemination.1 Paragraph 79.2 Sections 1 and 2 of the Matrimonial Proceedings (Children ) Act, 1958.
(b) The Donor87. Where a &quot; single woman &apos;n gives birth to a child she may bringaffiliation proceedings against the putative father at any time within twelvemonths of the child&apos;s birth, and the court may order the putative fatherto contribute towards the child&apos;s maintenance. In addition, the national assistance Board may bring affiliation proceedings against the putativefather of an illegitimate child if the Board have given assistance for themaintenance of the child, and the Board need not prove that the motheris a single woman.2 We have therefore considered whether affiliationproceedings could be brought against a person who donated semen forA.I.D. which resulted in the toirth of a child. It appears to us, however,that a donor who has supplied semen on the faith of an&apos; assurance thatit will toe used only for a married woman whose husband has consented to her insemination is unlikely to be held liable for the consequences ofhis action even if his paternity could be proved, which is also unlikely.Scotland88. In Scotland the common law imposes upon the parents the liability to aliment their Children in so far as they are able. The father is primarilyliable, but if his means are insufficient the obligation falls on the mother.Both would, therefore, be liable in law to maintain a child conceived as aresult of A.I.H. As regards A.I.D., it seems unlikely that the husband ofthe mother would be regarded as liable, if he could establish that the childhad been conceived by A.I.D. In this event, it would follow that so longas a child proved to have been conceived by A.I.D. (performed with or without the husband&apos;s consent) were deemed illegitimate, that child wouldhave claims for aliment upon the donor (if paternity could be established) andthe mother, but not upon the mother&apos;s husband. The provisions of theNational Assistance Act, 1948, apply as in England, in respect of children under sixteen. Likewise, under section 7 of the Matrimonial Proceedings(Children) Act, 1958, the Court of Session, on granting decree of divorce,has power to provide for the maintenance of an illegitimate child of one party to the marriage who has been accepted as one of the family by theother party. The Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, does not apply to scotland, nor is the Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates&apos; Courts) Billapplicable.F.   Registration of Birth89. The registration of births in England is governed by the Births andDeaths Registration Act, 1953, which consolidated earlier Acts dating from1836. The particulars to toe entered in the birth register concerning abirth are prescribed in regulations made by the Registrar General with theapproval of the (Minister of Health. There are two columns in the formof the entry which relate to particulars concerning the child&apos;s father;column 4 provides for entry of &quot;Name and surname of father&quot; andcolumn 6 for entry of &quot; Occupation of father&quot;. It is in relation to theentries in these columns that difficulties might arise when registeringbirths following artificial insemination.1 Within the meaning of the Affiliation Proceedings Act, 1957, as modified by section 4 ofthe Legitimacy Act, 1959.2 See National Assistance Board v. Tugby [1957] 1 All E.R. 509.27
90. Section 10 of the Act provides that, in the case of an illegitiml^jlchild, the registrar shall not enter in the register the name of any person as jnfather of the child except at the joint request of the mother and the person wacknowledging himself to be the father, who shall in that case sign theregister together with the mother.   In the case of an illegitimate birth qwhere the father&apos;s name is not to be entered, the registrar is required by regulations to draw a line through columns 4 and 6 of the register. ;0 in91. Persons who are qualified to give information concerning a birth ^are specified in the Act.  The duty is placed primarily on the child&apos;s father ^and mother, but in the event of their death or inability it falls on the occupier jjof the house in which the child was born, any person present at the birth,or any person having charge of the child.   In the case of an illegitimate !a,child, section 10 of the Act specifically excludes the father from any duty pto register although permitting him to sign the register jointly with the t]mother.   The responsibility for the truth of the information given for 0entry in the register rests entirely on the informant and the registrar has no ftauthority to record information other than that given to him by the jjinformant.   Section 4 of the Perjury Act, 1911, provides that, if any person f,wilfully makes any false answer to any question put to him by a registrar jrelating to the particulars required to be registered concerning a birth, ,vor wilfully gives to the registrar any false information concerning a birth vor makes any false statement with intent to have it inserted in a register of births, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.  Under section 7 of this JeAct the offence is extended to every person who adds, abets, counsels, !cprocures or suborns enotber person to commit the offence. c92. In Scotland, similar provision for the registration of births is madeunder the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1854.The giving of false information in furnishing particulars to the registrarconstitues an offence under the False Oaths (Scotland) Act, 1933,1 and itseems possible that it would also constitute the common law crime off fraud.93. Neither in England nor in Scotland is the entry in the registergoverned by the presumption that a child born during wedlock is the legitimate child of the marriage. The registrar is required to ask not forthe name of the mother&apos;s husband, but for the name of the child&apos;s father.It follows that when an informant registering the birth of a child off a married woman is aware that the mother&apos;s husband is not the child&apos;s fatherthe birth should be registered as illegitimate.94. Where a child may have been conceived by A.I.D. the questionwhether an informant who gives the husband&apos;s name as the father is oris not committing the offence of perjury must, we think, depend on whatknowledge the informant has of the husband&apos;s chances of fatherhood. Ifthe informant does not believe that there is a real possibility that the husband may be the father, then we think that the law is being broken.If, on the other hand, he is, rightly or wrongly, under the impression thatthere is genuinely such a possibility we cannot see how he can be foundguilty of the offence of perjury.95. We do not know how many births believed to be due to A.I.D.have been registered in legitimate or illegitimate form.   It is no part of the1 As extended by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, 1949.
,j\^strar&apos;s duty to enquire whether the child was conceived toy artificialJ insemination, and we have been told of only two occasions hitherto on1 which the registrar was informed that there had been A.I.D.G.  Whether A.I.D. is a Criminal Offence96. It has been represented to us by some witnesses that, even if falseinformation is not given to the registrar of births, A.I.D. may neverthelessconstitute a criminal offence.  On this view, the offence would consist, atany rate under English law, of a conspiracy to produce an ellegitimate child.In England the crime of conspiracy is committed when there is an agree-ment by two or more persons to achieve an unlawful act, even though thatpet would not amount to a crime if done by an individual.1  Lord Denningpointed out in the debate in the House of Lords on 26th February, 1958,that in the past when a woman, the mother of a bastard, had agreed with others by fraud or concealment to saddle an innocent person (i.e. the husband) with the maintenance of that child, it had been held to be anindictable conspiracy.2   A number of old cases3 can be cited as authorityfor this point, and we have no reason to doubt that it is still the law.Even if the husband consents, the production of an illegitimate child,whether through AjIJD. or adultery, is, on one view, an unlawful act.  ButJwe are extremely doubtful whether in practice the parties to A.I.D. (presume-ably the doctor, the donor and the woman who was inseminated) wouldfever be charged with committing a criminal conspiracy, or whether, ifcharged, they would be convicted.  It seems to us that the possibility of a criminal charge would only be likely to arise if there were an attempt to(obtain some material advantage by representing an illegitimate child tofbe legitimate, and in that case there would probably be a conspiracy todo an act which would be criminal if committed by one person namely,j obtaining money or goods by false pretences.97. We understand that in Scotland the crime of conspiracy can only be committed if there is an agreement to commit an act which would be criminalif done by one person.   It has, however, been represented to us that thisj does not necessarily mean that the purpose of engendering illegitimateIchildren by A.I.D. is not criminal in Scotland. It has always been accepted that the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justiciary is not limited to crimes; which are already established by statute or by the common law, and it has,; therefore, been put to us that the court has inherent power to declare criminaland to punish new types of conduct which, although not yet covered by(express authority, may be regarded as grossly immoral or mischievous, asj&quot; malum in se &quot;, or as contrary to the law of God.4  But others take theiview that the jurisdiction of the court is limited to acts which are plainlyi criminal, and that it could not be said in these days that because an act* R. v.

was immoral or contrary to the divine law it was a crime, unless it cov^Jialso be said that it was plainly criminal. Apart, therefore, from offencesin connection with the registration of the birth, or actions which showed afraudulent intention to support a false claim to an inheritance, we areinclined to think that in Scotland also the parties to A.I.D. would not in.practice be prosecuted for the commission of a criminal offence and thatif a prosecution were undertaken it would be unlikely to succeed.98. It seems extremely unlikely that A.I.D. would ever be performedon a woman against her will, but if it were it would clearly constitute aserious assault (but not rape, since penetration is an essential element of this offence). Apart from this unlikely possibility, we think it very doubtfulwhether, either in England or Scotland, anyone could be successfully prose-cuted merely for performing or assisting in the performance of artificial insemination with the seed of a donor.H.   Incest99. We have already mentioned1 that the possibility that two childrensired by the same donor may marry is at present extremely remote. It is sometimes suggested that if this were to happen the offence of incest mightbe committed. There would, however, be no offence unless one of theparties knew that the other was his half brother or sister.2 The only legalconsequence would be that the marriage, being within the prohibited degrees of relationship, would be void.311 Paragraph 39.2 Sexual Offences Act, 1956, sections 10 and 11.3 In accordance with section 1 of the Marriage Act, 1949, in England, and the common lawin Scotland.
PART TWO : THE COMMITTEES VIEWSCHAPTER iii the Committee&apos;s Views on A.I.H.A.  Whether the Practice should be Prohibited by Law100. The great majority of our witnesses who had enquired into thepractice of A.I.H. agreed that it was a form of medical treatment which was justified in certain rare circumstances and that in its social consequences it did not differ in principle from the conception of children by normal means.101. A few witnesses, principally those appearing on behalf or the roman catholic body, were, however, opposed to every form of human artificial insemination, including A.I.H. Their objections to A.I.H. were founded on two grounds. First, like A.I.D., it involved masturbation on the part ofthe donor. We appreciate that some people regard masturbation in any circumstances as a sinful abuse of a God-given faculty or as an unpleasantform of self indulgence. It is, however, a recognised method of producingspecimens of semen for medical analysis. Whatever may be thought ofmasturbation in other circumstances and this is not a matter on whichit is necessary or appropriate for us to express an opinion we share theview of the great majority of our witnesses that as a method of enablinga child to be born to a husband and wife, who would otherwise be childless,it should not be condemned.102. Secondly, artificial insemination has been regarded by some of our witnesses as constituting an unwarranted interference with the naturalprocesses of sexual intercourse and procreation of children. According tothe teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, marriage does not give ahusband and wife an absolute right to the conception of children, but merelya right to perform together natural acts of sexual intercourse which are of themselves conducive to conception. A wife is, therefore, not entitled to beartificially inseminated with the seed of her husband obtained apart fromintercourse. We understand, however, that some Roman Catholics do not object to a procedure known as &quot; assisted insemination &quot;, whereby, afterintercourse, semen is projected from the vagina into the cervix by mechanicalmeans.1 Thus the Roman Catholic Church rejects any substitute for thenaturally performed conjugal act: in this respect there is no diversity ofopinion among informed Roman Catholics. But there is no official teach-ing of the Roman Catholic Church as to whether and how the naturalconjugal act may be helped to achieve a procreative effect.103. We recognise that some sections of the community and some indi-viduals object on principle to any form of human artificial insemination,and we appreciate their reasons for doing so. But we feel sure that it wouldbe in accord with the wishes and with the interests of society as a wholethat those who desire to administer and receive A.I.H. should be free to doso without interference by the law.1 We understand that some Roman Catholics object to the withdrawal of the semen fromthe vagina before projection, while others do not.31
B.   Whether Proceedings  or Nullity oi Marriage should be Barred aft^1A.I.H.104. While we are agreed that in principle A.I.H. does not call for any amendment of the law, the practice may in certain circumstances haveconsequences to individuals of which the law should take account.105. It may be undertaken where, because of the husband&apos;s impotence,the marriage has not been consummated. We have already indicated1 thatsome practitioners hesitate to accept these cases, because the relationship between husband and wife may suggest that the child is unlikely to havea happy and secure upbringing. Whether to proceed with A.I.H. in sucha case is a matter which must be left to the physician and the couple todetermine, if necessary with specialist assistance. But if A.I.H. is under-taken and a child is born, the parties may nevertheless be at liberty underthe present law to take proceedings for annulment of the marriage2. Inthe interests of the child we do not think that this should be so. It istrue that if a decree of nullity is granted the child is deemed to be the legiti-mate child of the parties notwithstanding the annulment.3 But either or bothof his parents may marry again. In our view it is undesirable, havingregard to the interests of the child concerned, that any marriage which hasresulted in the birth of a child by a means to which both husband and wifehave agreed should be declared null and void. Until artificial inseminationbecame possible it was very rare indeed for there to be a child of a unionthat had not been consummated.4106. This matter was discussed by the Royal Commission on marriage and Divorce.   The Commission^ view was as follows : &quot; We consider that if the parties have gone to the length of artificial insemination of the wife, whether by the seed of her husband orby the seed of a donor, it is undesirable that either the husband or the wife should afterwards be allowed to claim that nevertheless the marriage should be annulled on the ground of the impotence of oneor other of them. Consent to an act which is likely to produce a child of the wife is in our view so fundamental a step that it must betaken to mean that the parties acquiesce in the marriage. Accordingly,we recommend that the fact that the parties to a marriage have con-sented to the artificial insemination of the wife, with the seed of either the husband or a donor, should be a bar to proceedings by eitherspouse for nullity of marriage on the ground of impotence.&quot;5107. The Royal Commission^ view is based on the argument thatconsent to &quot; an act which is likely to produce a child &quot; constitutes approba-tion of the marriage, whether or not a child results. (We have assumed that in referring to &quot; insemination &quot; the Royal Commission were not referringonly to successful msernination.) It is certainly true that if proceedings for nullity are to be barred on the ground that the parties acquiesced in the marriage in agreeing to artificial insemination the question whethera child was eventually born is of no relevance in determining the state of1 Paragraph 65.2 Paragraphs 71 and 72.3 Paragraph 79.4 See, however, Clark v. Clark [1943] 2 All E.R. 540, referred to in paragraph 75 above.5 Cmd. 9678, paragraph 287.
kind of the parties at the time of the agreement. But, as a result of ourWquiry, we think that the Royal Commission^ views require qualificationin two respects. First, the proportion of cases where A.I.H. is undertaken without success is so large1 that it is misleading to describe it as &quot; an actwhich is likely to produce a child.&quot; Secondly, there are other forms of medical treatment by which it is hoped that pregnancy will be achieved,and which are as likely, or more likely, to be successful than A.I.H.On the Royal Commission^ argument, agreement to undergo these other forms of treatment should also constitute approbation of the marriage.No doubt the courts would in many such cases take the view that the marriage had been approbated. It would, however, be difficult to justifydebarring the parties by statute in all cases from seeking a decree of nullityon the grounds of non-consummation merely because treatment to makeconsummation possible had been tried without success.108. We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that where A.I.H.has been undertaken the husband or wife should not be debarred fromproceedings for nullity of marriage unless a child has been born to the wifeas a result of insemination.we accordingly recommend that the  act that a live child has beenborn as a result of artificial insemination of a woman with the seed of her husband should be a bar to proceedings by either spouse for nullity of marriage on the ground of impotence.C. A.I.H. without fee Consent of one of the Spouses109. We understand that it is not uncommon for either husband or wifenot to want the other to find out that he or she is responsible for thechildlessness of the marriage.3 It is therefore conceivable that A.I.H.might be undertaken, at the suggestion of the wife, without the consentof the husband. The husband might, for instance, be asked by the doctorto produce a specimen of semen for analysis, which the doctor wouldthereupon use for A.I.H. without asking the husband&apos;s permission; alter-natively, the doctor might withdraw semen from the wife&apos;s vagina afterintercourse and inseminate her with it, again without consulting the husband.We have had no evidence that this has ever been done, but if it wereto happen we do not feel that the husband ought to have a remedy in lawagainst his wife, or against the doctor, for, as it were, merely taking additionalsteps to try to make the marriage fruitful. Similarly, we do not thinkthat the law requires amendment on account of the possibility (unknown,so far as we are aware, in this country) that at the suggestion of her husbandA.I.H. may be performed on the wife without her knowledge for example,under the pretext of gynaecological examination or other treatment. Nodoubt in these circumstances the wife would have cause for action againstthe doctor.D. A.I.H. after the HusbamTs Death110. Some of our witnesses have drawn attention to- the possibility that,if it became practicable to preserve human semen for more than a few1 Paragraph 63.2 As to A.I.D., see paragraph 156.3 See paragraph 114.33
hours,1 a woman might he artificially inseminated with her husband&apos;s sen^f)&apos;after his death. We are of opinion that such a practice would be most undesirable. Since the marriage would have been terminated by the death of the husband any child that resulted would not only be illegitimate but would be deprived of a father from the start. We can see no justification for deliberately bringing a child into the world in such circumstances.Since, however, according to the evidence we have heard, this is not atpresent a possibility, we need not consider whether it should be prohibitedby law.E.  The Use of Artificial Insemination for Sex Determination111. Another matter which is still in the experimental stage is the useof artificial insemination in particular, of A.I.H. to produce children of a particular sex.2 It is conceivable that if this ever became a widespreadpractice the desire of parents to have children of one sex rather than another might have the effect of upsetting the balance of the sexes inthe community. This is a matter which may acquire practical importanceat some future date, and we therefore think that the progress of theseexperiments and any developments to which they may give rise should bekept under review, in case it later becomes necessary for the State to take some action.CHAPTER IVA.I.D. Husband and WifeA. Introduction112. All members of the Committee are of the opinion that:(a) In no circumstances should a single woman be artificially inseminated.(b) A.I.D. should not take place without the written consent of husband and wife.B. A.I.D. for Single Women113. Under (a) we would exclude not only unmarried women, but widows and married women living apart from their husbands. The importance and possible difficulties of A.I.D. are such that it should never be undertakenif there is not in the home a husband who is prepared to exercise the responsibilities of fatherhood from the beginning. It is manifestly unfair to the child to impose on him the additional handicap of having no oneto look to as his father. It has been suggested to us that since an adoptionorder may be made in favour of a single woman, there is no good reason why a single woman should not receive A.I.D. But it is rare for such anadoption order to be made, and the circumstances of adoption are, we think,very different from those of A.I.D. The adopted child is already in theworld, and it may occasionally be found that there is an unmarried woman sometimes his own mother who is, in all the circumstances, the mostsuitable person to give him a good home. The usual argument put forward in favour of A.I.D. is that a woman is married to a man who is physicallyincapable of giving her a child in the normal way, and this, ex hypothesi,cannot apply to an unmarried woman.1 Paragraph 68.2 Paragraph 69.
A.I.D. for Married Women without the Consent of one of the Spouses114. We have no knowledge that in this country A.I.D. has ever takenplace without the full knowledge and consent of husband and wife. Wehave, however, seen it suggested in a report of a discussion of this subjectoverseas1 that A.I.D. without the knowledge of the husband is justified on the ground that the wife would not like her husband to know thathe is sterile ; and that A.I.D. may even be undertaken without the knowledgeof the wife (under the pretext of a gynaecological examination) becausethe husband does not want her to know that he is sterile. While we appreciate that, for one of the parties to a marriage to know that he, orthe other party, is incapable of begetting a child may have unfortunateeffects on the marriage relationship, we cannot but feel that to permit either of them on that account, without consulting the other, to induce a doctor tointroduce the seed of a third person into the marriage is a fraud whichmight have even more unfortunate effects not only on the relationship between the spouses, but also on any child who might be conceived in this way.115. As we have already remarked, it has been decided that A.I.D.is not adultery under Scottish law,2 and we have expressed the opinionthat this would probably be the view of the English courts.3 We have nodoubt that A.I.D. without the husband consent constitutes, in the words ofLord Wheatley,4 &quot; a grievous marital offence.&quot; Lord Wheatley continued&quot;... If it be that science has created a casus improvisus the remedy is notto be found in fitting such a case into one of the existing grounds of divorceon arguments which cannot logically or physiologically be supported.&quot; the remedy is, we feel sure, to make A.I.D. without the husband&apos;s consent anew ground for divorce, a course which was proposed by the Royal Corn-mission on Marriage and Divorce. The Commission^ views were asfollows:&quot; Our terms of reference do not embrace a consideration of the moral and social implications of artificial insemination, but we have felt it right to consider in what, if any, circumstances artificial inseminationby a donor should constitute grounds for divorce. In our view, if a wife accepts artificial insemination by a donor without the consentof her husband she is doing him a grave injury, an injury which, inits possible consequences, is as serious as that of adultery. Theintention is, and the result may be, to father a child on the husbandwithout his knowledge. It was in fact suggested to us that thisconduct should be deemed to be adultery for the purpose of the divorcelaw, whether or not it can accurately be described as adultery. Wethink that this would not be desirable. Instead, we recommend that acceptance by a wife of artificial insemination by a donor without theconsent of her husband should be made a new and, separate ground ofdivorce.&quot;51 Federation des Societes de Gynecologie et d&apos;Obstetrique de Langue Francaise, XVIIeCongres, Etude Medico-Sociale de L&apos;Insemination Artificielle, Masson &amp; Co., Paris; pages579-580.2 Paragraph 75.3 Paragraph 76.4 S.L.T. [1958] pp. 7-8.5 Cmnd. 9678, paragraph 90.
116. We have no hesitation in endorsing this recommendation of tifb1Royal Commission. We have also considered whether it is necessary togo further and provide a remedy for the wife in the case, referred to above,where on the initiative of the husband the wife is given A.I.D. withouther knowing what is being done. We have reached the conclusion that itis unnecessary to do so. It is most unlikely that such a case would everarise in this country, and, if it did, it would be open to the wife to seek a divorce on the ground of cruelty.117. The Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce also recommendedthat A.I.D. without the consent of the husband should be a ground forjudicial separation, and we agree with this recommendation. Furthermore,since A.I.D. without consent is analogous to adultery and adultery is aground for matrimonial proceedings in a magistrates&apos; court in England, wethink that it should be open to a husband to take proceedings in a magistrates&apos;court if his wife has received A.I.D. without his consent.Accordingly we recommend that acceptance by a wife of artificial in-semination with the seed of a donor without the consent of her husbandshould be made a new ground for divorce or judicial separation, and thatin England these circumstances should also enable a husband to takematrimonial proceedings in a magistrates&apos; court.D.  A.I.D. for Married Women with the Consent of Both SpousesCompared with Adultery118. While we had little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that withoutthe consent of the husband A.I.D. must constitute a grave offence against the marriage, we have found it far from easy to determine our attitude to A.I.D.where it is undertaken with his consent.119. It has been represented to us that while A.I.D. may not in lawbe adultery it is nevertheless analogous to adultery, and that, while the husband&apos;s consent may mean that it cannot be regarded as a matrimonialoffence, consent does not alter the essential nature of the act any more thanconnivance makes adultery not adultery. It has - been put to us, in par-ticular by witnesses representing religious bodies, that A.I.D. is a violation of the exclusive physical union of man and wife to which both pledgedthemselves at the time of their marriage ; in receiving the seed of a donor,it is said, the wife breaks the vow which she made at marriage &quot; to keepherself only unto him, so long as they both shall live.&quot; We think that without amplification this argument may be misleading. Until A.I.D. was introduced the only way in which the exclusive physical union of man and wife could be broken during the marriage was by physical intercourse, princi-pally adultery, on the part of one of them with a third party. The wholehistory of the institution of marriage, whether it be regarded as a religious or as a social institution, shows that the main threat to the physical sideof the union has always been adultery and that the undertaking, given atmarriage, to &quot;forsake all other&quot; is primarily an undertaking to refrain from adultery.120. We have already shown1 that there are good grounds for holdingthat in law A.I.D. does not constitute adultery.  We do not, therefore, think1 Paragraphs 74-76.m
m is sufficient to say, without further argument, that A.I.D. breaks theReclusive physical union of husband and wife because it is by its nature&quot; adulterous &quot; or &quot; analogous to adultery &quot;. It is necessary to examine in further detail the differences and resemblances between A.I.D. and adulteryand in this way to try to establish whether A.I.D. is likely to have undesir-able effects on the relationship between husband and wife, either because ofits resemblances to adultery or for other reasons. Since we are considering a.I.D. to which the husband gives his consent beforehand, the nearest com-parison is with adultery on the part of the wife with the connivance ofthe husband.   In neither case does one party deceive the other.121. The most obvious difference is that adultery consists in sexual inter-course between two people, with all the emotional implications that this involves, whereas A.I.D. is regarded by some as a form of medical treatment.Furthermore we understand that when a woman receives A.I.D. she con-tinues to have normal marital relations with her husband ; adultery, thoughby no means incompatible with their continuance, very often means thatnormal relations between the spouses cease or are interrupted.122. The motives behind the two actions are, as a rule, quite different.A woman who commits adultery does so for the pleasure of the sexual actwith a person other than her husband; very rarely does she do so inorder to conceive a child ; usually she will hope that conception will notoccur. A woman receives A.I.D. in the hope that she will be able to con-ceive a child to whom her husband will act as father. Just as the motivesare different, so are the consequences. The consequence of successfulA.I.D. is a child whom the consenting husband will treat as his ; the conse-quence of adultery may be an attachment, more or less lasting, between the wife and her lover. Such an attachment is ruled out in A.I.D., becausethe wife and the donor never meet.123. But adultery and A.I.D. have an important feature in common. in both, the wife receives the seed of a person other than her husband. Tomany people this is a decisive argument against A.I.D. Even though its effects on the marriage were in all cases wholly good, it would go againstwhat has hitherto been regarded as the essential nature of marriage. Weconsider later1 what effect this is likely to have an society as a whole. Forthe present we are concerned with the effect on husband and wife.Possible Dangers to the Relationship between the Spouses124. The immediate purpose of A.I.D. is to procreate a child otherwise than through the sexual union of man and wife. This is also true of A.I.H.,but with A.I.H. the male seed, without which a child cannot be conceived,comes from the husband. With A.I.D. the husband does not play his partin procreation, either through sexual intercourse or through A.I.H. the wife is able to conceive only because a third person is prepared to make hisseed available for the purpose. The wife has, in other words, to look out-side the marriage for the essential contribution without which procreationcannot take place.i Chapter VIII.
125. We find it very difficult to say with confidence whether the fact thfe;^the husband has been unable to play his part in procreation, and recoursehas been had to A.I.D., is or is not likely to have a disturbing effect on the marriage relationship. We think it must often happen that a husband onhearing that he is probably sterile feels a very great sense of inadequacy.It may well be that in many cases he feels that by consenting to A.I.D.he will be doing what he can to compensate his wife for his own failure,and if a child is born his own sterility may cease to worry him because his wife has after all been able to bear a child. On the other hand he will realise that it was most probably no action on his part but the contribution of a donor which was the physical cause enabling his wife to overcome herchildlessness. Far from putting an end to his feelings of inadequacy, thecontinued presence of an A.I.D. child may only serve to remind him of hisfailure, to which he might otherwise have become reconciled with the passageof years.126. From the point of view of the wife also, recourse to A.I.D. mayhave one of two effects. Her husband&apos;s failure to give her a child maylead her to regard him as an inadequate or inferior partner and may thusembitter the relationship between the spouses. His subsequent agreement to A.I.D. may be accepted by her as a magnanimous gesture which fullymakes amends for his inadequacy, and if A.I.D. is successful her joy in achieving pregnancy and her gratitude to her husband for permitting her to conceive a child in this way may produce an entirely satisfactory situa-tion. On the other hand, the fact that she has conceived as a result ofsemen provided by another man may permanently disturb her relationship with her husband. However clinical and anonymous the procedure, anotherman has in fact played the part which should be played by her husband.127. We cannot say that the possible dangers to which we have drawn attention in the preceding paragraphs will necessarily materialise. All wecan say is that while in some cases A.I.D. may be entirely satisfactory, sofar as relations between husband and wife are concerned, in other cases this may not be so. A heavy responsibility is placed on the shoulders of the doctor, to avoid the latter type of case.1The Desire of a Woman to Bear her own Child128. We have borne in mind throughout our enquiry that A.I.D. hasbeen introduced as a solution to a very real human problem. A couple,perhaps well suited for parenthood, have been trying, often for several years, to have a child in the normal way, and eventually they are told thatthe wife is fertile and the husband probably sterile. Until A.I.D. was introduced there was no means (other than adultery) whereby the wife couldbear her own child, and the couple continued to live with their childless-ness, which often imposed a very great strain on the marriage. We are told that the conception of a child through A.I.D. can bring great happiness tothese couples, which would not otherwise be possible, and that its mainjustification is that it can transform a childless marriage into a happyand successful family unit. The wife has the satisfaction of bearing her ownchild, a satisfaction which the husband can share in the knowledge thatsuccess,has been achieved in spite of his own infertility.1 We deal more fully with the doctor&apos;s responsibility in Chapter VII.
m 129. On the other hand, it cannot, we think, be denied that there arePassible dangers1 in the conception of children by A.I.D. which are not present with natural conception, although there may be differences ofopinion about the likelihood of such dangers materialising. In view ofthis, we have felt bound to consider what are likely to be the worstconsequences to a couple of not being able to have a child by A.I.D.We accordingly put this question to a number of our witnesses, including some who were concerned with the practice of A.I.D. and some who werenot. We were told that with some women continued childlessness might produce such a distortion of their natural impulses as to affect their whole personality ; nor would the effects necessarily be confined to the woman; the relationship between the couple might suffer from an increasing tension and distress, which could in the end be destructive ofthe marriage.130. Such consequences would, however, manifest themselves only insome women and some marriages. While most women wish to bearchildren, many who find they are unable to do so are able to &quot; sublimate &quot;their wish for children and maintain their marriage unimpaired by findingfulfilment in other ways. We have tried to establish in our conversations with witnesses whether on psychological grounds it is better for a womanwhose desire to bear her own child is unfulfilled to try to sublimate thatdesire or to satisfy it by recourse to A.I.D. The reply we have receivedis that this question cannot be answered in general terms. It depends onthe circumstances of the particular case. Some women in some circum-stances will sublimate their desire successfully ; others will fail to doso and their frustration can be relieved only by childbirth.131. The question arises whether the type of woman whose &quot; childhunger &quot; cannot be assuaged is suited to conceive a child by A.I.D. Again,the inevitable answer is that some are, and some are not. With somewomen, the frustration caused by childlessness may by itself becomepathological, or it may be merely an accompaniment of a more widespreadbreakdown of the personality; the same symptoms may occur in her husband, who may be obsessed by his infertility. Such couples are clearlyunsuited to become parents through A.I.D. As a distinguished psychiatristput it to us, speaking of the wife who insists on A.I.D. at all costs:&quot; I would feel happier if she bore the sorrow than bore the child.&quot; Inother cases, the desire for A.I.D. may not be associated with any formof mental instability. The danger is that it may not always be possibleto distinguish the former type of case from the latter.Possible Repercussions of A.I.D.: the Barren Wife Married to a FertileHusband132. From what we have said in the preceding paragraphs it will beapparent that in some cases A.I.D. may have certain advantages for ahusband and wife in their relationship with each other, while in other cases it may not. It does not, however, follow from this that it is a procedure which warrants adoption by married couples in general. Whileit is not our purpose in this chapter to consider the possible repercussions of A.I.D. on the child so conceived or on society as a whole,2 we feel bound1 Some have been referred to in this chapter, and some will be referred to in the followingchapter.2 See chapters V and VIII.
to point out that, even if one takes into account only the interests of $g^spouses, it may have far-reaching consequences. %133. It has been put to us that to accept A.I.D. is to accept the principlethat if one party to the marriage is physically incapable of playing his orher part in the procreation of children the two parties are entitled to callin a third to assist them in the essential physical role which has hitherto been regarded as the province of the spouses alone. It must, we think,be borne in mind that a considerably larger number of marriages arechildless because of the wife&apos;s infertility than because of the husband.2It has been suggested to us that if the fertile wife of an infertile husbandmay have recourse to a donor, it should be accepted that the fertilehusband of a barren wife should have the right to beget a child throughthe agency of another woman.134. While it is not strictly within our terms of reference to considerpossible solutions to the problem of the barren wife, we feel that it is relevant to our consideration of A.I.D. to draw attention to certain develop-ments which would appear to follow from the acceptance of the principlestated at the beginning of the previous paragraph. A husband could, ofcourse, seek to have a child of his own blood, even if his wife wereinfertile, by committing adultery with another woman who would handover the child at birth to be reared by his wife. But this would be asobjectionable as it would be for a woman married to an infertile husbandto conceive a child by adultery with another man. A possible solutionthat has been suggested would be for another woman to be artificiallyinseminated with the seed of the husband. But this proposal, like theprevious one, appears to ignore the very great difference that exists betweenthe biological role of the man who begets and the woman who conceivesand bears a child.2 The contribution of the woman who &quot; donated &quot; a child would scarcely be comparable with that of the donor of semen.We understand that if the wife&apos;s infertility is due to failure to ovulate,it may in the future be possible to transfer an ovum from another woman,either before or after fertilisation.3 In this way an infertile wife might been abled to bear what would in effect be another woman&apos;s child, just as byA.I.D. the wife of an infertile husband can bear the child of another man.We understand, however, that, unlike the donation of semen, the removalof an ovum would entail a surgical operation.135. We thought it right to draw attention to the possibilities mentionedin the previous paragraph in order to show that the situation for whichA.I.D. is put forward as a solution is only one aspect of the problem ofthe sterile marriage, and to suggest the sort of remedies to which medicalscience may be driven if it is held that the sterility of one partner shouldnot debar the other from the procreation of children.1 See paragraph 57.2 See paragraph 147.3 See (i) the Chapter on &quot; Artificial Insemination &quot; in Glanville Williams&apos; &quot; The Sanctityof Life and the Criminal Law&quot;, which mentions (on page 114) similar experiments withcattle and dogs and (11) Schellen, op. pit., who reports (page 291) the transplantation ofovaries from one woman to another.
WUiether Sterility should be a Ground for Nullity of Marriage^ 136. It has been represented to us that if either husband or wife hasbeen found to be sterile it is preferable for them to be able to ask forthe marriage to be terminated instead of continuing the attempt to procreatechildren even through the agency of a third person. We understand thatin Jewish law there is a provision permitting divorce by mutual consentwhen a marriage remains childless for ten years, on the ground that oneof the chief purposes of marriage procreation of children has not beenfulfilled. It has been suggested to us that the problem of A.I.D. wouldbe eased if a similar provision became law in this country. Jewish lawprovides no means of annulling a marriage, but it seems to us that ifthere were to be such a provision in the law of England, or of Scotland,it would have to be a ground for nullity rather than divorce and it wouldhave to depend on a petition being presented by one of the parties ratherthan on mutual consent, since dissolution of a marriage by mutual consenthas always hitherto been regarded as contrary to the public interest. Itwould mean regarding incapacity to procreate in the same light asincapacity to consummate the marriage. While the proposal is not entirelywithin our terms of reference we think it necessary to consider it at thispoint, because it was put to us as a possible alternative to A.I.D. It is,however, open to two serious objections.137. In the first place, it would be difficult to obtain satisfactoryevidence of sterility. The Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce1considered, amongst several suggested new grounds, a proposal &quot; that itshould be a ground of nullity if before marriage one party had undergonetreatment, medical or surgical, which had rendered him or her physicallyincapable of becoming a parent, and the other party was ignorant of this fact at the time of the marriage.&quot; They observed that in very few cases would the treatment make the person definitely incapable of becoming aparent. In the majority, the result of the treatment would be uncertainand it would not be right to allow such marriages to be annulled becauseof the element of doubt. They thought that grave difficulties and un-happiness might arise if the second category were to be excluded fromrelief and the first category provided for. If, however, sterility can inmany cases be determined with sufficient reliability, on the medicalevidence, to satisfy the court not necessarily that a child could never beprocreated, but that it is highly unlikely, then we are inclined to thinkthat the &quot; element of doubt&quot; referred to by the Royal Commission isnot of itself a decisive objection. The medical evidence cannot establishwith certainty that a marriage is permanently incapable of consummationowing to impotence.138. A more fundamental objection is that the proposal appears toassume that the procreation of children is the principal object of marriage.While it is no doubt an important object, it cannot be regarded in itself as the main object of marriage.2 It is significant that the proposal is basedon a provision of Jewish law, since it is well known that the Jewish religionattaches more importance than the Christian to the need for a marriageto be fruitful.   We think it is true to say that even without children a1 Cmd. 9678, paragraph 271. ::   2 See Lord Jowitt in Weatherley v. Weatherley [1947] A.C. 628.
husband and wife can experience fully the unity of two persons in oa^Aflesh that is the essence of Christian marriage, whereas it is doubtful whethev^they can do so if the sexual act is impossible.139. Furthermore, to make sterility a ground for nullity of marriagewould be unlikely to eliminate the demand for A.I.D. or even to reduceit significantly. We doubt very much whether the couples who seek A.I.D,would wish to end the marriage; it is the wife&apos;s wish that her husbandshould act as the father of the A.I.D. child ; if she wanted to leave her husband in order to bear her own child, she would probably find a wayof doing so under the law as it stands.Accordingly we recommend that the law should not be amended topermit a decree of nullity of marriage to be obtained on the ground ofsterility.E.  Summary140. The views set out in this chapter can be summarised as follows:  (1) We do not approve of the artificial insemination of single womenunder any circumstances (paragraph 113).(2) We recommend that A.I.D. without the husband&apos;s consent shouldbe a new ground for divorce or separation (paragraphs 114-117).(3) While A.I.D. differs from adultery in several important respects, itresembles adultery in; one essential feature: the wife receives theseed of another man ; this goes against what has hitherto been regarded as the essential nature of marriage (paragraphs 118-123).(4) The fact that the wife receives the seed of another man may causeemotional difficulties in her relationship with her husband (paragraphs124-127).(5) It is claimed that A.I.D. is justified by the happiness it brings toan otherwise childless couple; on the other hand, it may be thata couple who are prepared to seek this solution to their problemare unsuited to become parents (paragraphs 128-131).(6) A.I.D. invites consideration of what can be done Where the husbandis fertile and the wife sterile. The attempt to enable one of thespouses to beget a child when the other is sterile implies an excessive concentration on procreation, which is not the principalobject of marriage; we do not recommend that sterility should bemade a ground for nullity of marriage (paragraphs 132-139).CHAPTER VA.I.D.: The ChildA.  Introduction141. The object of A.I.D. is to bring a child into the world. If husband and wife agree to the procedure beforehand, it may be said that theyhave only themselves to blame if, so far as the two of them are concerned,it does not work out as happily as they could have wished. But the child, by the very nature of the procedure, cannot be consulted beforehand.We had therefore to consider the probable consequences of A.I.D. to the
Id and whether legislation to protect hirn from the consequences wasiSslirable. We were conscious in so doing that while the law is reluctant to interfere in the private behaviour of adults the protection of children and young persons is in these days a matter of particular concern toParliament.B.  Possible Dangers to the ChildIntroduction142. We think that difficulties may arise for the child in one of two days: first, because of the personalities of his &quot; parents &quot; and their motivesin seeking A.I.D.; and, secondly, because of the uncertainty of his parentage.The Child&apos;s Relationship with his Mother and her Husband143. We have no doubt that some of those persons who try to obtain a.I.D. are unsuited to be parents, for the reason that the child is to be usedmerely as a means to an end. The end may be to keep together a marriagethat is in danger of falling apart.   Or a child may be desired not for hisj own sake but because the wife does not feel herself to be a &quot;complete&quot;woman until she has experienced childbirth. In this case the wife maycontinue to regard the child after he is born almost as part of herself;if he is unsatisfactory she will blame herself and her confidence will be undermined, with unfortunate results for the child. This situation sometimesoccurs where children are conceived naturally, but we think that with A.I.D.1 the fact that the couple have been seeking a child for a long time mayaccentuate these difficulties when he finally arrives. The child has been somuch wanted that they may become over-possessive.144. On the other hand, it has been put to us that since an A.I.D. child is very much a wanted child he is likely to be particularly welcome and well11 cared for. As one of our witnesses remarked, the child will be &quot; glad tohave been born &quot;. It seemed to us, however, that this might be a rathershort-sighted attitude. While it may be true that such a child would havea happy infancy and childhood, we think that in the long run the circum-stances of his conception must be accounted a handicap rather than an advantage.145. The fact that the husband of an A.I.D. child&apos;s mother is not hisfather means, in the first place, that the child inherits something of thepersonality of the donor. However little, or however much, he in factinherits, he owes something to an unknown third person; both husband and wife will realise this and if the child is unsatisfactory they may attributethis to the donor and accept no responsibility themselves.146. The position of the husband as the child&apos;s supposed father may i be difficult. His fatherhood depends on no Wood relationship between the child and himself. So far as his side of the family is concerned, he cannotlook to the child for any inherited characteristics. His role as fatherderives not from a physical tie but from the fact that he wanted the childand had supported the chikfs mother through her pregnancy and since the birth. The child takes after him only in so far as concerns characteristicsacquired after birth.147. Some of our witnesses have suggested to us that the fact&apos; thatthe husband played no part in the physical conception of the child is of
comparatively minor importance. The biological aspect of fatherhood at tft,,instant of conception is, on this argument, of much less significance thanthat of motherhood, which involves nine months&apos; pregnancy followed bychildbirth. The child is much more closely attached to his mother than tohis father during the first few years of his life. It is mainly when he isable to walk and talk that the father becomes of importance to him, andby that time the husband of a woman who has received A.I.D. will beable to play his part. We can well believe that, in the main, fatherhoodconsists not so much in the original act of intercourse which made conceptionpossible as in the affection and interest which are displayed towards the growing child by the mother&apos;s husband. But if the husband has reasonto believe that he is unlikely to be the biological father we feel that heis liable always to have a sense that something is lacking in the relationship between him and the child.Whether the Couple can Keep the Secret of A.I.D.148. A difficult question with which husband and wife are faced is whether the child should be told of the circumstances of his conception,and whether, if he is not told, he is likely to find out.149. Some witnesses have told us that if the couple are well adjustedthey will gradually forget about their recourse to A.I.D., so that theyend by genuinely believing the child to be fully their own. It has beenput to us, on the other hand, that if this does happen it is due not toforgetfulness but to deliberate suppression of the truth, which may beharmful to family relationships. It has also been said that if the coupleknow that the husband&apos;s chances of fatherhood are remote they will not beable permanently to &quot; live a lie&quot;. Circumstances requiring not merelyavoidance of disclosure but mis-statement of the truth must almost inevitablyarise as the child grows to maturity. While some people will, no doubt,be able to keep such a secret successfully from the child, others may not beable to avoid revealing it, either explicitly by their replies to the chikTsquestions or implicitly by their conduct. We were told that not infrequentlywhen an unmarried couple were living together as man and wife and hada child the fact that they were unmarried came to the child&apos;s notice in spiteof their attempts to keep the secret from him. The infertility of a couplewho had a child by A.I.D. might well have become fairly widely knownbefore hand by reason of their need to go for treatment, and the chikFsarrival would then be an occasion for gossip and suspicion. While somecouples could no doubt be relied on to keep the secret, there would always be the possibility, however reliable the couple, of the child&apos;s hearing ofA.I.D. through circumstances beyond their control.The Effect on the Child of Hearing of his Origin150. The consequences to a dhild (or to a person of any age) of hearingby accident that he was conceived through A.I.D. could be very serious.He would learn, in the first place, that his &quot;parents&quot; had deceived him in allowing him to regard as his father a person who was probably unrelatedto him in blood. We were impressed by the evidence we received, fromwitnesses with long experience of child psychology and child care, of theharm that could be done to a child whose trust in his parents&apos; honestywas betrayed, and we have no doubt that deceit in the matter of A.I.D.
lljuld toe a very grave betrayal of his trust. Secondly, he would realise,*1F he was old enough to appreciate the fact, that he was probably in law illegitimate. He would, however, know that his conception was notthe result of a liaison outside marriage but was deliberately planned byhis mother acting in agreement with her husband. Finally, he would learn that he was conceived, in popular language, &quot;through a test-tube&quot;, a method of conception which is at the present time repugnant to a con-siderable section of the community (although since the method of conceptionis identical with that used in A.I.H., which appears to be generally accepted in this country, the repugnance must be due to the fact that a donor&apos;s seedis used rather than to the actual process of artificial insemination).Whether the Child should be Told151. We were told by the doctors who practised A.I.D. that it was atpresent their custom to advise the couple not to tell the child of hisorigin,1 although some of the doctors looked forward to a time when, ifA.I.D. became more widely accepted, there would be no stigma attachedto it and it could be freely mentioned without danger to the child. It has,however, been strongly represented to us by some witnesses that the childought to be told the facts. It has been put to us that every child has aright to know who his real father is. We think that there are occasionallycircumstances, quite unconnected with A.XD., where the truth may be veryharmful to a child and where on that account his right to know cannotbe accepted. It seems to us that those who argue that a child is entitledas of right to know that he is of A.I.D. origin, even though the knowledgemay do him great harm, are really arguing against the continuance ofA.I.D. rather than in favour of telling the child. A more cogent argumentis that the consequences (to which we referred in the last paragraph) of hisfinding out the truth by accident may be so harmful to him that it is preferable deliberately to inform him.152. Assuming, for the moment, that the child should be told, we have considered when this should be done, by whom and in what terms. Wehave no doubt that the appropriate person would be the mother or her husband. The main difficulty arises in trying to decide what would bethe most suitable age. A.I.D. is a technical matter which a child cannottoe expected to understand at an early age, as he can adoption, and whichhe cannot fully comprehend until he knows, in some detail, what happensin sexual intercourse. Adoptive parents are advised to begin telling the child from a very early age that he was adopted, but we think (Chat itwould be very difficult to explain A.I.D., even in the most general terms,to a child of tender years. If an explanation had to be deferred until alater age, this would extend the period during which a deception was practisedon the child, and would make it the harder for him eventually to acceptthe position. It would also increase the risk of his getting to know byaccident. The technicalities of A.I.D. are such, however, that we thinkthat if the situation had to be explained to the child no attempt shouldbe made to do so during early childhood. Since adolescence is generallyconsidered to be a particularly vulnerable period, this would mean deferringthe explanation until the child became adult. It would not, however, bepossible to suggest a particular age at which it would be appropriate to
inform all A.I.D. children of their origin.   This would depend on circui^1)stances, such as the child&apos;s curiosity and the likelihood of his finding outby accident.153. In the exceptional case where A.I.D. was undertaken because of hereditary disease on the part of the husband, and the child was aware of the disease, it would clearly be desirable that he should know that hewas not related in blood to his supposed father. In such cases the con-siderations to which we referred in the last paragraph, as to the appropriate time for explaining A.I.D., would apply. In other cases, while fullyappreciating the strength of the arguments in favour of informing the child of his origin, we are not conviced that this course would as a rule be inthe child&apos;s best interests. The effect on the child1 might be broadly speaking, the same as if he were to hear of the matter by accident, exceptthat he would know that his &quot; parents &quot; had not intended that he shouldbe permanently deceived. No doubt if the relationship between him, hismother and her husband were a happy one, and the explanation of hisorigin was managed with tact and understanding, the emotional impact ofthe news would be considerably lessened. But, whatever the circumstancesof their revelation, the facts could scarcely be other than disturbing.Conclusion154. We have seen that a married couple who have a child by A.I.D.are faced with a dilemma in considering whether they ought to discloseto him the facts of his origin or whether they should say nothing and run the risk of his suspicions being aroused either by their demeanour or by what he may hear from others. We think that this dilemma emphasises the handicap under which the child of A.I.D. enters the world. If thepractitioner of A.I.D. has chosen well and the mother and her husband are entirely suitable as parents, the child may not suffer in any way. He maybe better off than many ohildren who are conceived in the normal waybut have unsatisfactory parents. But we would not wish to encourage the conception of children, who are likely to suffer harm. With A.I.D. it isimpossible to be certain in any particular case that harm will not cometo the child.  The hazards to which the child is exposed include :(1) Disclosure of his A.I.D. origin.(2) Harmful reaction to such disclosure.(3) Uncertainty of his parentage,(4) Unwise exercise of discretion by the doctor in his choice of donoron moral, physical or mental qualities.(5) Change of attitude on the part of the husband.(6) Change of attitude on the part of the wife.In these matters the advocates of A.I.D. tend to assume the optimumconditions. We feel, therefore, that in the interests of the child alone, apartfrom other reasons discussed later, the practice should be discouraged.155. We have, however, borne in mind that in so far as A.I.D. continueschildren will continue to be brought into the world in this way, and wehave given much thought to ways in which their interests might be safeguarded.
9Whether Proceedings for Nullity of Marriage should be Barred after a.I.D.156. We have already recommended that the birth of a child by A.I.H.should be a bar to proceedings by either spouse for nullity of marriage onthe ground of impotence.1 For the same reasons we consider that it ought not to be possible for a decree of nullity to be granted where a child is born following A.I.D. to which both spouses have consented. While weunderstand that only in a very small proportion of A.I.D. cases has the marriage not been consummated,2 there have, as we have seen, been twosuch cases where a decree of nullity has been sought and granted, in one ofwhich a child had been born as a result of A.I.D.3Accordingly we recommend that the fact that a live child has been bornas a result of artificial insemination of a woman with the seed of a donor,to which the parties to the marriage consented, should he a bar to proceed-ings by either spouse for nullity of marriage on the ground of impotence.D.  The Husband&apos;s Responsibility for the child&apos;s Maintenance157. All members of the Committee agree that a husband who hasconsented to his wife receiving A.I.D. should be required by law to maintainany child who may be born as a result. We have seen4 that in England,assuming that the Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates&apos; Courts) Bill isenacted later this year and that a child born in consequence of A.I.D.to which the husband has consented is considered to have been acceptedby the husband as one of the family, a husband will no longer be ableto evade his responsibilities in this respect. The Bill does not, however,apply to Scotland, where the husband cannot, apart from the jurisdiction of the Court of Session in divorce cases,5 be required to maintain his wife&apos;s illegitimate children. We consider, therefore, that the law ofScotland should be amended in such a way as to make the husband liable for the maintenance of a child born to his wife as a result of A.I.D. towhich he (the husband) has consented.158. We have also considered what might happen if the husband wereto die before the child became of age or if, by reason of some physicalor mental disability, the child was incapable of maintaining himself. InEngland the Inheritance (Family Provisions) Act, 1938, provides that acourt may order payment out of the net estate of a deceased person forthe provision of maintenance for certain of his dependants, including hischildren or adopted children, if he has died intestate or without makingadequate provision for such dependants in his will. We feel that theprinciple that the husband should maintain the A.I.D. child should con-tinue to apply after the husiband&apos;s death, and that the Act of 1938 should therefore be amended6 to make it possible for the child, if necessary, to claim provision for maintenance out of the deceased husband?s estate.1 See paragraphs 104 to 108.2 See paragraph 28.3 See paragraph 71.4 See paragraph 86.5 See paragraph 88.6 It would be in accordance with the principle behind the Matrimonial Proceedings(Children) Act, 1958, for the amendment to cover all children of one spouse accepted as one of the family by the other spouse, but this is outside our terms of reference.     &apos;
159. The Law of Scotland is fundamentally different from the Lawi^,England in this respect. In Scotland a child has a right of legitim^Vshare of the capital of the moveable (personal) estate of his deceased parent)and further rights in the case of intestacy. To give an AID. child aright to legitim would be an innovation which would go much further thanthe English recommendation. An illegitimate child has no rights ofsuccession in either of his parents&apos; estates other than by virtue of theLegitimacy Act, 1926, if his mother dies without legitimate issue, norhas an adopted child any claim on the estates of his adoptive parents.On the other hand it has been held that aliment for an illegitimate childunable to support himself is a debt on a parents testamentary estate forwhich provision may be made in preference to the claims of legitimatechildren in respect of their rights of succession.1 We think it would be undesirable to extend this preference to a consenting husiband&apos;s estateor to make special provision out of that estate for the A.I.D. child inScotland except as part of a wider amendment of the law of succession.We understand that this is at present under review and it may be that an equitable provision similar to that proposed for England will becomeeasier to devise.Meanwhile we recommend that the law of Scotland should be amended so as to require a husband who has consented to the artificial inseminationof his wife with the seed of a donor to maintain during his (the husband&apos;s)lifetime any child who may be born as a result of the insemination, andthat in EaglaBd the child should be entitled to claim that provision for hismainteEasce be made out of the deceased husband&apos;s estate.E.  Whether the Child should be declared to be the Legitimate Child of theHusbandIntroduction160. A more far-reaching proposal, which has been put to us by manywitnesses, is that where the husband has consented to A.I.D. the resultingchild should be declared by law to be the legitimate child of the husband.We have discussed this proposal with nearly all those who have givenevidence before us, and we regard the question whether it should be implemented as one of the most important and difficult which we havehad to consider.Advantages to the Child161. We have no doubt that there is, even in these days, a serioussocial stigma attached to the condition of illegitimacy. If the child of A.I.D.were declared to be legitimate he would at least be relieved of this very real handicap. But it would remain true that he was probably not the son of his supposed father and that his conception was probably due to theinsemination of his mother with the seed of another man. These facts could,we think, be a danger to the child&apos;s security, whatever his legal status.2For this reason it cannot be said that legitimacy would afford him completeprotection, though it would have the important effect of saving him froman additional disability.1 Gloag and Henderson, 6th Edition, page 629.2 See paragraph 150. &quot; &apos;.
IP 162. The status of legitimacy would, it is true, bring the A.I.D. childdefinite material advantages. He would, for instance, have a claim onthe estate of his mother&apos;s husband, if the husband died intestate.1 It may,indeed, be thought illogical that we should recommend that the childshould be able to look to his mother&apos;s husband for maintenance duringthe husband&apos;s lifetime, and, in England, if necessary out of his estateafter death, but should have no other claim on the estate if the husbandmakes no will or chooses not to mention him in his will. We think,however, that a clear distinction can be drawn between an entitlement to maintenance, without which the child might suffer real hardship, andan entitlement to a further share in the estate. The consenting husbandcan usually provide for the A.I.D. child if he so wishes, and if it weredesired to provide that the A.I.D. child should have a claim on the husband&apos;s estate in the event of his dying intestate, this could be done(by amendment of the law of intestate succession) without amendment ofthe law defining the status of legitimacy.Interference with Hereditary Succession163. If the child of A.I.D. were declared to be legitimate, the consequentdevolution of entailed property, titles and dignities of honour might provide an additional motive for resort to A.I.D. This would, of course,be against the interests of those persons who would otherwise have succeeded in default of a legitimate child being born to the husband as aresult of normal conception. It would also, we think, be against theinterests of society as a whole. Succession through blood descent is animportant element of family life and as such is at the basis of our society.On it depend the peerage and other titles of honour, and the Monarchyitself. The Monarchy has not always proceeded by direct descent, butthe exceptions only serve to illustrate how much reliance was placed ondescent through blood and how much was done to maintain the position that even an apparent usurper should be closely related to the previousSovereign. The view has been put to us that for a child of A.I.D., andhis descendants, to succeed to a hereditary title through his mother&apos;shusband would not only be an injustice to persons who were related inblood to the first holder of the title ; it would also be an imposition onthe Sovereign and a frustration of his original intention in granting aprivileged status not merely to an individual, but to a family or group of persons who for ever after could trace a legitimate descent in bloodfrom the grantee. However small the incidence of A.I.D., we do not feelthat these consideration ought to be overlooked.164. In so far as dignities and titles of honour are conferred by the sovereign, succession to them stands on a rather different footing fromthe devolution of property. Similar considerations might apply, however,if an A.I.D. child took an interest in property coming to him through his presumed father and which would not otherwise do so. This couldhappen in the case of inheritance from an intestate relative, for example paternal grandparent or uncle or aunt, or in the case of a dispositionmade by any such relative without knowledge of the A.I.D. birth.
Comparison with Adopted and Legitimated Persons ^); I165. No doubt for the reasons given in the last two paragraphs Parlia-ment has provided1 that in England neither adopted nor legitimatedpersons may succeed to dignities or titles of honour, in spite of the factthat a legitimated person is, and an adopted person may be, related inblood to his mother&apos;s husband. These two classes of persons are alsoprecluded from taking an interest in property which is subject to a disposition made before the date of the adoption order2 or coming intooperation before the date of legitimation. When a person has beenlegitimated or legally adopted, the fact is officially recorded, and could therefore be known to any person making a testamentary dispositionthereafter. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in all subsequentdispositions the adopted or legitimated person is accepted as fully amember of the family, unless he is expressly excluded in the disposition.166. We think it follows from the provisions relating to adopted andlegitimated children, to which we have just referred, that it would be inequitable for an A.I.D. child, in the capacity of a legitimate child ofhis mother&apos;s husband, to succeed to a title or dignity of honour, or totake an interest in property under a disposition made before his birth.Legitimacy as an Encouragement of A.I.D.167. It has been suggested to us that to declare the A.I.D. child to belegitimate would merely be to &quot; regularise &quot; what is understood to be thesituation at the present time. As we have seen, the presumption oflegitimacy has never yet been challenged in this country in the case of anA.I.D. child, and in most cases it would be very difficult to do so.3 Becauseof this, those who have conceived children through A.I.D. have done soin the knowledge that it is most unlikely that the child&apos;s illegitimacy willever be brought to light. But the child&apos;s legal status remains the samewhether or not it is ever officially established. If on other grounds itwould be wrong for him to have the status of a legitimate child the factthat in practice it is difficult to prevent his enjoying the advantages ofapparent legitimacy is not a sufficient reason for converting appearanceinto reality. To declare that henceforth the child shall be legitimate would amount to more than a recognition of the status quo. Those who are atpresent concerned with A.I.D. would no longer have to weigh the chances,albeit remote, of the child&apos;s illegitimacy being brought to light; they could proceed in the knowledge that at least his legal status oould not beimpugned. Others, who had hitherto been deterred from seeking A.I.D.because of the possibility that the child might some day be bastardised,would be deterred no longer. The practice of A.I.D. would be likely toincrease.168. Many witnesses have told us that if it is accepted that whateveris thought of the practice of A.I.D. children will continue to be conceivedin this way, and that the protection of such children is of primary importance,4 this is in itself a sufficient reason for granting to the children the status of legitimacy.   According to this view, whatever objectionsi Adoption Act, 1958, section 16; Legitimacy Act, 1926, sections 3 and 10. In Scotland,an adopted person has no rights of inheritance other than through this natural parents.2 Section 17 (2) of the Act of 1958 provides that for this purpose a disposition made bywill or codicil shall be treated as having been made on the date of the death of the testator3 Paragraph 81.4 See paragraph 155.
Jpere are to the practice of A.I.D. ought not to weigh in the balanceagainst the interests of the child. We fully recognise the force of this argument, but we think that it exaggerates the degree of security thatlegitimacy would give to the child,1 and that it tends to forget the encouragement it would afford to A.I.D. It is true that while no one would wish to encourage adultery or fornication, it is nevertheless recog-nised that any children born as a result should not be made to sufferunnecessarily for the misdeeds of their parents, and provision has therefore been made, in the Legitimacy Acts of 1926 and 1959, for the children ofsuch unions to be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents.But the object of fornication or adultery is not normally to beget a child,and we think it is probably true to say that the possibility that the children,if any, may later be legitimated is not an appreciable encouragement of extra-marital intercourse. The object of A.I.D., on the other hand, is,specifically, to produce a child. To give that child the status of legitimacyis to give a significant degree of official encouragement to the practice ofA.I.D. Since we do not feel that it is in the interests of any child to beconceived in this way,2 we cannot support a proposal that would tend toencourage the practice, even though it may appear to be of some benefitto those children who are so conceived. The responsibility for any dis-advantage the child may suffer must rest primarily with the husband and wife who decide on A.I.D., and not with the State.Conclusion169. We recognise that the law on legitimacy has during the last thirty-five years twice been modified to enable children to be legitimated whowould otherwise be illegitimate. But the changes brought about by theLegitimacy Acts of 1926 and 1959 merely made it possible for childrenborn to a man and woman who were not at the time of the child&apos;s birthmarried to each other and who later married, or whose marriage wasvoid, to become the legitimate or legitimated children of that man andwoman. To make A.I.D. children legitimate would be an entirely new departure. They would be the only class of legitimate children not relatedin blood to the mother&apos;s husband. It is true that they would have becomelegitimate if a proposed new clause had been added to the LegitimacyBill of 1959, whereby &quot; any child born to a married woman, and accepted as one of the family by her husband,&quot; would have been deemed to be a child of the marriage. But this clause was withdrawn after a shortdebate,3 and we have no reason to suppose that opinion in Parliament orin the country would, in general, be in favour of so far-reaching a changein the concept of legitimacy. Nor do we ourselves consider that such achange would be justified in the interests of A.I.D. children alone. It wassuggested to us that a community which was prepared to tolerate A.I.D.had a duty to protect the interests of the resultant children. As illegitimatechildren are tolerated by the community in the sense that the act by whichthey are conceived is not made criminal, this argument would suggest the removal of all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children.We are not prepared to accept an argument with such far-reachingImplications.1 See paragraph 161. no^-2 See paragraph 154.3 House of Commons, Official Report, 8th May, 1959, col. 760.
170. The simple question of principle is whether a child may become^Xthe legitimate issue of those who are not his natural parents. That seemsto be a contradiction in terms and the invasion of standards acceptedfrom time immemorial. It would be the introduction of a new conceptwhich alters the meaning of parentage. Rights may be given to adoptedor A.I.D. children, but that cannot make them the offspring of the mother&apos;smarriage. The word may be altered, but the facts cannot be. What issuggested is a new meaning of the term legitimate. Hitherto extensions of the meaning have still left intact the requirement that a legitimate child is a child born of parents who were or who have become married or whohave gone through a ceremony of marriage. There are two requirements,parentage and marriage. The change proposed is one which would alternot only the status of the A.I.D. child, but also that of all children nowdescribed as legitimate, since marriage of the father and mother would no longer be necessary for the status they now enjoy.171. The reasons why we are not prepared to recommend that a childborn as a result of A.I.D. to which the husband has consented should be declared to be the legitimate child of the husband can be summarisedas follows: -(1) While the proposal would relieve the child of the stigma ofillegitimacy, it would not give him complete security since hewould still be liable to discover that he was probably not,biologically, the child of his supposed father (paragraph 161).(2) It would bring the child certain material advantages, but it mightbe a serious encroachment on the rights of other members of the husband&apos;s family and would interfere with the principle of hereditary succession which is at the basis of our society (para-graphs 162-166).(3) It would constitute a degree of official encouragement of A.I.D.and the consequent birth of children exposed to dangers to whichchildren should not be exposed (paragraphs 167-168).(4) It would involve an unprecedented change in the concept oflegitimacy (paragraphs 169 and 170).F.   Whether the Child should be adopted by his Mother and her Husband172. Since in our view the arguments against making the A.I.D. childthe legitimate child of the husband are decisive, we have had to considerwhether there is any other legal status which could properly be givento the offspring of A.I.D. The comparison which we have already made1with the provisions relating to adopted and legitimated children suggeststhat something similar might be appropriate for A.I.D. children.173. It has been put to us by several witnesses that the child of A.I.D.ought to be adopted by his mother and her husband, or ought to bedeemed to have been adopted by them. It can be said that since anA.I.D. child is a child of the wife of the marriage he should not have a status &quot; inferior &quot; to that of an adopted child, neither of whose adoptersneed be his natural parents.
v^/174. There is nothing, in the law as it stands at present, to preventthe mother of an A.I.D. child and her husband from applying \p a court for an adoption order, but the court would be faced with a curioussituation. Adoption proceedings therefore involve the exercise by a courtof a statutory discretion (whether to make or not to make an adoptionorder, or whether to make an interim order), which is exercisable even when one of the applicants is a parent of the child. The establishmentof the status of a child conceived by A.I.D. would not, however, involvethe exercise of any comparable discretion. The situation could be corn-pared with the adoption jointly by a husband and his wife of an illegitimatechild born to the wife as a result of natural conception.1 But if the childhas been naturally conceived, the court will be aware that there is anotherman, probably known to the mother, who is the father of the child andwho may, if he is available, be heard by the court on the question whether an adoption order should be made. With A.I.D., the natural father isnot available. Moreover, if there is any likelihood that the husband isin fact the father the court may feel that adoption is pointless.175. A recommendation that the couple should apply for an adoptionorder would, in any case, be unlikely to be effective. They are likely to&apos;be deterred from doing so by the thought that the child, and other people,might well get to know that he was born illegitimate. In Scotland the child would be able to get the particulars from the Registrar-General onattaining the age of 17, and in England it would not be very difficult to trace the original entry of birth if certain details were known. bearing that mind that at present the couple are prepared to register the child atbirth as legitimate, regardless of the law, it seems unlikely that they wouldbe willing to risk a procedure which might reveal the child&apos;s illegitimacy.Furthermore, unless the child was represented as the illegitimate child ofthe mother, the mother would have to deny her motherhood in order togive the impression that the child was genuinely adopted from outsidethe family. When we add to this the suspicion that might arise amongneighbours and relatives on hearing that a child apparently conceived andborn in wedlock was being brought up as an adopted, child, it becomesclear that adoption is not the solution.176. We have considered whether, since the normal procedure of legaladoption would not be appropriate, a modified form of procedure mightbe applied, whereby an A.I.D. child to whom the husband had consentedmight be deemed to have been adopted at birth. In this way a formaladoption order would be dispensed with, and the birth would be registeredat once in the Adopted Children Register. But such a procedure is opento the objection that it is not adoption at all. Adoption is an act of selection and acceptance of an individual in a sense in which the begettingof a child, whether by A.I.D. or otherwise, is not. Moreover the absenceof an original entry in the ordinary registers of birth might itself arousesuspicions.1 Some 3,000 children a year are adopted by their natural mother and her husband, notbeing the father; but it is likely that in many of these cases the mother and her husbandwere not married to each other at the time of the child&apos;s birth.
177. In short, we consider that to apply the procedure of legal adopti^*in any form, to A.I.D. children would be inappropriate because the situation of adopted children is quite different, and unacceptable to the &quot;parents&quot;because it would reveal the A.I.D. child&apos;s illegitimacy.G.   Whether the Child should have a separate status, ascertainable by reference to a secret record178. Another proposal, to which we have given much attention, is that,while not being described as &quot; adopted &quot; or &quot; legitimated&quot;, a child bornof A.I.D. to which his mother&apos;s husband had consented might have a statussimilar to that belonging to adopted and legitimated children, as regardssuch matters as entitlement to property and succession to hereditaryhonours.1 It would appear to be in the interests of the A.I.D. child tobe granted what would amount to a limited form of legitimacy, ratherthan to remain illegitimate, and the present status of adopted children under English Law suggests that it is now accepted that children who may be unrelated in blood to either spouse may be accorded many of therights which formerly belonged only to the legitimate children of thespouses. We have accordingly considered in some detail whether means could be devised which would ensure that the A.I.D. child, though legiti-mate in other respects, was debarred from titles, dignities of honour andcertain property which might otherwise come to him as the legitimatechild of his mother&apos;s husband.179. The fact that a person has been adopted or legitimated is ascer-tainable by reference to the registers of births, and we feel sure that itwould be pointless for the law to accord a somewhat similar status to a child of A.I.D. unless some means were provided whereby interested parties could establish his A.I.D. origin. Otherwise, we have no doubt,in view of the privacy in which A.I.D. has hitherto taken place, that anyspecial provisions relating to such matters as succession to titles would be largely without effect.180. For this purpose it would be desirable that there should be a record of births due to A.I.D. Since, however, as we have seen,2 it wouldin many cases be difficult to establish that the child had been born as aresult of A.I.D., it would scarcely be feasible to compile such a record.In most cases, the only indisputable fact would be that the child&apos;s motherhad been inseminated with the seed of a donor, and the only reliablerecord would therefore be a list of women who had received artificial insemination with the seed of a donor. In the interests of the child, whosestatus would depend on the fact that the husband had consented, the record would also have to include evidence of his consent. If a conception,and subsequently a birth occurred which was considered to be due toA.I.D., this information would add to the usefulness of the record ; butthe person who would be required to supply information for the recordwould no doubt be the doctor who had administered A.I.D., and he wouldnot necessarily be aware of a subsequent conception or birth. The only way of establishing a certain record of the child&apos;s paternity would be torequire the provision of very detailed particulars of the blood groups of1 See paragraph 166.2 Paragraph 81.
\Jb husband, the donor and the child, but we doubt whether this wouldoe acceptable to the parties. A record of the insemination of the wifewith her husband&apos;s consent would be sufficient to initiate further enquiry,though the enquiry would of course be fruitless in the cases whereinsemination had not been successful.181. It seemed to us that, if this proposal were adopted, the appropriate authority to maintain a record of the type outlined in the previous paragraph would be the Registrar General. In view of the harm thatmight be done to the child by the disclosure of the facts, it would clearly be essential that the record should not be open to public inspection orsearch and that the Registrar General should not furnish any person withany information in it except under an order of a competent court, onthe analogy, in England, of the special registers and books which hemaintains1 for the purpose of making traceable the connection betweenany entry in the registers of births which has been marked &quot; Adopted&quot;and any corresponding entry in the Adopted Children Register.182. The maintenance by the Registrar General of a confidential record of A.I.D. would, however, give rise to a difficulty about the form in whichthe birth of the child should be recorded in the public register of births.The object of the confidential record would in effect be to help to prove that the child was not for all purposes the legitimate child of the mother&apos;shusband, for the reason that the husband was not his father. On the otherhand, it would be of very little advantage to the child to be deemedlegitimate for any purpose if the mother&apos;s husband could not be recorded as the father in the public register. Thus the particulars in the confidentialrecord would tend to contradict those in the public register, and this wouldbe liable to undermine the whole principle of registration and to lead thepublic to conclude that it did not matter much whether they gave incorrectinformation to the registrar. A conflict between the two records could not doubt be avoided if it were provided by law that for the purposes of birth registration the husband of the mother of an A.I.D. child were tobe deemed to be the child&apos;s father. Such a provision would, however,be a departure from the hitherto accepted principle of birth registration,that the form of entry in the public register should give some indication of the general legal relationship between child and &quot; father &quot;, and would obviously detract from the usefulness of the register. Unless, therefore,the husband could be regarded as the father for all purposes there wouldbe serious objections to his being entered as the father on the publicregister of births.2183. If, in spite of the objections referred to in the previous paragraph,a confidential record of A.I.D. were established, a court would no doubtgrant access to the record only to persons who could show a genuineinterest i.e. those who were concerned with succession to a title or dignityof honour or with certain property. Whether an application for access tothe register would in fact be made in the appropriate cases seems doubtful.1 Adoption Act, 1958, section 20 (4).2 The problem could, of course, be solved by providing that in all cases the particulars tobe given on registration of birth should relate to the &apos; mother&apos;s husband &apos; rather than to the&apos; father&apos;. But we do not think that the practice of A.I.D. would justify so fundamental achange in the law of birth registration which would greatly reduce the value of the registeras a record of paternity.
in the case of adopted or legitimated persons reference to their full bir%1;certificates would normally lead to recognition of their true status, andwould thus prevent their succession, for instance, to entailed property towhich they were not entitled. Unless there was some reason to suspectA.I.D. origin, there would usually be no occasion for recourse to the confidential record. It would scarcely be justifiable to attempt to establish a record of all cases of A.I.D., unless there was a reasonable likelihood that the record would be consulted in appropriate cases.184. A more important objection to the establishment of any record of A.I.D. is that there would be no satisfactory method of ensuring thatthe record was complete. The particulars of all legal adoptions areautomatically recorded in the Adopted Children Register in consequenceof a direction to the Registrar General by the court making the adoptionorder. The status of a legitimated person is conferred by the marriage ofhis natural parents,1 and there is an incentive to re-register the birth toremove the stigma of illegitimacy which might otherwise attach to theoriginal registration. In the case of A.I.D. the Registrar General wouldhave to depend entirely on the information provided by the doctor. bearing that mind that one of the main objects of the record would be to preventevasion of the law restricting the rights of A.I.D. children, it seems very likely that persons who wished to evade the law would try to ensure thatthere was no official record of the administration of A.I.D. rather thanthat information was provided in the hope that an application would never be made for access to the record. Failure to provide information would mean that there was no official record of the husband&apos;s consent,and it is conceivable that he might later deny that he had given consentand that the child would be bastardised. But the parties might well beprepared to take this risk. Thus it is probable that the record would beincomplete at the very point where it was most needed.185. Finally, if and when the record was used for the purpose ofdisputing a person&apos;s claim to a title or to property, that person wouldlearn not only that his claim was probably unfounded but also that hewas probably conceived as a result of A.I.D., and this could, as we have seen,2 have a disturbing effect on him, particularly if he were not ofmature years. In this way the consequence of giving him some of therights of a legitimate child and officially recording the fact of A.I.D. mightbe to put him in a worse position than if there were no official recordand he had no special rights. Furthermore, the existence of a record,however confidential, which purported to list all cases of A.I.D. couldnot but increase the danger of any A.I.D. child getting to know of hisorigin. This in itself would be likely to make the parties reluctant toprovide information for the record.186. We have dealt at some length with the suggestion that a con-fidential record of A.I.D. might be established for the purpose of preventingan A.I.D. child from succeeding to a title or dignity of honour or takingan interest in certain property. It appeared to some of us at an early stage in our enquiry that this might be the solution of the dilemma in1 Legitimacy Act, 1926, section 1 (1), as amended by the Legitimacy Act, 1959.2 See paragraph 150.
Mich the A.I.D. child is placed: on the one hand, it is not in his interestsmat his origin should be revealed to the world ; on the other hand, it maybe in the interests of other people, and of society, that they should know of his origin. Having carefully examined the suggestion in discussion with many witnesses and in deliberation amongst ourselves, we are satisfiedthat it does not solve the problem. Our reasons for reaching this conclusioncan be summarised as follows:(1) The record would not, by itself, be conclusive proof that a birthwas the result of A.I.D. (paragraph 180).(2) It would be undesirable to create a secret register the main purposeof which would be in effect to provide evidence that the publicregister might contain incorrect information (paragraph 182).(3) It is unlikely that the record would often be consulted when itwas needed (paragraph 183).(4) It would be incomplete (paragraph 184).(5) It would be an additional threat to the child&apos;s security (para-graph 185).H.   Conclusion187. We think that the objections listed above would apply to anyproposal to give A.I.D. children a separate defined status. If a class ofpersons with a separate legal status is created, there must be some provision for enabling interested parties to discover whether a particularperson falls within that class. If it is also required that the fact thata person is within the class should remain a secret from society, societyhas no effective means of determining who is within the class. Since wedo not feel that A.I.D. children ought to be declared to be the legitimateoffspring of the husband, and since there are good reasons for not equatingthem with adopted children, our conclusion is that no amendment shouldbe made to the law of legitimacy or to the law relating to the registration of birth. We recognise that the effect of our conclusion would be that,in so far as the praotice of A.I.D. continued, children conceived in thisway might continue to be registered at birth as the legitimate children ofthe husband, and presented to society as such. But such children mustconstitute a very small group indeed when compared with the number ofadulterine children whose illegitimacy is never detected. Society does not wish to encourage adultery but has not considered it necessary to ensurethat the offspring of adultery by one spouse who are accepted by theother spouse as children of the family are not in practice regarded as the legitimate children of both. In this respect, at least, the analogy betweenadultery and A.I.D. is appropriate.1 We believe that it is in the interestsof children that A.I.D. should not be encouraged, and we do not thinkit inconsistent with this view to refrain from making any recommendationabout the legal status of children conceived in this way.Accordingly we recommend that there should be no amendment ofthe laws relating to legitimacy or registration of birth.
A.I.D.: The DonorA.  The Donor&apos;s Motives and Temperament188. Many of our witnesses have questioned the motives of personswho act as donors of semen, and it is an aspect of the practice which we ourselves have not found easy to understand. There is no evidence beforeus that any of those who have hitherto agreed to act in this capacityhave done so for motives of financial gain.1 They may well have agreedout of a desire to help the practitioner and to help couples who seekchildren through A.I.D. This was said to apply in particular where thedonor&apos;s wife had previously been cured of infertility by the A.I.D. prac-titioner, and the donor had a sense of gratitude towards the practitioner.If the donor is a friend of the practitioner his personal relationship withhim will, of course, be a factor. If he is also in the medical professionhe may donate because he wants to help a colleague. It would, however,be clearly undesirable for use to be made in this way of medical students2or doctors who are in close association with the practitioner of A.I.D. Theformer are of an age when they might be too easily persuaded of thedesirability of A.I.D., while if it were known that the latter were regularlyused it might make it easier to identify the donors.189. It has been represented to us that a donor is, in a sense, serving the community, by helping to bring a child into the world, just as the blooddonor serves the community by helping to save life. It is not our purpose in this chapter to discuss whether the community is well served by the encouragement of A.I.D., but we think that the suggested comparison withthe donation of blood does point to one of the main objections to A.I.D.The usefulness of a blood donor consists only in the blood which he gives.Provided that his blood is of the right group and compatibility and conveysno potential source of disease, his other attributes, physical or mental,are of no relevance. The donor of semen, on the other hand, is selectednot merely because he can provide fertile semen, but also because he isthought to possess personal qualities which make him particularly fitted to act as the biological father of a child or children to be born to oneor more women. Whether it is, or should be, the function of a doctorto make such a selection is a matter we discuss in the following chapter.At this stage we are merely concerned to question whether a man whois prepared to accept the role of donor, without ever seeing the motherof the child who, it is hoped, will be conceived through his agency, can have a proper sense of his responsibilities towards that child or towardssociety.190. The role of donor would be repugnant to many men because it involves masturbation. Others would not feel that they were doing any-thing in the least objectionable. Masturbation is a recognised methodof producing specimens of semen for medical analysis, and no doubt thedonors who have attended the practitioners own infertility clinics have become accustomed to providing the practitioner with specimens in thisway.   But masturbation is accompanied by emotional activity.   So long1 See paragraph 34.2 See Appendix I, paragraph 45.
is carried out for the purpose of A.I.H. or the investigation of thefertility of husband and wife, it may be said that the emotions are directed towards achieving a child of the marriage. But when it is for the purposeof A.I.D. this consideration no longer applies. There may well be donorswho, without reflecting much, are gratified by what they are doing becausethey believe that it will make somebody happy. Others must, we think,realise that they are performing a function which properly belongs to the husband of a marriage other than their own.191. We have received no information which suggests that the donorswho have hitherto been used by A.I.D. practitioners in this country are other than normal well-balanced men, actuated by motives which appearto them entirely worthy. But we feel that the role of donor is of sucha kind that it is liable to appeal to the abnormal and unbalanced. As a leading psychiatrist put it to us, it is an activity which might be expectedto attract more than the usual proportion of psychopaths. If such menwere to be accepted as donors the dangers to the A.I.D. children soconceived are obvious. Whether the lack of responsibility which, in ourview, is likely to characterise the process of donation of semen, howeverwell-balanced the donor may otherwise be, is liable to be passed on tothe child must, however, be open to doubt. The selection of a donor whoappears to be free, so far as possible, from the undesirable characteristicsto which we have drawn attention, is solely the responsibility of thepractitioner of A.I.D., and the difficulty of making such a selection is,we think, another reason for discouraging A.I.D.B.  The Effect on the Donor&apos;s Marriage192. We have considered what effect donation of semen may have onthe donor&apos;s marriage. We have been told that many men have declined to act as donors because their wives have objected. We can well under-stand that many wives would object to their husbands being responsiblefor the conception by other women of children who would be the half-brothers or half-sisters of the children of the donor&apos;s own marriage. Otherwives may consider, rightly or wrongly, that donation would adversely affect 4he marriage relationship. There is, however, no reason why normalrelations between husband and wife should be in the least affected, andif the wife is also in sympathy with A.I.D. it may well be that no difficulties arise. Whatever the emotional significance of donation, it does not involve an attachment to another woman, since the woman who receives A.I.D.is unknown to the donor. For this reason, one or two of our witnesseshave suggested to us that the fact that a man acts as a donor is of noconcern to his wife and that he need not ask her permission before agreeing to become a donor or even inform her that he has done so. While we appreciate that this is very much a matter which married couples should decide for themselves, it is clear that if the donor consults his wife at thebeginning and takes her advice the likelihood of disagreement on thissubject between husband and wife at a later stage is much reduced. the wife may not accept that donation would take nothing away from the marriage relationship, and if that is her attitude a husband who does notascertain her wishes or acts in defiance of them may place the happinessof the marriage in jeopardy.59
193. No doubt for the reasons mentioned in the preceding paragn^the Law Society suggested to us1 that failure on the part of a donor toobtain his wife&apos;s consent to his acting as a donor should be a new ground for divorce, at the instance of the wife. While, as we have indicated, wewould agree that, in so far as A.I.D. continues, the consent of the donor&apos;swife should be obtained, we are unable to support this suggested amend-ment of the law. In the first place, we doubt whether public opinion would regard the husband&apos;s conduct as sufficiently serious to justify its being made a new ground for divorce. If the husband persisted in hisactions knowing of his wife&apos;s objections and disregarded any adverse effecton her health, no doubt under the existing law she could take proceedings for divorce on the ground of cruelty. There seems no good reason why anew ground should be introduced merely because in what would nodoubt be the less serious cases the husband&apos;s conduct would not beconsidered sufficiently damaging to the wife&apos;s health to justify divorceon the ground of cruelty.194. Secondly, we think that difficulties might arise in defining the newground for divorce. For instance it would be necessary to consider whatdegree of consent would suffice to prevent the wife from proceeding ;whether consent should be inferred from acquiescence with full knowledgeof the facts ; and whether consent could be given subject to a condition as to the number of donations or the length of time over which they weregiven, or whether it should be given separately for each donation. Itwould seem manifestly unfair to allow a divorce to be granted in respectof one donation only for which consent had not been obtained.195. Finally, difficult problems of proof are likely to arise ; such as, forinstance, whether semen was given for medical analysis or for A.I.D.Accordingly, we recommend that the law should not be amended toenable a wife to take proceedings for divorce on the ground that her husband has donated semen for the purpose of A.I.D. without obtainingher consent.C.   Conclusion196. It will be seen that we consider that there are dangers associatedwith donation of semen, both as to the type of men who may be preparedto act as donors and their lack of responsibility in doing so, and as tothe effects which donation may have on the A.I.D. child and, in some circumstances, on the donor&apos;s relationship with his wife. For this reason,amongst others, we deprecate the practice of A.I.D.CHAPTER VIIA.I.D.: The Medical PractitionerA.   Introduction197. We consider in this chapter whether A.I.D. is a procedure whicha medical practitioner can properly undertake: whether, in the first place,he has the necessary qualifications for the selection of applicants fori In a memorandum submitted to us in June, 1959, which has been published in the law society&apos;s Annual Report for 1959-60, at pages 50-58. We were informed that the law society of Scotland concurred in the recommendations contained in the memorandum.. &quot;in
slpD- and donors ; and secondly, whether, on more general grounds,ATI.D. can be justified as a branch of medical practice.B.   Qualifications suggested for the Practitioner of A.I.D.Introduction198. The British Medical Association1 have expressed the view that&quot;the actual technique of insemination is of the nature of a minor surgicalprocedure, but ... the selection of suitable couples and donors, andtheir investigation for fitness, necessitates considerable knowledge in thefield of gynaecology, male infertility, psychological medicine and humangenetics.&quot;r The information which we have received in the course of our inquiry has confirmed that a practitioner who engages in A.I.D. shouldhave knowledge in all these fields.Gynaecology and Male Infertility.199. The requirement that the practitioner should have knowledge inthe fields of gynaecology and male infertility needs little elaboration. Wewere impressed by what we heard of the difficulty of determining, wherea marriage is involuntarily childless, whether the fault lies with the husband,the wife, or both. Many couples seek A ID. before the wife has been adequately investigated2 and we were told that not infrequently bothhusband and wife were found to possess a degree of infertility whichwould suggest that A.I.D. was unlikely to be successful.200: On the male side, if is, as we have seen,3 very rarely possible tosay with complete confidence that a man is permanently incapable ofbegetting a child. This means that in most cases where a decision isreached to undertake A.I.D. the practitioner should explain to the couplethat the possibility that they may subsequently have a natural child cannotbe entirely ruled out. While this possibility may be of some psychologicalcomfort to the couple who like to feel that a child born following A.I.D.may nevertheless be the husband&apos;s child, we think that it must make thedecision whether to undertake A.I.D. a more difficult one both for themedical practitioner and for the couple. The remedy which was to havebeen used as a last resort may occasionally prove to have been used too soon. We have already mentioned4 that we were informed of a numberof instances of children having been begotten by men possessing a degreeof infertility that would be held by some practitioners to justify A.I.D.Not infrequently a couple conceive a child by natural means after havingadopted one ; in such a case the husband and wife stand in an equalrelationship to both children, the first &quot;belonging&quot; physically to neither of them and the second to both. This is not so if an AID. child isfollowed by a natural child. According to the evidence we have received,in this country A.I.D. has not so far been undertaken when the husbandhad only a moderate degree of oligospermia. But it cannot be denied thatif, because of lack of knowledge on the part of the practitioner or for anyother reason, there were in the future to be a departure from the standards which we understand have hitherto been maintained, there could well bean increase in the practice of .A.I.D.5i See paragraph 21. 4 Page 11, footnote 2.2 See paragraph 44. 5 See also paragraph 58.3 Paragraph 26.6r
Human genetics (\^)201. It is clearly necessary for the practitioner to have some knowledgeof human genetics, both in order to deal with the rare cases wherehereditary disease in the husband&apos;s family may be considered an indicationfor A.I.D.,1 and so that he can recognise the minor trends which would suggest the possibility that a donor might be carrying certain hereditarydiseases. For (the latter purpose, he would have to enquire not onlyinto the donor&apos;s own medical history but into that of his family forseveral preceding generations. If careful enquiries are made about thedonor&apos;s heredity, the risk to the child is probably less than where a child is born as a result of natural conception, but with natural conception the doctor cannot be held responsible for the development of geneticabnormalities in the child.Psychological Medicine and other Matters202. We consider skill in the field of psychological medicine to beas important as any of the four qualifications mentioned by the british medical Association,2 and the most difficult to apply in relation to A.I.D.It is on the exercise of his skill in this field that the practitioners selection of suitable couples and donors largely depends. It was represented to us that the practitioner need not be a qualified psychiatrist, but that heshould have sufficient knowledge of the subject to be able to eliminate theunbalanced, either as donors or as applicants for A.I.D., and should also have had some experience in advising patients on marital problems.203. In so far as concerns selection of donors, we consider that anessential requirement would be ability to recognise those who werepsychologically unfitted for the task. But in dealing with applicants forA.I.D. a more positive approach and more far-reaching enquiries wouldbe needed. The practitioner has to try to determine not only whetherthe marriage is at present stable, but whether it is likely to remain soafter the birth of an A.I.D. child. He has to try to envisage the circum-stances in which the child will grow up, five, ten or fifteen years later.It seems to us that this is a matter which may well not be within theA.I.D. practitioners ordinary practice and skills. He can of course seekassistance from other sources. Many cases come to him from the family doctor, who may be able to provide a full report on the couple&apos;s homecircumstances. If the family doctor requires further advice, it is opento him to call in a specialist for example, a psychiatrist or to consultresponsible lay persons who know the couple better than he does. Iffhe himself is not familiar with the home circumstances it might be advisable for him to arrange for a trained and experienced social workeito visit the home. In certain respects the sort of enquiries that are made inadoption cases, for the purpose of establishing whether a couple wouldmake suitable adoptive parents, would also be relevant when A.I.D. was contemplated.204. It will be appreciated, however, that the type of investigationsuggested in the last paragraph would be dependent on two conditions ; first,on the co-operation of the doctors concerned, and particularly of the3 See paragraph 24.4 See paragraph 198.
(jpiy doctor, and secondly on their being fully aware of the-sort ofirirormation the enquiries were aiming to elicit. In many cases the first -of these conditions could not be fulfilled since we understand that a con-siderable proportion of the medical profession regards A.I.D. as unethical,and while some who would not themselves agree to A.I.D. might beprepared to provide information for the A.I.D. practitioner, others wouldnot. Fulfilment of the second condition would depend very much on theabilities of the doctor concerned and on the time and facilities at his disposal. Furthermore, a couple who were seeking A.I.D. might objectstrongly to anything in the nature of widespread enquiries being made into their suitability as parents, feast their intentions should become public knowledge. For all these reasons, we understand that in practice it is often left to the A.I.D. practitioner alone to determine whether a coupleare in every way fitted to have a child by AID., and in view of the considerations to which we referred in the last paragraph we do notthink that such a practitioner is usually in a position to perform this very important task. Indeed, we doubt whether these matters can be adequately dealt with by a medical practitioner.C.   Whether A.LD. is a Therapeutic Procedure205. We have discussed with many of our witnesses whether A.I.D.can properly be regarded as a &quot; therapeutic &quot; procedure. It is sometimesrepresented as a &quot; cure&quot; for childlessness--the only cure where child-lessness is due to the husband&apos;s infertility. This view overlooks the factthat the husband&apos;s infertility is not usually cured by the wife&apos;s recourse to donated semen ; he remains infertile. As we have seen, the justificationclaimed for A.I.D. is that husband and wife earnestly desire a childborn to the wife, and not that either of them is suffering from any formof physical or mental disability, apart from the husiband&apos;s infertility. Inthis respect, A.I.D. appears to us to differ from most other forms of medical treatment. Certain forms of treatment may, however, be given not todeal with any specific physical or mental disability but in the interestsof the patienfs general well-being. Thus some practitioners take theview that A.I.D. is therapeutic because it brings happiness to the marriage,and the practice is often referred to in the U.S.A. as &quot; therapeutic donorinsemination.&quot; Since we do not consider that A.I.D. is ultimately of benefitto the marriage, we cannot accept this view.206. It has been suggested to us that in deciding to undertake A.I.D.in a particular case a medical practitioner is taking a decision whichdoes not differ in principle or in importance from other decisions whichhe has to take in the course of practice, especially in the sphere of infertility.It is true that any treatment of male or female infertility may, like A.I.D.,make it possible for a child to be born, but so long as the semen of the husband only is used the practitioner merely assists the couple in theirattempt to produce a child&quot; of the marriage. If the practitioner decidesto use A.I.D. he both takes it upon himself to go outside the marriage and assumes responsibility for choosing who shall be the biological fatherof the child. The technique of insemination may be precisely the samewith A.I.H. and A.I.D., but because of the nature of the decision takenby the practitioner the latter differs fundamentally from the former and.from all other medical practices.
207. Many of our witnesses have emphasised that a heavy responsibility rests on the practitioner to ensure that a couple who wish to receive A.I.D. are fully aware of its implications and possible consequences and have considered and rejected other courses, such as continuing childless or seeking to adopt or foster a child; and there is no doubt that it is in the practitioner&apos;s own interests to discuss the matter fully, lest the couple afterwards seek to lay the blame on him for consequences which they had not foreseen. While they may consult their legal adviser about the legal consequences of the course they propose to take, it is principally to the medical practitioner that they will look for advice on how A.I.D. is likely to affect them. We appreciate that many of the applicants for A.I.D., having considered all the consequences, may conscientiously believe that it is a right and proper course for them to take, and it may well be that in such circumstances the practitioner feels that the responsibility is theirs and not his. But we find it difficult to believe that a practitioner who was fully aware of all the possible dangers to the marriage and the handicap under which an A.I.D. child enters the world could, if asked for his advice, recommend A.I.D. as a desirable solution for any patient.

D. The Need for Research

208. We have particularly borne in mind that the practitioners who do recommend A.I.D. are, for the most part, unaware of the eventual outcome of their cases. 1 Those who support A.I.D. maintain that if couples are carefully selected there is unlikely to be any more danger to the marriage or to the child than with natural conception. Others, including ourselves, take the view that however carefully applicants for A.I.D. are selected the practice carries with it serious risks. Little concrete evidence to support either point of view is at present available. While it may well be that whatever its consequences to the individuals concerned A.I.D. is in principle undesirable, 2 there is no doubt that all discussion of the practice is at present greatly handicapped by lack of information about what has subsequently happened to the families of those women who have received A.I.D.

209. We appreciate that since the purpose of A.I.D. is to produce a child who shall to all intents and purposes be regarded as an ordinary member of the family, a periodic enquiry from outside about the well-being of the child and the family might be regarded as an unnecessary reminder of A.I.D. On the other hand, the view can be taken that society&apos;s need for factual information is paramount. Moreover we understand that the medical profession have found it possible to carry out several research projects whereby useful information has been collected about patients through the co-operation of their family doctors, but without the patients being aware that they were under surveillance. The sort of project which might eventually produce useful information about the results of A.I.D. would be a careful and planned "follow-up" of a representative sample of cases, for a period of twenty-five years from the birth of each child.

210. A good deal of information could no doubt be obtained, with the co-operation of the practitioners of A.I.D., about families where A.I.D.

%M already taken place. But, to ensure completeness, the study oughtproperly to start at the time A.I.D. is administered, and v/ould thereforebe dependent on the continuance of AiLD. on an appreciable scale inthis country. We ourselves, for reasons which have already been indicatedand which are summarised in the following chapter, have no wish tosee A.I.D. continue. In so far as it does continue, the only way to obtainsufficient reliable information to enable the next generation to evaluateits results would, we think, be by the institution of a programme of research on the lines we have indicated in the preceding paragraph.CHAPTER VIIIA.I.D. and SocietyA. Introduction211. The conclusions which we have reached in the previous fourchapters may be summarised as follows:(a) A.I.D. is liable to endanger the relationship between husband and wife.(6) A.I.D. must be accounted a handicap for the child so conceived.(c) The motives of a donor of semen are difficult to appreciate. Thepractice appears to indicate a certain irresponsibility and is, wethink, liable to appeal to undesirable persons. It may endanger the relationship between the donor and his wife.id) Certain aspects of the practice of A.I.D. are outside the province of a medical practitioner.212. It follows that we do not consider A.I.D. to be, in the words ofour terms of reference, in &quot; the interests of individuals involved.&quot; our terms of reference also require us to take account of the interests of society as a whole/&apos; We have no doubt that, in inviting us to considersociety as a whole as well as the individuals involved in A.I.D., thosewho appointed us had in mind that we should consider not only the married couples who receive A.I.D., but its effect on the institution of marriage as the basis of our society; not only the children who areconceived in this way, but the repercussions that this mode of conceptionmay have on the security of children in general- not merely donorsand the doctors who use them, but the implications of the whole procedure for the future of medical science. These are large and intangible problems which need not be developed fully within the compass of this report, butwe think that it is possible to make certain inferences about the conse-quences of A.I.D. to society by referring again, though in more general terms, to the four main headings under which we have already dealt, in chapters IV to VII, with the consequences to individuals.B. The Bamger to  fee Imstifffitioa of Marriage213. In Chapter IV we remarked1 that A.LD. goes against what hashitherto been regarded as the essential nature of marriage, since the wife
receives the seed of a person other than her husband. This proposililrlay at the root of the evidence given by virtually all the religious bodieswho appeared before us. A small minority took the view that the Christiandoctrine of marriage could not be used to condemn A.I.D. since the doctrine originated at a time when A.I.D. was unknown.1 But the greatmajority emphasised to us that although the interpretation of religiousdoctrine might well vary with social changes, this view did not imply that the concept of Christian marriage could be so altered as to con-template the reception by a wife of the seed of someone other than her husband. While it is true that in this country there are many people who do not, either in principle or in practice, accept the authority of anyreligious denomination, we think that most of these people agree with,or instinctively accept, the Christian attitude to A.I.D.214. Furthermore, the objection to A.I.D. as a violation of the marriageunion, which was put to us by other witnesses besides those representingreligious bodies, derives not only from the belief that A.I.D. contravenesreligious doctrine but also from the view that it is not in the best interestsof society. The Christian and the Jewish views of marriage depend onthe principle of monogamy which is also embodied in the civil law relatingto matrimony. A.I.D. violates this principle, and we do not think itunreasonable to suppose that if it were practised more widely this might lead to a general disregard of the obligations of marriage. As one ofbur witnesses expressed it:&quot; Public opinion trained to a tolerance of A.I.D. is likely to become more indifferent to a breaking of the marriage vows by normal inter-course with third parties. Obviously couples who practise A.I.D.retain some regard for the exclusiveness of the marriage relationship,which leads them to prefer this method to ordinary adultery. Butothers might well be inclined to ignore the difference of method andto consider only the similarity of result.&quot;2C.   The Danger to Children and Deception of Society215. Anything which tends to weaken&apos; the estate of marriage threatensthe security of children everywhere. In addition, A.I.D. brings into theworld a class of children who, whatever their legal status,3 are not permitted to know who their biological fathers are. Nor is society permitted to know,for the facts are either not known or available only by reference to thepractitioners confidential papers. It seems to us that the practice carrieswith it a possible threat to all children. If other children know that A.I.D.is practised doubts about their parentage may well be raised in their minds,and they would find it difficult to establish that they themselves were hotconceived in:this way. The knowledge that there is uncertainty about thefatherhood of some is a potential threat to the security of all.216. It has also been represented to us that the creation of a class ofchildren whose paternity cannot be known infringes the right of societyto be able to identify a child as the offspring of his father.   It may be1 See paragraph 119.-2 Evidence submitted on behalf of the Catholic Body in England and Wales and published as a pamphlet by the Catholic Truth Society, London, April, 1960.s See Chapter V.
-jWbted whether society at large has such a right, since in most of ourdealings with other people it is of no consequence to us to know whothe other person&apos;s father was ; nor can a society which permits a person to use any surname at will insist that it has a right to know the detailsof every man&apos;s parentage. But within a fairly wide circle of friends andrelatives the assumption is usually made that the mother&apos;s husband is thefather of the child. Since with A.I.D. it is usual for only the motherand her husband to be aware of the facts, the practice does involve thepermanent deception of a considerable number of people.D.   Donation of Semen as a Substitute for Natural Procreation217. While it should not be overlooked that in most cases1 whereA.I.D. is administered the husband and wife are capable of normal sexualrelations, the fact that a donor has to be used to achieve conception doesdisassociate responsibility for physical procreation from responsibility forthe upbringing of the child thus created. This is the practice amongstcertain species of animals, but it is in these days customary in our societyfor a woman to choose a man whom she knows and loves to beget childrenfor her and to assist her with their upbringing. A.I.D. does not permit a woman to choose who shall be, in the physical sense, the father of herchild. It substitutes an anonymous and mechanical procedure for anintimate personal relationship. We do not consider that such a procedurecan benefit society.218. There is another possible danger. If A.I.D. were to become more widely used, there would be an increased demand for donated semen.More donors would have to be employed, and it might not be possibleto maintain proper standards of selection ; in view of the known reluctance of most men to act in this capacity it might be that some financial induce-ment would have to be offered to them ; we think that this would be adisquieting state of affairs. .  A.I.D. and the Medical Profession219. A.I.D. is regarded by its advocates as a branch of medical practice.In so far as it is a strictly medical procedure it is a simple operationattended by no particular risks. It was introduced by doctors as anapparent solution of the medical problem of male infertility. But thosewho introduced it seem to have overlooked or to have failed fully to appreciate its wider consequences. Few would go so far as to say thata doctor is entitled to do whatever science may enable him to do ; in all forms of treatment he is limited by what society permits. It may well bethat in the treatment of infertility A.I.D. is beyond that limit. While a doctor is traditionally free, within the medical field, to prescribe what he considers best for his patient, society is entitled to object if thetreatment has consequences far beyond that field.220. It is clear from the evidence which has been submitted to us thatA.I.D. is not a practice which has the general support of the medical profession. &quot; The majority &quot; of a committee who submitted evidence tous on behalf of the Royal College of Physicians &quot;felt that, in general,1 See paragraph 28.67
the dangers and objections to A.I.D. outweighed any possible benefita committee appointed by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburghfound &quot; much that is repugnant in the practice of A.I.D.&quot; ; the view of&quot;the great majority&quot; of the Council of the Royal College of Obstetriciansand Gynaecologists is &quot; that A.I.D. is unethical and that it is not in theinterests of the community &quot; ; and the memorandum submitted to us by theCouncil of the British Medical Association, while expressing the opinionthat &quot; A.I.D. would not appear to contravene any of the accepted principlesof scientific medicine,&quot; made it clear that &quot; there is a substantial body ofopinion in the profession which regards this practice as an undesirable one and many doctors who are absolutely opposed to it on moral and religiousgrounds.&quot; In view of the weight of medical opinion which is opposed toA.I.D. it clearly cannot be regarded as a practice which is accepted bythe profession as a whole and society is therefore entitled to questionwhether it falls within a doctor&apos;s proper responsibilities.F.   Conclusion221. We are satisfied that it is unrealistic to assume that the optimumconditions for A.I.D. will always apply. We think that however well-intentioned doctors who practise A.I.D. may be, they are liable to makemistakes, that consenting husbands will be liable to change their attitude to the A.I.D. child in the stresses and strains of ordinary family life, andthat the dangers of disclosure are inevitable. In brief, we believe thatA.I.D. is not in the interests of society, and from what we have been ableto ascertain we understand that this view is shared by a substantial pro-portion of persons in the medical profession and in other walks of life.Many witnesses representing medical and other bodies discussed with ushow A.I.D. might be regulated1 but they made it clear that this shouldnot be taken as implying that their members supported A.I.D. Indeed,only a small minority of our witnesses expressed themselves as positivelyin favour of the practice.222. We wish, however, to qualify this statement of our conclusions by drawing attention once again to the very small scale on which the practicehas hitherto taken place. However small the practice, we believe thatsociety would be better off without it. But its small extent means, wethink, that it is a potential rather than a present danger to society. It isonly if it were to increase that it would have any significant effect on thecommunity as a whole.223. We have already referred to the factors which might lead to anincrease in the practice.2 One of these is the publicity given to it, whichis liable to stimulate the demand. Publicity has also had the effect ofexaggerating the incidence of A.I.D. and the magnitude of the dangers to which it might give rise. While we recognise that attention must bedrawn to the dangers, and have done so ourselves, we hope that one ofthe results of our report will be to put the practice in its proper perspective,as an activity which, albeit objectionable in our view, is at present resortedto by only a minute fraction of the community.1 See Chapter IX. &apos; &apos;2 Paragraphs 56-61.
O CHAPTER IXWhether A.I.D. should be Prohibited or RegulatedA. Introduction224. We are required to recommend &quot; whether any changes in the law arenecessary or desirable &quot;. We have already, in the earlier chapters of thisreport, suggested one or two amendments of the law relating to nullity,divorce, separation and maintenance, which are in no way dependant onour general view of A.I.D. as set out in the last chapter. We have now toconsider whether to recommend the introduction of legislation to give effectto this view.225. Since we consider that it is in the interests of society that A.I.D.should not increase, and that it is desirable that it should decrease or ceasealtogether, we think that legislation could only take one of two forms :either it could prohibit A.I.D. entirely, or, by stringent control of the prac-tice, it could attempt severely to restrict its incidence. We propose in this chapter to consider each of these two courses in turn.B. Prohibition of A.I.D.Introduction226. We have already discussed whether A.I.D. is at present a crime,and have concluded that it is unlikely to be so regarded unless it can be shown that other persons have been defrauded thereby.1 To prohibitA.I.D. by statute it would be necessary to make it a criminal offence for anyperson artificially to inseminate a woman with the semen of anyone otherthan her husband, and for a woman to be thus inseminated. No doubt thedonor, the woman&apos;s husband if he agreed to A.I.D. and any persons whoassisted the person carrying out the insemination could be charged asaccessories.227. We think that the question whether A.I.D. should in all circum-stances be a criminal offence must depend on (1) whether the practice couldbe effectively prohibited and (2) whether its extent and social consequencesare such as to justify the creation of such an offence.Whether A.I.D. could be Effectively Prohibited228. In order to determine whether prohibition of A.I.D. would be effective we have found it convenient to consider first whether it woulddeter persons from practising, and secondly whether those who were notdeterred could be detected and convicted.(a) Deterrence229. As to deterrence, the evidence which we have received on the likelyeffects of making A.I.D. a criminal offence, both from A.I.D. practitionersand from other witnesses, is conflicting. Some have said that if it is made an offence it will nevertheless continue to be practised &quot;underground&quot;,since there is now a steady though small demand for it and there will notbe lacking unscrupulous persons who will attempt to satisfy the demand.Others take the view that if A.I.D. is made an offence it will virtually cease,1 See paragraphs 96-98.69303 D 2
since the couples who at present avail themselves of it and the doctors w&amp;ppractise it are persons who respect the law and would continue to do so,and anyone who attempted to carry on the work would find that the results achieved were not worth the time and trouble taken. Both these opinionsare conjectural, and it is not easy to judge between them. The first seemsto depend to a certain extent on the analogy of criminal abortion, but thisanalogy is not entirely appropriate. In general, the persons who performcriminal abortions, and to a lesser extent those who seek the service ofabortionists, have not the same respect for the law as those who are engaged in A.I.D. The circumstances of the two practices are very different.The motives for seeking abortion are generally more urgent than those for seeking A.I.D.: failure to obtain A.I.D. merely means a continuation ofchildlessness (though we have no doubt that some of those who are driven to despair by childlessness would not be deterred by the fact that A.I.D.was illegal) : failure to obtain an abortion within a specified period means the appearance of an unwanted (and perhaps illegitimate) child. Moreover,there is more money to be made by criminal abortionists, partly becauseof the greater urgency of the woman&apos;s need and partly because the desiredresult is achieved in one operation.230. Where the analogy with abortion is appropriate is in the difficultyof detecting an offence. If in fact it proved virtually impossible to detectan offence of A.I.D., then those who would be deterred not by the fact ofthe practice being illegal but only by the likelihood of their being foundout would not refrain from practising.(b) Detection of Offences231. If A.I.D. were made a criminal offence it would be extremely diffi-cult to obtain a conviction. At present the practice very rarely comes to notice, and if it became criminal no doubt it would be even more carefullyconcealed. Cases of criminal abortion are usually revealed only becauseof the death or serious illness of the woman. But A.I.J3. is not normallyattended by any medical complications.232. It is unlikely that witnesses of the offence would be forthcoming.The donor would not be able to testify to the insemination of a particularwoman but only to the fact that he gave his semen for the purpose of A.I.D.A nurse or secretary would be a possible witness. So would the couplethemselves, but these persons might also be liable to be charged.233. Unsuccessful A.I.D. would be likely to come to light only if oneof the parties (i.e. the doctor, the wife or the husband) revealed the fact.Successful A.I.D. might be suspected either on the birth of the child or later, if for some reason&quot; it became known that the husband could not havefathered a child, though the mere existence of a child of whom the husbandwas not thought to be the father would not prove that A.I.D. had takenplace.(c) Conclusion234. We therefore consider that while the prohibition of A.I.D. by lawwould deter some of those who now.engage in the practice, at would be extremely difficult to detect those who were not deterred, and in so far as
Sgf practice fell into the hands of unscrupulous persons its consequencescould be more dangerous than if it had not been prohibited. In addition,there would be added scope for blackmailers or mischievous persons, withthe possibility of unfortunate consequences to the child.Whether the Social Consequences of A.I.D. Justify Prohibition235. It does not, however, necessarily follow that because A.I.D.probably could not be completely or effectively prohibited, it is undesirable to make it a criminal offence. There are some actions which, howeverdifficult to prove, ought to remain criminal offences. Poisoning is an example.It is extremely difficult to detect, but nobody would suggest that becausemany poisonings may go undetected poisoning should not remain a criminal offence.236. We have seen that very little is known of the consequences of A.I.D.to those who have been concerned with it, and that their numbers are so small that it can scarcely be said to have had as yet any significant effectOn society. It has, however, been represented to us that the potentialdangers of the practice, particularly to children conceived thereby, are so great that the law ought to take action now and prohibit A.I.D. before itspreads beyond control. While we fully appreciate this point of view andwe realise that it may seem to many to be the logical corollary of our ownattitude to A.I.D., the practice is not in its infancy and we have already suggested that prohibition would be unlikely to be effective.237. We doubt whether the prohibition of A.I.D. would in fact be con-sistent with the function of the criminal law as it is understood in thiscountry. Adultery is on an infinitely larger scale than A.I.D. and is more often liable to have undesirable consequences both for the marriage andfor any children of the marriage, and hence for society as a whole. Butadultery is not a criminall offence. Apart from the difficulty of detectingoffences, a major objection to prohibiting adultery by law would be thatsuch a step would be considered to be an unjustifiable encroachment onthe freedom of the individual in a sphere of behaviour where the law doesnot normally intrude. Adultery is generally a private matter between two persons only. A.I.D. requires the co-operation of a donor and usually of a doctor, as well as the husband and wife, but it is nevertheless a procedure which, whatever the public may think of it in general, is not in any particular case offensive to public order or decency.1238. Nor can we forget that those who administer and receive A.I.D.,and others who sympathise with them, conscientiously believe that it isa right and proper thing to do. They are people, who, we understand, wouldunhesitatingly reject adultery as immoral, but see in A.I.D. a way bywhich the wife may be able to experience childbirth and motherhood with-out, in their view, going outside the marriage. While we believe such people to be mistaken about the morality of A.I.D., we do not consider thatit is the function of the State in matters of this sort to impose a uniformmorality by means of the criminal law.1 See the views expressed on the function of the criminal law in the report of the Depart-mental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution (Cmnd. 247 of 1957), paragraphs13 and 14.
Conclusion \Jl239. To attempt to prohibit by law a practice which is very difficult todetect, which is so far of very small extent and not demonstrably harmfulto the community as a whole, which, if prohibited, might get into worsehands or offer scope for blackmail and which some people do not regard as morally wrong would, we think, be liable to encourage a general disrespectfor the criminal law.Accordingly, we do not recommend that A.IJO. should be prohibited by statute.C.   Regulation of A.I.D.Introduction240. The suggestion that the practice of A.I.D. should be controlled orregulated, by law or otherwise, is one that has been made to us by manywitnesses. It is a solution which appeals both to those who abject on principle to A.I.D. but believe that it is bound to continue and that if so it were better brought under control, and to those who consider that A.I.D. isjustifiable in a small number of carefully selected cases and that some form of regulation is necessary in order to ensure that it is undertaken onlyin such cases. We do not propose to set out here all the various methodsof control which we have considered both privately among ourselves andin discussion with those who have appeared before us to give evidence,and we hope that those who made suggestions to us will appreciate that although their suggestions may not be mentioned here we had them verymuch in mind in reaching the conclusions which we give below.241. Having considered the many proposals put to us by witnesses, we reached the conclusion that the abject of regulating A.I.D. would be toattempt to restrict the incidence of the practice to those cases where itwould do least harm or where, in the opinion of its supporters, it wouldbe positively justified.Difficulty of Controlling the Medical Technique242. Since the selection of cases considered suitable for A.I.D. is atpresent undertaken by the doctors engaged in the practice, an obvious methodof regulation would be to lay down certain requirements about the procedure to be followed by medical practitioners. In so far as the procedure is amatter of medical technique whether in the field of gynaecology, maleinfertility, genetics or psychological medieme--legislation would no doubt be regarded as an unprecedented infringement of the freedom of a doctorto do what he considers best for his patients. We think that such aninnovation would be justified only if there were clear evidence that as amatter of medical technique A.I.D. was being wrongly applied for exampleif there was unnecessary risk to health or life due to infection at the timeof insemination or the use of diseased donors. In matters of this sortit is possible that something might be achieved by legislation laying dawncertain detailed requirements, but there is no evidence to warrant such ameasure. Some practitioners may require guidance in the field of maleinfertility, but, as we have seen,1 it would be impossible to define with sufficient precision a degree of infertility in the husband which could be&apos; 1 Paragraph 26.
Hfd to justify A.I.D. Finally, the matters to be decided within the sphere of psychological medicine are so variable and intangible that no statutory provisions on this aspect are likely to be of much value.243. We have also considered whether, by means short of legislation, theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland might exercise control over the practice of A.I.D. We understand that the two Ministersdo from time to time give guidance, by means of circulars issued by their departments to hospitals with the National Health Service, on the adminis-tration of the hospital services ; but it would scarcely be appropriate todeal with A.I.D. in this way. In any case, as we have already observed,1A.I.D. is not known to take place in hospitals. The Ministers also issuememoranda concerned with the preventive and social aspects of medicine,or with the services available for the case of patients suffering from various types of disability, and the broad aspects of treatment. But they do not attempt to regulate any matter Which is within the clinical discretion ofthe individual practitioner. Similarly the Ministers do not consider that itwould be right for them to seek to regulate the use of artificial inseminationby the issue of memoranda or any other means, and we agree with their view.244. Another suggestion, which we have discussed with a number of medical bodies who appeared before us, is that guidance might be givento practitioners of A.I.D. by an authoritative body within the medical profession, in order to ensure the maintenance of standards in regard tosueh matters as the selection of donors and applicants for A.I.D. Itappears, however, that there is no existing body who could properly take on these responsibilities. Since we are of the opinion that A.I.D. necessarilyinvolves the medical practitioner in matters which are outside his provinceand is in principle undesirable, we do not consider that it would be appropriate for us to recommend the institution of arrangements for thecontrol by the profession of the medical side of the practice. Moreover we appreciate the difficulties to which any attempt to control the practice wouldgive rise, since it is a matter affecting the freedom of conscience of theindividual practitioner.Proposals that A.I.D. should be Undertaken by Certain Practitioners only245. It was suggested to us by the Royal College of Physicians that anydoctor who wished to practice A.I.D. should request his name to be entered on a register and that he should give an undertaking to observecertain conditions, mainly concerned with the enquiries he should makebefore undertaking A.I.D. The proposed register would, however, bevoluntary, and there would therefore be no obligation on any doctor to&apos; beon the register. Many applicants for A.I.D. would no doubt prefer to goto a doctor who was on the A.I.D. register, but if the conditions which thespecially registered doctors had to comply with were regarded either bydoctors or patients as too onerous, there might well be a considerable practice by other doctors or by unqualified persons.246. To restrict the practice of A.I.D. to certain approved doctorswould, we understand, be unacceptable to the medical profession, since itwould&apos;imply that only those doctors were properly qualified for the work.It has always been accepted that a registered medical practitioner may1 Paragraph 21.73
carry out any medical procedure, and he is deterred from doing the wfppof specialists only because he has not got the necessary skill or experience.We have heard of only one precedent for limiting a medical procedure to certain doctors only, a provision in the Radioactive Substances Act,1948, whereby regulations can be made licensing doctors to prescribe and administer radioactive substances and to use irradiating apparatus. Noregulations have yet been made.247. A.I.D. is, however, an exceptional procedure, and it may be thatunprecedented measures would be justified. One such- measure which wassuggested us by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh was that A.I.D.should be carried out only by gynaecologists specially appointed for thepurpose by a regional committee or Hospital Board, and only in hospitalswithin the National Health Service. This proposal would both depriveother doctors of whatever right they may have to carry out the practice, andwould make A.I.D. the only practice which cannot be conducted privately.Since we understand that at present A.I.D. is not performed in hospitals, theproposal is unlikely to be acceptable Jp those who now engage in thepractice and might tend, if put into effect, to drive the practice underground.A.I.D. under the National Health Service248. We also think that there are objections to the institution of special arrangements for A.I.D. under the National Health Service. In the firstplace we understand that the form of record used in some National health service hospitals is such that the fact that the patient had receivedA.I.D. might have to be specified on it, and this fact would then be liableto become known to medical and administrative staff through whose handsthe record passed. Moreover the fact that A.I.D. was being practised ina particular hospital would not be easy to conceal from the staff, fromother patients and from students, and it might thus become possible to identify couples and donors attending for this purpose. These are, however,administrative difficulties which might be overcome if the hospital arrange-ments were altered.249. There is, we think, a more fundamental objection to institutingarrangements for A.I.D. under the Health Service. Such a step would necessarily indicate a measure of official approval of A.I.D. and wouldmake it more widely available without the payment of a fee.1 This would lead to an increase in the practice which would be the more distastefulto those who, like ourselves, object to A.I.D., since it would be at public expense. On the assumption that A.I.D. is not a criminal offence,2 thereis at present nothing to prevent a practitioner doing it within the health service, if his patient agrees and the hospital authorities provide the facilities.We would, however, deprecate any steps which would make it easier toundertake A.I.D. within the Service, since this would be liable not to restrict the practice but to expand it.Responsibility to Remain with Individual Practitioners250. Our terms of reference require us to recommend changes only inthe law. Since, however, it appears to us that in so far as it is a matterof medical procedure A.I.D. cannot be appropriately dealt with by legislation,1 See paragraph 32.2 See paragraphs 96-98.
^fhave also examined various proposed methods of controlling the procedure by action on the part of the medical profession. For the reasons givenin the preceding paragraphs we are unable to recommend any particularmethod of control. Furthermore, since a substantial body of the medical profession is firmly opposed to having anything to do with A.I.D., it wouldbe difficult for the profession to implement any system of control. We canonly hope that in so far as the practice continues those who are engagedin it will bear in mind the possible dangers and will impose and maintain their own standards, since we do not think it feasible for standards to be imposed on them from outside.Proposed Control of Non-medical Aspects of the Practice251. There are a number of matters connected with A.I.D. which, although they affect the medical practitioner, may be considered more suitable for legislation than the purely medical aspects which have been dealt with inthe preceding paragraphs. These matters are mainly concerned with the suitability of applicants for A.I.D. on other than medical grounds, and theview has been taken that if certain requirements could be laid down by statute some of the dangers of A.I.D. could be avoided.Proposed Procedure for obtaining the Consent of Husband and Wife252. It has been proposed that a practitioner undertaking A.I.D. shouldbe required by law to obtain the written consent of the husband. As wehave seen,1 most practitioners already do this, for their own protection.If, as we propose,2 A.I.D. without the consent of the husband is made anew ground for divorce, the practitioner would be well advised to obtainhis consent, as suggested by the Medical Defence Union.3 We are inclined to think, however, that, apart from divorce proceedings, difficulties are likelyto arise subsequently not because the husband did not sign a form ofconsent but because he did not fully appreciate the consequences of theprocedure to which he gave his consent.253. It has been represented to us4 that in order to ensure that theconsent of husband and wife to A.I.D. is &quot; real&quot; and that they fully appre-associate the seriousness of the step they are taking and its legal consequences,it is not sufficient to leave the matter to the practitioner : it should be the function of a court official, on receiving a medical certificate that the case is suitable for A.I.D., to interview the couple, obtain their consent andissue an order permitting A.I.D. to proceed. It would then be an offence to undertake A.I.D. otherwise than under the authority of such an order.254. We believe that there are decisive objections to such a proposal.In the first place, the court official charged with satisfying himself aboutthe &quot; reality &quot; of the consents before issuing an order would have to make the sort of enquiry into the couple&apos;s motives and background which shouldhave been carried out by the practitioner. This he would not usuallybe able to do, and he would therefore have to rely on the practitioner&apos;judgment in this most important matter.255. Secondly, while a court official might be in a better position toexplain to the applicants, in a detached and unbiassed manner, the seriousness1 Paragraph 49.2 Paragraph 117.3 Paragraph 49.4 By the Law Society (see footnote on page 85).
of the step they proposed to take and its possible consequences, sofeofficials might well find it very difficult to remain impartial, since A.I.Wtends to arouse strong prejudices on one side or the other. We considerthat it would be undesirable to place upon officials the duty of givingadvice on the implications of a practice which many of them would be opposed to in any circumstances.256. Finally, a provision requiring a couple to appear before a courtofficial before receiving A.I.D. would probably be unacceptable to thecouple since they would imagine that in this way their application wouldbecome known to other persons besides the doctor. They would thereforebe likely to disregard such a provision and to seek someone who wouldbe prepared to undertake A.I.D. without going through the official procedure.Proposal that Applications for A.I.D. should be Considered by a Committee257. The considerations mentioned in the previous paragraph would, wethink, apply to any system whereby applications for A.I.D. were consideredby a committee or tribunal. Both the couple and the practitioner mightwell be deterred from bringing so private a matter before a formallyconstituted body, and might resent having to submit themselves to the sort of investigation which such a body would have to make if it wasproperly to fulfil its role of restricting the incidence of A.I.D. to the few cases where the practice was least likely to do harm. The practice ofA.I.D. is, as we have seen, so difficult to detect that it would be impossibleto establish the extent to which a provision designed to restrict its incidencewas having its effect. We believe, however, that a provision settingup an official procedure for dealing with applications would be more liableto be disregarded than a provision prohibiting the practice altogether, sincethe offence of not complying with such a procedure would clearly beconsidered of less consequence than the offence of engaging in a practice which was altogether prohibited.Central Record of A.I.D.258. Many of the suggested methods of regulating A.I.D. which we have considered propose the setting up of a central record of all cases of A.I.D.,compiled from information which the practitioner would be required tosubmit. The information might include a record of the husband&apos;s consent,and some witnesses have proposed that the donor&apos;s name should also begiven, so as to make it possible to attribute to a particular donor anygenetic abnormality that might arise. We have already considered,1 and rejected, the suggestion that a record should be maintained in order toestablish the child&apos;s legal status ;. but it has been put to us that, whatever the child&apos;s status, if A.I.D. continues at all a central record is requiredfor the purposes of research, and in order to provide some evidence to theextent of the practice and of the fact that the practitioner has complied with certain conditions, such as a requirement to obtain the busband&apos;consent. We doubt, however, whether research workers would need tohave recourse to a central record. The names of those doctors who practiseA.I.D. are fairly well known to the medical profession, and we think thataccess to the doctor himself and to his notes would be of more use forthe purposes of research than the necessarily brief particulars contained inan official record.2 Nor would the record be particularly useful as evidence1 See paragraphs 178-186. &quot; -&quot;2 See paragraphs 208-210.
lithe extent of A.I.D. or of compliance by the practitioner with certain conditions since, for the reasons which we have set out in an earlier chapter,1it would probably be incomplete. Finally, any record of A.I.D., howeverconfidential, would increase the risk of A.I.D. children learning of theirorigin, and if the donors name were linked in the record with that ofthe mother they too would be in a very embarrassing position if thefacts were disclosed. Since we understand that each practitioner uses hisown donors and no others we are not convinced that a central record ofdonors would serve any useful purpose: if such a record were to be instituted it ought, in order to preserve the anonymity of the donor, to be quite separate from any record containing the names of women who hadreceived A.I.D.Whether A.I.D. for Single Women or Without the Consent of the Husbandshould be Prohibited259. It has been put to us that some of the worst consequences of A.I.D.could be prevented if it were made a criminal offence to undertake A.I.D.for a single woman or without the consent of the husband. It will be recalled that we are unanimously. of the opinion that A.I.D. should not take place in such circumstances and have recommended that it shouldbe a new ground for divorce if the consent of the husband is not obtained.2But we would hesitate to recommend that these practices should be madecriminal offences. In the first place, we have no evidence that they haveever taken place in this country and we think that it would be premature to consider prohibiting an activity which is not known to occur. Secondly,it has to be borne in mind that it is not a criminal offence for a singlewoman to conceive a child by natural means or for a married woman to doso without the consent of her husband. Thirdly, A.I.D. is so difficult todetect that it is unlikely that a person who was prepared to inseminate asingle woman, or a married woman without the consent of her husband,would be deterred from doing so merely because the practice was illegal.Whether Persons other than Medical Practitioners should be Prohibited fromUndertaking A.I.D.260. Many of our witnesses suggested that persons other than registeredmedical practitioners should be prohibited by law from undertaking A.I.D.We have no doubt that in view of the skill and experience that are requiredin various fields of medicine,3 and of the need to seek the assistance ofspecialists, the consequences of AID. are likely to be more dangerous if itis not undertaken by a doctor. While the law does not in general prohibitlaymen from practising medicine, our attention has been drawn to a numberof provisions whereby only qualified medical practitioners may carry out certain medical procedures4 and it has been suggested that a similar provision might be enacted in respect of A.I.D. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that in this country A.I.D. is now carried out by personswho are not doctors, and if it is known that certain medical practitionersdo it there is little incentive for those desiring A.I.D. to resort to the1 Paragraph 184.2 See paragraphs 113-117.3 See paragraph 198.* For example, the Venereal Disease Act, 1917, the Corneal Grafting Act, 1952, and, more generally, the National Health Service (General Medical and Pharmaceutical) Regulations.1954.
unqualified. We think that laymen are probably deterred from practisF^A.I.D., as they are in fact deterred from practising any but the simplestforms of medicine, because they have insufficient knowledge and are notprepared to risk the consequences of their ignorance.Conclusion261. A further reason why we do not consider that the law shouldprohibit persons who are not medical practitioners from carrying out A.I.D.is that a provision to this effect would imply that medical practitionerswere qualified to do so, which we do not accept. Similar arguments applyto the provisions considered in the preceding paragraphs. If it wereenacted that A.I.D. should not be undertaken for single women or for married women without their husband&apos;s consent, this would, we think,imply that A.I.D. was permitted for married women where the husband&apos;consent was obtained. Any proposal to regulate A.I.D. by excluding certain cases as unsuitable implies that other cases are suitable for A.I.D. Aswe have already indicated, we do not ourselves consider that A.I.D. is a desirable course in any circumstances. The object of legislation to regulate the practice would be to distinguish and exclude those circumstances whereA.I.D. was likely to be most harmful in its consequences to those concerned,particularly the child. But since we believe that, whatever its consequences to the individuals directly concerned, A.I.D. is never in the interests of society, we could not support legislation which would give tacit approval to the practice so long as it conformed to the law, while those who wished tobreak the law would be able to do so with little fear of detection.262. We have felt it necessary to set out in some detail the arguments for and against various proposals designed to regulate or restrict the incidence of A.I.D. although we are not in favour of any such proposals.Many of our witnesses have taken the view that &quot; regulation&quot; is the best solution, and we ourselves were attracted towards this solution in theearlier stages of our enquiry. We spent a considerable time consideringpossible methods of regulation but, for the reasons which we have givenin the preceding paragraphs, we eventuality concluded that regulation wasboth impracticable and undesirable. Our reasons may be summarised asfollows:(1) The nature of the subject is such that it would not be practicable to deal with it by legislation or by non-statutory control through a professional body or through the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland.(2) To accord with our views on A.I.D., regulation would have to berestrictive and would therefore probably not be adhered to by all those engaged in the practice.(3) Regulation might be understood to imply a degree of officialrecognition which would be undesirable.Accordingly we do not recommend that the practice of A.I.D. should be regulated.
CHAPTER XFinal Conclusion263. Since we consider that A.I.D. should be neither prohibited norregulated by law it follows that so far as the criminal law is concernedwe are in favour of leaving the position as it is at present. The fact that wedo not recommend restrictive legislation does not mean that we are indiffer-ent to the practice or that we lack decision in our attitude to it. We discardthe suggestions of such legislation for reasons already explained. these reasons are accepted as conclusive by us all.264. On the other hand we are clear in our opinion that having regardto the dangers and disadvantages for the child, the parents, and the donorand for society as a whole, A.I.D. is undesirable. We therefore wish to discourage the practice. But in holding this view we are conscious that weare presented with a dilemma. If disapproval is pressed too far then thereis a danger that the practice may fall into less desirable hands than thoseof members of the medical profession. This would be unfortunate, evendisastrous. We hope that we leave neither prospective parents nor anydoctors under any misapprehension as to the view which we take. We think the practice most unwise and a grave injustice (Whether regarded as a realor only a potential danger) to the intended child. We think that anyhusband and wife should recognise the conflict between their own desiresand the interest of the child they would wish the wife to bear and both tocherish. We believe that most at least will take heed of these considerations.We think the fact that through the need of secrecy the donor must donatein complete ignorance of the identity of the recipient of his seed indicates alack of responsibility on his part. We hope further that the practice maydiminish or entirely disappear and that publication of this report and a fuller disclosure of the facts relating to the practice so far as it exists inthis country and of the implications of that practice for the individuals concerned will assist to this end. In so far as the practice does continuewe are unanimous that it is better it should remain in the hands of medical practitioners, although, as we have stated,1 we are not satisfied that it is entirely within their province.265. The conclusion we have reached may be exposed to criticism from two directions. On the one hand there are those who for religious, ethicalor sociological reasons would favour what might appear to be the strongerline of prohibition or control. On the other hand there are those who will feel that the practice of A.I.D. is one which should be given approval, director indirect, as a course which, in suitable circumstances, may lead to matri-monial happiness. In the immediately preceding chapter we have dealt withthe former criticism and in earlier chapters we ha^e endeavoured to make clear why we consider the latter criticism is based on a mistaken or danger-ous view. There remains, however, the conflict between the religious, moralor ethical approach to the problem and the liberty of the subject to rulehis own conduct subject to certain limitations in so far as such conduct may affect other individuals or society in general.   Religious opinion is almosti Paragraph 211.
entirely unanimous in condemning the practice as a sin. There is alscffelarge body of opinion which, while not necessarily accepting the authont^of any Church, agrees with religious opinion to the extent that A.I.D. isunethical and a danger to the institution of marriage as an essential part ofthe social structure of this country. Against this view there are some whobelieve that A.I.D. is a justifiable exercise of the liberty of the subject whichcarries no threat to others.266. What then is the proper course to recommend? We believe the answer is that A.I.D. falls within the category of actions known to studentsof jurisprudence as &quot; liberties &quot;x which while not prohibited by law will receive no kind of support or encouragement from the law. It has long beenthe view of many people that there is a type of conduct which althoughregarded bv. the community as a whole or a substantial part of it as immoralought not to be classed as criminal and therefore punishable by the State.The most common illustrations are fornication and adultery. This view was recently expressed in another connection by the Wolfenden Committeewho wrote of &quot; a realm of private morality and immorality which is in briefand crude terms not the law&apos;s business &quot;.2267. While we consider that A.I.D. is not entirely a matter of &quot; privatemorality &quot; since it has consequences which affect others besides those whodecide to engage in it, it would accord with the conclusions which we havereached as a result of our enquiry if it is regarded as an activity which is neither on the one hand expressly prohibited nor on the other given any sort of approval by the law and therefore falls within the category of&quot;liberties&quot;.268. The following words, taken from a recent publication3 which was brought to our notice, come very near to expressing our attitude to A.I.D.&quot; Between these two extremes that is to say, between the criminalcode of offences, which must be publicly condemned and punished forthe good of society, on the one hand, and the private code, by which theindividual with moral standards governs his own conduct, on the other the ordinary man acknowledges that there is an intermediate group of recognised offences which, although they are public in that theyconcern more than a single person and disturb the harmony of society,are still not of a nature or quality which demands punishment by the criminal law.&quot;We think that A.I.D. is a matter of public concern although the extent ofthe practice and its impact so far as can be seen at present are not such that it requires to be &quot;publicly condemned and punished&quot;. We believe it should belong to the &quot; intermediate group&quot; referred to above.   Many1 &quot; My legal liberties... are the benefits which I derive from the absence of legal duties imposed upon myself. They are the various forms assumed by the interest which I have in doing as I please. They are the things which I may do without being prevented by the law.The sphere of my legal liberty is that sphere of activity within which the law is content to leaveme alone.&quot; (Salmond on Jurisprudence, Eleventh Edition, page 271, edited by GlanvilleWilliams and published by Sweet and Maxwell, Ltd., 1957.)2 Cmnd. 247 of 1957, paragraph 61.3 &quot; What is Unlawful? Does Innocence Begin where Crime Ends? &quot;, by Quentin Edwards -published by the Church Information Office, 1959.
voplc will not regard A.I.D. as an offence,1 but it clearly concerns more\ /kn a single person and may well disturb the harmony of society.269. Apart from those considerations already explained there are other reasons why we consider that, with the exceptions we have mentioned,2legislation is unnecessary or undesirable. It is particularly important thatthe problem should be seen in its proper perspective. The number of birthsby A.I.D. in this country does not appear to be much more than 100 perannum. This number may possibly increase or on the other hand it may,and we hope it will, diminish as a result of this report and fuller realisation of the issues involved, but taking the figures as they stand they represent lessthan one birth in 7,000. Births registered as illegitimate average about 350for every birth by A.I.D. We do not feel that these figures justify anygeneral legislation on account of A.I.D.270. Again, the problem is one in relation to which legislation may well prove to be premature. The development of science in its relation tohuman procreation may in the future create conditions different from thosewhich we have had to consider. The time may come when the use of artificial insemination, or of other medical techniques which are at present only in the experimental stage,3 assumes such proportions that the Statecan no longer leave the matter to the decision of individuals. On the otherhand, in the particular field with which we have been concerned, it maybe that progress in the reduction of male infertility will reduce the numberof cases where the conditions regarded as suitable for A.I.D. exist or thatcases which would now fall within the description of A.I.D. may in futurefall rather within the description of A.I.H. by the use of donor plasma.4271. Finally we wish to emphasise the hope that all the agencies, religious or secular, which help to guide people as to standards of conduct will beused to underline the dangers which we have referred to in this report.Religious teaching will undoubtedly do so, but conduct is not governedonly by teachings of religion because there are many people who do not accept the authority of any religious body. An individual may justify hisactions by the argument that if certain conduct is not contrary to the lawthen it is not a crime ; again, if he does not observe the teaching of religionthen conduct cannot be equated with sin and he may be misled into thinking that whatever he does is harmless and justifiable, but it does not follow thatsuch conduct is either harmless or justifiable..

CHAPTER XISUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS272. The following is a summary of our recommendations.A.I.H.The fact that a live child has been born as a result of artificial insemina-tion of a woman with the seed of her husband should be a bar to pro-ceedings by either spouse for nullity 6f marriage on the ground of impotence(paragraph 108).A.I.D.(i) Acceptance by a wife of artificial insemination with the seed of adonor without the consent of her husband should be made anew ground for divorce or judicial separation, and in Englandthese circumstances should also enable a husband to take matri-monial proceedings in a magistrates&apos; court (paragraph 117).(ii) The law should not be amended to permit a decree of nullityof marriage to be obtained on the ground of sterility (paragraph139).(iii) The fact that a live child has been born as a result of artificial insemination of a woman with the seed of a donor, to whichthe parties to the marriage consented, should be a bar to pro-ceedings by either spouse for nullity of marriage on the ground of impotence (paragraph 156).(iv) The law of Scotland should be amended so as to require a husbandwho has consented to the artificial insemination of his wife withthe seed of a donor to maintain during his (the husband&apos;s) lifetimeany child who may be bom as a result of the insemination, andin England the child should be entitled to claim that provisionfor his maintenance be made out of the deceased husband&apos;s estate(paragraph 159).(v) There should be no amendment of the laws relating to legitimacyor registration of birth (paragraph 187).(vi) The law should not be amended to enable a wife to take proceedings for divorce on the ground that her husband has donated semenfor the purpose of A.I.D. without obtaining her consent (paragraph195).(vii) The practice of A.I.D. should not be prohibited or regulated bylaw (paragraphs 239 and 262), but should be discouraged.
(&quot; \ MEMORANDUM OF DISSENT BY MRS. JAY AND MR. ROSS1. We regret that we are unable to Sign the report, though we agreewith most of its conclusions and with all the recommendations relating tothe law with the important exception of number (v) dealing with thestatus of the child born of A.I.D., on which subject our views are set outin paragraphs 9-14 below.Attitude to A.I.D.2. We should make it clear at the outset that, with our colleagues, weare not in favour of encouraging A.I.D. We consider, however, that, given a stable marriage, A.I.D. may properly be employed in small numbers ofcases provided that both applicants and donors are carefully and expertlyselected. The governing consideration should be not the needs of applicantsbut the opportunity for happiness and security which the couple can offer a child conceived with the aid of a donor.3. It is shown in paragraph 45 of the report that the doctors who now practise A.I.D. take great care in selecting suitable couples, and that many applicants are rejected. Paragraph 203 mentions facilities that areat the doctor&apos;s disposal to assist selection, though paragraph 204 suggeststhat persons possessing the necessary skill and experience will not always be available and prepared to co-operate with a practitioner of A.I.D.4. Paragraph 57 points out that the number of couples suitable on medical grounds for A.I.D. depends partly on the number, put at 1,000 a year, ofmarriages where, the wife being of normal fertility, the husband will prove to be subfertile; while paragraph 200 suggests that the practice might increase by being undertaken where it was not justified on medical grounds,though no evidence of this reached the Committee. We should have thought on the contrary that the fact that the husband, even if grosslysubfertile, might still be capable of begetting a child would lead practitionersto restrict, rather than to extend, the use of A.I.D.5. We think that paragraph 215 (see also paragraph 222), suggesting that the existence of A.I.D. carries with it a possible threat to the securityof all children, should be read against the figures given in paragraph 269showing that for each child born of A.I.D. in Great Britain there are some.350 children registered at birth as illegitimate and over 7,000 as legitimate.6. The statement in paragraph 217 (whose comparison of human beingswith animals we deprecate) that donation of semen dissociates &quot; responsi-bility for physical procreation from responsibility for the upbringing of the child thus created &quot; seems to us to place undue emphasis on the biologicalaspect of fatherhood: insufficient account is taken of the husband&apos;s role offather in his association with his wife during her pregnancy, and of hisassumption from the time of the child&apos;s birth of the full responsibilities andsatisfactions of fatherhood (a consideration mentioned in paragraph 147).The procedures of adoption and fostering of children recognise that father-hood (and motherhood) can be exercised independently of the biologicalorigin of the child.7. We find it difficult to understand what is meant by the statement inparagraph 214 that A.I.D. violates the principle of monogamy. Further, we
do not share the opinion that A.I.D. might lead to general disregard of fijjjLobligations of marriage. We think it unreasonable to suppose that this woulParise out of a practice which is of interest only to a limited number ofcouples hitherto infertile who are anxious to have a family.8. Our colleagues consider (paragraph 267) that A.I.D. should remainwhat is known as a liberty, to be resorted to according to the conscience ofthe individual. Anyone who accepts what is said on the subject in thereport, and in particular in Chapter VIII, might be expected to conclude thatA.I.D. is not a practice which a reputable doctor would undertake or asolution to which responsible married people should resort. While, as already stated, we have no wish to see A.I.D. encouraged, we feel that in the limited number of marriages where it may be a good solution, medical practitionersand married people should be able to undertake A.I.D., within or outsidethe National Health Service, without feeling that they are doing somethingdiscreditable.Status of the Child9. We find ourselves unable to agree with the conclusion that a child bornof A.I.D. to which the husband of the mother has consented should remainillegitimate (paragraphs 160-171).10. It is our view that the reasons summarised in paragraph 171, asread with the preceding arguments, do not sustain the conclusion reached in the report. If the interests of children destined to be born of A.I.D.were a main consideration, it would obviously be desirable that such children,exposed to some risk of learning of their A.I.D, origin, should be spared theadditional handicap of illegitimacy (see paragraph 161).11. Our colleagues say in paragraph 169 that they have no reason to suppose that opinion in Parliament or in the country would be in favourof changing the concept of legitimacy to apply it to any child born to a married woman, and accepted as one of the family by her husband. while we do not want to comment on this speculation, which does not applyexclusively to children born of A.I.D., we take the opportunity to saythat for our part we should welcome such a change in the law. With regardto the last three sentences of paragraph 169, we cannot see that acceptance by society of legitimacy for children born of A.I.D. (being children whoare to be brought up as members of families) need carry with it the implication that all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children should be removed.12. We are not convinced that objections (see paragraphs 163-166) tointerference with what our colleagues refer to in paragraph 171 as &quot; theprinciple of hereditary succession which is at the basis of our society&quot;should be allowed to stand in the way of legitimacy for A.I.D. children ingeneral, few of whom will have any interest in succession to dignities ortitles of honour or to property other than that at the testamentary disposalof their &quot; parents &quot;.13. We are not persuaded that to extend the definition of legitimacy toinclude the child born of A.I.D. would be likely to encourage A.I.D. toany marked extent as is suggested in paragraph 167, particularly as thepresent practice is for the &quot; parents &quot; in registering the birth to register as
\^ ybir own child, and so to all appearances a legitimate child, one whoseconception may have been the result of A.I.D. However this may be, wethink that it would be wrong to depress the status of the child a childwho is to be brought up as a member of a family as a means of dis-ecouraging resort to A.I.D.14. All members of the committee agree that A.I.D. should not be pro-hibited by law. One of our witnesses, representing the Law Society whichconsidered it undesirable to make A.I.D. a criminal offence and accepted as a corollary the provision of full legitimacy for the child, on being askedwhether his position was that a community which was prepared to tolerateA.I.D. had a duty to protect the interests of the resultant children, answeredthat it was as simple as that.  Thus it is that we recommend that:  (i) the definition of legitimacy should be extended to include a childborn of A.I.D. to which the husband of the mother has consented;and(ii) for the purposes of registration of birth of such a child the husbandshould be deemed to be the father of the child.
APPENDIX IThe Law and Practice Overseas1. This appendix summarises the information obtained by the Committeeabout the law and practice of human artificial insemination in a number offoreign and Commonwealth countries. The information has been obtained fromenquiries made by the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office andthe Colonial Office at the request of the Committee; from correspondence whichthe Committee have had with medical practitioners and other persons abroad;and from published material.2. In no country are comprehensive statistics available and the informationobtainable is limited by the very nature of the practice. It has been established that in no country does the law specifically recognise artificial insemination ;accordingly no provision is made under the marriage, legitimacy, divorce orinheritance laws for dealing with A.I.D. or the offspring of A.I.D. There is littlecase law on these matters and in only a few countries is legislation beingconsidered.Commonwealth Countries and Colonial Territories3. The United Kingdom High Commissioners in all Commonwealth countries and the Governors of certain Colonial territories were asked to provide informa-tion, where available, about the law and practice of artificial insemination,particularly A.I.D. We were informed that A.I.D. was not known to be practisedin any of the Colonial territories or in Ghana, Malaya, Ceylon or the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Australia4. The practice of A.I.H. is not uncommon in Australia but A.I.D. is under-stood to be rare.Canada5. No information is available about the extent of the practice of A.I.D. inCanada.India6. The Government of India make a grant to an artificial insemination centreon the understanding that the centre undertakes A.I.H. only.7. There have recently been reports in Pakistan of children born as a resultof artificial insemination, and the Government of Pakistan have issued a statement to the effect that the practice is wholly repugnant to the moral and religiousvalues cherished by the great majority of the people of Pakistan and is unethicalin the eyes of the medical profession.New Zealand8. No information is available to the authorities in New Zealand about theextent of the practice. One witness seen by the Committee had carried out asmall amount of A.I.H. and A.I.D. in New Zealand for some years after the war,but no other doctors were known to undertake the practice at that time.South Africa9. The extent to which artificial insemination is practised in South Africa isnot known. Early in 1959 the Minister of Health said in the House of assembly that he was aware of all the dangers inherent in the practice of uncontrolledartificial insemination and that the first step to ensure control had already beentaken.   No legislation has so far been introduced.10. In the view of the South African Medical and Dental Council artificial insemination as such is not necessarily unethical from the medical standpoint. TheCouncil have, however, strictly isolated themselves from moral and legal con-siderations, and they have not drawn any distinction between A.I.H. and A.I.D.
\    iier CountriesAustria11. The practice of A.I.D. in Austria is extremely rare and there is apparentlylittle demand for it.Belgium12. We have received information that A.I.D. probably began in Belgiuma little over 20 years ago and that the annual number of births thought to bedue to the practice are unlikely to have exceeded a few dozen in any year.13. We have been in touch with one practitioner who has been responsiblefor about 20 cases of A.I.D. in 20 years. His procedure in selecting couples anddonors follows closely that of the practitioners in England. He reports thathe has been able to follow up all his cases and that the results have been excel-lent; the oldest child is now himself married. No psychological tension has been observed in A.I.D. families ; on the contrary, the tension resulting from theinfertility has been considerably reduced. In none of his cases has the child&apos;sorigin been disclosed.France14. It is believed that at the most a few thousand people in France owe theirorigin to artificial insemination.15. There is no legislation dealing with the subject but a Commission chargedwith reforming the Civil Code has proposed that while a husband should be ableto disown a child of his wife&apos;s if he can prove that he was absent at the timeof conception or can provide conclusive medical evidence that he was incapable of procreation, he should not be able to do so if it is established that the childwas conceived as a result either of A.I.H. or of A.I.D. to which he consented.The Commission also took the view that the practice of artificial inseminationwas not sufficiently widespread to justify regulation by the Civil Code.16. The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences were asked by the ConseilNational de 1&apos;Ordre des Medecins&apos; for advice on certain moral problems arising in the treatment of male sterility, and passed a resolution on 9th March, 1949, asfollows :that A.I.D. used to relieve sterility on the part of the husband raises in thehome such objections from the moral, legal and social point of view that itspractice ought to be strictly discountenanced.17. Artificial insemination was discussed at a Congress of the Federation desSocieties de gynecologie et d&apos;obstetrique de langue Francaise, held in Marseillesin September, 1957. A full report was prepared for use at the Congress, covering the medical, biological, psychological, social, moral, religious and legal aspectsof the practice. The report has been published together with the proceedings ofthe Congress and provides a certain amount of factual material, including thefollowing:A questionnaire was sent to 1,156 gynaecologists. Only 98 replied, of whom80 were from France and the others from abroad (including Belgium, Italy,U.S.A., Mexico and Finland). All considered A.I.H. to be morally right,with the exception of 2 who were against it, and 2 who were doubtful.Eighteen regarded A.I.D. as morally right and 22 admitted practising iton occasions, if not frequently. The majority were against A.I.D., althoughit is suggested in the report that those who practised it the most did not infact reply.Four accepted artificial insemination of unmarried women, and two othersthought it of doubtful legitimacy.Payment to donors in France was said to vary between 2,000 and 3,000francs per donation. In an attempt to compare the practice with donation of blood 30 regular blood donors were questioned, but scarcely one would accept the idea of semen donation.18. The report includes a table of some published figures for artificial insemi-&apos; nation, which mentions two French doctors ; in a publication of 1946 /. Vimeux
(had reported 33 A.I.D. cases, which produced 19 pregnancies, and in a publica^tof 1952 Fayolle reported A.I.D. cases resulting in 5 pregnancies. In addition,J. F. Marcel of Paris reported a 10 per cent, success rate with A.I.D. in his reply to the 1957 questionnaire, but without giving any figures of cases ; thisis greatly below the rate (50 to 60 per cent.) achieved in this country and theU.S.A.19. The report concludes that the subject is losing its interest and finding its proper level now that the rather exaggerated hopes it raised a few years agohave been to some extent disappointed.20. The subject of artificial insemination was submitted early in 1959 to oneof the technical committees associated with the Ministry of Public Health and population, namely the Maternity Commission of the Permanent Committee of social Health, composed of gynaecologists and obstetricians. A brief report was presented to the Maternity Commission by Dr. R. Merger, who had also been responsible for the legal section of the report presented to the Marseilles con-ference. His conclusion was that artificial insemination could not be discountedaltogether ; certain people thought it useful and desirable while others, includingmany doctors, rejected it on moral and religious grounds. Legislation however,would be premature and the matter was best left to the responsibility of the individuals involved.21. The Maternity Commission, having taken cognisance of Dr. Merger&apos;sreport, concluded that since the practice of artificial insemination was not legallyrecognised in France they should abstain from discussing the medical aspects.Federal German Republic22. According to our enquiries the problem of artificial insemination isnumerically insignificant in Germany. A.I.H. is probably attempted occasionallyin practically all large gynaecological clinics, but it is clear that the preponderance of German opinion is definitely against the practice of A.I.D. The GermanMedical Conference (Deutscher Arztetag), the most comprehensive organisationof the German medical profession, adopted a resolution in 1959 disapprovingof A.I.D. but allowing the practice of A.I.H. by the profession provided husband and wife both consented. The resolution went on to express the view that theprohibition of A.I.D. by law was not justified. The opinions expressed by themajority of the other German medical bodies agree with the first part of theresolution, but opinion is divided with regard to making the practice of A.I.D.criminal. The subject has from- time to time figures in the press or popularmagazines but it has not hitherto caused any general public discussion.Criminal Law23. In 1958, the question of prohibition of artificial insemination by legisla-tion was raised in some of the German legislatures. At the meeting of the bundestag on 12th lune, 1958, the Federal Minister of Justice was asked by amember about the attitude of the Federal Government with regard to prohibitionof artificial insemination ; the Minister replied that the Federal Government would examine the question when the recommendations of the Great Commission onPenal Law, which at present was dealing with this subject were forthcoming. Afew weeks later, on 9th July, 1958, the Bavarian legislature passed the followingresolution:&quot; The Bavarian Government is requested to approach the Federation withthe object of inducing them to issue legislation on the subject of artificial insemination in respect of human beings at an early date, and foremost to prohibit artificial insemination from donors other than the husband &quot;.24. In the meantime the Great Commission on Penal Law, a body set up bythe Federal Minister of Justice, has discussed the subject of artificial inseminationin extenso. It has recommended that the new Criminal Code should include aspecial Article prohibiting the practice of A.I.D. but permitting A.I.H. TheCommission has furthermore recommended that penal legislation on artificial
Humiliation should ibe passed soon, before the new Criminal Code is being dealtth as a whole.   It remains to be seen whether the Federal Government willcomply with this recommendation.Civil Law25. We understand that the view is taken that circumstances do not requirenew legislation on the effects of artificial insemination in the field of civil law.Israel26. The legal implications of human artificial insemination in questions of marriage, divorce, legitimacy and inheritance are not dealt with in any secularlegislation of the State of Israel. All questions of Jewish marriage and divorceare the prerogative of the religious rabbinical courts, whose decisions are based,not upon statutory legislation but upon the religious law.27. The religious law has been held to prohibit A.I.D. No firm pronounce-ment has been made about A.I.H.D. It seems possible that there will be noreligious objection to the use of the husbands semen combined with the seminalplasma of a donor1.28. We have been in touch with one practitioner in Israel who has undertaken400 A.I.D. cases since 1938 and who claims that 192 pregnancies have resulted.141 infants have been born. No comprehensive follow-up investigation has been undertaken but it is hoped with the help of psychiatrists, social workers etc. todo so in the near future. Some information has been obtained about many ofthe couples, however, and the practitioners impression is that they are happy.Only two are known to have divorced and 60 couples are known to have had twoor more children by A.I.D.29. The total number of A.I.D. cases in the country is not available, but weare informed that other physicians also undertake the practice and that thedemand is growing.Italy30. No information about the extent of the practice of artificial inseminationin Italy is available, but the subject has foeen given considerable publicity in theItalian press as a result of a court case which has continued for some years.In 1956, a woman gave birth to a child while separated from her hushand. Shewas charged with adultery (a criminal offence in Italy) and her defence was thatshe had been artificially inseminated by a doctor with the seed of a man otherthan her husband. According to a Press report, she had sworn not to revealthe identity of the doctor, and he did not appear in court.31. The local magistrate decided (in November, 1958) that there was in-sufficient proof of adultery and dismissed the charge. The Public Prosecutorappealed to a higher court, which, in March, 1959, reversed the magistratesdecision and sentenced the woman to 20 days&apos; imprisonment. The main purportof the judgment of the court was to show, by reference to (a) the rights given tohusbands under Italian law, (b) the Catholic doctrine of marriage and (c) theviews of other countries on artificial insemination (including the report of the archbishop of Canterburys Commission), that A.I.D. &quot;represents a penal and moral infringement &quot; and can be classified as adultery. The court was howeverable to decide that the woman had committed adultery without deciding thequestion whether or not A.I.D. was administered.32. We understand that this case will eventually be taken to the Supreme Courtof Cassation.33. Proibably as a consequence of this case two private Bills (one prohibitingA.LD. and the other prohibiting A.I.H. and A.I.D.) have been discussed by the health Commission of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. It is understood that asingle combined Bill is to be drafted for presentation to the Chamber of Deputies.i See paragraph 70 of the report.
The Netherlands34. The extent of the practice of artificial insemination in Holland is not known precisely, but it has been estimated by Dr. Schellen1 that the number ofchildren born between 1948 and 1957 inclusive as a result of artificial inseminationis as follows :With semen from husband (A.I.H.)-300-400.With semen from a donor (A.I.D.) 150-200.With mixed semen from husband and donor i(A.LH.D.) at most a few dozen.With mixed semen from two or more donors (A.I.D.D.) at most a fewdozen.35. A special commission set up by the Board for Public Health is investi-gating the problem of artificial insemination and is expected to report shortly.We had hoped to have an opportunity of studying their report before completingour own but it has not so far been made available to us.Scandinavia36. It is convenient to summarise the position in Norway, Sweden and Den-mark together since the Governments of all three countries set up committees at about the same time to consider the legal implications of human artificial insemination. The three committees reported in 1953, recommending legislation,but in no country has the recommendation been acted upon.Norway37. In Norway the Committee majority put forward a draft of a law govern-ing artificial insemination ; the majority also proposed that the law should be amended to enable a husband to ofotain a divorce if his wife, without his consent,allowed herself to become pregnant through A.I.D.38. The report states that there had definitely been 22 children borne as aresult of artificial insemination (both A.I.H. and A.I.D.) in Norway up to theend of 1948, but that the actual total must certainly have been greater.39. The draft law proposed by the majority of the committee amounts to approval of the practice of A.I.D. under certain safeguards. It is made to apply only to married women ; and only specially qualified doctors are permitted tocarry out the insemination, in hospitals which would be officially recognised. the husband must give his consent in writing ; and husband and wife must not be under the age of twenty^five. There must not be any insemination undertakenif, by reason of existing inheritable conditions, there is an evident danger of the child or his descendants eventually suffering from serious mental or bodilyailments or defects ; and it is further stipulated that the husband and wife must,on the basis of the doctor&apos;s opinion, possess the qualifications for bringing upthe child in a proper manner. Anonymity must be ensured ; and the anonymousthird party must not be a close blood-relation of the woman concerned, i.e., notin the line of direct descent, and not her brother or half-brother. The child is granted the ordinary legal rights of a child born after a normal conception.The donor is not liable in any way for the support of the child or its mother.The obligation of secrecy particularly applicable to the medical practitionerconcerned is specifically declared. Anyone committing, or contributing to, a breach of this law would be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a term ofnot more than one year.40. The minority of two who did not support the draft law favoured thestatus quo. They disapproved of AJLD. on ethical and social grounds butconsidered that to make it illegal would not be effective and would only draw the attention of the public to the practice.Sweden41. The Committee set up by the Swedish Government reached broadly similarconclusions to the majority report of the Norwegians. A.I.H. was accepted as not presenting any legal problems and they did not consider that A.I.D. should See paragraph 10 of the report.
fj* forbidden. They appreciated that any form of legislation short of completerohibition would create more favourable conditions for A.I.D. and although they did not want to encourage the practice by legislation they considered never-theless that there were good grounds for some legislation. They proposed thatthe circumstances in which the legal presumption of legitimacy might be set aside should be supplemented in such a way that the presumption in the case ofa child born as a result of A.I.D. with the husband&apos;s consent could not beremoved through a suit brought by the husband. They further proposed thatA.I.D. should only be carried out by doctors possessed of special training ingynaecology and then only in hospitals or similar institutions ; that the doctorsshould be responsible for the selection of the donors (though they did not wishto exclude donors known to the couple) ; and that there should be an obligation on all parties to maintain secrecy. As regards the artificial insemination ofunmarried women, the Committee took the view that it would be wrong tointroduce prohibitive legislation.42. We have been informed that the total number of A.I.D. births in Swedensince the practice began sometime after 1940 is estimated at between 50 and 100and that there is at present no indication that the practice is increasing. the criteria adopted for the selection of couples include social and psychologicalfitness, good character and relative economic stability. Donors must be ofexcellent physical and psychological health, and married men who have fatheredhealthy children are preferred. No systematic follow-up has been undertakenbecause it is thought to be unnecessary interference in the normal and healthyprogress of family life, but certain information has been obtained in many ofthe cases and there is no knowledge of any unsatisfactory results.Denmark43. The Danish Committee also reached the conclusion, as did the otherScandinavian countries, that the misgivings advanced by the churches and others were not sufficient grounds for prohibiting A.I.D. They considered that it wouldbe best, even although there were only a small number of cases, for the practice to be regulated by law and they proposed legislation broadly similar to that proposed by both the Norwegian and Swedish Committees. Unlike the norwegians, however, they did not preclude the insemination of single women in certain special circumstances.United States of AmericaPractice44. We have received information from a number of individual A.I.D. practi-practitioners in the U.S.A. and, as the practice is more prevalent there than in anyother country, more information has been available from publications. It appearsthat, while there were isolated cases during the latter part of the 19th century,A.I.D. was not performed to any extent in the U.S.A. before the 1920s. Fromthe information we have received it appears that over 10,000 A.I.D. childrenmay have been born in the U.S.A. since the practice began. The AmericanSociety for the Study of Sterility have given the practice their blessing, as anethical, moral and desirable practice if requested by the couple.45. From the particulars given by the practitioners with whom we have beenin touch there would appear to be no fundamental difference between the methods and criteria used by the American practitioners and those employed in thiscountry. Some emphasise that they will only accept husbands who are &quot; irrepar-ably &quot; sterile, while others are prepared to do A.I.D. in cases of oligospefmia. Allpractitioners stress that the marriage should be stable and some reject as many as 40 per cent, of the applicants as not &quot; good parent material&quot;. Perhaps thetwo most notable differences from British practice are first the type of donor,who often seems to be a medical student or house doctor, and secondly themore elaborate written agreements signed by the couple, inter alia&quot; absolvingthe doctor from responsibility for faults and undertaking to bring up the childas their own.  A further difference, we understand, is, that donors are frequently
paid, as indeed are Mood donors in the United States. None of the practitionWwith whom we corresponded, volunteered information on this aspect, but some ofour witnesses told us of their personal knowledge of the practice in the U.S.A.,and Dr. Schellen reports in his book1 that payment varies between five and fiftydollars per donation and perhaps averages between fifteen and twenty-fivedollars.46. Eight practitioners have given us information to the effect that they havebeen responsible for a total of over a thousand pregnancies up to 1959. Themaximum for one practitioner was over 300, which represented a conception rateof about 70 per cent. The conception rate achieved by another practitioner was rather under 50 per cent. One donor was reported as being responsible for as many as 35 births. Follow up action has been taken by some practitioners andnot by others ; one insists on return visits to which over 75 per cent, of hispatients have agreed and he reports ithat in only one per cent, of his oases havethe couple subsequently divorced and not because of A.I.D. compared with adivorce rate of 1 in 20 in his State. Another, who has had fewer cases, followsup by personal home visits over a period of several years ; the oldest child isnow ten and he reports that couples are delighted with the interest shown.Another told us that he has observed the subsequent growth and reactions of the families over many years with no regrets or dissatisfaction in any case andanother that he has never experienced an unfavourable emotional result.Law47. Due to the higher incidence of the practice of A.I.D. in the U.S.A., itis not surprising that a number of cases involving A.I.D. have arisen in the courts of the U.S.A. Four that have come to our notice may be briefly summarisedas follows : Strnad v. Strnad (Supreme Court of New York County, 1947)48. The couple had been judicially separated and the wife asked the court to restrain the husband from visiting the child who, she alleged, was not the husband&apos;s child but the product of A.I.D. to which the husband had consented.49. The court declared that the husband retained the right to visit the child.It held that the child had been potentially adopted or semi-adopted by the husband, who was entitled to the same rights as those acquired by a fosterparent who had formally adopted a child, if not the same rights as a naturalparent. Assuming that the husband had consented to A.I.D. the child was notillegitimate, and the court considered the situation analogous to that of a childborn out of wedlock who was legitimated on the marriage of &quot; the interested parties &quot;.   The court expressed no opinion on the propriety of A.I.D.Hoch v. Hoch (Cook County, Illinois, 1949)50. Divorce was granted on the ground of adultery, but A.I.D. appears to havebeen mentioned, since the court took the opportunity of declaring that A.I.D.would not support a judgment that adultery had been committed or an action for divorce.Ohlson v. Ohlson (Cook County, Illinois, November, 1954)51. The wife sought to restrain the husband from visiting the child whomshe alleged was born of A.I.D. The gynaecologist who had performed A.I.D.gave evidence but he was unable to state positively that (the husband could notbe the biological father. The court decided that the presumption of legitimacywas not rebutted.Doornbos v. Doornbos (Cook County, Illinois, 1954-55)52. The wife petitioned for divorce and apparently asked the court for a&quot; declaratory judgment &quot; as to whether A.I.D. constituted adultery, whether it was contrary to public policy and whether the child was legitimate. The courtdeclared that A.I.D. (with or without the husband&apos;s consent) was contrary to public policy and good morals and did constitute adultery and that the childwas illegitimate. In this case it is understood that medical evidence showed the husband to be sterile and that he had consented to A.I.D.
P53. It should be borne in mind that none of the above four cases has beenthe Appeal Court of the State concerned, and that only Strnad v. Strnadreached the Supreme Court of the County.54. There is no statute in any of the States of the U.S.A. dealing specificallywith artificial insemination. Bills were introduced in the States of New York(1948 and 1950), Virginia (1948), Wisconsin (1949) and Indiana (1949) providing that an A.I.D. child conceived with the husbands consent should be legitimate.The New York (1950) and Indiana Bills also provided an official procedure forfiling the husbands consent. One Bill introduced in Minnesota (1949) declaredA.I.D. to be illegal, but the children legitimate, and another Bill declared it tobe lawful on certain conditions. A Bill introduced in Ohio (1955) would havemade A.I.D. illegal (and the children illegitimate) and subject to a fine of up to500 dollars and imprisonment for from 1 to 5 years. None of these Bills passed into law.55. The Sanitary Code of New York City was amended in 1947 to includeRegulations governing the use of donors, which inter aha, require A.I.D. practi-practitioners to keep certain records, accessible only to the Department of Health &quot; andsuch other persons as may be authorised by law to inspect such records &quot;. Inaddition, the City adopted a resolution to the effect that no one other than a qualified physician should perform artificial insemination.56. In 1953 a committee appointed by the Office of the Legislative Council ofthe California State Assembly prepared a report relating to the legal problems arising from the artificial insemination of human beings. The conclusion of theCommittee was &quot; that the practice of artificial insemination of human beingswas not of widespread use and that the present laws relating to presumptionsof legitimacy of children, as found in the Code of Civil Procedure of this State,provide ample protection for all concerned &quot;. The opinion of the committeewas that no legislation in the field of human artificial insemination was neededat that time. (It should be noted that in California the presumption of legitimacyis irrebuttable if the husband is living with the wife and is not impotent.)
