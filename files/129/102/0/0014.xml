SECRET u        4 nci(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 114 COPY NO.    j^j,14th July, I960CABINETSTATE OPENING OF parliament memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department the British Broadcasting Corporation (B. B. C. ) have applied for permission to televise the State Opening of the next session of Parliament.This has been considered by the Home Affairs Committee, whose view isthat the State Opening should be broadcast not more than once in eachParliament.    Since this was impracticable in the first session of thepresent Parliament, the Committee feel that it would be preferable that livetelevision of the State Opening should be carried out, not in the next, butin a later session.    It might otherwise prove impossible to refuse a furtherbroadcast before the end of the Parliament, when the question whetherfacilities were to be granted to the B. B. C. or the Independent television authority (I. T. A. ) might have become more acute and more embarrassing.2.      The Committee are, however, attracted by the proposal that acolour film of the State Opening should be made.     This would give a far more vivid impression of the ceremony itself and would be of much valueoverseas.    It could, if either the B. B. C. or the I. T. A.  so desired, be broadcast afterwards in black-and-white.    Tests have been made in the palace of Westminster, which indicate that a satisfactory colour filmcould be made without any undue intensity of lighting or interference withthe ceremony.     The Lord Great Chamberlin is willing to agree.3.      We therefore invite the Cabinet to agree:-(a) That the B. B. C&apos;s application for permission to televisethe State Opening of the next session should be refused.(b) That, subject to The Queen&apos;s concurrence, a colour filmor films of the ceremony should be made which could,if desired, be broadcast in black-and-white.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W. 1.14th July, I960.
