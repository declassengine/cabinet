Printed for the Cabinet. July I960C. (60) 117 Copy No.    0 O18th July, 1960CABINETRATING AND HOUSING policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Housing Policy Committee have considered proposals put forward by theMinister of Housing for (a) the full rerating of industry in 1963;(b) some relief for householders from the impact of the revaluation in thatyear;(c) a scheme of Government loans to housing associations, for the building ofhouses to let;(d) a complete reshaping of the present system of housing subsidies.The Committee have not been able, in the time available, to reach final conclusions on all the issues involved; but Cabinet decisions are needed at once, in order that work may proceed. The Ministers proposals and, in particular, their relativetiming raise delicate political issues which are discussed at the end of this report.Revaluation for Rates2. Industry. In England and Wales the next revaluation for rates will takeplace in 1963. Under the law as it now stands, all houses and flats, which are atpresent assessed on 1939 values, will then automatically be re-assessed on currentvalues; and shops, offices and other commercial premises, at present assessed on current values, will lose the 20 per cent, relief from rate liability they have enjoyedsince 1957. The Committee consider that the occasion should be taken to bringindustry and freight transport (which in this context means docks but not british railways) back to full rating.3. In 1929 the rate liability of industry and freight transport was reduced to25 per cent, as a stimulus to production. This liability was raised to 50 per cent, in1959 and the Committee are satisfied that the time has now come to restore it infull. Not only is there no longer any economic case for continued relief, but, withthe re-assessment of houses and flats, industry&apos;s share of the rate burden would fallif it retained 50 per cent, derating: even with full rerating, industry&apos;s share is unlikely to increase, because of the effect of revaluation on other classes of property.The abolition of relief will no doubt cause protests but the burden of rates on industry is not great and experience of the last increase in liability leads us not to expect serious trouble.4. Rerating will reduce industry&apos;s contribution to general taxation and it will therefore be necessary to consider in due course whether there should be acompensating reduction in the Exchequer grant to local authorities.5. Agriculture. We do not propose the rerating of agriculture: the smalladdition to the total rate revenue would not justify the serious political difficultyinvolved and the effect of the operation would have to be taken into account inthe Farm Price Review.
.6. Houses and Flats-Thc revaluation may effect something like a threefoldincrease in householders&apos; assessments. This will, of course, be to some extentoff-set by reductions in rate poundages. But, while estimates at this stage can beno more than conjectural, such indications as we have suggest that, even with fullrerating of industry and commerce, the householders&apos; share of the rate burdenmight be increased from less than 50 per cent, to more than 60 per cent, and what is politically more significant that individual householders might be facedwith an increase of as much as 25 per cent, in their actual disbursements (excluding any additional increase due to a rise in the total rates levied).7. This will, without question, call for some measure of relief by way of temporary derating. The relief could be effected by special legislation in the session of 1961-2, when the general level of the new assessments will be known;but a preferable method would be to take power in the Bill which the committee epropose for the rerating of industry to introduce a measure of derating for houses and fiats by Ministerial order subject to affirmative resolution. If Parliament canbe persuaded to accept an unrestricted power to act by order, we think that thatwould be preferable to specifying in the Bill either a maximum percentage ofderating which might be ordered or that relief was not to be given unless thehouseholders&apos; share of the total rate burden exceeded a given proportion.8. The Committee are satisfied that, if industry is to be rerated in 1963 andthe revaluation on that basis is to be completed in time, the Bill must be introduced at the beginning of next Session. The order effecting derating of houses and flatswould be made some time in 1962.9. Scotland. These two proposals industrial rerating and derating ofhouses raise peculiarly difficult problems for Scotland because in that country the next revaluation is due in 1961, two years earlier than in England and Wales.We are satisfied that a further complete revaluation in 1963 would be whollyimpracticable and a revaluation of industrial properties alone in that or thefollowing year would put them out of step with commercial and residentialassessments. The Secretary of State would, therefore prefer to postpone industrialrerating in Scotland to 1966, when the next revaluation but one is due. The othermembers of the Committee, however, feel that so long a time-lag between theoperation in England and Wales and in Scotland could not be defended.Differential rating as a method of assisting industry in particular areas is a principlewe cannot accept; and the deferment would provoke pressure for increasedExchequer grant to Scottish local authorities to compensate for the relatively less favourable position in which they would be left. The Secretary of State is thereforeconsidering various means by which the time-lag could be avoided or at leastreduced.10. Secondly, Scotland will be embarrassed by the timing of the proposed legislation on derating for householders. The English Bill will need to be beforeParliament just at the time that the next Scottish revaluation is coming into effect and will therefore raise difficult questions on the timing and extent of parallel actionin Scotland. On this the Secretary of State is therefore obliged to reserve hisposition.Rented Houses11. The Cabinet are already aware of the proposal by the Minister of Housingthat the Government should take power to make long-term loans at the currentPublic Works Loans Board rate of interest to housing associations or trusts, toenable them to build houses for letting. Since the war there has been virtually nobuilding to let and no significant advance in this direction can at present be expected from private enterprise. There is, however, a real need for more houses availablefor renting, beyond those provided by local authorities, and the Housing PolicyCommittee regard the Ministers proposal as an attractive one and politicallyvaluable. It would, moreover, offer the only feasible answer to the Opposition^policy of municipaiisation by enabling the housing associations, in addition to building new houses, to buy up, modernise and manage houses which are now being allowed to deteriorate into slums by neglectful landlords.12. The scheme, if adopted, would be made subject to stringent safeguards.There would be close Ministerial control over the number and type of houses built by the associations and, since they would be counted against the public programme,
they would not increase our total investment in housing. The scheme would be of limited duration and would in any event be unlikely to produce for some time morethan a few pilot experiments.13. On the other hand it would unquestionably constitute a new Exchequercommitment and the Committee accept the Chancellor^ warning that our commitments over the next few years must if possible be reduced or at least not increased. Furthermore, with the history of rent restriction, risk capital is not forthcoming for building houses to let at the return which could be obtained:people do not pay high enough rents to make it worth while. Therefore, if theExchequer does provide or guarantee the money at normal Exchequer rates ofinterest, it is in fact subsidising the houses which the associations would be building.14. The Committee have so far been unable to reach finality on this issue.The possibility of devising adequate safeguards which would reduce the Exchequercommitment to a tolerable level is being explored. If no way of doing this canbe found, an alternative would be to prepare a detailed plan on the lines proposedby the Minister of Housing and, if financial circumstances improved, announce itlater in Parliament as part of our forward policy.Housing Subsidies15. The Cabinet have already indicated their general acceptance of theoutline of the Minister^ proposals to reshape the present system of housing subsidies. The purpose of these is to adjust the amount of subsidy payable tothe financial need of each local authority at any given time and, in the process, to force up those local authority rents which are being held at an artificially low level.Briefly, a standard rate of subsidy would be payable for all purposes (other than over-spill and the housing of incoming industrial workers) that is, for general needs,including the relief of over-crowding and the housing of old people, as well as forslum clearance. (Some members of the Committee are a little doubtful aboutre-introducing any subsidy for general needs and this is to be further considered.)Subsidy would be payable at the full rate only to those local authorities, at present about one in four, who satisfied the proposed test of financial need that is, thattheir housing account would not be in balance even if their total rent income were at least twice the gross value of their existing houses (2 G.V.). This rent-standardis the same as that applied to private letting by the Rent x\ct of 1957 and would thus bring private and council rents for the first time into line. The standard rateof subsidy would be specially adjusted upwards in favour of local authorities withan exceptionally low rate income or an exceptionally large slum clearance problem.And it would be adjusted downwards, or withheld altogether, where the localauthority failed to satisfy the new test.16. The immediate effect of this arrangement would be to reduce the total amount of subsidy payable, as compared with what would result from continuation of the present system. But many local authorities whose rents were below 2 G.V.would at once begin to increase them, though no doubt at varying speeds, in orderagain to qualify for subsidy. When their rents had reached the necessary level andthey had used up on further building any surplus in their housing accountsaccumulated from past subsidies or subvention from the rates, they would become eligible for the full rate and at some point the total Exchequer expenditure would exceed the level which the present system would produce17. The same general plan would apply to Scotland but, since housing thereis in general worse than in England and Wales, it would probably be necessary toadopt a higher standard rate of subsidy and to make greater use of weighting infavour of slum clearance. There would be no embarrassment in this, especially asthe practice for many years has been to legislate separately on housing subsidies inScotland.18. The Committee have considered these proposals from both the economicand the political angle. The economy is to some extent distorted by the artificiallylow level of many local authority rents and we are satisfied that both the objective of forcing them up and the proposed method of doing so are right. But the crucialpoint is, of course, the amount of the new subsidy. The Minister of Housing has at present in mind an annual sum of about  20 or  25 per house but further workwill be needed before the figure can be determined and it will in any case depend on what result, for the Exchequer, we intend to achieve.

The Minister of Housing has at present in mind an annual sum of about  20 or  25 per house but further workwill be needed before the figure can be determined and it will in any case depend on what result, for the Exchequer, we intend to achieve.  In the short run the newSECRET57362 b 2
system would, on the Minister^ figure, result at first in a reduction and later in anincrease in the Exchequer commitment as compared with the present (on theassumption that the public housing programme continued at its present level, though in the longer run the completion of slum clearance in many parts of the country should lead to some run-down). Averaged over a period the Exchequercommitment could be held at its present level, reduced or (in theory) increased andthis would be determined by the amount of the standard subsidy.19. There was considerable support in the Committee for the view that thegeneral balance of the economy and the increasing expenditure which must result from existing commitments in particular, education-demanded some reductionin the scale of public expenditure on housing. On the other hand we are deeply committed to progress on slum clearance, the case for more houses to relieve grossover-crowding and for old people is almost equally strong, and a great deal ofbuilding therefore remains to be done. These factors point to maintaining theExchequer commitment at approximately its present level, though it would in anycase be the intention to provide for review of the amount of the standard subsidynot later than 1965. Clearly these issues require much further thought, which neednot, however, hold up work on the details of the new plan and preparation of thelegislation.20. Politically the plan poses a difficult question. A sharp increase in councilrents in most of Greater London and many of the big cities is liable to cause anoutcry. On the other hand, if the legislation were introduced in the New Year of1961, rents would not begin to go up until towards the end of that year. Thegreatest impact of the increases would probably come in 1962, and that is theyear in which we shall be announcing the global effect of revaluation onhouseholders and the steps we propose to mitigate it. Moreover, all ratepayersother than council tenants will certainly welcome our putting an end to theunnecessary subsidisation of that minority, and the move will do nothing but goodin the many country areas where rents are already on or above the 2 G.V. level by enabling the authorities to build such new houses as they need to build withouttoo heavy a burden on the rates. While, therefore, we cannot ignore the possible effect of a Bill on public opinion in the early part of 1961, the Committee thinkthat, on balance, legislation in the next Session is the best course. As suggestedbelow, it would be more difficult in a later Session of the present Parliament andwithout it we cannot hope to prepare the way for further progress towards theremoval of general rent control.Relative Timing of the Different Proposals21. The next three years will bring us, in the field covered by this report, anumber of political discomforts. To begin with, all the evidence suggests that inthis coming winter the final working out of the decontrol provisions of the RentAct, 1957, is going to cause us a great deal of trouble which we can do nothing toavoid: we cannot affect the timing and we can do nothing more to mitigate theeffects of the Act. At the same time as we are facing this trouble we shall have todeal in Parliament with the legislation to abolish industrial derating. But this is,if anything, in our favour, because not only will industrial derating be to theadvantage of householders but the Bill will also (if the Committee&apos;s proposal is accepted) hold out the prospect of some mitigation for householders of the effectof the revaluation. We could not defend postponing into the next Parliament the revaluation for rates due in 1963, so that in that year, within sight of the next general Election, all householders will have their rate payments increased: we canmodify the increase but, without giving an indefensibly high measure of relief, wecannot nullify it.22. At what point can the increase in council rents best be fitted in?Although, as suggested in paragraph 20, its effects on public opinion should be by no means wholly unfavourable, the Committee do not feel that it would be wise to allow its full impact to coincide with the increase in rates: that would intensifyhostile reaction and tend to offset favourable ones. We should, therefore, arrangefor the main increase in council rents to come in 1962 and this means legislationnext Session. To include two major and contentious Bills Rating and Housing-in an already overloaded programme will in itself add to our difficulties but theCommittee&apos;s conclusion is that that is the course which is open to the leastobjection.
23. Since the appropriate rent test for Scotland comparable to the 2 G.V.proposed for England and Wales cannot be settled until the results of the 1961Scottish revaluation are known, a Scottish Bill on housing subsidies could not becarried through next session. As the increase in rates resulting from revaluationin Scotland takes effect in 1961, however, the desirability of avoiding coincidencewith an increase in rent resulting from new subsidy legislation means that Scottishlegislation should not in any event be undertaken before 1961-62.Summary24.   The Housing Policy Committee invite the Cabinet to agree (a) that industrial derating should be abolished in England and Wales at thedate of the next revaluation in 1963, and in Scotland in the same year or as soon as possible thereafter;(b) that, at least for England and Wales the Bill effecting this should empower the Government to lighten the impact of the revaluation on householdersby a temporary measure of derating (of an extent not specified in theBill and to be effected by Ministerial order in 1962);(c) that the system of housing subsidies, both in England and Wales and inScotland, should be reshaped on lines already considered by the Cabinet,so as to ensure that subsidies are adjusted to the financial position ofeach local authority and that artificially low council rents are forcedup into line with private rents;(d) that for England and Wales both the Rating and Valuation Bill and theHousing Bill should be introduced in the Session of 1960-61. TheScottish Housing Bill should be deferred until 1961-62.25.   Outstanding questions requiring further consideration are (a) the timing of industrial rerating in Scotland;(b) the extent (if any) and the timing of derating of householders in Scotland;(c) if the Cabinet approve the proposals on housing subsidies, the details ofthe new system and, in particular, the amount of the subsidy and the levelof the Exchequers future commitment to housing;(d) the Minister of Housing&apos;s proposals for Government loans to enablehousing associations to build houses to let.R.
