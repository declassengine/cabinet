Printed for the Cabinet.   July I960C. (60) 112 Copy No.    5 815th July, 1960CABINETPUBLIC INVESTMENT programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerDecisions are now required about the programmes to be fixed for 1961-62, andthe provisional planning figures to be used for programmes for 1962-63. the annexed Table gives details of the estimated outturn for 1959-60 and the proposals put forward by Departments for public sector investment in 1961-62 and later years.General Approach2. In the past two years public sector investment has been growing very fast.This has largely been the outcome of our plans to strengthen the economy and topull out of the 1958 recession. From  1,470 millions in 195SV-59, the total has risen to  1,620 millions in 1959-60 and a programme of  1,730 millions (latest estimate) in the current year, 1960-61. The rate of increase has slackenedconsiderably since the beginning of the year.3. My colleagues will recall that I informed them on 21st June that a restriction of public sector investment was one of the ways by which I hoped to restrain home demand. In the light of this, I announced in the House on 23rd Junethat the Government were arranging that the programme of expenditure on investment in the public sector for 1961-62 would be held at the level of the current programme for the present financial year.4. Some of my colleagues have already been able to assist me to relieve the immediate pressure on the economy by marginal reductions in the current year. I am grateful to them.Programmes for the Year 1961-625. The proposals for next year, 1961-62, total, in round figures,  1,760millions. The task now before us is to make such adjustments as will reduce this figure by  30 millions and so bring it down to the level of the current year.6. Officials have been discussing where the necessary adjustments might best be made. They have looked at the programmes which offer scope for adjustmenteither because of their size or because they contain a high proportion of short-termbuilding. I have been anxious not to bear too hardly on programmes which havebeen held back severely over a long period.SECRET57336 J5
7. Subject to the decision of Ministers on the exercise as a whole, there isagreement at the official level that the following adjustments can be made in theproposals for programmes 1-10 below for 1961-62:Q Vi- i C(1) Atomic Energy Authority (including Dragonproject) ...............(2) Post Office     ...............(3) Housing (England and Wales)     ......(4) Water (England and Wales)        ......(5) Sewerage (England and Wales)    ......(6) Education (England and Wales)   ......(7) Local Health and Welfare Services (Englandand Wales)    ...............(8) Electricity Council   ............(9) National Coal Board .........(10) Gas Council..............(11) Central   Government   small(paragraph 9 below)......(12) Local     Authority     small(paragraph 9 below)............(13) Roads and British Transport Commission(paragraphs 10 and 11)      .........programmesprogrammesOriginalProposal  millions45-599-5239-441-3\50-1/122-518-0321-0&quot;)100-0 y47-0 J80-673-6SuggestedReduction  millions1452224226Total ......... 308.   I ask my colleagues to confirm their agreement to these reductions.Small Programmes9. The Central Government and Local Authority small programmes cover a wide variety of items such as prisons, fire stations, airports, land drainage, town halls,leisure services, married quarters, slaughterhouses. These include programmesreferred to in paragraph 6 where past restrictions have been severe and upon whichI do not wish to be hard: but I cannot except them altogether and it should bepossible to find these small savings without undue trouble. If my colleaguesapprove the overall reductions suggested, I propose that officials be left to workout details. Some will not be finally determined until the Estimates for next year are under consideration.Roads and the British Transport Commission10. The figures of estimated investment under these heads are subject to special uncertainties. Railway investment plans and expenditure may well be significantly affected by the work of the Special Advisory Group on the british transport Commission. A figure of  240 millions for 1961-62 has been submittedby the Commission ( 190 millions for railways and  50 millions for other undertakings). Adequate explanation of these figures is not yet available and inthe circumstances I think I must for present purposes assume a figure of about 200 millions, i.e., roughly the amount of expenditure last year. The road programme is the subject of a separate paper which will be discussed separately.In the meantime the attached table repeats for subsequent years the current programme for 1961-62 of  80 millions for roads. (This figure includes theExchequer expenditure of  65 millions for England and Wales,  10 millions forScotland and  5 millions found by local authorities.)11. I consider that expenditure on roads and the British transport commission together should in 1961-62 be rather less than the level of  280 millionsassumed above. I propose, therefore, that in 1961-62, whatever we decide on roads,the total expenditure for roads and the Commission together should be at least 6 millions less than this, and that I should pursue separately with the Ministerof Transport how it should be divided. If it is decided to increase expenditure on roads, the Commission should be reduced by at least the same amount. However,an even larger reduction may be appropriate when railway investment policy hasbeen reassessed.The Year 1962-6312. My present anxieties relate mainly to 1961-62. Bearing in mind the stability we shall be achieving in 1961-62, it may be that we shall be able to
undertake some increase in public sector investment in 1962-63. The total of theproposals shown in the table is  1,790 millions, an increase of  60 millions over thelevel I am now proposing for 1961-62. At this stage I see no reason to rule out such an increase as being impossible, but I must express my anxiety at the prospective general burden on the public finances. I want to minimise the possibilityof a situation arising in Which it might become necessary to ask for programmes to be cut at a later stage. In short, I hope to avoid the difficulty we -are now inwhich, incidentally, has been accentuated by the large increase in the 1961-62proposals above the levels provisionally approved last year. In fact the figure has risen from  1,700 millions to  1,760 millions.13. The right course for 1962-63 seems to me to determine within the total figure proposed for each programme a minimum to be provisionally approved thisyear which there would then be no question of cutting later save in the most exceptional circumstances. The remainder would be carried out if circumstances permit. This procedure will assist Departments in planning ahead, and at the sametime enable us to retain a margin of flexibility until the course of the economy isclearer. I suggest that officials be asked to work out the details and report to ministers in the autumn. Any immediate commitments should be made with this procedure in mind.Forthcoming White Paper14. I must remind my colleagues that I have promised to publish a white paper on Public Sector Investment later this year. This is part of the Governmentsexpressed intention to follow up some of the Radcliffe Committee&apos;s proposals aboutimproving the flow of financial and economic information; it will also enableParliament to discuss public sector investment programmes. (The White Paper will show the provisional out-turn for 1959-60 and the programmes for 1960-61 and1961-62. It will be for consideration in due course whether the programmesprovisionally approved for 1962-63 should also be included.) It is therefore most desirable that we take decisions now about the level of expenditure on these programmes, and bear in mind that the figures so determined will be published inthe White Paper.Conclusions.15.   I invite my colleagues id) To approve the figure of  1,730 millions for total public sector investment in 1961-62.(b) To agree that individual proposals should be adjusted on the lines proposedin paragraphs 7-11 above.(c) To agree that officials should examine further the proposals for 1962-63 onthe basis proposed in paragraph 13.D.
