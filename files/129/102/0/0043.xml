VISIT TO AFRICA BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE for commonwealth RELATIONSRECORD OF A CONVERSATION HELD AT CHEQUERS on saturday, 24th SEPTEMBER, 1960At Chequers on Saturday, 24th September, 1960, the commonwealth secretary reported to the Prime Minister on his recent visit to Africa. TheColonial Secretary was also present and Mr. Trend, Treasury, and Mr. Bishop,Cabinet Office, were in attendance. The following were the main points made inhis report and in the resulting discussion.GhanaPresident Nkrumah was a volatile character and clearly hoped to becomeleader of a United States of Black Africa, but all the same he gave a general impression of goodwill. In order to influence the uncommitted States his prestigewould be very valuable and it would pay us to cultivate him, remembering allthe time, however, that in due course Nigeria might become much more important than Ghana.The idea of a Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting on disarmament,which had arisen in the conversation between the Commonwealth Secretary and president Nkrumah, should be pursued. The Prime Ministers speech at theUnited Nations might well give the lead here, and he would try to see theCommonwealth group in New York both before and after that speech.President Nkrumah and South AfricaPresident Nkrumah had admitted that the Ghanaian boycott of South Africangoods had not proved very effective but he thought it important all the same asa symbol. It appeared that he had been thinking in the same way about thequestion of South African membership of the Commonwealth in the event of herbecoming a Republic. He had thought that a vote against continued South Africanmembership would be a gesture, but an ineffective one. When the commonwealth secretary had told him that such a gesture might break up the Commonwealth hehad said (and repeated on a later occasion) that he did not wish to risk damagingthe unity of the Commonwealth. He had even asked the commonwealth secretary not to give to Dr. Verwoerd the impression that there would be any greatdifficulty about continued South African membership in case this should lead theSouth African Prime Minister not to apply for membership.South AfricaDr. Verwoerd had made it clear that he wanted to remain in theCommonwealth. One factor which influenced him was that he might lose thenext Election if South Africa was thrown out. He had asked the commonwealth secretary how to go about seeking continued membership and had indicated that he would rather leave it to Mr. Macmillan to sound the other commonwealth governments if it had to be done by correspondence. A Prime Ministers&apos; meeting might perhaps be preferable if it could be arranged.Dr. Verwoerd would be ready to bring in a Bill making South Africa are public in January or February of next year, but he was prepared to deferuntil June the date of its coming into operation. This would mean that if a commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting were held in May to discuss the subjectSouth Africa would not then be a Republic.Dr. Verwoerd had said that South Africa&apos;s attitude to Cypriot membership of the Commonwealth could not be determined until after the Referendum, andhad indicated that they would regard Cyprus as a test case. The commonwealth secretary had felt it necessary to warn him against any appearance of blackmailin this matter.It was agreed that the Commonwealth Secretary should prepare for the PrimeMinister^ return a draft letter to Dr. Verwoerd about South African membership of the Commonwealth in the event of her becoming a Republic.
South African Refugees in the ProtectoratesDr. Verwoerd had said that this was a very difficult problem and hadthreatened to close the frontiers. The Commonwealth Secretary had said that,according to his understanding, there were only about 20 refugees now in theProtectorates and the movement out of South Africa did not appear tO;,be continuing. He had suggested that it was best to leave matters alone, but he wasnot sure that Dr. Verwoerd would do this.Northern rhodesia the&apos; Commonwealth Secretary had had talks in Northern Rhodesia with members of various political parties and with African and European mineworkers.Among the politicians he had been much impressed by Kaunda. Almost all Africanshad spoken against federation. They appeared, however, to have no fundamentalobjection to federation as such but they regarded it as a device for indefinite Whitecontrol. They had admitted that their attitude might be different if there were an African majority and an African Government.The Commonwealth Secretary had noticed that many of the Africans hadtalked a great deal about their Chiefs, and he wondered if enough attention was paid to them. The Chiefs were opposed to the political parties and it might bethat it would be unwise to build everything on the Nationalist Extremist Parties.Even Dr. Banda in Nyasaland tended to talk of &quot; the people and Chiefs of nyasaland &quot;.The African members of Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s Party had not impressed theCommonwealth Secretary, who had thought them mere stooges. The only genuinemulti-racial party seemed to be Sir John Moffat&apos;s Central African Congress Party.One puzzling factor was that large numbers of Africans who would be eligible to vote did not bother to register for the purpose.NyasalandIt seemed clear that there was a considerable hooligan element in Dr. Banda&apos;party and that a good deal of intimidation of the moderates went on. This wouldprobably get worse when the remaining detainees were released. All the same, theCommonwealth Secretary agreed that it was right to release them.Southern rhodesia the Commonwealth Secretary thought that Sir Edgar Whitehead had seen thered light and was now trying to eliminate discrimination, though he still had not enough sense of urgency about it. One of the most important steps was the repeal of the Land Apportionment Legislation. Sir Edgar had said that he was not afraid of an African majority or an African Government but he did fear an irresponsibleAfrican administration based on a mass electorate which did not understand the issues involved. &apos; He therefore emphasised the need for a high standard ofqualification for the vote; but there was little doubt that he would have to make some concessions on this.Central African FederationSir Edgar Whitehead thought that the break-up of the Federation might meaneconomic disaster for Southern Rhodesia since the larger unit tended to encourageinvestment; but he also recognised that changes would be needed in the structure of the Federation, if disorder was to be avoided.This point had not been accepted by Sir Roy Welensky, who maintained thatthe Federal authorities were quite able to maintain law and order. He and his advisers had taken the view that if agreement was not reached at the review of theFederation^ constitution the Federation would automatically go on as at present.The Commonwealth Secretary had had to make it clear to them that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were responsible for the Northern Territories; they had no desire toimpose a solution against the will of the Federal authorities; on the other hand,if they thought that constitutional advance in the Northern Territories necessary,and if they could not reach agreement with the Federal authorities on a reasonablebasis, Parliament would expect Her Majesty&apos;s Government to use their legal powers
to dissolve the Federation rather than to do nothing and cause a breakdown of lawand order. This point of view had been accepted by Sir Roy Welensky after ameeting of his Cabinet.As a result of his discussions with Sir Roy about the Monckton Report theCommonwealth Secretary had come to the conclusion that quite substantial changes were needed in the composition of the Assembly and that if these could be achievedalteration of the structure of the Federation might be less necessary. He certainlythought that it was neoessary to get more Africans into the Assembly, though theproposal in the Monckton Report for an Assembly consisting of 30 europeans and 30 Africans seemed objectionable on the ground that it emphasised racialdifferences. It seemed to conflict with the objective of building up multi-racialparties. To stimulate thinking in the Federation the Commonwealth secretary had suggested an arrangement whereby, out of 60 seats, 15 should be reservedfor Africans elected by African voters in the constituency and 15 reservedfor Europeans elected by European voters in the constituency, but the other 30should be elected on the basis of &quot; paired &quot; African and European votes. This,he thought, would force candidates to advocate policies appealing to all races andwould produce something like the Monckton Commission^ idea of parity withoutfreezing the whole system into racial blocks.The Commonwealth Secretary thought that the Federal authorities wouldprobably in the end be prepared to go some way in the direction of transfer of functions back to the Territories. There was, however, some justification for theirreluctance to do so; for example, it would obviously be bad for the efficiency of the health service to give responsibility for it back to the Territories. One of the most difficult problems in this field would arise over education. At present Africaneducation was a Territorial responsibility and European education a Federalresponsibility. The Monckton Report recommended that all education should infuture be a Territorial responsibility. Sir Edgar Whitehead had pointed out thatthis would create an embarrassing situation, for whereas the Southern rhodesian government at present spends  5 per head on African education the federal government spends  100 a head on European education. Since in effect alleducation is paid for by the Europeans through their taxes, the solution might perhaps lie in financing a minimum level of education for all races through taxes,while leaving the Europeans to finance the extra by &quot; voluntary contributions &quot;.This whole question of the transfer of functions was, however, something whichwould have to be worked out in discussion.SecessionThis theme had run through every meeting with Sir Roy Welensky. He had assumed that secession would not be an issue in the Monckton CommissionsReport and his party had not given evidence on the point to the Commission.There was a danger that unless some means could be found of saving his face hewould, when the Report was published, be pushed into saying that he would notin any circumstances consider the recommendations as a basis for discussion. Sofar as Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ initial comments after publication of the report were concerned. Sir Roy Welensky had not liked the formula proposed in commonwealth Relations Office telegram No. 1122, but he would accept that inparagraph 5 of Salisbury telegram No. 811. The important point, however, was what Her Majesty&apos;s Government would say when (as was bound to happen) theywere asked about their attitude to the recommendation on secession. It would notbe difficult to put this particular recommendation into perspective by pointing outthat the Commission were agreed on the advantages of federation and that it was clear that in their view the provision of a right to secede would strengthen ratherthan weaken it. It was likely, however, that this alone would not satisfy Sir roy welensky, and it would be necessary to work out very carefully how much further than this, if at all, Her Majesty&apos;s Government could go.It was agreed that the Prime Minister should send an immediate holdingtelegram to Sir Roy Welensky and that after consideration of this problem a further telegram should be sent in a few days.September, 1960.
