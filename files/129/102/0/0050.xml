Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1960C. (60) 150 Copy No.    5814th October, 1960CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Minister of health the yield of the National Health Service contribution is appropriated in aid ofthe Health Service votes. In net terms, an increase of Is. would wipe out almost the whole of the present forecast excess of the Health Service estimates for 1961-62over the original estimates for 1960-61, and produce a sharp reduction comparedwith the revised estimates for 1960-61 (which will be inflated by doctors&apos; back-pay).The figures are as follows (Great Britain):1960-61      Original estimate ...      ...       584 millionsRevised estimate ...      ...       633 millions1961-62     Forecast estimate ...      ...       639 millions2. On the other hand, it would do nothing to reduce the gross cost ofthe Service or to abate the prospective real increase in expenditure. Increasing the contribution is a purely fiscal measure, designed to raise revenue, not to curtailexpenditure.^ 3. My draft estimates for 1961-62 have not yet been examined with theTreasury and other Departments concerned. The forecast indicates increases in expenditure totalling some  45 millions- 50 millions over the 1960-61 original estimates, but I have initiated studies designed to show where the possibilities lie for obtaining substantial reductions. These reductions, it can already be said, would depend on two classes of action:(a) policy decisions, for which the support of the Party would be necessary;(b) economies, independent of policy, but requiring the co-operation of the professions and the voluntary Boards and Committees.4. In my opinion substantial reductions are to be desired on two distinctgrounds:(a) if no brake is placed now on the increase in expenditure on the health services, a halt may later have to be called in circumstances of embarrassment and possibly crisis;(b) in order to make it possible, by a shift of emphasis over the coming years,to finance newer developments demanded by modern trends in medicalthought and practice without overloading the estimates withexpenditure which is unnecessary or outmoded.5. There is a danger that an increase in the contribution, announced at thisstage, will, by reducing or eliminating the prospective net increase in the health service votes, render it more difficult to secure either class of reduction.57884
m6.   I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that, if the contribution is to beraised now:(a) this should be without prejudice to the consideration of proposals in due course to limit increases in the 1961-62 gross estimates;(b) the increase in the contribution should be linked in presentation as far aspossible to the present cost of the Health Services, and not to the prospective future increase;(c) the Chancellor should accept responsibility for the measure, as being in essentials a fiscal one, related to revenue and not expenditure.E. P.Ministry of Health, W. 1,13th October, 1960.
