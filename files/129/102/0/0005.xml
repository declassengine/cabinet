J o4th July, 1960CABINETCOST OF RELAXATION OF IMPORTRESTRICTIONSNote- by the President of the Board of trade the annexed table takes account of all the liberalisationmeasures of the past two years.2.      Before liberalisation, all the measures together were expected to cost  100- 106 millions in a full year.    The actualincrease in these imports is at present running at about  100 millions,of which rather more than one-half represents additional dollar imports.3.       Total imports into the United Kingdom have increased inJanuary-May this year compared with two years ago by the equivalent of  830 millions in a full year.    The cost of liberalisa-tion therefore represents at most about one-eighth of the increasein our import bill.R. M.Board of Trade, 3. W. 1.4th July, 1960.
