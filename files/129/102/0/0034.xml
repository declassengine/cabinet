Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1960C. (60) 13423rd September, 1960CABINETTHE SPECIAL CONTRACTS PREFERENCE SCHEME AND the nationalised industries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 15th September the Cabinet asked the President of the Board of trade for a memorandum describing the working of the Special Preference Scheme forGovernment contracts and setting out the arguments for extending it to the nationalised industries (C.C. (60) 50th Meeting, Minute 4). I have agreed toprovide this.The Special Preference Scheme2. The provisions of the General Preference Scheme and the SpecialPreference Scheme (introduced in 1950) are set out in the Annex to this paper.Contracting departments recently reported that offers under the SpecialPreference Scheme are regularly made, but they are not always accepted. Thoughstatistics are not available to measure its effectiveness, the general impression ofthe departments concerned is that in most cases development district firms whichsecure Government contracts would have done so in any event on normal commercial grounds, without the benefit of the scheme.Attitude of Industry to the Scheme3. When the Special Preference Scheme was first introduced, the Federationof British Industries complained that it offended against the principles ofcompetitive tendering, and were concerned lest it involve a hidden subsidy. Thescheme must irritate firms who are successful in the initial tender competition butthere has been no recent general criticism.Extension to the Nationalised Industries4. On 25th May, 1950, soon after the scheme was announced in Parliament,the then Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the Minister of Transport and theMinister of Fuel and Power asking them to invite the British Transport Commissionand the Coal, Gas and Electricity Industries to adopt it in administering their contracts. In 1953 an interdepartmental Working Party on Government contracts in development and unemployment areas reported that, in response to this invitation, the nationalised industries had given assurances that they already gavewhat assistance they could to firms in development areas under the GeneralPreference Scheme, and would continue to do so. The implication was that the nationalised industries had not adopted the Special Preference Scheme, and theWorking Party recommended that, in view of the difficulties met by Governmentdepartments in operating it, no further approach should be made to the industries.The Working Party&apos;s report, including this recommendation, was accepted by theCabinet Manpower and Production Committee in October 1953.Working Party on Government Contracts and Research in Scotland5. In July 1960 an interdepartmental Working Party set up on theinstructions of the Prime Minister reviewed the possibility of placing moreGovernment contracts and research in Scotland. The Working Party&apos;s report was approved and is now being implemented.  The main recommendations were thatCopy No.    56
other   should be a special publicity campaign in Scotland to encourage Scottishfirms to tender for Government work, and that an instruction should be sent tocontracting departments reminding them to operate the existing preferencearrangements, including the Special Preference Scheme, as effectively as possible,and to keep in mind the claims of development districts when looking for new capacity and placing any trial orders.&apos;iV.&apos;[ 6. The Working Party recommended that the scope for applying their recommendations in the nationalised industries and the National Health service should be examined by the departments concerned. The Treasury have written to these departments drawing their attention to this recommendation.General Arguments7. Any additional work for development districts would be welcome. the implication of paragraph 2 above, however, is that the extension of the SpecialPreference Scheme to the nationalised industries might not result in much extra work being placed there.8. The financial condition of most of the nationalised industries has made it increasing necessary for them to have more regard for commercial principles. Inthese circumstances there are special difficulties about governmental action whichcould be interpreted as implying that the nationalised industries should actuncommercially or construed as interference with their purchasing policy or their responsibility for day-to-day administration.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1960.
AnnexPLACING OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WITH FIRMS in development DISTRICTSSpecial Preference SchemeEver since 1934, the placing of Government contracts has been subject tothe General Preference Scheme. This provides that when other things are equal(e.g., price, delivery dates, quality) firms in Development Districts are givenpreference over others. In 1950 the arrangements were modified by the introductionof the Special Preference Scheme, which operates as follows.2. All purchasing departments maintain Trades Lists of firms able to supply the articles or services which the department requires. Under the Scheme allfirms in Development Districts who are on the Trade List for the particular articlefor which tenders are to be invited must, as far as is practicable, be invited to tender for the whole or part of the order. This arrangement is necessary since, whenTrade Lists are long, departments normally only invite a selection of firms to tender.3. If, as a result of open competitive tender, a substantial part (defined as25 per cent, or more) of the order is secured by a firm or firms in development districts, no further special action is taken.4. If the Development District firms fail to secure about 25 per cent, of theorder as a result of the tendering, then, provided that they can offer satisfactoryquality and delivery dates, part of the total requirement must be offered to theDevelopment District firms who tendered at a price within an upper limit of theweighted average of the accepted tenders. The first offer goes to the DevelopmentDistrict firm with the lowest tender. If the first offer is not accepted, the nextoffer is made to the Development District firm with the next lowest tender, and soon up the scale until the offer is accepted or all the Development District firms whooriginally tendered have refused the offer. In the latter event, the order, or thebalance of the order, would be placed in accordance with the normal rules of tender.5. The purpose of these arrangements is to ensure that the departmentsconcerned do not in the ordinary course pay more for the goods in question thanthey would have had to pay if they had purchased the goods from the lowest amongthe original tenderers.6. The Scheme applies to all suitable orders for which it is normal departmentalpractice to call for competitive tenders. Orders for specialised requirements not normally dealt with by competitive tender are not subject to the Scheme, nor are small orders which it is not administratively practicable to sub-divide.September, 1960.
