m CONFIDENTIAL .         35ail(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 142 COPY NO.   \^4th October, I960CABINETTHE ANDERSON report memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer agree with the Minister of Education, in paragraph 8 of his paper c.(60) 141, that we can promise a radical review of the means test scales.But I cannot agree to an announcement of abolition.2.   First, financial grounds.    The paper by the Minister of Educationputs the additional cost to public funds at  12^ millions to  18 millionsaccording to date - in the first full year (1962/63) about  15 millions.We have not yet discussed the other expensive proposals in the Report ofthe Committee on Grants to Students under the Chairmanship ofSir Colin Anderson (e. g. , vacation grants for all students), which withtheir repercussions may be  4 millions to  6 millions a year.3.   If we abolish the means test for universities, the Minister sayswe must also do it for teachers training colleges and other further education.    Thence would follow claims that all post-18 training and education should be publicly financed - and maybe with maintenanceallowances too.    Why not, if all parental responsibility ends at 18?4.   We could also expect pressure for more maintenance grants togrammar school children, and perhaps some others.5.   Without any of this at all, the annual education bill is alreadyestimated to increase by about  450 millions (over 50 per cent) in thecourse of this decade.6.   Second, social and political grounds.    I think abolition is boundto lead eventually to increased State control over the entry to universities -dictating selection more and more by an &quot;18 plus&quot; examination.    If, as one would expect, the independent schools and direct grant grammarschools were disproportionately successful in getting their boys and girlsselected to receive these sums and privileges they would come underincreasingly heavy fire politically.7.   Third, on grounds of prudence, we should be unwise to endorse the Anderson majority report without being quite clear what we are actually doing.    The Anderson majority propose to abolish the means test and also to withdraw the income tax child allowance - a savingallowed for in the Ministers paper.    The minority propose to improve the scales greatly and to retain the child allowance.-1-
8. I am advised that the majority proposal would leave large groups of parents actually worse off than they are now. Many parents now get more in tax relief on the  150 child allowance than they pay in parentalcontribution. This is probably true, for example, of most people in the 450- 850 income band with a single dependent child at the university,and of most people in the  600 to  1, 250 income band with one child atthe university and two other dependent children.9.   For people in the lower middle income ranges indeed the minority&apos;proposal is vastly preferable to the majority&apos;s.    The  1,000 a yearparent pays no contribution under either proposal but he would retain histax relief ( 58 a year if he has no other child) under the minority&apos;proposal (but not the majority1 s).10.   Very broadly speaking, it would seem that about one-half of thepresent award-holders would either get no advantage (paying no contribution and paying no income tax) or lose (their tax relief now exceeding their contribution) by the enactment of the Anderson majority proposal and possibly a further one-third would be better suited by the minorityproposal than by the majority.    In normal cases, only parents aboveabout  1,600 income (and higher in the case of bigger families) would prefer the majority proposal.    This is a very narrow group, though ofgreat importance - and there are plenty of ways to help it withoutestablishing major new social principles.11.  Obviously much more thought is needed, both in principle and indetail, before we can decide upon our policy.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.4th October, I960.
