Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1960C. (60) 120 Copy No.   5520th July, 1960CABINETNORTH BRITISH LOCOMOTIVE company memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the North British Locomotive Company employs some 3,300 people in glasgow. Under not very effective management it has lost a great deal of money in recent years in switching production from steam to modern diesel locomotives.In 1958 it received loans from the Development Areas (Treasury Advisory)Committee of  If millions, the Clydesdale Bank  11 millions and General ElectricCompany t\ million to keep it afloat. These three major creditors all appointednew directors to the board. The new management under Mr. Coughtrie claims to have made marked improvements in efficiency.2. The bulk of the company&apos;s order-book has consisted of orders for 164mainline diesel locomotives from the British Transport Commission. Deliveriesagainst these orders have been going on for some time and will all be completed by June 1961. The company is already short of work at the early stages ofproduction and is beginning to lay people off. This process will gather momentumfrom now until June 1961 by which time the whole labour force will have been discharged apart from two or three hundred engaged on subsidiary lines ofproduction. This misfortune can be staved off only if North British get new ordersquickly.3. The company is chasing an export order from Bulgaria for 30 locomotivesbut their chances of getting it against stiff competition are not at all good. Whatthey really need is a new order from the British Transport Commission.4. The Commission have said that they have no further requirement for the types of locomotive now produced by North British. They have requirements for new types for delivery in 1962-63 and have invited North British among others to tender; but since, even if North British are successful, orders placed as a result ofthese tenders will not mean work until 1962, this cannot solve the immediate problem.5. The Commission have further said that, in order to keep North Britishafloat through 1961, they would place a repeat order for 20 locomotives of an existing type to the value of  li millions, but only on condition that.their investmentceiling for 1961 can be raised to accommodate this sum and that it is understood by the Government that they would be taking the locomotives in place of latertypes which are expected to be 10 per cent, cheaper in capital and to a lesser extent running costs.6. This repeat order would probably enable North British to keep a reducedlabour force of some 2,000 employed through 1961, whereafter the company would hope to have succeeded in getting orders against the Commission^ requirements for 1962-63.7. Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport arefirmly opposed to accepting these conditions.  Their constant effort is to get the57367
British Transport Commission to have a greater regard for commercial criteriain making their investments and they are unwilling, therefore, to authorise theCommission to take a course which manifestly departs from this standard: andsuch a departure would be all the more difficult to defend in view of the decision tohold up parts of the modernisation plan pending a re-assessment.8. It is also important to look at the long-term prospects of the locomotive,industry. When the modernisation plan is completed (probably somewhereFetween 1963 and 1965) it is expected that the total demand for mainline locomotives(home and export) will quickly revert to a figure in the range 250 to 300 a year.The manufacturing capacity of the industry is about twice that figure, in the range650 to 700. A substantial proportion of this capacity (up to 200 locomotives a year)is in the Commissions own railway workshops. I expect that later on when therecommendations of the Stedeford group are available Ministers will have toexamine the question of whether in these circumstances the manufacture oflocomotives in the railway workshops, in competition with private industry, canbe justified, given that only the private firms are in a position to compete in export markets. But even if production in the workshops were restricted or discontinued,there will still be substantial redundant capacity among the private firms to theextent of not less than 150 locomotives a year. When this squeeze comes, the chance that North British will survive as locomotive producers, given that they appear to be the weakest unit in the industry, seems to me highly doubtful.9. The Secretary of State for Scotland considers it most important that the running down of the labour force employed by North British which, if a furtherorder is not received very soon, will begin this summer and affect 1,500 men by theend of the year and some 3,300 by June 1961, should be averted. The prospects are that a small repeat order for 20 locomotives of the type that the company are now producing for the Commission would tide them over this critical perioduntil they can tender for, and it is hoped secure, another and bigger order for anew type of locomotive. This breathing space would also give opportunity to thenew Chairman, who has already done much to improve the efficiency of theCompany, to pursue diversification of production which is very necessary andwhich he has hopes of achieving.10. It appears to the Secretary of State that in weighing the economics ofthe proposal regard should be paid to the loss of employment opportunities whichwill otherwise be caused in the Glasgow area, where the unemployment rate isalready (June 1960) 3-7 per cent. (22,099) representing more than 30 per cent, ofthe total Scottish unemployed.11. The Secretary of State also points out that the political effect of allowingthis large firm (the only one manufacturing locomotives in Scotland) to go out ofbusiness, after all that has been said about the Governments determination to steerwork to areas of high unemployment, and the substantial investment of Governmentmoney in this particular firm, would be most unfortunate.12. Nevertheless I do not think I should be justified in asking the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport to authorise such exceptional measures to meet the companys immediate problem. We have always made it clearthat a condition of Government assistance to firms in Development Districts isthat they should have a reasonable prospect of commercial success in the longterm. I cannot feel that this is true of North British so far as locomotivemanufacture is concerned. I shall consider with the company whether they canuse their manufacturing capacity for other lines of production and whether wecan help them in this; but I am bound to say that, given the prospects for heavyengineering generally, I am not very hopeful. In view of the concern which mycolleagues feel for employment in Scotland, I thought I should report this situationbefore the decision not to authorise the British Transport Commission to place arepeat order is conveyed to the Commission and the company.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W.1,18th July, 1960.
