SUPERSONIC AIRLINERMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet, on 14th July, &quot;invited the Minister of Aviation, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofDefence, to give further consideration to the question of continuing designstudies for supersonic aircraft, including the range of their speeds&quot;.(C. C. (60) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 6).2.      The Minister of Aviation, the Minister of Defence and I have discussed the matter accordingly.3.      The proposal is that we should now decide to place with one of thetwo main air-frame manufacturing groups a further contract for a designstudy to be carried out in the next twelve months at a cost of      million;and that we should make a public announcement of this decision.     Theobject would be to create a negotiating position from which the UnitedKingdom should attempt to secure United States collaboration in a jointproject - since the Americans would only be likely to be interested in collaboration with us if they thought that, without it, the United kingdom would develop a supersonic airliner which would compete in a limitedmarket with any airliner which they might produce themselves.     when this further contract had been placed we should pursue discussions withthe United States, both between Governments and between the manufacturingfirms.     The work that has so far been undertaken on this project is inany event completed;  and it is argued that if we do not take this furtherstep, the design teams which have already come into existence will bedispersed;   and it will be manifest to everyone, including the Americans,that we have effectively abandoned any intention of going ahead with the project.4.     I am still uneasy about our going ahead with work on a supersonicairliner at the lower speed of Mach 2. 2, given that it is at least possiblethat the Americans will go for a higher speed.    But the Minister of aviation informs me that the Americans are far ahead of us in the solutionof the problems which arise in flying at the higher speeds;  and  that weare not technically capable of competing with them at these speeds.5.     I have therefore come to the conclusion that we should accept theMinister&apos;s proposal.    But my agreement to this is subject to the very important proviso (which he also accepts) that we must neither decidenor announce anything now which in any way commits us to proceeding toany stage beyond that of the design study now proposed.    I am quite clearthat it would be wrong to accept a commitment now actually to develop-1-C. (60) 126 COPY NO.19th July, I960CABINETto.
this or any other supersonic aircraft.     And in pai-ticxilar I am more thandoubtful whether, if we cannot secure collaboration with the Americans(perhaps also with the French) in a joint project, we ought to contemplate the possibility of going ahead by ourselvesi    If we find ourselves alone in this business we should very likely be competing with both the UnitedStates and Russia in producing an immensely expensive aircraft forwhich the total market is very restricted.D.
