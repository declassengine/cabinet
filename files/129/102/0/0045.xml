C (60) 145 Copy No.    5&apos;57th October, I960CABINETSTEEL: DENATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 21st June the Cabinet decided that the next step in the denationalisationof the steel industry should be for the Iron and Steel Holding and RealisationAgency (I.S.H.R.A.) to sell a block of the fixed interest securities (nominal value 158 millions) which they hold in steel companies already denationalised, but toinclude in the package thus offered for sale  50 millions of new debentures inRichard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd. (R.T.B.). This would, it was thought, securethe assistance of the market in financing the Company&apos;s present development programme (estimated to require  190 millions of outside finance by the end of1962) and would serve as an earnest of the Governments intention to return theCompany to private ownership as soon as that seemed expedient. The cabinet also invited my predecessor to consider the possibility of making the issue of newdebentures in R.T.B. more attractive to investors by arranging for a proportionof them to be convertible into equity shares after a&apos; period of time (C.C. (60) 36thConclusions, Minute 4).2. The discussion of this matter in the Economic Policy Committee since Junehas concentrated on the most desirable and practical method of issuing newdebentures in R.T.B. In the result, we have reached the conclusion, after considering advice received from I.S.H.R.A. and their City advisers, that it wouldnot be desirable to proceed at this stage with such a debenture issue. The alternative proposals which we have considered and the reasons which have led us to thisview are,briefly as follows:(i) A sale of debentures carrying rights to convert into equity shares atspecified times and rates.(ii) A sale of debentures carrying options to acquire equity shares at prescribedtimes and prices.Both these proposals were, in the Committee^ view open to the objection that,contrary to the Governments declared policy of reducing its holding in the steelindustry, they would have required I.S.H.R.A. to subscribe for substantial amounts(between  25 millions and  35 millions) of new equity capital in the Company.Moreover, given that it would be desirable for the option on conversion rights to expire before the probable date of the next Election, neither proposal would havegiven I.S.H.R.A. a return for their present investment which adequately reflected the Company&apos;s likely value when its present development schemes which in any event will have to be substantially financed by the Government have beencompleted. Moreover, the latter scheme, which I.S.H.R.A.&apos;s advisers thought likely to be the more attractive to investors, would have carried with it all the risksattendant on the necessity of fixing now the prices at which options would have tobe exercised at some date in the future. We think that the obligation to securethe best possible price for the sale of these State assets requires that the sale shouldbe postponed until such time as the strip mill project is nearer maturity and an issueprospectus can be based more on facts and less on forecasts.SETJRET57845Printed for the Cabinet.   October I960
(iii) A sale of a straight debenture.(iv) A sale of a straight debenture coupled with a sale of half of the equity.The objection to (iii) is, we have been advised, that, having regard to the interestcover available at the present stage of R.T.B.&apos;s development, the debentures wouldnot be regarded as first-class securities; in order to be attractive to investors thedebentures would have to carry a rate of interest which would be unduly onerousfor the Company. Moreover, we are told that (iv) is impracticable in presentcircumstances because of the amount of money involved.3. In these circumstances the Economic Policy Committee took the view thatattempts to sell R.T.B. shares or securities should be postponed for the present andthat proposals should be developed for the sale of as much as practicable of othersecurities held by the Agency, in the period up to the end of 1961. I.S.H.R.A. havealready been advised that it may be possible to sell from  75 millions- 100 millions of these securities during that period. The proceeds of these sales, together withI.S.H.R.A.&apos;s present cash balance of about  20 millions and the loan of  70 millions from the Ministry of Power, would be available to finance R.T.B.&apos;s development programme. There would still remain the possibility of raising about  30 millions of short-term capital from the banks, if necessary. The Committee also concluded that the question of returning R.T.B. to private ownership should be reviewed in12-18 months&apos; time when its development schemes would be nearer to maturity:4. We have considered the political aspects of this change of plan. ministers have already announced that it is the Governments intention substantially to return the steel industry, including R.T.B., to private ownership during the lifetime of thepresent Parliament. We think, however, that Government supporters would be willing to accept some postponement of the denationalisation of R.T.B. if real progress were made with the disposal of I.S.H.R.A.&apos;s existing fixed interest holdings and if the money accruing from these sales were sufficient (together with the loanby the Ministry of Power and I.S.H.R.A.&apos;s present cash balances) to provide forR.T.B.&apos;s further needs for loan capital.5. I therefore seek the approval of the Cabinet to the recommendations of theEconomic Policy Committee that (i) I.S.H.R.A. should be instructed:(a) To suspend attempts to sell any R.T.B. securities for the present.(b) To develop proposals for the disposal, in the period up to the endof 1961, of as much as practicable of the other securities whichthey hold.(ii) The question of returning R.T.B. to private ownership should be reviewed in twelve to eighteen months&apos; time.6. If these recommendations are approved, the Economic Policy Committeewill give further thought to the way in which this matter might best be presented toParliament.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,7th October, 1960.
