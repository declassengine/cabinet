C. (60) 108 COPY NO.11th July, I960CABINETSUNDAY OBSERVANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home department i have been considering the question of reform of the Sunday observance Acts   and other enactments restricting activities on Sunday.The main effect of the Sunday observance law is to forbid, subject to exceptions, the opening on Sundays of any house, room or other place for entertainment or amusement to which the public is admitted on payment.In addition, the law on Sunday trading (which makes numerous exceptions tothe general proposition that all shops should be closed on Sundays) has given rise to many ambiguities and uncertainties which have been thesubject of some acid comments by the courts, and both shopkeepers andlocal authorities are left in considerable doubt as to what they should observeand enforce.   There are special provisions for Sunday in Licensing lawjbut any necessary amendment of these could perhaps be effected in nextsessionTs Licensing Bill.2. There is no doubt that the law no longer reflects public opinion.There is a growing body of opinion in favour of changing the law but thereis no widespread agreement as to what form change should take.   It seemsto me that we ought to take some initiative towards reform.   But before any proposal for amendment of the law can take definite shape there is a clear need for inquiry.   On 1st July the Home Affairs Committee:-(a) Agreed with my proposal that a Joint Select Committee shouldbe appointed to inquire into amendment of the law of Sunday observancein England and Wales.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consider whetheror not such a Joint Select Committee should cover also the law on Sunday observance in Scotland.3. I invite   my colleagues to agree with these conclusions.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W. 1.11th July, I960Jk. JL M
