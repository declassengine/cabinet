Printed for the Cabinet.   July I960C. (60) 119 Copy No.     SO21st July, 1960CABINETCOINAGE REFORMSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer think that it is time to make a start on the simplifications and improvementof our bronze coinage. The first steps would undoubtedly be to eliminate thefarthing which has outlived its usefulness. About 200 million farthings have beenissued in the last 100 years, but it is certain that only a small fraction of this number can be in use to-day and, apart from meeting a very small demand from scotland, none have been issued by the Mint since 1956. Until two or three yearsago the farthing still tended to enter into the price of certain common commodities bread, milk, haberdashery, petrol, &amp;c. But there has recently been a noticeabledecline in the practice of marking prices in farthings and I do not think that any section of the community would now press for their retention. Indeed, the banks,and the vast majority of shop-keepers and shoppers would equally be glad to seethe end of them.2. The formal action required would be the issue of a Royal Proclamationunder s. 11 of the Coinage Act, 1870. (The last such proclamation was issued in 1890 when the guinea and other pre-Victorian gold coins were called in.) Asthe demonetisation of the farthing is a simple step, I think that a day should bedetermined on which an announcement of demonetisation would be made, anddemonetisation itself should then take place three months later. During this periodpeople would be able to change farthings at any bank for coins of highdenomination.3. One advantage of abolishing the farthing, as the Deputy Master of theRoyal Mint pointed out in his Report for 1958, would be that the way would be cleared for the introduction of a smaller halfpenny or penny. Although thesecoins are so familiar that they are largely taken for granted, they are in factunnecessarily large and heavy for their purpose and it would be far more convenient for the public as well as economical in production costs to replace them bysmaller coins.4. If it were decided to do it. the operation would be done over a period ofyears and in two stages, as follows. The first step would be the introduction of a smaller halfpenny, which would require legislation to amend the Schedule to theCoinage Act of 1870. There are at present about 950 million halfpennies in issue,and by one means or another it should be possible to produce an adequate newissue in under two years. A period for education and adjustment would bedesirable and, following a firm decision by the Government and the beginning of stock-piling by the Mint, an announcement could be made in about 18 months&apos;time from that decision, and the actual date for the change fixed not more than six months later. The new coin would probably be slightly larger than the presentfarthing and would be made of the same alloy. The introduction of a new penny,which would be slightly larger than the present halfpenny and of the same alloy,would require at least a further two years, since it would be necessary to stock-pileover 1,000 million coins.   Thus, if the changes were agreed, and if, for instance,57371
the farthing were demonetised as from the end of 1960, a new halfpenny could beintroduced and the old one demonetised by the end of 1962, and a new penny issuedand the present one demonetised by the middle of 1965.5. There are, however, two main difficulties about this. The first, which applies to the penny, but in a relatively small degree to the halfpenny, is that thereare in existence something like 200,000 coin operated machines (including telephonecall boxes) which are designed for operation with bronze coins of the present size., But this is mainly a problem of timing. Provided that sufficiently long notice wasgiven for the introduction of a new penny, there is no reason to suppose that thenecessary mechanical adjustments could not be made. The second difficulty is thatof knowing how the introduction of new coins would link up with any futuredecision on decimalisation. My own view is that with any decimal system thatwe should be likely to adopt, the penny and perhaps also the halfpenny would berevalued and retained; and, if so, I think it is a fair assumption that they would continue to be called pennies and halfpennies. It is therefore arguable and thisis, I understand, the view of the banks that it would be convenient, and avoidconfusion, to introduce smaller pennies and halfpennies before decimalisationrather than at the same time, or later. However, we are not yet ready to reach adecision on decimalisation and for this and other reasons a firm decision on penniesand halfpennies now would be premature.6. I cannot claim that any of these changes are essential, nor that there is any widespread popular pressure for them. But I have no doubt that they are desirableif we are to have an up-to-date and convenient coinage, and I am sure thatrationalisation of this sort would be well received by the public at large. If, at thetime we announce the demonetisation of the farthing, we say that we are also considering the introduction of smaller pennies and halfpennies, there would bean opportunity for public opinion to express itself.Crown Pieces7. I have also been considering the case for a crown piece of a smaller andhandier type than the present one, but readily distinguishable from otherdenominations. I have had trial pieces struck in silver, of between shilling andflorin size and with a raised inscription on their edges. I do not think that wecould introduce the crown piece without withdrawing either the florin or the half crown probably the latter; and the use of silver in the coinage would raisewider questions which need to be further examined. It would therefore be premature to take a decision on this matter at the present.conclusion. I seek the authority of the Cabinet to inform Parliament of our intentionto demonetise the farthing as from the end of 1960 and to state that we are considering the introduction of a new issue of smaller pennies and halfpennies indue course.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,19th July, 1960.
