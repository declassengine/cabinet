Printed for the Cabinet. July I960C. (60) 113 Copy No.14th July, 1960CABINETFORECAST OF expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have now received an analysis of the Forecast Estimates for 1961-62and 1962-63. It is clear that Supply expenditure is rising much faster than gross national product.1959-60       1960-61        1961-62       1962-63Forecast       ForecastEstimates      Estimates      Estimates     EstimatesDefence Budget (net)......       1,552 1,624 1,705 1,721Civil Supply     .........      2,943 3,212 3,337 3,417Total Ordinary Supply   ...      4,495 4,836 5,042 5,1382. In the Forecast Estimates as submitted, we must allow for an increase ofover  200 millions in next year&apos;s Estimates, and an extra  100 millions in thefollowing year.3. This calculation assumes pay rates at 1st April last. Taking a more realisticassumption here, with public service pay costs increasing at, say 2 per cent, perannum, and allowing for variations from this level where known, and taking intoaccount the possible effect of pay increases in general and police grants in 1962-63,it is estimated that an addition of at least  50 millions should be made for 1961-62,and about  100 millions for 1962-63.4. In addition to this, there are a great many projects which are being pressed by my colleagues for expenditure in 1961-62 and 1962-63. The following are some	Addition to	Addition to	1961-62	1962-63	  millions	  millionsRoads       ............	25	31Pensions	35*	35*Civil BLUE STREAK   ......	13	15Overseas Grants (Cyprus, &amp;c.) ...	17	16	90	97Miscellaneous      ......	35	43	125	140* Assumes a 56s. Od. rate of basic pension (6s. Od. increase from 1st April, 1961, and an increasein contributions), and corresponding increase in war pensions, with possible consequences for national assistance.5. If these projects were accepted, we should have to envisage an extra 175 millions in 1961-62 and  240 millions in 1962-63. The Estimates could thus be expected to be:As submitted Augmented  millions   millions1959-60 ............... 4,495                      -1960-61 ............... 4,836                      -1961-62 ............      ... 5,042 5,2171962-63 ............... 5,138 5,37857337
6. This excludes provision for the railway deficit, which must from now onbe considered an item of Government current expenditure (deficit this year 105 millions). But last year  85 millions was provided below-the-line. Mycolleagues will also bear in mind that there are very large commitments, e.g., for overseas loans, developing below-the-line. Nor does it include any allowance for any change in urgency and policy for defence and civil defencefi *\ 7. Thus, if the projects in paragraph 4 were accepted, we would envisage anincrease of  381 millions in 1961-62 over the original Estimates for 1960-61 anincrease of 7-9 per cent. The 1961 Estimates would thus be showing an even greater increase than that of the 1960 Estimates. In 1962-63 there would be afurther increase of 3-1 per cent, over 1961-62.S. This would imply a rapid increase in the proportion of supply expenditure to gross national product (G.N.P.):	Budget Estimates	Percentage	for	of G.N.P.

The assumed 24- per cent, per year increase in G.N.P. involves an increaseof 2 per cent, per year in productivity output of goods and services per worker and some increase in working population. The average annual post-war rate of increase of productivity is 2 per cent. Whether it will grow faster or slower in thenext two years is inevitably uncertain. But if it rose faster, wage-rates would be higher and public service pay would be higher and Supply Expenditure higher.Even if productivity rose twice as fast as is assumed here, which cannot seriouslybe considered, starting as we are from a position in which resources are very fully employed, the percentage of G.N.P. in the last column for 1962-63 would still bewell above 22 per cent, compared with 21 -2 per cent, last year.10. I hope my colleagues will be in no doubt as to the implication of thesefigures. It seems to me quite certain that, even on the basis of our existing commitments, Supply Expenditure will grow faster than G.N.P. during the courseof this Parliament. All the available indicators point in this direction: the defencefive-year costings, the public sector investment programme, and the prospectiveeducational and national health service estimates for five years ahead. But if, inaddition to our existing commitments, we accept the projects which I have listed in paragraph 4, then the proportion of Supply Expenditure to G.N.P. is likely toshow an increase of approximately 7 per cent. (i.e., from 21-2 per cent, to 22-8per cent.) in three years. I am sure there is no need for me to emphasise the political implications of such a rise, nor the difficulties that it would cause with regard both to further reductions in taxation and to the maintenance of confidence in sterling.Furthermore this is a particularly serious matter when, as everyone agrees, we need to devote more resources to productive industry in the private sector. Indeed, webid fair to lose all the economic gains of recent years.11. There is only one way to remedy this situation, and that is not to acceptfresh proposals (great or small), however attractive, for increased public expenditureunless room for them can be found by cutting some existing commitment. I cannotemphasise too strongly to my colleagues the seriousness of the outlook, and thatif the results I have mentioned are to be avoided action must begin to be taken now.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th July, 1960.
