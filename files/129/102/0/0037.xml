C. (60) 137 CoPy No-   &apos; &apos;3rd October, 1960CABINETMEDICINES FOR PRIVATE PATIENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on the last of the several occasions on which the Cabinet have considered thequestion of allowing the private patients of general practitioners to be provided with their medicines on National Health Service terms, they decided that the time was not yet opportune for reaching or announcing a decision to make the proposed concession.2. Since then there has been unabated pressure both from our people in theHouse and from the British Medical Association (B.M.A.) and the Home AffairsCommittee have decided to accept the advice of the Minister of Health and torecommend to the Cabinet that the time has now come to introduce the legislation required to effect the concession. As long ago as 1949 we committed ourselves in &quot; The Right Road for Britain&quot; to the principle that patients might avail themselves of the whole or any part of the National Health Service and undertook that private patients &quot;would be enabled to obtain their medicines on Health Serviceterms. This pledge, though repeated in none of our subsequent election literature,has never been repudiated and it has become increasingly difficult to justify out failure to give effect to it.3. The arguments put forward against the concession were these. It would cost the Exchequer at least  2\ millions a year and possibly much more. this additional expenditure would be incurred at a time when the increasing size of thedrugs bill is causing both ourselves and the public much concern and when allprojects for increased Government expenditure which are not demonstrablynecessary are having to be deferred. The concession would, moreover, be made against the background of a possible increase in the Health Service weekly contribution or other drastic action to control the cost of the service. The view was also expressed that the concession is not altogether easy to reconcile with theConservative principle that assistance from public funds should be concentrated on those whose need is greatest.4. On the other hand, the Home Affairs Committee were impressed by the argument that if we made the concession now it might be easier thereafter to persuade our supporters and the medical profession to accept whatever unwelcomeaction on the drug bill in particular or the Health Service in general we may feel obliged to take.5. To sum up, the Home Affairs Committee, on balance, recommend theCabinet to agree that the necessary legislation should be introduced early in thecoming Session, so that the concession can be effected as from the beginning of thenext financial year.R.
