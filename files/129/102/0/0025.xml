C. (60) 125 Copy No.   5012th September, 1960CABINETBATTLE OF BRITAIN MEMORIALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for AirSince 1943 the anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been commemoratedeach year by a Service of Thanksgiving in Westminster Abbey (or St. Paul&apos; cathedral) and, since 1945, by &quot;At Home&quot; days at selected Royal Air Forcestations. There has so far been no falling off in public interest and it seems clearthat the Battle of Britain is still regarded by the general public as a major victoryand deliverance. Nevertheless, as time goes on it will naturally become lessa matter of recollection and more a matter of history.2. Those who fell in the Battle are commemorated in the Battle of Britainmemorial Chapel in Westminster Abbey, but there is no memorial to commemoratethe event itself.3. -I invite my colleagues to consider whether the 20th Anniversary, whichfalls this year, might not be marked by a decision to erect such a memorial. It isdifficult for me to attempt to argue the case for this. I do however believe thatthe Battle of Britain has come to occupy a firm position in the minds of the public,possibly because it was a fight against odds, in our own skies; it averted invasion;and it was the first decisive reverse to German arms.4. If there is to be a memorial it must be erected by the Nation, rather thanby the Royal Air Force. This would mean an announcement on behalf ofthe Government as such and, possibly, a resolution in Parliament.5. Similarly, the form of the memorial about which there could be manyviews should be acceptable to public opinion as well as to the Royal Air Force. Ifthe Government set up a small committee of public names to consider the matter,public opinion would have an opportunity to express itself. The Air Council, fortheir part, would favour the naming of a street or square somewhere in central london perhaps in the City, where extensive rebuilding and planning of blitzedareas is now going on and the erection in it of a carved figure or series of murals.The cost of such a scheme could not be great. However, even within this broadconcept there is obviously room for many different opinions.6.   I therefore ask my colleagues to consider:ia) whether the Nation ought to erect a memorial to the Battle of Britain;and(b) if so, the appointment of a small committee of public names to considerthe form such a memorial should take.G. R. W.Air Ministry, S.W. 1,9th September, 1960.57702THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1960
