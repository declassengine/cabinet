jff SECRET   &apos; .-j 5(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 101 COPY NO._ffc2nd July, I960CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE colonial development CORPORATIONMarnorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Colonial Development Corporation (C. D. C. ) is empowered to borrow up to  130 millions from the Exchequer, and up to a further 20 millions from sources other than the Exchequer, outstanding at anyone time.   So far it has operated solely onExchequer money, and itscommitments to date total about  115 millions.   It thus has about 15 millions of Exchequer borrowing still uncommitted.. All advances fromthe Exchequer are made on a fixed repayment basis, long-term loanscci?:vying a seven year fructification period.?,.      In May, 1959, a Committee of Enquiry into the financial structure of the. C. D. C. was  set up under the chairmanship of Lord Sinclair ofClee.&apos;-e.   Their report (Cmd. 786 published in October, 1959) shows clearly that the C. D. C. has no prospect of meeting over time its obligations inrespect of the loan capital it has already drawn from the Exchequer.   TheCommittee came to the conclusion that it is not possible for the corporation to carry out the purposes for which it was set up and at the same time todischarge the financial obligations laid on it under the Overseas resources development Act, 1959 unless there is a change either in its financial structure or in the nature of its activities.3.      The Committee1 s main recommendation was that the existing capital structure should be replaced by three kinds of stock: -(a) A StockThis would comprise the advances drawn by the Corporation fromthe Exchequer for the purpose of making straight loans to governments and statutory bodies in the Colonies.   The C. D. C. would have to pay thefull Exchequer rate of interest on each such advance, and the capital wouldbe repayable to the Exchequer.(b) BJtockAll other advances to the C. D. C. (save the C Stock, as described below) would be covered by the issue of B Stock.   Interest would be payableonly to the extent of the available earnings of the Corporation in a givenyear,  subject to a maximum of 5 per cent in any year.   Capital would berepayable only if a surplus remained to the C. D. C. after interest payments and payments to a reserve fund, or in the event of capital repayments tothe C. D. C. from third parties.-1-
secret (c)     C StockThis would represent the capital lost in C. D. C. projects whichhave been abandoned with Ministerial approval (about  7 millions), andthe C. D. C. &apos;s accumulated liability to the Exchequer in respect offructification interest (slightly under  10 millions as at 1st January, I960).The G. D. C. would have no liability to pay interest on the C Stock     Itwould remain theoretically liable to repay the capital, but only as a last charge on the C. D. C. &apos;s annual surplus (in effect this would mean thatthe capital would never be repaid).4.      On 17th March, I960, a group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary considered the future of the C. D. C. in the light ofthe Sinclair Committee Report.   They concluded that the C. D. C. shouldcontinue in being in a modified form, and appointed a working party of officials of the Treasury, the Commonwealth Relations Office and theColonial Office to examine the future functions and financial structure of the Corporation, and the presentational aspects of the problem, and tosubmit proposals.5.      The report of the working party is annexed.   It did not prove possibleto reach agreement in the working party on a scheme to recommend to ministers, and further discussion subsequently between the FinancialSecretary, Treasury and the Ministers of State for Colonial Affairs and commonwealth Relations have failed to reconcile the divergencies of view between the Treasury on the one hand, and the Colonial Office and commonwealth Relations Office on the other.6.     I consider that our aim must be to avoid having to increase thepresent limit of  130 millions on Exchequer advances to the C. D. C.   Butin my view we can only achieve this objective by:-(a) Relieving the C. D. C. of obligations which it at present has no hopeof being able to meet, to the extent necessary to give it a reasonable prospect of operating as a revolving fund within its existing capital limits.(b) Providing it with a capital structure which will give it a reasonable prospect of raising the  20 millions of its authorised capital which it canonly get from private sources.7.      With these objectives in view the scheme I advocate is as follows:-(a) We should adhere to the limit of  130 millions on Exchequeradvances (and to the limit of  20 millions on borrowing from non-Exchequersources), but within the ceiling figure of  130 millions we should impose a limit on the amount of Exchequer advances which the C. D. C. may haveoutstanding at any one time for equity-type investment (this is the typeof investment in which losses have mostly occurred to date, and in which by the nature of things the risk is greatest).(b) Advances from the Exchequer for straight lending by the CD. C.would be termed Advances in respect of Secured Borrowing;   advances in respect of equity-type investment would be termed Advances inrespect of Unsecured Borrowing.
(c) The G. D. C. would be required to pay interest at the full Exchequerlending rate on all Advances in respect of Secured Borrowing, and alsoto repay such advances to the Exchequer by means of annuities.(d) The limit on Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing (i. e. equity-type investment) would be the total of existing commitments for suchinvestments plus an amount to allow for any necessary expansion of some ofthe existing projects plus a proportionof the Corporation^ remaininguncommitted funds (say  3 millions).   The best estimate we can make atpresent is that the amount might be about  43 millions, but that wouldbe subject to discussion in detail with the C. B. C.(e) The C. D. C. &apos;s obligations in regard to Advances in respect ofUnsecured Borrowing would be as follows:-(i) Interest would be payable at the full Exchequer lending rate.If the C. D. C. were unable to pay interest in any one year, the defaultwould be reported to Parliament and the liability carried over to thenext year.   If the liability accumulated, after, say, three years it wouldbe transferred to Losses and Liabilities and Parliament would be askedto vote the amount in question.(ii) The C. D. C. would have no fixed obligation to repay thecapital to the Exchequer.   But once they had reached the limit on ExchequerAdvances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing they could only gain access to further capital for new equity-type investment by repaying some of theoustanding advances in this category.   They would thus have a strongincentive to turn over the money invested in this kind of project as rapidly (and as profitably) as possible.(f) There would be a further category in the capital structure, to be termed Losses and Liabilities.   This would comprise:-(i) The advances lost on projects already abandoned withMinisterial approval, or which may be so abandoned in future.(ii) The C. D. C. &apos;s present accumulated liability for interestdeferred due to the fructification period, and possibly certain capitalpayments received by the Corporation but not yet paid over to the Exchequerbecause of the operation of the fructification   period.All amounts transferred to Losses and Liabilities would count against the 130 millions Exchequer lending ceiling, except the element representingfructification interest. j(g) We should agreed that the C. D. C. &apos;s obligations to outside lendersshould rank pari passu with C. D. C. Secured Borro/wing from the Exchequer.The Sinclair Committee clearly felt that to afford the C. D. C. areasonable prospect of borrowing from outside sources it would be      .necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to accept that the Corporation^obligation to outside borrowers should rank above its obligations to theExchequer.   I feel this would be difficult to justify;   but the compromiseI propose is, I think, the minimum arrangement which would offer theC. D. C. a reasonable prospect of being able to raise funds from non-Exchequer sources.
secret58.      The above arrangements, though more stringent in a number ofrespects than the recommendations of the Sinclair Committee, are modelledpretty closely on those recommendations.   They would in my judgment givethe C. D. C. a real incentive to make the best possible use of the resources at its disposal, and a fair prospect of raising  20 millions for colonial development from private sources.   This would be especially valuableat the present time when the inflow of private capital into territories suchas East Africa is virtually drying up, and we shall have to rely increasinglyon the C. D. C. for fresh commercial-type investment in those territories,wherever possible of course in partnership with private enterprise.   Ibelieve too that a scheme as outlined above would be acceptable tothe C. D. C. and to Parliamentary opinion.9.      The points in this scheme on which the Treasury disagree areas follows:-(a) The Treasury consider that the C. D. C.  should be debarred fromundertaking any further equity-type business, other than the minimalamount required to complete certain existing projects, on the ground thatit is in this type of business that the risk of losses is greatest.     they further consider that if additional capital is required for certain existingequity-type projects, and it is clear that there is a risk that such capitalmight not be repaid if advanced on normal terms, it should be providedthrough Votes and not from the Consolidated Fund, which would imply amuch closer control over the C. D. C&apos;s operations.(b) The Treasury could not accept that the CD. C. should be relieved of an obligation to repay Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing.They consider that the obligation to repay such advances by equatedannual instalments of capital and interest must remain.    If the C. D. Cwere unable to meet the capital repayment obligation, after a suitableperiod Parliament would be asked to vote the amount in question as a subsidy above the line.(c) The Treasury cannot agree that the CD. C&apos;s private borrowingshould rank on a par with Exchequer Advances in respect of SecuredBorrowing, but only pari passu with Exchequer Advances in respect ofUnsecured Borrowing.The detailed arguments on these points are set out in the attached reportof the working party.10.    I could not recommend acceptance of the Treasury views inparagraph 9 above.    If they were adopted, the result would in myopinion be:-(a) To perpetuate what the Sinclair Committee rightly termeda hopeless situation (the ultimate prospect of apermanent above the line subsidy would not in factremedy the situation, and would deaden any incentive to efficiency).(b) Far from bringing the alleviation to the Corporation which both sides in Parliament are expecting, to imposefurther severe and, from my point of view, unwelcomerestrictions on its operations.-4-
(c)    To make it quite impossible for the C. D. C. to borrow from private sources.I am confident that if we tried to put across this line, which would involverejection of almost the whole of the Sinclair Committee&apos;s recommendations we should face a very difficult Parliamentary situation, and that the Boardof the C. D. C. would almost certainly resign.    I also believe that weshould inevitably be driven into increasing the amount of Exchequer moneyto which the C. D. C. had access.11.     I recognise that my proposals involve a degree of subsidisation,in the sense that they would relieve the C. D. C. of some of its existing,unrealistic obligations to the Exchequer.    But they would in my viewenable us to stick to the present limit of  130 millions on Exchequeradvances, and that is clearly preferable to a situation in which it came tobe accepted that we had at regular intervals to provide the CD. C. with increasing sums of Exchequer money and eventually a constantly increas-ing subsidy.    We should of course have to make it quite clear that wewere &quot;sealing off&quot; the CD. C. at its present authorised maximum capital for borrowing from the Exchequer of  130 millions and this fact in itself would, I consider, enable us to deal with the CD. C. as an issue on itsown merits separate from the nationalised industries.12.    I accordingly invite my colleagues to endorse the proposedre-organisation outlined in paragraph 7 above.I. M.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.1st July, I960.
ANNEXFUTURE OF THE COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONReport by a Working PartyIntroductionAt their meeting on 17th March a group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary decided that the Colonial Development Corporation (C.D.C.)should continue in being in a modified and truncated form and that there shouldbe no increase in the scale of its activities. They invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for officials to examine the functions of the corporation and the presentational aspects of the problem and to report to junior Ministers ofthe Departments concerned. A Working Party of officials of the Treasury, theCommonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office have carried out this task and now submit their report.2.   The Ministerial decision clearly implies:(a) that there must be no increase in the present limit of  130 millions onExchequer advances to the C.D.C.;(b) that there must be no change in the policy governing the C.D.C.&apos;s activities in independent territories;(c) that the C.D.C. must henceforth function on the basis of a revolving fund;especially as some  115 millions out of the  130 millions has alreadybeen committed. (In order to achieve this the main emphasis will clearly have to be on dated loans rather than on equity-type investment,and there must therefore be certain restrictions in future on the type of activity in which the C.D.C. may engage.)r3.   We think, therefore, that the aims of policy can be stated as follows:(a) to avoid any increase in the statutory limit on Exchequer advances;(b) within that limit, to give the Corporation as much incentive as possible to finance the maximum amount of useful work; and in this connexionto do whatever is reasonably practicable to make it possible for theC.D.C. to raise money from non-Government sources within its presenttotal borrowing ceiling of  150 millions ( 130 millions from theExchequer and  20 millions from private lenders).4. In formulating our proposals we have borne in mind the desirability fromthe presentational point of view, first, of keeping as close as practicable to therecommendations of the Sinclair Committee of Enquiry, and, secondly, of exposingfor all to see the losses which the Corporation has made in the past and any whichit may make in the future. We think it would be advisable, however, to avoid theterms A. B and C Stock used by the Sinclair Committee, since they are appropriate to&apos;a purely commercial concern and, in the case of C Stock, would be misleading inthat the sums in question represent liabilities rather than assets.5. We start in Part I by making proposals on which we do not think thereshould be any significant differences of opinion. In Part II, we set out the pointswhere the Treasury and the Colonial Office favour different solutions.PART ICapital Structure6. We propose that the basic capital structure of the Corporation should beas follows. The main departures from the recommendations of the SinclairCommittee apart from the change of terminology arise from the need strictly to limit the amount of risk business.57259BTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Advances in respect of Secured Borrowing(a) These Exchequer advances would be broadly what the Sinclair Committeecall A Stock; but, in addition to loans to Governments and statutory bodies and loans guaranteed by Governments (i.e., finance house&quot; business), they would cover all secured commercial loans as well.(b) In respect of all such advances the C.D.C. would be under an obligation,as at present, to pay the full rate of interest and to repay the whole of the capital tothe Exchequer.(c) The present seven-year moratorium on the service of long-term advances(the &quot; fructification period &quot;) would be abolished, except in approved cases wherethe C.D.C. had extended similar facilities to its borrowers or did so in future with her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs agreement.(d) So far as possible, the duration of the advances and the arrangements foramortisation would be determined in accordance with the duration andarrangements agreed by the Corporation with its clients.(e) In the case -of existing advances in this category, to the extent that the C.D.C.has already received payments of interest from its borrowers but, owing to theoperation of the fructification period, has reinvested them instead of makingcorresponding payments to the Exchequer, the amounts might be transferred either(if the projects in which they had been reinvested could be expected to yield anadequate return) to Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing (sub-paragraph(/) below) or (if their re-investment appeared likely to show no significant return)to Losses and Liabilities (sub-paragraph (h) below). There may, however, be substantial practical objections to the former course: it might be difficult to ascertain the precise projects in which such monies had been reinvested; the conversion of a liability on the Corporation to pay interest into an Advance in respect of UnsecuredBorrowing would have the effect of creating a notional advance which would count against the  130 millions ceiling; and there would also be the complication that thetransfer of such amounts to Unsecured Borrowing would lead to an addition (whichwe cannot quantify but which could be appreciable) to the amount of equity-typeinvestment which could be undertaken, by the Corporation, if it were decided thatsome further equity-type investment should be permitted (see Part II below). Theappropriate treatment of fructification capital would also have to be determined inthe light of similar considerations. In the case of fructification capital transferredto Unsecured Borrowing, it would be possible to cancel an equivalent amount of theC.D.C.&apos;s indebtedness to the Exchequer in respect of Advances for SecuredBorrowing, so that no difficulty would arise in relation to the overall ceiling of 130 millions; but the point about increasing the limit on advances for equity-typeinvestment would remain. We conclude, therefore, that the treatment offructification interest and capital cannot be decided until it is possible to approach the Corporation after Ministers have reached decisions on the other main issues of policy discussed in this memorandum.Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing(/) All the Corporation^ other investments which had not been abandoned,both existing and future (if any), would be regarded as Exchequer Advances inrespect of Unsecured Borrowing (the Sinclair Committee&apos;s so-called B Stock).Whether or not the Corporation would be allowed to make fresh investments ofthis nature is discussed in Part II below.(g) Interest at the full Exchequer lending rate would be payable by the C.D.C.on all these advances. (Under the Sinclair Committee&apos;s proposals interest would depend on the Corporation^ ability to pay and would be limited to a maximum of 5 per cent.) If the Corporation were unable to pay interest in any one year, thedefault would be reported to Parliament and the liability would be carried overto the next year. It would be shown both in the Corporation^ Annual report and in the annual account in connexion with the C.D.C. which is presented by theColonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office to Parliament. If theliability accumulated, the money would be transferred to Losses and Liabilitiesafter, say, three years, and Parliament would be asked to vote it at a suitable opportunity. This would bring home to all concerned the extent to which theCorporation was subsidised.
Losses and Liabilities(h) In the main these would be what the Sinclair Committee call C Stock. Touse such a term would be misleading, however, since the sums covered by it would represent losses and liabilities to the Exchequer.  They would comprise:(i) advances lost on projects which had already been abandoned or mightbe abandoned in future;(ii) in respect of existing projects, the Corporation^ present accumulatedliability for interest deferred due to the fructification period, togetherwith any capital repayments received by the Corporation but not paidover to the Exchequer owing to the operation of the fructificationperiod, which it may be agreed to treat in this way (see sub-paragraph (e)above).All amounts transferred to Losses and Liabilities would count against the 130 millions Exchequer lending ceiling, except the element representingfructification interest.(/) There is a possible alternative of writing-off (i.e., voting) all thesecomponents of the Losses and Liabilities Account. We do not however recommendthis, since (a) it would seem desirable to keep on record what the C.D.C. has cost the Exchequer and (b) there is always the possibility that the C.D.C. might at some future date realise sufficient profits to repay a part of these losses. It would ofcourse be open to the Government, if it became clear the projects had no reasonablehope of earning sufficient profits, to ask Parliament to write off appropriate amounts,and in some cases this might well be necessary.Treatment of Annual Surpluses(/&apos;) In each financial year any surplus in the profit and loss account would beapplied in the following order of priority:(i) to the payment of interest on Advances in respect of Secured Borrowing(capital repayments to the Exchequer would be made from repaymentsfrom the C.D.C.&apos;s borrowers);(ii) to the payment of interest, at the full Exchequer rate, on Advances inrespect of Unsecured Borrowing (the C.D.C. would be required to devoteto the redemption of these advances any capital which it recovered bythe sale of its investments in this category);(iii) if it were decided that there should be further equity-type investment (see part II below), to the maintenance of a Reserve Fund for investigationsand research at a level of  100,000, not more than  50,000 to be paid intothis account in any one year the Sinclair Committee recommended 500,000 and  250,000 respectively, but this would obviously be too much for the reduced amount of equity business which at most theC.D.C. could be allowed to undertake in future;(iv) to a Losses and Liabilities redemption account.  Amounts so transferredwould release an equivalent amount for new investment, which would,of course, have to be accommodated both within the maximum of 130 millions for all outstanding advances and within the separateindividual maxima applicable to the two categories of advances.As regards (iii), the Treasury point out that it would be inappropriate for any direct contribution to be made from the Exchequer to this reserve fund.Control of Investment7. Under the present Act the Secretary of State has the power to give general directions and also directions as to the disposal of capital assets. Under the new regime, however, it will be necessary to supplement this pov/er to enable theSecretary of State to give, in addition, specific directions on the nature, scope, paceand spread of the C.D.C.&apos;s investments. Its uncommitted resources are small inrelation to the financial needs of the Colonies, and it is not to be expected thatrepayments of existing advances will release large amounts annually for relending.It will be necessary, therefore, for the C.D.C. to accept Her Majesty&apos;s Government^advice, for example, that on grounds of public interest a loan to a given territory or for a given purpose should take precedence over some other loan which might seem more attractive to the Corporation. Subject to this overriding control, mattersof commercial judgment would be left to the Corporation^ own discretion. :57259
PART II8. The provisions in Part I are those which, Departments are agreed, are essential to the C.D.C.&apos;s new constitution. On certain other questions there arediffering opinions. These are, briefly, (a) whether the C.D.C. should be allowedto invest in new equity-type projects, calling for further unsecured borrowing;(b) whether the Corporation should be required to repay capital advanced for suchprojects; and (c) what ranking should be given to the Corporation^ liabilities inrespect of any loans it may be able to raise from sources other than the Exchequer.New Equity-type InvestmentCase for such Investment9. Although many existing projects of an equity type (in which one-third ofthe C.D.C.&apos;s approved borrowings is committed) have either made losses or at leastare not earning enough to service capital, and although the Sinclair Committeeshowed that the existing projects of this type, unless drastic special measures were taken, would in due course leave the Corporation with an unmanageable load of debt, the fact remains that some of them have been valuable to the territories concerned and have yielded a reasonable return. Other such projects may suggestthemselves. The Colonial Office and Commonwealth Relations Office thereforefeel that it would be unwise statutorily to preclude the C.D.C. from engaging infuture business of this sort. They argue that to do so would certainly increase thepolitical and presentational difficulties of the new deal and would almost certainlymean that Lord Howick would be unwilling to accept the chairmanship later thisyear.10. Nevertheless, the Colonial Office and Commonwealth Relations Officeregard it as essential that a limit should be placed in future on the amount of money which the C.D.C. may borrow and have outstanding at any one time for equity-typeinvestments; and also that it should be stipulated that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, the Corporation should not make such investments unless privateenterprise or local sources of finance had a substantial stake in the business. they suggest that the limit should be the total of existing commitments for suchinvestments plus an amount to allow for any necessary expansion of some of these projects plus a proportion of the Corporation^ remaining uncommitted funds. Thebest guess we can make is that commitments for existing risk projects amount to 36-8 millions. On the above hypothesis  40 millions might be a reasonablemaximum to which such projects might be allowed to increase; and, in addition,another  3 millions might be provided for new projects, making a total of 43 millions or approximately one-third of the total of Exchequer money availableto the Corporation. The above figures should, however, be regarded as illustrativeonly. For more precise figures it would be necessary to consult the C.D.C., butDepartments are agreed that it would be preferable not to do so until thismemorandum has been considered by Ministers.Objections to such Investment11. Against the proposals in paragraphs 9 and 10 above, the Treasury pointout that it is in these risk ventures that the Corporation has incurred large losses in the past and has amassed a heavy load of debt for the future. There is no reasonto suppose that further ventures of this sort would not lead to further losses inwhich case there would virtually be no prospect of capital repayment and the probability of some degree of default on interest payments. The Treasury would see the strongest objection to a continuation of this state of affairs on the present basis that losses would fall on the Consolidated Fund. The only way of avoidingthis would be to make any future advances for risk projects above the line on theColonial Services Vote. But this arrangement would involve a degree of controlover individual projects which would call in question the judgment of the C.D.C.to an extent which, in the view of the Colonial Office, would create serious friction and would make the system unworkable. The Treasury therefore consider thatthere is no logical alternative to confining the Corporation in its future activities.to making secured loans and that this would be fully consistent with the Ministerialdecision that the Corporation should continue in being a modified and truncatedform, which, in their view, implies that there should be a reduction in its activities.They would agree, however, that it would be reasonable, subject to the maintenance
of close control, to allow a strictly limited amount of further investment in selectedexisting risk projects if otherwise these could not be made profitable or in order tobring them to a state in which they could be sold off, thus providing the Corporationwith further capital for lending.Capital Repayment of Borrowings for Equity-type Investment12. Under the Sinclair Committee&apos;s proposals the so-called B Stock capital(i.e., advances for risk projects) was to be repaid only according to the ability of theC.D.C. to do so. Some alleviation of the Corporation^ burden does seem necessary, since its existing risk commitments cannot carry the present weight ofinterest and capital repayment over 40 years, even taking account of any surplusprofits that may be available on secured borrowings; and without such alleviationthe Corporation could not hope to borrow up to  20 millions from sources otherthan the Exchequer as provided in the present Act.13. The Colonial Office point out that it is of the essence of equity investmentthat the capital is used to create income-earning assets and does not have to be repaid over a fixed period. They therefore propose that the Corporation should beplaced under no fixed obligation to repay to the Exchequer the capital of advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing, past or future. The existence of a statutory limit on Exchequer advances outstanding at any one time for projects in this category, as proposed in paragraph 10 above, would provide the Corporation with astrong incentive to sell off equity investment in part or in whole, the proceeds ofsuch transactions being devoted to redemption of Advances in respect of UnsecuredBorrowing, since only by this means could the Corporation gain access to additionalmoney for further ventures of this type once the ceiling had been reached. In thisway the capital invested in equity-type projects would be made to revolve, to theextent that the Corporation could in practice make it do so. The Colonial Officerecognise that in all probability it would be only a relatively small portion of the advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing which could in fact be made to revolvein this way. But in their view the alternative, namely that the Corporation shouldbe left with a liability to repay the whole of this capital, would simply leave theCorporation with the outlook which the Sinclair Committee rightly describe ashopeless. This would not be acceptable to Parliamentary opinion; and becauseof the ultimate hopelessness of the situation, the Corporation would have no realincentive to manage its affairs to the best advantage. The arrangements proposedin this paragraph would, on the other hand, provide the Corporation both with an incentive and a challenge.14. The Commonwealth Relations Office share the views of the ColonialOffice in this matter.15. The Treasury, on the other hand, in view of their objection to bearinglosses on the Consolidated Fund (paragraph 11 above), would not consider itappropriate simply to relieve the Corporation of its statutory obligation to repay the capital of the advances which have been, or may be, made to it from theExchequer.  Nor do they accept the Colonial Office&apos;s arguments for so doing.16. First, they do not regard the issue of finance from the Exchequer toC.D.C. as at all comparable with an investment in equity shares. A commercialconcern has to keep its shareholders satisfied that their capital is safe or run therisk of being wound up. If it wishes to expand it must show itself credit-worthy bythe standards of other commercial organisations competing for the availablecapital. The Corporation, on the other hand, can count on further loans from her Majesty&apos;s Government within the statutory limit. These loans are made on terms which are related to the Governments own credit and are much less onerous,even allowing for amortisation charges, than those on which the Corporation wouldbe able to borrow as a commercial enterprise. The Exchequer will, therefore, be continuing to put money into the Corporation despite the past experience of heavy losses, not on any commercial ground, but as a matter of Colonial policy.Moreover, while a commercial concern is admittedly not obliged to repay itscapital over a fixed period, it has to make provision on revenue account to renewits assets. The C.D.C., on the other hand, can count on further loans from her majesty&apos;s Government to replace its assets and can use amounts set aside asprovision for depreciation to repay its capital. Analogies with normal equityinvestment therefore seem to the Treasury to be beside the point.
17. Secondly, while they agree that the existence of a statutory limit onadvances would act as an incentive to the Corporation to sell off investments;waiver of capital repayment is scarcely consistent, in the view of the Treasury,with the revolving nature of the total fund of  130 millions; under the ColonialOffice&apos;s proposal only a small part of the fund would revolve. Only by the repayment of capital could the Corporation lay its hands on new capital, and thenatural incentive to repay would be powerfully supplemented by a continuingstatutory obligation to do so, which, moreover, would be a salutary influence for economy.18. Finally, if the C.D.C. were relieved of any obligation to repay capital,the practical problem would arise of how to determine the interest payable on what would amount to undated loans. (The Colonial Office, however, do not feelthat this difficulty need be insuperable.)19. In the Treasury&apos;s view, therefore, the Corporation should not be excusedits obligation to repay capital. To the extent that it proved unable to do so itshould be subsidised by money voted above the line. As suggested inparagraph 6 (g) above, the first step would be to transfer the amounts, after aperiod to be determined, to Losses and Liabilities. This would bring home toParliament the true cost to the taxpayer of the Corporation^ activities, a consideration to which the Treasury attach much importance; and it would atthe same time save the Corporation from the hopeless situation to which theColonial Office refer.Ranking of Borrowing from Non-Exchequer Sources20. Under the present Act the Corporation is empowered to borrow, overand above the ceiling of  130 millions from the Exchequer, up to  20 millions from sources other than the Exchequer. The Colonial Office consider that it is of thegreatest importance that any scheme of reorganisation which may be decided uponshould be such as to offer the Corporation reasonable prospects of being able toraise finance from non-Exchequer sources. The grounds for this view are, first,that in practice it would not be possible to hold to the existing limit of  130 millions of Exchequer advances to the Corporation unless it was clear that the scheme of reorganisation was such as to give the Corporation a fair prospect of borrowing from non-Exchequer sources; and, secondly, that they believe that the longer-term objective must be to encourage the Corporation to look to non-official sourcesrather than the Exchequer for its finance.21. The Sinclair Committee recommended that the C.D.C.&apos;s obligations tooutside lenders should rank above its obligations to the Exchequer. They clearlyfelt, in the view of the Colonial Office, that unless this were agreed the corporation would have no prospect of borrowing from non-Exchequer sources. The ColonialOffice do not feel that it would be reasonable to subordinate all the C.D.C.&apos;obligations to the Exchequer to its obligations to non-Exchequer lenders. But intheir judgment the minimum arrangement which would provide a reasonable prospect of the Corporation^ being able to borrow from outside sources wouldbe that such borrowing should rank pari passu with C.D.C. Secured borrowing from the Exchequer. This is the course which the Colonial Office accordinglyadvocate.22. The Commonwealth Relations Office share the views of the ColonialOffice.23. The Treasury agree that it would be wholly unreasonable that the C.D.CAsobligations to outside lenders should rank above all its obligations to the Exchequer.They do not consider, however, that the desirability of enabling the C.D.C. to raisemoney from non-Exchequer sources justifies placing its obligations to outsidelenders on a par with its obligations to the Exchequer in respect of SecuredBorrowing and above its obligations to the Exchequer in respect of some  40 millions of Unsecured Borrowing. Like the Colonial Office, they are clear that there mustbe no increase in the existing limit of  130 millions of Exchequer advances, butthey do not share the view that access to private capital would necessarily relievepressure for an increase in this limit; on the contrary, a programme of privateborrowing, which in the nature of things could hardly be large enough of itselfto satisfy the C.D.C.&apos;s aspirations^ might serve to whet its appetite for further
Exchequer borrowing. They consider that the already inadequate security heldby the Exchequer for its loans should not be further weakened. In their view thehighest that the Corporation^ private borrowing should rank is on a par withExchequer Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing.Conclusions24.   Ministers are invited :(.1) to approve the proposals in Part I above;(2) to consider whether the Corporation should in future :(a) be permitted to undertake a limited amount of new equity-typeinvestment (paragraph 10 above); or(b) be confined,  in  its  new  projects,  to  making  secured  loans(paragraph 11);(3) to consider whether the Corporation should be relieved of any fixedobligation to repay the capital of advances for existing schemes of the equity-type and, if (2) (a) above were decided upon, of advances for new schemes of this type (paragraph 13); or, alternatively, whether it should retain the obligation to repay the capital of such advances, on the basis that any default would, after an appropriate period, be met by a subsidyvoted above the line (paragraphs 15-19);(4) to consider whether the Corporation^ obligations in respect of any loansit may be able to raise from sources other than the Exchequer shouldrank on a par with Advances in respect of Secured Borrowing from theExchequer (paragraphs 20 and 21) or after these Advances and on a parwith Advances in respect of Unsecured Borrowing (paragraph 23).25. In any case new legislation would be required, if only to relieve theCorporation of its obligation to repay without subsidy the capital advances made inrespect of existing risk projects and to pay interest on Losses and Liabilities.Treasury Chambers,30th May, 1960.
