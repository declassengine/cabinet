THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July I960C. (60) 104 Copy No.    615th July, 1960CABINETMUSCAT AND OMANNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHer Majesty&apos;s Government intervened in 1957, during the Omani rebellion,in order to ensure their general interest that the Sultanate of Muscat remained intactand in friendly hands. In so doing they incurred considerable internationalembarrassment. For this reason they adopted in 1958 the policy of giving the sultan certain assistance with the object that he could eventually provide his own security without recourse to open British intervention. The annual cost of thesubsidy then foreseen was about  390,000 a year.2. Two things have now become clear. First, the cost of executing the programmes laid down in 1958 was underestimated. The subsidy is already running at something under  700,000 a year and the proper execution of those programmesmight cost  800,000 a year. Secondly, a thorough review has shown that the programmes laid down in 1958 for the strengthening of the Sultans forces and for improving the loyalty of the population by spreading civil benefits were inadequate for the purpose. If the aim of the 1958 policy is to be achieved, the programmesmust be expanded and the total cost of the subsidy is likely to rise to about 1,350,000 recurrent plus about  1,565,000 in capital spread over about three years.Details are shown in paragraphs 10-14 of the Memorandum annexed to this Paper.3. Our interests in the area to-day are no less important than those whichweighed with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in 1958. They relate principally to thepreservation of the independence of Kuwait, on account both of her oil and of hersterling balances, and for this purpose certain political and military requirements in the Persian Gulf must be assured: in particular, the confidence of the Rulers inour protection must be maintained and we must retain military facilities in Masirah(which belongs to the Sultanate), Sharjah on the Trucial Coast, and Bahrain. Theright to overfly Muscat and Oman is also of great value. There are, in addition,important subsidiary interests in the area, some of which may gain furtherimportance in future, for instance, the promising oil discoveries in Abu Dhabi.Our interests are described in paragraphs 1-4 of the annex. To ensure these it isstill our general interest that there should be an independent and friendly Muscatand Oman.4. The policy of avoiding open intervention in Oman is also no less important to-day than it was in 1958. Indeed intervention to-day might be even more damaging to our relations with the other Arab Governments and Afro-Asian States.5. Finally, we must recognise that the threat remains of a further rebellionin Oman inspired and armed from outside by Saudi Arabia, supported by Iraq andthe United Arab Republic and applauded by most of the Arab States.6. I conclude therefore that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should continue thepolicy decided in 1958 and that they should be prepared to pay the extra cost thereof,which is not extravagant in relation to the interests at stake.SECRET57269 b
7. Before reaching this conclusion, however, I examined other possible linesof action:(a) Various forms of disengagement from the Sultanate would not only bedishonourable but would imperil and almost certainly sacrifice thematerial interests in the Gulf which we are concerned to defend.(Paragraphs 22-24 of the annex.)(b) A continuance of our subsidy designed to support the 1958 programmes(costing say  800,000 a year) would not really represent an attempt tocontinue the 1958 policy, since we should in effect be doing only about two-thirds of what we know to be necessary, while relying largely on good luck for success in deterring or countering further trouble.(Paragraph 16 of the annex.)(c) Finally, I have considered the possibility of giving to the Sultan a guarantee,which would necessarily be public, that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould defend his territory. This would enable us to dispense with a largeexpansion of the Sultan&apos;s forces. Making an allowance for a certainnecessary increase in civil development, the subsidy might then bepegged at, say,  850,000 to  900,000 a year, assuming that the Sultan&apos;forces are not to be reduced to insignificance but must be retained as a deterrent of some sort. The attractions and the disadvantages of thispolicy are discussed in paragraphs 17-20 of the annex. The decisiveargument against it, in my opinion, is that it would render openintervention by British forces not only more likely but, indeed, the firstresort and not the last. It would therefore represent an abandonment ofthe policy decided in 1958. It would also be inconsistent with our general policy of avoiding new commitments in the Middle East.8. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree in principle that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be ready to incur costs of about  1,350,000 recurrent, plus about 1,565,000 in capital (spread over three years) in order to maintain the policy decided in 1958. At the same time we should make clear to the Sultan that we shall reserve the right to review our 1958 policy at, say, the end of 1963 if that policy has notbeen proved effective by that time. One object of this reservation is to increase the stimulus to the Sultan to co-operate in making the policy effective.9. If my recommendation above is agreed, conversations would begin at once with the Sultan (who is now in London) under various safeguards set out inparagraphs 28 and 29 of the annex.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,4th July, 1960.
SECRETANNEXMUSCAT AND OMANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is important that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman should remain effectivelycontrolled in friendly hands. The reasons must be seen against the background ofour interests in the Persian Gulf area as a whole. Apart from the need to meet our treaty and moral obligations to the Rulers, these interests are as follows:(a) Economic. To retain access on favourable terms to oil produced in theStates bordering on the Persian Gulf, and to maintain acceptablearrangements for kuwait&apos;s sterling balances.(b) Strategic. To maintain rights over Masirah Airfield. This is likely to growin importance, both as an air staging post providing flexibility on air routes to the Far East, and also possibly in the long term as analternative to other air bases which we possess at present elsewhere inthe area.(c) Political. To defend the area against the spread of Communism or pseudo-Communism.In order to safeguard these interests certain political and military requirements inthe area must be met. We have to retain the confidence of the Rulers in our willand our ability to protect them, and we must maintain the military facilities needed for successful intervention. These requirements have developed substantially inrecent years.2. For some 150 years it was British policy to avoid intervention on land in either the anterior of Oman or the Trucial Shaikhdoms. The reversal of this policyin the last decade was due to the growth in importance of oil and the pre-eminenceof Kuwait, and secondly to the growth of Saudi Arabian imperialism. We now have to reckon also with the Iraqi threat to Kuwait. It is difficult to put a precisemonetary value on the preservation of Kuwait, but it is extremely important thatKuwait should not fall under the control of an unfriendly Government since thiswould greatly strengthen any of the Arab States in putting pressure on the oil companies or Her Majesty&apos;s Government and would jeopardise the  300 millions of kuwait&apos;s sterling balances.3. Our principal interests in the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman apart fromthat described in paragraph 1 (b) above are at present related to our positionelsewhere in the Gulf.(a) The air base at Masirah (off the south coast of Oman) is essential, andoverflying rights over Oman are important to strategic plans for thedefence of Kuwait.(b) The base at Sharjah on the Trucial Coast, which might be endangered by events in Oman, is also essential for the defence of Kuwait.(c) Any withdrawal from Oman might gravely weaken the confidence of the ruler of Kuwait and the other Gulf Rulers in either our will or our ability to protect them.(d) It is essential to prevent the entry to the Gulf from falling into hostile hands.In this connexion, a 12-mile limit to territorial waters would eliminate the high seas passage through the Straits of Hormuz.There are also subsidiary interests:(e) Oil may be discovered in Oman, a territory at present relatively insulatedfrom Arab nationalist influence.(/) If the recent substantial oil strikes in the Abu Dhabi and Qatar sea-bedsdevelop, the security of these States, which depends also on (a), (b) and(c) above, would become more important.4. In addition to these material interests, Her Majesty&apos;s Government also have a moral obligation to support the Sultan. This rests not only on their longfriendship with his dynasty but on the fact that they did not permit the Sultan,before 1955 to deal in his own and probably effective way with the threat posedby the Saudi Arabians in Buraimi or by the stirrings of independence in the Omaninterior.
Intervention in 1957 and Subsidy in 19585. For the reasons in paragraphs 3 and 4 above Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentintervened openly in Oman in 1957 to sustain the Sultan&apos;s authority against arebellion which would have placed the Oman interior and probably the whole country under hostile control. In doing so Her Majesty&apos;s Government incurredconsiderable international embarrassment. As a result, in July 1958 they undertook to give financial and other help to the Sultan in order to help him to preserve hissecurity without the need for open British intervention. This is the policy whichhas been pursued since that time.Situation in Oman and the External Threat6. The threat envisaged in 1958 was that of an organised revolt on the linesof 1957, when a few hundreds of well-led dissidents, infiltrated from Saudi Arabia,held an enclave on Sultanate territory. Insurrection on this pattern is still possible,and the Saudi Arabian Government have trained several hundred Omanis for thispurpose. Another form of threat is now, however, more probable and would bemore dangerous, that of prolonged and widespread guerrilla activity, supported byarms and money infiltrated from Saudi Arabia, or from the United Arab republic and Iraq, both of whom have pledged their support for an independent Omani State.The Programme needed in 19587. The recurrent cost of the subsidy foreseen in 1958 was about  390,000 ayear.  50,000 of this was allocated for civil development,  68,000 for an air forceand the remainder ( 272,000) was added to the Sultan&apos;s own contribution ( 232,500)to support an army. The civil development programme included the building ofthree roads, a school, an agricultural research station and 10 dispensaries or medicalcentres, for a population estimated at 500,000 in an almost wholly undevelopedcountry as large as the United Kingdom. The air force included three strikeaircraft, and two communications aircraft, the bare minimum which ds technicallynecessary to constitute a force at all. The army was expected to number 1,470when recruits could be obtained.8. The costs foreseen for 1958 proved to be an underestimate. Recurrentcosts are already running at something under  700,000 a year. Even these costs,however, are inadequate properly to execute the programmes for the Sultan&apos;s forces and civil development envisaged in 1958. The cost of properly executing existing programmes would probably be about  800,000 a year (roughly  620,000 for thearmy,  115,000 for the air force and  65,000 for civil development).Inadequacy of the 1958 programme . Even if properly executed (at a cost of about  800,000 a year) the 1958programme would not, however, be adequate to secure the objectives of our policy as decided in 1958. This has been shown by a thorough review, both military and civil, which has been undertaken over the past six months. That is to say, if it isto be reasonably probable that a further rebellion inspired from outside could be averted or crushed without the need for open intervention by British forces, the sultan&apos;s armed forces must be larger and better equipped, and the civil development programme should be on a larger scale, than was necessary two years ago. this does, not reflect a recent deterioration in the situation, which has in fact beenperceptibly improving. It shows only that we have been operating with anunacceptably low margin of safety.Increased Programme now needed to carry out 1958 Policy10. A detailed military review has been undertaken by Brigadier M. R. J. HopeThomson, seconded for the purpose by the War Office. His comprehensive andconvincing report has been strongly endorsed by the General Officer commanding in Aden, approved by the War Office in the context of the 1958 policy, and approved(with amendments) by the Air Ministry. It gives high priority to deterrence andto the need to crush trouble in the early stages. It makes the maximum provisionfor the overriding operational requirements of good intelligence, good signals and high mobility. Even allowing for the economies of manpower thereby made possible, the report recommends that the Muscat army establishment should riseover three years from .1,470 to 2,140 and that a gendarmerie of 280 should be
SECRET5established. It recommends discarding certain unrealistic assumptions made in 1958about rates of pay (which were inadequate to attract Arab recruits), scale of equipment, depreciation of vehicles, and reserve holdings and training ammunition.The number of seconded British officers would rise from 23 to only 25. BrigadierHope Thomson disagreed with the view of the Sultans Defence Secretary and ofthe Commander of the Sultan&apos;s Armed Forces that the total army strength shouldbe as high as 3,060 and that two armoured car troops, two engineer troops and otherdesirable but not essential items should be included. The preliminary costing ofBrigadier Hope Thomsons army proposals indicates an additional capital cost of very roughly  1,035,000 spread over 3-4 years, plus a total recurrent cost rising after three years to about  1,291,000 per year. From these figures the Sultanscontribution should be deducted. It is doubtful whether he will contribute muchto the capital, but .on present form he would offer to contribute not less than 275,000 recurrent, leaving about  1 million per year in respect of the army to befound by Her Majestys Government.11. On the air force side, Brigadier Hope Thomsons recommendations arestill subject to reserves about future types of aircraft. They stress the greatimportance of communications and transport and the need for rapidity of strike action in the first stage of any revolt. They envisage adding one transport aircraft,one communications aircraft and two strike aircraft to the existing establishment.The Air Ministry agree that the additional strike aircraft are required (togetherwith some reserve aircraft), but consider that transport / communication needs could best be met by increasing the establishment by two and re-equipping the Force withBeaver aircraft. The addition to the recurrent cost would be about  70,000,making  185,000 a year in all. The capital cost involved would be about  250,000,but this is not a true net addition to capital costs since a sum roughly one-thirdof this amount would in any event shortly have to be incurred to replace existingaircraft even if no expansion takes place. The Sultan has never made any contribution for the air force.12. In civil development, unlike military organisation, there is no &quot; threat &quot; ortarget to which the effort can be related. The Sultan has, however, recently comeround to our view that order cannot be maintained in this country by force alone or by making payments to tribal shaikhs at a time when the tribal framework isweakening. He is prepared to co-operate in modest development schemes viewedas an adjunct to the strenthening of physical control throughout the country. Thequestion is only of-the balance between military and civil expenditure. Thepresent recurrent civil development budget of  50,000 cannot be expected to makemuch impression on the Sultanate. In the Trucial States, in easier country with less than one-fifth of the population, an annual development programme of about 100,000 is barely sufficient to make a real impression. There are also secondaryfactors. British officers and other subjects in the Sultanate are discontented at the apparent lack of any kind of civil progress, and opinion in this country may find ithard to understand the disproportion between military and civil expenditure. Also,opinion outside the Sultanate tends to blame this country for the backward andunderdeveloped state of affairs.13. The new civil development programme envisaged for the Sultanate would increase by about  100,000 over the present  50,000 per year and involve additional capital of about  282,000 (spread over some years). Much the largest item of theincrease is  33,000 recurrent plus  87,000 capital for medical aid (largelydispensaries and health centres), which brings the most immediate and welcomebenefits to large parts of the population. The next most important items are thosedesigned to increase the productivity of the Sultanate, e.g., agricultural research,fisheries and port improvement. Details of the whole programme remain fordiscussion with the departments concerned, but the order of costs involved is approximately as described above.Probable Cost to Her Majesty&apos;s Government of the New Programmes14. The total annual costs to Her Majestys Government, military, air forceand civil, would be of the order of  1,350,000 together with about  1,565,000 in capital costs spread over about three years. The figure could be only slightlyreduced even if the Sultan increased his contribution to what we believe to be thelimit of his capacity to pay. The cost would, however, be radically affected if oilis found in Oman or, in the other direction, if the oil companies renounced their
concession at the end of their present two year survey programme. It is also fair to say that the total costs quoted above are somewhat greater than the net additionto the costs which would have to be borne by the Exchequer. For instance, theestimate of recurrent costs earlier in this paragraph includes about  150,000 forBritish seconded and attached personnel. The pay, if not the allowances, of atleast some of these might fall on the Exchequer in any case. A certain amountof military equipment, obsolete or obsolescent so far as Her Majesty&apos;s Forces areconcerned, finds a market in the Sultan&apos;s forces. Even new equipment bought fromthis country provides a margin of profit.Alternative Policies to be Considered15. In the light of this increase of costs it has to be decided whether we shouldcontinue with our existing policy or whether the objects of our policy should be pursued by other means or even conceivably modified or abandoned. There are three conceivable lines of action within the framework of our continued supportof the Sultanate. These are:  (a) To re-endorse the 1958 policy and accept its consequences in full togetherwith the increased costs.(b) To continue our aid only to the extent of the programmes decided in 1958.(c) To abandon the 1958 policy and give a guarantee of protection to the Sultan.The implications of (a) have been discussed in paragraphs 10 to 12 above. Thesecond and third are discussed below.. . . Continuance of 1958 (Unexpanded) ProgrammesParagraph 15 (b)16. This would mean deliberately accepting a considerable risk both that arebellion might break out and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would in that eventhave to decide either to intervene once more or to watch a possible hostile regimeestablished in the interior or even in the whole of the Sultanate. We would haveto accept the fact that the Sultan&apos;s forces and administration would not be built up to a level offering a reasonable insurance against the need for such furtherintervention. (The risk would of course be even greater if only the present levelof the subsidy was maintained, since this would not even suffice to support the1958 programmes.) The principal question is whether the extent of insurance so obtained would be worth having at the price or even at all. There can be no clear-cut answer to this question. The weight of expert opinion, however, is thatthe military establishment included in the figure of  1,350,000 recurrent inparagraph 14 above (plus a slightly larger sum in capital) is the minimum necessaryto achieve reasonable security. Failure to increase our aid accordingly wouldmean that we were pursuing our 1958 policy only half-heartedly and relying largely on luck for its success. The assessment of the increased requirements (both militaryand civil) must stand irrespective of the fact that the 1958 programmes have not yetbeen fully executed. Considerable progress has been made, on the military side in particular, quite sufficient to enable lessons to be drawn about the inadequacy ofthe 1958 programmes. Also the fact that no rebellion has occurred since january 1959 cannot be taken as evidence that the existing effort is adequate. the saudi Arabian Government have deliberately abstained from making troubleduring the current Anglo-Saudi discussions on the resumption of diplomatic relations, but as soon as the irreconcilable nature of British and Saudi views onBuraimi becomes evident once more, this restraint may disappear. Furthermore,the United Arab Republic and Iraq have both espoused the Omani cause. although these three Arab Governments may be willing to hold the Omani threat temporarily in suspense, for some special reason of their own, they will collectively orindividually wish to maintain it in being, both as a weapon against the UnitedKingdom position in the Arabian Peninsula and as evidence of their fidelity to theArab nationalist cause.. . . Possible Guarantee of Protection to the SultanParagraph 15 (c)17. There are considerable attractions in the concept of giving an undertaking that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would defend the Sultan&apos;s territories. Since sucha commitment, which would of course have to be public, would necessarily involve
planning for the use of British forces, it would no longer be necessary to build upthe Sultan&apos;s forces on a scale sufficient to crush a rebellion on their own. A greater proportion of the available money could moreover be diverted for civil development and constructive purposes. The morale of the other Rulers in the Gulf might be favourably affected. It is difficult to estimate the financial saving which this new policy might permit. It would seem desirable to maintain the Sultan&apos;s armed forces at a significant level, if only to reduce the risk that British intervention mightbe called for. It is doubtful whether these forces should in fact be reduced much below the level envisaged in 1958. Allowing for an expansion of the civildevelopment programme the total cost of the subsidy under this policy might beof the order of  85O,O0O- 900,00O a year, i.e., a saving of, say, some  450,000 a year over the full cost of continuing our existing policy.18. The arguments against this new policy are, however, impressive. Thedetermining factor seems to be that such a policy would make open intervention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government more likely than does the present policy. Openintervention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government would become the first resort and notthe last. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have not of course at any time decided thatthey will not intervene to save the Sultan in the last resort, although they have gonevery far in indicating to him that they will not do so.19. The argument in paragraph 18 above is in my own view decisive. Thereare, however, other arguments of some weight. An undertaking to defend theSultahs territory would run counter to our general policy of making no new commitments in the Middle East and in particular no new public commitments.Moreover, during the next few months at least, while Mr. Hammarskjold, theSecretary-General of the United Nations Organisation, is conducting his negotiationfor the despatch of a &quot; neutral personage &quot; on what is no more than a tour of inspection in the area, we are committed to take no action affecting the status ofthe 1955 frontiers in the area, provided that the Saudis make a similar self-denyingordinance. A guarantee to the Sultan would be interpreted as a breach of this undertaking. Secondly, the question of financial saving is not so clear. If Britishintervention in Oman is to be effective, plans must be made for intervention at theearliest possible moment, since the scale of force necessary will rise rapidly if trouble is allowed to continue unchecked. This means that the inconvenience and effects on other tasks in the area of this additional commitment for British forces must beset against any saving in the subsidy. Actual intervention, if it became necessary,might more than cancel out any of the financial economies envisaged above.20. Among the secondary arguments against the proposal are the following.If the Sultan had a complete assurance of protection the incentive towards internalreform would disappear. Secondly, a commitment to the Sultan personally, giventhe general backwardness of his regime, would not immediately commend itself to public opinion in this country. Negatively, it can also be argued that a formalundertaking to defend the Sultahs territory would not necessarily be more effective than our present policy as a deterrent against attempts at rebellion, since the rebelleaders already believe that we are committed to defend the Sultan, both because,of our actions during the late rebellion and because of the regular manoeuvreswhich have been held by British forces in Oman since the autumn of 1959.Policies Outside the Framework of Support for the Sultan21. If for any reason we decided to discontinue our present policy of support for the Sultanate there are three forms of disengagement which we mightcontemplate involving a partial or complete break with the Sultan himself:(a) An attempt to establish a new protected State in Oman, under one or -more of the late rebel leaders.(b) Disengagement from the interior of Oman.(c) Disengagement from the Sultanate as a whole.... A New Protected State in Oman22. At the cost of a partial break with the Sultan we might come to terms with the late rebel leaders, or some of them separately, and try to establish them under our own protection in the interior of Oman. Contacts with the rebels nowin Saudi Arabia have in fact been going on with the Sultahs knowledge. these have given no grounds to believe that the rebel leaders, collectively or separately,would agree to anything less than complete autonomy, which the Sultan could never
agree except under force majeure. There is very little reason to believe that therebel leaders as a group would agree to receive our protection in an autonomousOmani State. There is slightly more ground to believe that in certain circumstancesone of the rebel leaders, Suleiman bin Himyar, if it was possible to detach him fromthe others, would accept our protection. Even assuming, however, that an autonomous Omani State could be established under our protection, there wouldbe strong external pressures on the leaders of an independent Oman to renounceour protection and change their course and, although the Omanis are traditionallydistrustful of Saudi influence, these pressures are likely to prevail. The only chanceof maintaining stability in the area would be to establish a substantial cordonsanitaire around the Omani State, particularly between Oman and Saudi Arabia.The financial and military commitments needed to maintain this cordon, and to subsidise the new protected State, might be no less and might be greater than thosenecessitated by our existing policy. In addition to the new military and financial commitment, the course considered in this paragraph would involve relying on thevery doubtful willingness of the rebel leaders to maintain a relationship with her majesty&apos;s Government which would be repugnant to the Arab nationalist feelingwhich they have hitherto invoked. The risks involved would therefore be considerable. The consequences of failure would also be serious, since we wouldthen incur the risks described in the other two policies at paragraph 21 (b) and (c)above, dealt with in paragraph 24 below. Finally, any attempt to conduct seriousnegotiations with the rebels behind the Sultan&apos;s back would shake the confidence of the Persian Gulf Rulers as well as representing a breach of faith with the Sultanhimself.... Disengagement from the Interior of Oman, or from the Whole Sultanate23. If we attempted to disengage completely, either from the interior of Omanor from the Sultanate as a whole, we should be in serious breach of understanding with the Sultan. Our obligation to the Sultan does not rest only on the 1958agreement by which we undertook to build up his armed forces and give him aid for civil development, while he granted us a 99-year lease of Masirah. Duringthe negotiations in Muscat in January 1958 Mr. Julian Amery, the parliamentary under Secretary of State and Financial Secretary, War Office, assured the Sultancategorically that British assistance would be &quot; on a very long-term basis &quot;, andthat our presence in Masirah &quot; would be a sign of our enduring support forMuscat&quot;. During the Sultan&apos;s visit to London in 1959 he was assured that theobject of Her Majesty&apos;s Government was to ensure that the policy embarked upon in 1958 was made practicable.24. Either of these courses of disengagement would also entail greater dangersfor our interests than the policy described in paragraph 22 above. The results ofdisengagement from the interior would depend largely on how far we could maintain a cordon sanitaire around Oman. The difficulty and cost of doing this might bemuch greater than if we had only to attempt to contain a new &quot; protected &quot; State.Even if such a cordon could be maintained, a neutral or unfriendly Oman would offer to the Saudis a valuable base for subversion of the Trucial Coast. Such anOmani State moreover would soon press claims on the remaining territories of the sultan, with a corresponding increase in the effort needed to defend them. Theresults of complete disengagement from the Sultanate would be even more serious.Control of the mainland opposite Masirah and thereafter Masirah itself would almost certainly be lost. It is most unlikely that, in the face of a hostile world opinion, we could retain our position in Masirah by physical force in defiance ofthe mainland authority to whom Masirah belonged. Overflying rights over Omanwould lapse. The threat to the Trucial Coast would be greatly increased and it is uncertain how far this could be contained. The confidence of the Ruler of kuwait and other Gulf Rulers would be seriously shaken, with unforeseeable consequencesin respect of the future of our relationship with Kuwait. Our subsidiary interests inthe Sultanate would also automatically lapse (possibly discoveries of oil, the reaction of events in Oman on future oil development in Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and controlof the entry into the Persian Gulf).Conclusion on the Choice of Policies25. Any form of disengagement (paragraphs 22-24) at the present time wouldseem to involve both a breach of faith and unacceptable risks to our position in
Kuwait.. Any radical change in our position in Kuwait might modify this position.On the other hand other interests in the Persian Gulf which now seem relatively less important might meanwhile gain in priority: for instance, latest indications fromAbu Dhabi are extremely promising, and it is not fanciful to visualise a time someyears ahead when Abu Dhabi and Qatar oil together, in which British interestspredominate, may total something like one-third of the present Kuwaiti production.26. Within the framework of continued support of the Sultan, the choiceappears to depend on the importance which we still attach to the policy decided in1958, namely, that the Sultan should be enabled to ensure his security withoutrecourse to open intervention by ourselves. The political effects of any resort to open intervention would, I consider, be no less serious to-day than they seemedin 1958. It is difficult to evaluate the direct and indirect economic costs of openintervention. An attempt has been made to estimate the direct costs of interventionon a battalion-group scale. Allowing for air support, the cost might be of theorder of  2 millions. More significance might be attached to the indirect economiceffects due to a deterioration of our relations with the Arab and other Afro-asian countries. Against the background of our interests in the Gulf, the scale ofexpenditure involved in paying the full price for carrying out the 1958 policycannot be called extravagant.27. I have considered whether it might ease our task if the Sultan could be persuaded to make way for a successor. No alternative regime, however, isconceivable which would necessarily be better than the present Sultan, who is astaunch friend of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and possesses great virtues as well asconsiderable defects; and the alternatives might be worse.28. If we continue the 1958 policy of increased cost we should of coursecontinue also the regular training exercises in Oman which have been recently heldby British forces stationed elsewhere. These exercises are known to have exerteda deterrent effect on the rebel leaders. Secondly we should also seek any possible opportunity for a settlement by which one or more of the rebel leaders submittedto the Sultan&apos;s authority and returned to Oman under conditions acceptable to the sultan and satisfactory to ourselves. Such a settlement seems at present unlikely,but if it could in future be achieved it might reduce the rebel threat and thereforeprobably also the efforts needed to counteract the latter. Both lines of actiondescribed in this paragraph would of course be important even if the alternativepolicies in support of the Sultan were adopted (paragraph 15 (b) and (c) above).Recommendation29. I consider that in principle Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be preparedto pay up to about  1,350,000 a year (plus  1,565,000 capital) as the price of continuing our present policy in Oman: there would be little chance of significantlyreducing this burden unless oil is discovered, and we cannot confidently expect,though we should attempt, to secure United Nations assistance for developmentpurposes. I invite my colleagues to agree to this as a preliminary to the talks whichwe have been pledged since last autumn to undertake with the Sultan on thelong-term programme for his country and which are due to begin in London earlyin July. During these talks my Department will remain in close touch with theTreasury and Service Departments. They will endeavour to reduce the total costs in detail, in so far as that is compatible with the general policy which I have recommended above, and to secure the maximum contribution from the Sultanhimself. They will also try to ensure satisfactory methods of control, both financialand otherwise, of any increased scale of assistance. It would also be made clear to the Sultan that the object of increased expenditure is to render practicable, withhis assistance, the policy on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government decided in 1958, butthat if events in the future (say within the next three years) prove that this object is unattainable. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will have to consider other means ofsecuring their interests. I believe that it is essential to retain this note of doubtwith its veiled threat in our dealings with the Sultan if we are to instil a sense of urgency and secure his co-operation in the active measures of reorganisation which seem necessary.S. L.July I960.
