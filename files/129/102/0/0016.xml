i SECRET &quot;        j 3 2(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C, (60) 116 COPY NO.   -  \19th July, I960CABINETHER MAJESTY&apos;S OVERSEAS CIVIL service memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesPresent ArrangementsWe have reached a critical period for the administrations of colonial territories in our policy of progress by ordered stages to self-government.The richer and better developed territories, Ceylon, Ghana, Malaya and singapore, have become independent or self-governing with a decline, butnot so far a catastrophic decline, in standards of administration.    In thenext few months Nigeria and Sierra Leone will join them as independent states.    The Civil Service of Ceylon was mainly staffed by local officersbefore independence.    In Ghana 60 per cent of senior posts in the service were staffed before independence by local officers and in Malaya nearly50 per cent.    In mid-1959 about two-thirds of the seniorposts in the self-governing Eastern and Western Regions of Nigeria were filled by local officers.    In these territories, other than Ceylon, lump sum compensationfor loss of career was made available at about the stage of self-governmentto members of Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas Civil Service;  about a third ofthem left within a year of self-government, and the drain has continued.But enough have remained to be able, with local officers, to maintain the framework of government.    The first years of Nigerian independence will however be critical as both the Northern Region and the Federation ralymore than the Eastern and Western Regions on overseas officers and wedo not know how many will stay.2.      These changes have reduced the strength of the Overseas CivilService to about 15,000 members, including 2,300 administrative officers.Some 7,000 serve in East Africa, over 2,000 in Nigeria and Sierra Leone,and 1, 500 in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    In addition there are about 10,000 officers serving overseas on contract of whom over 2,000 arein East Africa, nearly 2,000 in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and over 700 inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    The bulk of the remainder of theService is thus concentrated in East and Central Africa where in the nextfew years our policy will be put to its most serious test.3.      The arrangements to be made for the Service when a territorybecomes self-governing were set out in Colonial No. 306, published in 1954.Her Majesty&apos;s Government promised to safeguard pensions, to protectconditions of service of officers continuing to serve, to continue toconsider these officers for transfer elsewhere, and to arrange for thelocal Government to provide proper compensation for officers sufferingpremature retirement through constitutional change.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment also undertook to ensure the observance of these conditionsby the conclusion of a Public Officers&apos; Agreement with each territorybecoming self-governing.SECRET
SECRETJL D 3Their Defects-4.      These arrangements have been fully observed and have secured the legitimate interests of overseas officers by protecting their pensions and providing compensation.    But more must be done if we are to be able to rely on the support of the Service in pursuing our policies in the remainingColonial territories.    The problem is most urgent and acute in East and central Africa but is serious in nearly all of them.    The safeguardspromised by Colonial No. 306 take effect only on self-government.    Butoverseas officers become subject to the strains of approaching self-government for years before the event, and during this period of transitionour ability to secure proper conditions of service for them steadily declinesas power passes to local politicians who may be temperamentally unwillingor politically impotent to see justice done to the claims of an expatriateCivil Service which, for the very reason of its major role, absorbs muchof its limited revenues.    The classic example of this frustrating situation has been Nigeria.    Because we were unable to persuade Ministers thereto grant the increased salaries which were due, and were unwilling openly toprovide them ourselves, we devised the Special List B scheme which, whilerelated to the Nigerian compensation schemes, was intended to be a hiddensubsidy in place of the missing salary increase.    We were conscious,however, that it was an unsatisfactory compromise with a number of defectsand, although many officers joined the List for its benefits, their discontentremained.    On the other hand Nigerian Ministers, to whom these concessions bulked large, have increasingly regarded them as a classover-concerned with their privileges, and relations between the ministers and their overseas officers have deteriorated.5.      The second defect of the present arrangements is that their emphasis is on protecting officers1 existing rights rather than encouraging them tocontimie to serve.    While many officers will find their careers curtailedby self-government it will still in most cases be open to them, if we cancreate favourable conditions, to continue for some years to provideinvaluable service.     But as self-government approaches many overseasofficers sense the loss of protection by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, feelthemselves forgotten, lose heart, and simply wait for compensation toobtain their release on favourable terms.    Local Ministers are generallywell aware that they need to keep most of their overseas officers, but thedemands made on them to achieve this, for compensation, for increasedsalaries to parallel increased prosperity in the United Kingdom, and forsuccessive statements of reassurance (which seem to compromise them before their new nationalistic electorate), appear an excessive price topay.    So far Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s contribution has beenexhortation to both local Ministers and the Service and insistence on theprinciple that all costs must be borne on local revenues, even if forpoorer territories these require subvention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The incongruity of the situation is heightened by the fact that, as officersleave with compensation, many of them have to be replaced by contractofficers of lesser quality and experience, and we are often asked to help to finance these under technical assistance schemes.Present Problem6.  These patchwork arrangements will not meet the situation in Eastand Central Africa.    In Tanganyika, which is likely to be the first of
these territories to achieve self-government, only 10 per cent of the seniorposts in the public service are filled by Africans;   243 Africans achievedSchool Certificate standard last year, and about 20 obtained a degree or its equivalent at Makerere.    In Uganda the situation is a little better with about 12^ per cent of the senior posts filled by Africans and 500 SchoolCertificate passes in 1959.    These figures are improving each year butit is evident from them that it will be at least five years before the territories can expect to provide even the normal intake to maintain theService and ten years before there will be sufficient experienced local officers to fill the majority of the superscale posts in the Service.7.      The overseas officers in East Africa have already fallen under the shadow of impending self-government:    A Salaries Commission, justappointed, may bring some immediate relief but the present poor conditionsof service combined with anxiety about future prospects have alreadycaused a serious decline in morale.    Both the Governors and serving officers have naturally and properly turned to Her Majesty&apos;s government as their sole resource in this difficult situation.    The Governors considerthat if Service morale and confidence in Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot be restored a large proportion of the Service will leave at theearliest opportunity.     We cannot compel them to remain but unless manydo so we shall face a decline in our ability to maintain stable governmentwhich might have disastrous consequences.Career Prospects8.      I have therefore considered what more can be done to induce officers to remain.    A major reason for premature retirement is loss of careerprospects.    It has been suggested that this could be met by the creationof a Commonwealth Service available on request to assist all commonwealth governments;  or a Service based in the United Kingdom, employed by her Majesty&apos;s Government and similarly available;  or simply by the amalgamation of the Home Civil Service and the Overseas Civil service on a common establishment.    Unfortunately all these superficiallyattractive solutions fail for two main reasons.     The number of the home civil Service is static and it has no substantial body of vacancies availablefor the bulk of the Overseas Service, while vacancies in the Commonwealthwhichare open to United Kingdom candidates are already notified here, sothat the new Service would generate no new jobs.    Her Majesty1 sGovernment as employer of the new Service would have no control over the overseas establishments they were asked to fill and so could not ensure a satisfactory or indeed a continuing career for any officer.New Proposals9.      Since a full career can no longer be assured we must make thecareer that remains as attractive as possible if we are to retain theService in sufficient numbers to enable our policy to be carried outsuccessfully.    Whatever we do a good many officers for family reasons,distaste for political developments and the atmosphere which accompaniesthem, or the chance of a fresh start, will choose to leave prematurely.But we can enhance the attractions of continuing service by financial help,which for the new Governments will greatly ease their financial andespecially their political difficulties in maintaining an expensive cadreof overseas officers, and for the officers will guarantee reasonable
SECRET ,        I 9 CX tt tsconditions of service and retain the direct link with Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that means so much.    We, other nations, and the United Nationsprovide technical assistance in manpower after independence.    Thenormal arrangement is that the receiving country provides the local salaryand the assisting country the external expenses of the appointment,including the addition needed to the local salary to attract a candidatefrom overseas.    We have recognised a similar principle in the Supply of teachers Scheme which resulted from the Commonwealth EducationConference.    I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the application ofthis principle to the Overseas Civil Service.10.    In territories employing the majority of Overseas officers there isa local salary payable to all officers, together with an inducement additionpayable only to overseas officers.    I propose that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should offer to conclude agreements with overseas governments to assume responsibility for this inducement element in the pay of overseas officers and also to pay passage costs and suitable children&apos;sor education allowances (since the cost of providing overseas education and a second home for children is the heaviest single burden on overseasofficers).11.     I propose that these payments should extend not only to thepensionable members of the Service but also to contract officers from overseas serving in comparable posts and recruited by the ColonialOffice or the Crown Agents.    In some professions, such as engineering,most recruitment is by contract, and as territories approach self-government an increasing proportion of all overseas recruitment is bycontract, since full careers are no longer open to overseas officers andthe compensation bill (for those already there) must not be increased.Extent of Proposals12.    The cost will be heavy and I have considered how to limit it.    our main anxieties at present concern East and Central Africa and to restrictour commitment to these territories would save over one-third of thecost.    But there is no principle by which we could justify our refusal toextend this commitment to the other members of the Service.    The only other large section is those serving in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.    Whilethe Eastern and Western Regions of Nigeria have taken the initial strainof self-government the Federation have yet to do so, and the real testingtime is just beginning for the Northern Region, much the largest andmost backward part of the country, where the standard of literacy seven lower than in East Africa.    If Nigeria were to disintegrate the wholeimpetus of our Colonial policy would be lost, and I have no doubt thatit is both desirable and inevitable to offer to extend the scheme to Nigeria,and to the smaller and poorer Sierra Leone, where the bulk of the protectorate is disturbed and undeveloped.    It should not be difficult tojustify not extending the scheme to Ghana, which has already dispensed with four-fifths of its permanent overseas officers, and has the wealthto recruit more if it wishes, and to Malaya which is in a comparableposition.13.    In addition to these large territories there is a number of smallermainly island colonies such as those of the Indian Ocean and the Western-4.
-\;.-;:.::;rPacific.    They employ, even combined, a very small proportion of overseas Civil Servants.    Their problems of government are often asacute, if not on the same scale, as those of the bigger territories, andtheir few overseas officers need to be of high quality.    Mostly their resources, and therefore their capacity to pay, are very poor.    In thepast their top posts have often been filled by younger promising officerspicked out from the larger territories.    Many of these later obtained highrank in the Service, and the prospect of earning this was an attraction whichcounter-balanced the poor material conditions of service.     That prospectno longer exists, while the conditions for which the smaller territoriescan afford to pay are becoming relatively worse.    Many of them (e.g. ,British Guiana and Mauritius) also have political anxieties akin to thoseof East Africa.    There is already great difficulty in filling these posts and unless we can get good men for them we shall not only risk wasting theColonial Development and Welfare money we make available for them,but  have  on    our hands the problem of scandalous standards of govern-ment which, even if on a small scale, can still be gravely embarrassing.I therefore recommend that the proposals should cover nearly allterritories still dependent including (with the agreement of theCommonwealth Secretary) the High Commission territories.    The onlyones which I think it is possible to exclude are Hong Kong, Brunei, the bahamas and Bermuda, where the wealth and individuality of the territories at present give, in my view, adequate justification for theirexclusion.Compensation14.    One other financial change is also essential.    On India, the Sudan,Malaya and the African territories attaining independence, we haveinsisted that all the overseas members of their Services should havecompensation for loss of career at the stage of self-government.     Thishas also been promised to the Service in East Africa.    I am sure thispolicy is right.    The change of master at this stage is a fundamental change in their position and in the conditions on which they were recruited,and they can moreover no longer look forward to the completion of a normal career.    On the other hand their services are in many casesstill urgently needed for a time and it is in the interests both of theColonial Government and of the United Kingdom that they should stay on.To try and induce them to do so, we have at that stage, therefore, alsoinsisted on the Public Officers&apos; Agreements referred to in paragraph 3.Our insistence however that compensation is in principle the sole responsibility of the local Government, both as the employer of overseasstaff and the prime mover in the constitutional changes which requirecompensation, has caused much bitterness.    Local Ministers anxiousto devote their limited resources to development are required to depletethem to pay for an unproductive scheme which will hasten the departure of the officers they still need.    Ministers have accepted our demand for both compensation and such an Agreement, as part of the price of their freedom.    But our arguments have never convinced them and the upshothas gravely imperilled the good relations between them and the overseasofficers which it is cardinal to our policy to preserve.    It would greatlyease those relations if the cost of compensation were shared equally between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the local Government.    Thisequal division would fairly reflect the fact that constitutional changes area joint responsibility of the Governments.    If we assume responsibility- 5-
for inducement. Pay we should in any case have to pay compensationequivalent to that proportion of total salary - say a quarter.    Furthermore,the remaining dependent territories are mainly the poorer ones where weshould need to contribute to compensation by increased grant in aid as wehave done in Sierra Leone.    I do not therefore expect that sharing the full cost of compensation would in fact add much to our burden.    But it wouldunquestionably go far to create a new atmosphere in which overseas officerscouid work.    Experience in West Africa suggests that it is much the biggest step we can take to that end.    It would therefore represent far better use of money that we are likely in any case to spend.    To give theleast inducement to go, and the most to stay, I propose that futurecompensation schemes should broadly take the form of the recent sierra leone scheme.    Officers required to leave should receive compensation in one lump sum calculated to take account of their actual loss of employ-ment.    Those free to leave or to stay should receive compensation on a lesser scale payable by instalments spread over several years.Re settlement15.    Since it is not possible to absorb elsewhere in the service of theUnited Kingdom Government most of the officers whose careers come toan end prematurely, we must do everything we can to help find jobselsewhere for the majority of them.    An Overseas Resettlement Bureau was set up three years ago.    It may be necessary to expand its scope on thelines of the arrangements made in respect of redundant members of the armed Forces.    This aspect would be fully covered in the White paper i have in mind (see paragraph 22) but it is not likely to involve any material expenditure and I need not trouble my colleagues with it.Cost of Procosals----16.    The total cost of my proposals will be heavy.    In most territoriessalaries have not kept pace either with recent prices or with salaries here.The best provisional estimate I can make is that the cost of a fair&apos;current rate of inducement pay would be about  500 per annum per officer,which would roughly double the present average level of this element in pay.    The annual cost might then be as follows:-  millionsInducement Pay	9Education Allowances	3. 5Pensions and Gratuities	2Passages	7.12Compensation (10 year average)	2. 66Total	24. 2817.    We should have to make it clear that these proposals are not designed to replace our general assistance in development, or they mightbe regarded as a new device for perpetuating our control and channellingthe fund we provide into white hands.    Nevertheless, since the proposals-6-
ssc:.-.-.r;will increase the funds available to local Governments, they will automatically lead to savings in United Kingdom grant in aid to someterritories and they may make it possible to avoid grant in aid to certainEast African territories which are now on the borderline for such assistanceThere will also be a saving in the manpower cost of Colonial development and Welfare schemes.18.    It is likely that the  9 millions per annum inducement pay will be spent locally and the other payments will be spent mainly in this country.Assuming that inducement pay all goes on increased imports and thatthese are drawn from existing sources in the same proportions as atpresent,this would mean an increase of  2 millions per annum in UnitedKingdom exports, a similar increase from the rest of the sterling area andan increase of  5 millions in imports from the rest of the world.Duration of Proposals19.    The proposals would continue in force after independence since theiressence is to enable overseas officers to continue to serve so long as theyare needed.    But the responsibilities of Her Majesty&apos;s Government ando f the local Government must be clearly defined and I propose that each government wishing to participate should conclude an agreement with her Majesty1 s Government which would normally be for a period of, say,ten years.    The inducement element would be determined solely by her Majesty&apos;s Government and would not be liable to local tax, and payment would be by block grant to the overseas Government.    This grant would be fixed at an annual review of the required establishment of overseas officers.    As the local Service grew so our commitment couldbe reduced, and we would aim to eliminate most of it within about ten years in all except perhaps a few small permanent dependencies.     Theproposals would constitute an umbrella stretching from before until after independence under which the services of existing officers could beretained, and the normal technical assistance in specialist manpowersupplied.Objections20.    The obvious objection to these proposals, apart from their cost, isthat they represent an unknown ultimate commitment.     The estimate ofthe cost which I have given is the best my Department can make, but thecost even at present could only be determined after detailed and publiclyknown investigation of conditions of service in each territory.    Ifsalary levels in the United Kingdom continue to rise and skilled manpowerremains scarce there is bound to be pressure to grant parallel increases to overseas officers by adding to their inducement pay.    I believe wecan only regard this as a part of the unavoidable price of our colonial policy.    The level of inducement pay in each territory would initiallybe fixed and subsequently varied by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on expert advice which would take account of local conditions and costs as wellas salary levels in the United Kingdom.    It is conceivable that the costof inducement pay might be increased by the local Government, keepinglocal salaries artificially depressed to increase the proportion of totalemoluments borne by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    But the pressure ofthe growing local Service which, in Colonial territories is alsopolitically weighty, would be against this, the annual review of the secret
SECRET -        139scheme in each territory would give us opportunity to expose any suchmanoeuvre, and the enquiries leading to each recommendation for anincrease in inducement pay should themselves show how local costs have moved since the previous review.    I am confident that any such movecould be controlled.    I recognise that increased commitments (due forexample to subsequent increases in the total emoluments of expatriateofficers) could not be automatic.    They would need agreement by theTreasury in each case.21.    I have also considered whether the cost could be reduced by her Majesty&apos;s Government, sharing the cost of the overseas element inemoluments with the local Government.    But while a partial contribution would no doubt be welcome, it would not have the effect of taking theseoverseas costs out of the local political arena, and a local government might be almost as reluctant to meet a half as the whole of a recommendedsalary increase.    I go so far as to say that the whole object of the scheme would be lost if we were to attempt such a compromise.Procedure22.    Preparations to give effect to the proposals, the calculation ofinducement pay, and the negotiation of agreements, will take some time.They have been discussed between Departments,  but the Treasury havereserved the Chancellor&apos;s position.    I recommend that the proposals shouldtake effect from the beginning of the next financial year, although thequestion of grant in aid to the East African territories towards the costof the recommendations of the present Salaries Commission is likely to arise before then.    But the Governors have strongly advised me that anear.ly statement is necessary if the rot is to be stopped.    I should thereforewish to make a general statement of our intentions before Parliamentrises.    During the recess consultation with the Governors and with theother Departments concerned in Whitehall would be completed and a white Paper replacing Colonial No. 306 would be published when parliament reassembles.23.    I seek then my colleagues&apos; agreement to the proposals for the overseas Civil Service and for contract officers recruited under myauthority set out in paragraphs 10 to 19 above, to my working them outin detail in consultation with other Departments and with colonial governments and presenting them in a White Paper when Parliament re-assembles, and also to my making before Parliament rises a preliminarystatement of our intentions on the lines of the annexed draft.I. M.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.18th July, I960.-8-
SECRET140ANNEXDRAFT STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR THE colonies have had under consideration the position of Her Majesty1 s OverseasCivil Service.    In Colonial No. 306 issued in 1954, Her Majesty1 s Govern-ment undertook that when a territory becomes self-governing pensions andconditions of service would be safeguarded, and compensation would bepaid to officers suffering premature retirement.    These undertakingshave been fully observed and have gone far to protect the existing interestsof serving officers.    But they do not take effect until self-government,and they afford inadequate inducement to officers to continue to serve.2.     It is a direct responsibility of Her Majesty1 s Government tomaintain stable administration throughout the years of change precedingself-government, and further than this we must do what we can, fullyconsistent of course with the independence of the new States, to encourageofficers to continue to serve overseas so long as the job remains.3.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, decided to offer totake over in all Colonial territories,save those where the problem is notat present a serious one, the extra cost of employing overseas staffbroadly on the lines of the arrangements followed in most technical assistance schemes.    This means that while the local Government would continue to bear the local rates of salary and other conditions of serviceHer Majesty1 s Government would bear the cost of the supplementary pay and allowances which prove to be necessary for overseas officers.    Thedetails of such a scheme, which will be radical and costly, can only befinalised after consultation with Colonial Governments.    This consultationwill be pursued during the recess and I hope to present a White Paper toParliament containing full details when Parliament reassembles.4.     These new arrangements(which would not cease with independence)are evidence that Her Majesty1 s Government continue to attach primary importance to the maintenance of an efficient Overseas Service and tothe necessity of ensuring stable government in the Colonial territoriesduring these difficult transitional years.July, I960-9-
