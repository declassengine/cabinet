Printed for the Cabinet. July 1960C. (60) 131 Copy No.    5 521st July, 1960CABINETTHE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND OVERSEAS COMMITMENTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have been considering the balance ofpayments prospects for 1960. On 20th July they approved a report (copy attached)which had been prepared by a Committee of Officials.2. The following paragraphs comprise a summary of the position as seen bythe Official Committee. In preparing this regard was had to a request by theEconomic Policy Committee for a memorandum on the balance of paymentsprospects in relation to future commitments for capital expenditure overseas.3. In 1959 the United Kingdom had a surplus on its current balance ofpayments of only  145 millions. In 1960, the current balance is expected to be evenlower something less than  100 millions.4. The table below shows that the main cause of the deterioration is the greaterrise expected in imports than in exports. The invisible account would have helpedappreciably to offset this worsening in visible trade but for the rise in government expenditure overseas.United Kingdom Current	Account		 	millions	1959	I960		forecastsImports..................	3,605	4,035Exports..................	3,547	3,920Visible balance        .........	- 58	-115Invisible items (other than Government)	431	467Government      ...	-228	-257Invisible balance	+203	+210Current balance       .........	+ 145	+ 955.

6. Given the magnitude of the estimated net capital outgoing in comparisonwith an estimated surplus on current account of less than  100 millions we must expect to face a deficit on current and capital account together of the order of over 250 millions (see the table below). This deficit may have to be financed out of the reserves (at present  1,033 millions) but it might be wholly or partly met by anincrease in the holdings of sterling by overseas countries. The first possibility holdsthe danger of a loss of confidence in the pound leading to an even bigger run onthe reserves; the second averts this danger but at the cost of increasing oue independence on the confidence of the overseas investor.United Kingdom External Monetary Position  millions1959 1960forecastsCurrent balance ............      4-145 -f- 95Long-term capital       ...      ...      ...      ...      -285 -375Balancing item ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      -1-30 ^ 20Monetary position (adverse -f)       ...      +110 +2607. These tables show that the balance of payments is in a precarious positionand this can be explained by the excess of imports over exports, the high level of overseas Government expenditure and the rising rate of investment abroad, both public and private. Over the past 10 years there have been only three years (1950,1952 and 1958) in which the identified surplus on current account has been sufficientto cover investment abroad, see table below:United Kingdom Balance of Payments, 1950-59  millions	1950	1951	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956	1957	1958	1959Current balance		-419	-f227	+ 179	+204	- 92	+ 192	+2s5	+S49	4-145Balance of long-term capital	- 95(g)	-334(a)	-180	-241	-240	-183	-241	-286	-259	-287Balance of current and long-term capital transactions	+202(a)	-753(a)	+ 4V	- 62	- 36	-275	- 49	- 52	+ 90	-142(a) Including balancing item and miscellaneous capital.   Separate estimates of the balance of long-term capital are not available.There are a number of unidentified items in our balance of payments which are usually in our favour and these would convert the deficit shown in line 3 for 1956and 1957 into a surplus.8. The forward position in 1961 is highly uncertain. Little improvement inthe balance on current account is expected and a high rate of investment abroad islikely to continue.9. Government commitments are likely to continue to weigh heavily on thebalance of payments. The prospect for Government current expenditure is asfollows:Government Current Overseas Expenditure  millions1959 1960 1961Current Expenditure  forecastsMilitary..................         174 201 215Colonial and other Grants.........          52 55 60Administrative, diplomatic, &amp;c.     ...      ...          43 46 45Total gross current expenditure      ... 269 302 320Less: Receipts ...      ............      - 41 - 45 - 45Net current expenditure      ...... 228 257 275SEGREX

It should be noted that this table takes no account of any additional loansthat we shall be pressed to make available over and above existing commitments to overseas countries in Asia and Africa, especially, e.g., as assistance to India and pakistan in respect of their next Five-year Plans. (It has been contemplated thatsuch assistance to India might have to be on the scale of  30 millions- 50 millions ayear: Ministers have already agreed that, as part of this, a loan of  20 millions should be offered to the Indians for the construction of the Durgapur extension.This, if accepted, would probably be spent over two or three years.)12. Despite our continued good luck with the terms of trade, the generaloutlook for balance of payments continues to be serious. Indeed, on the figuressummarised in the preceding paragraph, it is more so than when the last submissionwas made to Ministers in March. But the full effect of the measures of restraint on internal demand which the Government have taken in recent weeks have still tobe felt: looking ahead, it would be reasonable to hope that these might bring abouta somewhat lower level of imports and an improvement in exports, althoughpossibly not until 1961.13. But we find it difficult to have any confidence, especially in view of thecontinued rise in our overseas commitments, that there can be such an improvementto the position as to relieve us from continued anxiety in the period ahead. We donot advocate drastic direct measures such as quantitative import controls or anattempt to restrict overseas lending, since we think that these are emergency steps which would be likely to shake our confidence without bringing about any quickresults or lasting remedies. What we feel to be essential is that (i) in considering futurecommitments overseas (whether in direct expenditure or aid) Ministers should havecontinuous regard to the risk that the deterioration in our position will worsen tothe point of near disaster if we add to such commitments without securing a more adequate balance on current account; (ii) the only effective way of securing such a balance will be by way of a policy of restraint at home. This means that the internaldemands on the economy must continue to be kept below the point at whichexcessive calls on resources are met by abnormal imports and by the diversion tothe home market of goods which ought to have been made available for export.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st July, I960.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTS FOR I960PART I.-SUMMARY AND conclusions this report deals with the prospects for the balance of payments over theremainder of this year. The last report made in March indicated the unsatisfactoryprospect of a deficit in the balance of payments as a whole of some  200 millions in1960, concentrated entirely in the second half of the year. Such results as we have in respect of the first half year tend to confirm our views about the outcome during that period. In the present review, attention has been directed particularly to theprospect for the second half of 1960.2. The prospect is influenced by the recent tightening of financial policy whichcan be expected to have certain beneficial long-term and short-term effects. In the longer term it is to be hoped that tighter financial policy will bring about an earlierreduction in the pressure of internal demand which is at present adversely affectingthe trade balance. In the shorter term it is likely to increase the confidence offoreign investors in sterling and thereby reduce the risk of a general movementout of sterling which could so rapidly convert an otherwise manageable loss of reserves into an acute exchange crisis.3. These short-term effects are the more necessary because the outlook forthe external monetary position in the second half of the year has not improvedsince March. The surplus on current account which may have reached about 100 millions in the first half of the year, is expected to disappear in the second half. The outflow of long-term capital, including the repayment due on north american loans, is put at over  200 millions in the coming half year. The overalldeficit (allowing for errors and omissions) can hardly be less than  200 millions and may be as much as  250 millions.4. The position of other sterling countries has worsened since the beginningof the year and they are likely to draw down their sterling holdings over the next six months. The latest rise in Bank Rate will encourage non-sterling countries tomaintain their aggregate holdings of sterling, but unless they are going to be willingto increase their holdings there could be a loss of reserves greater than the total united Kingdom deficit alone.5. This prospect is bound to overhang economic policy for some time to comesince so much will depend on our ability to convince foreign holders of sterlingthat such adverse reserve movements as may occur are fully within the capacityof the United Kingdom to sustain and that adequate corrective measures havebeen, or will be, taken. The immediate response to the recently announced measureshas been favourable and if the confidence thereby created can be maintained thisshould go a long way to prevent the deterioration in the monetary position in thelast six months of 1960 from developing into a crisis of confidence.6. The position after the end of 1960 is uncertain and we have confinedourselves to generalisations about prospects for the first half of 1961. There isa good prospect that the internal pressure of demand will have eased substantiallyby then, and thereby reduced the pressure to import and facilitated a more readyflow of resources into exports. By that time, however, world trade may be lessbuoyant than now so that exports may be more difficult to sell. In view of theprospect of a continuing high level of investment abroad, it seems unlikely thatthe deficit in the balance of payments will disappear in 1961.7. The nature of the present imbalance in the United Kingdom overseaspayments and receipts differs from that in the boom year of 1955. In that year,a large balance of payments worsening was associated with a deficit on visible tradeaccount of over  350 millions. Since then, the visible trade balance has improved and we are forecasting a deficit for 1960 only one-third of that for 1955. At thesame time the capital out-flow has roughly doubled and there has been a long-termdeterioration in the invisibles account. It must, however, be remembered that theincreased rate of investment abroad will have made our exports higher than theywould otherwise have been.57299b
8. The overall balance of payments went into deficit in the middle of 1959and looks like continuing so for two years at least from that time. To some extentthis may be regarded as a temporary lapse arising from the spurt of demand inthe United Kingdom. But even in the period before this, the years 1956 to 1958,the situation was not altogether satisfactory in that expansion in the UnitedKingdom had to be kept down to a low rate to maintain external balance.9. Whether or not a critical situation is avoided this year, the continueddeficit in the United Kingdom balance of payments cannot be allowed to continueuncorrected. In the year ended June 1960 this deficit probably amounted to nearly 200 millions. In order to rebuild the reserves after depletion, or to reduce thevolume of our outstanding short-term liabilities, an overall surplus will be needed in the balance of payments. The measure of adjustment needed that is, theamount by which we must improve the current surplus or reduce capitalcommitments is more like  300 millions a year. So far as improvement is soughton the current account it is not merely a matter of releasing resources from usesat home, but of selling that much more abroad or displacing imports to that extent.Some forces making in the direction of adjustment may already be at work, butthe problem of matching current earnings with capital commitments is a formidableone and involves questions beyond the scope of this report.PART II.-PROSPECTS IN DETAIL*Economic Background10. Total demand will probably continue to rise during the rest of the year,but very much less quickly than during 1959. Private fixed investment may continueto rise rapidly but the rate of rise in consumption will probably slacken (despite a continued rise in real personal income) as a result of the credit restrictions. (Therestrictions on hire purchase appear to have had a large and immediate effect onhire purchase sales.) Exports (for reasons discussed later) are also likely to riselittle during the remainder of 1960. Finally, investment in stocks, which reached a very high level in the first quarter of 1960, may well fall later in the year,particularly in view of the recent series of monetary measures. Taking into accountall these individual changes, it seems likely that expenditure as a whole will riseat an annual rate of 2-3 per cent. There should be a larger increase than this inthe productive capacity of the economy and hence we may expect the pressure of demand to begin to ease at some time during the next 12 months.11. Economic growth abroad is also likely to proceed more slowly from now on. Expansion has practically ceased for the time being in the United States,while growth in Western Europe is bound to slow down, since the limits of capacityhave in many cases been reached. The stability of commodity prices will exert abraking effect on the growth of importing capacity in the primary producing countries. However, further moderate growth in world trade is likely over the restof this year, though the outlook for 196fis still uncertain.Recent Developments in the Balance of Payments12. The United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments was in overall deficit in 1959to the extent of  110 millions, apart from certain special non-recurrenttransactions such as the subscription to the I.M.F. On current account alone therewas a surplus of  145 millions, the lowest since 1955. The overall deficit of 110 millions was made up of a surplus of  60 millions in the first half of the yearand a deficit of  170 millions in the second half. The second half of a year is usuallyworse than the first but not to this extent.13. In the first quarter of 1960 the United Kingdom earned an overall surplusof about  20 millions, but the second quarter seems to have been less favourableand the outturn for the whole of the first half year is put at a deficit of  10 millions;some  70 millions worse than a year ago. The balance on current account is putslightly lower at  105 millions but the main reason for the advetse change is thehigher net outflow of private capital. An overall deficit in the first half of a year,even a small one, is highly unsatisfactory because it implies a substantial deficit for the year as a whole.* The main figures are set out in the tables of Appendix I.SECRET
, 14- So far we have been dealing with preliminary estimates of actual results which reveal a number of general trends which have been running against us. Therest of the paper deals with prospects and takes into account existing trends andsuch changes in those trends as it seems reasonable to project in the light of generalinternal and external developments.Imports15. The United Kingdom economy has been expanding very rapidly and imports have risen faster still. From now on the growth of both is likely to be muchslower. Industrial production in the first half of this year is estimated at about10 per cent, above a year ago. Payments for imports, which seem to be laggingsomewhat behind the rate of arrivals, are estimated to be 13 per cent, higher in thefirst half of this year than in the first half of last year. Food imports have changedvery little, nor do we expect any change in the second half of this year. Importsof industrial materials have risen about twice as fast as industrial production. this represents the change from a position where imports were doubtfully adequate tosupport the level of production, let alone provide for the increase in stocks and work in progress inseparable from an increase in production, to one where stocks were being replenished; there is no evidence that stocks have been built up to a level disproportionate to the current level of production. Some decline in the rateof investment in stocks in total is expected and for this reason and also becauseindustrial production is expected to expand at a slower rate in future, the rate of increase in imports is expected to fall off. We have put the level of imports ofindustrial materials in the second half of this year at about the same figure as inthe first half.16. The third main category of imports is imports of finished manufactures.These have been a sharply rising trend for several years but the pace has quickenedlately and in the first half of this year they have been running at a level some50 per cent, above a year ago. Sharp increases have taken place in imports ofmachinery, road vehicles, aircraft, clothing and most other kinds of manufacturedgoods.Imports of aircraft and machinery are expected to show a substantial further increase. There should be some slowing down in the rate of increase for othermanufactured goods as consumer demand1 is reduced and stocks level off, but thegeneral trend will still be upward. The rapid rise in these imports has inevitably)attracted attention and several possible explanations have been advanced. Theresults of a general examination of United Kingdom exports and imports of finished manufactures are set out in Appendix II.17. The projected increase in imports of finished manufactures, together withan allowance for an increase in payments relative to arrivals of goods, leads to a figure of total imports in the second half of this year about  75 millions above thelevel prevailing in the first half.Exports18. The trend of exports has been disappointing so far this year. After arise in the course of 1959 which, while less than that of imports, was quiteconsiderable, exports have levelled off. In the light of this performance and of detailed studies of the various overseas markets we project only a slight recovery in the rest of the year, not sufficient to maintain the value of exports at the level ofthe first half against the adverse seasonal influence. Virtually all our competitorshave been increasing, their exports much faster than we have during a period when,world markets have been favourable. Unfortunately measures to reduce internaldemand do not benefit exports very rapidly and it is not safe to assume that we canimprove our position substantially during the next six months.The Balance of Visible Trade19. Visible trade was approximately in balance in the first half of this year,as it was in the first half of last year. The increase of some  75 millions in imports and the fall of  30 millions in exports which we project for the second half of theyear would produce a deficit on visible trade of about  100 millions (comparedwith about  60 millions in the second half of the year).57299
20. At the time of our last report in March, some worsening of the termsof trade seemed probable. In the event, the buoyant world conditions have failedto have any significant effect on commodity prices as a whole and there has been some slight favourable movement in the terms of trade so far this year. We expectlittle further change in the next six months.Invisible Earnings21. The balance of invisible transactions is estimated at  110 millions in thefirst half of 1960, about the same as a year ago. A similar figure is forecast forthe second half of the year, representing a modest improvement on the same periodlast year. This improvement springs from an expected recovery in oil earnings from their depressed level last year, partly offset by greater net expenditure onforeign travel, on interest on overseas sterling holdings, and on the maintenanceof our military forces abroad, especially in Germany. It is worth recording thatGovernment overseas expenditure, mainly military, has now reached the extremelyburdensome level of  300 millions a year. Largely for this reason our net invisibleearnings have shown a general decline over recent years.The Balance of Payments on Current Account22. The balance on current account is estimated at a surplus of  105 millions in the first half of this year and projected as a small deficit in the second half.The figure for the year as a whole v/ould be only about half the current surplusearned on the average during the last four years and would be below the poor1959 result.Overseas Divestment23. Net long-term investment abroad is, however, proceeding at a much higher level than in earlier years and for 1960 is forecast at  375 millions, greatly in excessof net current earnings.  The total is made up broadly as follows:		  millions1.	New lending by United Kingdom Government ...	602.	Net repayment of Government loans  ...	403.	London market loans	204.	Free market security transactions	455.	Oil investment (net)	1206.	Other long-term investment (net)        ......	90	(a) Of which outflow to R.S.A.*-100		(b) Of which inflow from N.S.A.-10	7.	Total.....................	37524. It is natural to question the need for such a high rate of investment abroadwhen the balance of payments is weak. There are, however, great difficulties incontaining it. The reasons for Item 1 in the table above have been fully explained in the Report of the Committee on Development Policy. Of the total of  60 millionsexpected to go out this year  25 millions is for the Colonial Territories and 30 millions for India. Item 2 consists mainly of the North American loan andE.P.U. debts, legacies of past deficits in the United Kingdom balance of payments,set against certain repayments due from other countries to the United Kingdom.Item 3 has accrued in the first half of this year to the International Bank and certainCommonv/ealth countries.25. Item 4, free market security transactions, consists of the sale to UnitedKingdom residents, through Hong Kong and other free markets in the sterling area,of securities previously held by non-residents. These are sterling securities. Theacquisition of non-sterling securities through these free markets was prohibited in mid-1957. Transactions in sterling securities have increased sharply in recent months and are believed to be connected with the general lack of foreign interest inthe London stock market and particularly with the sales of South Africansecurities.* The estimate does not take account of the unknown inflow into the United Kingdom on accountof disinvestment in South Africa.
26. Item 5, oil investment, is the largest element in United Kingdom private investment overseas and is bound up with the maintenance of the British oil business which is, on balance, beneficial to our balance of payments.27. Item 6 shows that the remaining net private investment abroad is whollyin the rest of the sterling area and cannot be directly controlled. Much of this,like the oil investment, consists of the ploughing back of overseas earnings and afurther part represents plant and stock sent abroad without payment. UnitedKingdom private investment outside the sterling area amounts to some  60 millions a year and is rather less than the inflow of investment into the United kingdom from the United States and other foreign countries.28. Of the total of  375 millions over  200 millions is estimated to fall in thesecond half of this year, mainly owing to the incidence of the North American loanrepayments.The Overall Balance of Payments29. This figure of over  200 millions investment abroad in the coming halfyear compares with a current account more or less in balance. This produces a deficit of over  200 millions on current and capital account combined which is likelyto be increased somewhat by a deficit on unidentified transactions such as had occurred in the second halves of the last two years. Hence the overall deficit is unlikely to be less than  200 millions in the next six months and may be as high as 250 millions.30. The final task in assessing the external prospect is to consider the likelycourse of the reserves. Broadly speaking, a deficit in the United Kingdom balanceof payments may be financed either by a loss of reserves or, if they so choose, byan increase in the sterling held by other countries. In this period we think that the sterling holdings of a number of sterling area countries, of which Australia is thechief, are likely to be reduced because they are buying heavily from abroad outof reserves built up last year, and because the second half of the year is a seasonallyunfavourable period for many sterling countries so that even those who are keepingtheir reserves steady over a full year may draw them down somewhat in this cominghalf year.31. Such evidence as we have suggests a fall in the sterling holdings of the restof the sterling area of some  50 millions in the second half of, this year. This fall of  50 millions as well as the whole United Kingdom deficit of over  200 millions would have to be financed from the gold reserves, except to the extent that the non-sterling world chose to build up its holdings of sterling. On past occasions sterling holdings of non-sterling countries have risen by as much as  100 millions in a halfyear. We can hardly hope for a rise of this magnitude. The present level of interest rates in London following Bank Rate rise will certainly be conducive to a rise, butholdings already, stand at a high level and, moreover, further repayments to theI.M.F. will reduce them by  30 millions. Fortunately there is every indication thatexternal confidence in sterling is high and has been strengthened by the recently announced financial measures with their implication that any necessary action tosupport sterling has been and will be taken. Nevertheless, this analysis implies a heavy loss of reserves during the second half of the year which could become a floodif confidence in sterling were shaken.32. Looking ahead to the first part of 1961, we would expect some favourablemovement in the visible trade position. A decline in the rate of stock-building andan easing of the pressure of internal demand generally may well lead to a lower level of imports. However, it is unlikely that exports will expand strongly if world markets are less buoyant. A high rate of capital outflow will undoubtedly continue.The present indications are that the overall monetary position may be weaker in thefirst half of 1961 than in the first half of 1960. There is thus little prospect of making up in the early part of next year for the severe deterioration in our position expected in 1960.

Appendix united KINGDOM TRADE IN FINISHED MANUFACTURESIntroduction1. In their last report (B.P. (60) 3, paragraph 19) the Committee undertook to study the relationship between the rates of growth in imports and exports of finished manufacturers.Summary2.   The main conclusions that we have reached may be summarised as follows :(a) While finished manufactures amount to only 10 per cent, of our totalimports (and consumer goods only about 3 per cent.) they account for over 50 per cent, of our total exports and the proportion is rising.Between 1954 and 1959, imports of finished manufactures rose by 220 millions, while exports increased by  497 millions. Over the sameperiod total imports increased by  632 millions and total UnitedKingdom exports by  680 millions.(b) With all areas we have a substantial favourable balance in trade in finished manufacturers. But whereas the favourable balance with North america has been rising rapidly, that with O.E.E.C. has been declining, as our exports have been rising slowly and our imports rapidly. In 1959imports from the R.S.A. of finished manufactures (although only 13 percent, of the total imports of these goods) increased at a rapid rate, while our exports fell.(c) Quite apart from the bilateral balance, it would seem clear that it isin Western Europe in particular that the expansion of our exports of finished manufactures is not commensurate with the expansion of tradein these markets; whereas the increase in the total imports of O.E.E.C.non-sterling countries between 1954 and 1958 was 64 per cent., our exports to those countries, over the longer period, 1954 to 1959, increasedby only 21 per cent.(d) Only in 1958 did the level of United Kingdom imports of finished manufacturers reach the same proportion as pre-war of our total imports.Imported consumer goods even now represent only a slightly larger proportion of total consumer expenditure than pre-war, but there is a substantially higher import content now than before the war in domesticcapital expenditure on machinery and vehicles.(e) It is not possible to say whether or not imports of finished manufactureswill continue much longer to rise at a faster rate than exports or the gross domestic product. Trade in these products needs to be related tothe changing pattern of trade as a whole and is still affected by thereadjustments following the progressive removal of import restrictions which have until recently distorted the pattern of trade.The Place of Finished Manufactures in United Kingdom trade. The term finished manufactures in this Appendix is applied to goods of types entering directly into personal and public current expenditure and into fixed capital expenditure, other than food, drink and tobacco and fuels. Broadly, thiscovers machinery of all kinds, including components, vehicles, and durable andother consumer goods, including clothing. It does not include processed industrial materials such as steel or textiles.4. The United Kingdom is almost entirely dependent on manufactured goods for her export earnings and in 1959 finished manufactures contributed over halfof total exports. Manufactured goods account for only a quarter of our totalimport bill and a substantial part of these imports are semi-manufactures for industry. In the same year imports of finished manufactures accounted for only10 per cent, of total imports.SECRET57299 c
5. It was not until after 1955 that imports of finished manufactures regainedtheir 1938 volume*. By then the volume* of United Kingdom exports was nearly double that in 1938 and the contribution of finished manufactures (in value terms)was considerably greater than before the war.Composition of Imports6. Of total imports of finished manufactures in 1959 of  392 millions,  285millions was engineering products,  41 millions was clothing; the remainderincluded a wide variety of products such as tools, toys and sports goods, works of art, furniture, &amp;c. Consumer goods accounted for  111 millions, aero-engines and works of art, imported mainly for subsequent re-export, accounted for  48 millions,and capital goods for most of the remaining  233 millions.7. The area and commodity pattern of imports of finished manufacturessince the war has been much influenced by import controls. By 1954 restrictions were still in force on all finished manufactures from the dollar area, and a largerange of goods from the rest of the non-sterling world, particularly consumer goods.Since then most restrictions have been removed: industrial plant and machinery was generally liberalised from the dollar area in 1958, and in 1959 restrictions on imports of consumer goods from the dollar area, and the remaining restrictions on imports from Western Europe, were removed. It is not surprising therefore that over the period 1957 to 1959, when consumer expenditure and fixed investmentwere both rising, imports of capital goods continued to grow strongly, but the mostrapid expansion was in consumer goods. Between 1958 and 1959 imports of consumer goods increased by  39 millions, or 54 per cent, and imports of otherfinished manufactures by 15 per cent. (1\ per cent, if aero-engines and works of art are excluded).8. It has been estimated that the share of imports in total consumerexpenditure on manufactures did not exceed the 1938 proportion until 1959 (whenit reached 8 per cent.), while the proportion of imports to capital expenditure onmachinery and vehicles, other than cars, was, at 9 per cent., already larger in1954 than in 1938, and has since increased to 13 per cent.9. There is no reason to expect imports and exports of finished manufacturesto have any direct relationship. The United Kingdom must continue to pay for large imports of food and raw materials by exporting manufactured goods of allkinds, whereas imports of finished manufactures are in general marginal to home production.10. Table 1 (at the end of this Appendix) shows the growth of imports and exports (excluding re-exports) of finished manufactures in relation to trade in theother main commodity classes over the period 1954-57-59. Imports of finished manufacturers have been increasing much faster than exports since 1954, but sincethe value of exports is much greater than that of imports, the increase in exportshas been greater in absolute terms, by  277 millions, enough to cover the increasein the net cost of all other imports. The rate of increase in imports between 1954and 1957, and between 1957 and 1959 was unchanged, at 18 per cent, per annum.The growth in exports was reduced in the latter period from an annual rate of9 per cent, to 3 per cent, per annum. During 1959, both imports and exports began to expand much faster; between 1959 and 1960 increases are forecast of about50 per cent, in imports and 14 per cent, in exports.Area Pattern of Trade in Finished Manufactures11. If it is unreasonable to expect a constant relation between imports and exports of finished manufactures in total, it is even less reasonable to look forsuch relations in trade with individual areas. Nevertheless, it is of interest to compare the trends of United Kingdom export and import trade in finished manufacturers with the main areas, as shown in Table 2 for the years 1954, 1957and 1959.12. With the overseas sterling area a slight fall in exports between 1957 and1959 was accompanied by a substantial increase in imports, mainly of clothing from hong Kong. But this followed a period of marked improvement in exportsbetween 1954 and 1957, which may be resumed this year.* Using post-war price weights.SECRET
13. Exports of finished manufactures to North America have been increasingat a much faster rate than imports throughout the period 1954-59. It will probablybecome more difficult to continue to achieve substantial further increases in exportsto these markets. With the virtual removal last year of all restrictions on dollar imports, it seems likely that in future more of our imports of finished manufactureswill be obtained from the United States.14. Two-thirds of the total increase in United Kingdom imports of finished manufacturers since 1954 has come from Western Europe, and the increase has been at a rather faster rate than that in imports from the rest of the world, althoughthe difference, particularly between 1957 and 1959, was quite small. western europe, particularly the Common Market countries, supplied nearly two-thirds of total imports of engineering products, and almost all the cars, motor-cycles andother engineering consumer goods. The expansion in exports of finished manufacturers to Western Europe has been comparatively small, particularly between1957 and 1959, and in actual value, the increase in imports was much greater thanthe increase in exports,  69 millions compared with  12 millions. Nevertheless,our exports of finished manufactures at  396 millions still exceeded our importsfrom these countries by  158 millions.United Kingdom Exports to Europe in Competition15. A rapid rise in imports of manufactures since the end of the war hasoccurred in almost all manufacturing countries and, apart from the United Statesand Canada, the pattern of growth has been much affected by the progressiveremoval of controls. In several European countries, particularly France, severeimport restriction continued longer than in the United Kingdom, and this clearlylimited the expansion of exports to Europe in the earlier post-war years.16. In the four years 1954-58, imports of finished manufactures (on a slightlydifferent definition&quot;5) into continental O.E.E.C. countries from all sources increasedby 64 per cent. ( 934 millions, c.i.f.), whereas United Kingdom exports to thosecountries increased by only 21 per cent. ( 69 millions, f.o.b.). Although the import and export figures are not directly comparable, it is clear that in European marketsour exports of finished manufactures have not only been expanding more slowlythan our imports from those markets, but have also been doing less well than thoseof our competitors.Commodity Pattern of Trade with Western Europe17. An examination of the commodity composition of trade with thesecountries in 1954 and 1959 shows that our exports of machinery and instrumentsas a group increased in value almost as much as our imports. The reduction of 87 millions in the excess of exports over imports between these two years was mainly in ships ( 16+ millions), and miscellaneous metal manufactures ( 20 millions,due largely to a fall in exports of arms and ammunition) and in cars and motor-cycles( 211 millions), clothing ( 13 millions) and miscellaneous manufactures ( 12millions). Apart from ships, it seems clear that it is in consumer goods, ratherthan in capital goods, that we have been losing ground.* SITC Sections 7 and 8.SECRET57299
