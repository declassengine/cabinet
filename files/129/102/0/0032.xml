THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,.-! i    - --      ! :--       &quot;.    Printed for the Cabinet.   September I960C. (60) 132 Copy No.   5513th September, 1960CABINETNORTH BRITISH LOCOMOTIVE company memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandThere have been a number of developments since the Cabinet last consideredthe affairs of this Company on 25th July (C.C. (60) 45th Conclusions, Minute 7)and decided not to authorise the British Transport Commission to place a repeatorder with the Company for locomotives of existing types.2. At that time, there was a possibility that the Company might succeed in securing orders for new types of locomotives for delivery in 1962-63. Since then,however, the Minister of Transport has been in touch with the Chairman of theCommission, Sir Brian Robertson, who has written to say that he will be unableto place orders with the North British Locomotive Company for these locomotives,because the Company have quoted prices considerably higher than most of their competitors and their rates of delivery are not attractive.3. My colleagues will recall that when the Company received a veryconsiderable loan from the Development Areas (Treasury Advisory) Committeein 1958, Mr. Coughtrie was put in by the Government as their nominated directorand that he subsequently became Chairman. Mr. Coughtrie maintains, Iunderstand with justice, that under the new management a great deal has alreadybeen done to raise the morale and efficiency of the Company and that, given thenecessary breathing space, it will become fully competitive.4. At present, however, I am advised that there is a difference of 8-10 percent, between the lowest tenders put in to the British Transport Commission andthose submitted by the North British Locomotive Company. It would no doubt be most difficult to seek to override the Commission^ commercial judgment in thismatter. If as a result, however, the North British Locomotive Company founderit will, apart from the unemployment aspect, be yet another case of the disappearance from Scotland of a whole industry locomotive manufacture in which the same way as we have lost the manufacture of complete aircraft.Moreover, this is not the only storm cloud hanging over the west of Scotland.A rather similar crisis threatens John Brown Land Boilers at Clydebank to say nothing of United Turkey Red at Dumbarton and Acme at Greenock, while the longer-term prospects of the shipbuilding industry must continue to give anxiety.5. British Railways are, I understand, among the purchasing authorities which adhere to the principles of the Government Contracts Preference scheme under which Government Departments and the Nationalised Industries, whenawarding contracts by open competitive tender, are normally prepared, other thingsbeing equal, to give preference to firms in development districts. The NorthBritish Locomotive Company are, of course, such a firm. In addition to these general arrangements there is a Special Preference Scheme which applies at present,I understand, only to Government Departments and which provides that if firms in Development Districts are awarded less than 25 per cent, of a Governmentcontract in competitive tender, they are given an opportunity to revise their tendersand obtain up to that proportion of the contract.57710
6. An official Working Party, recently set up by the Chancellor of theExchequer to examine the possibility of placing more Government contracts inScotland, have recommended among other things that contracting departments should be reminded to operate the existing development-district preferencearrangements as effectively as possible, and that the question of extending all their recommendations to the Nationalised Industries should be examined. I should liketo suggest to my. colleagues that it would be in the spirit of these recommendations(which I understand the Treasury have asked Departments to consider putting intoeffect) to ask British Transport Commission to consider whether they; could approach the North British Locomotive Company on the lines of the Special PreferenceScheme, to see whether the Company would wish to undertake part of the 1962-63locomotive contract at the price offered by the finally successful tenderer.7. The additional work represented by this part of the contract might enablethe Company to keep at least part of their capacity in operation. MeanwhileMr. Coughtrie might well succeed in his attempts to obtain other kinds of sub-contract work in order to maintain employment in the factory.J. S. M.Scottish.
