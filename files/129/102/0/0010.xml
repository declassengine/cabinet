Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1960C. (60) 11012th July, 1960CABINETKENYA: LAND policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies special meeting of the Kenya Legislative Council is being called for20th July. Its purpose is to consider a Government motion to approve the SessionalPapers on Land Policy. The policy set out in these Papers provides for the adoptionof economic rather than racial or tribal principles to govern land use, and inparticular for the opening of the Highlands to good farmers of all races and tribes.Land questions in Kenya are the most emotional of all issues there and the debateis therefore likely to cover all aspects of Land Policy, including the great uneasinessat present felt by many European farmers about the future security of their titles.These subjects are described in fuller detail in Annex A to this Paper.2. I have been in consultation with the Governor and have also had discussions with two of his Ministers most directly concerned (both members ofMr. Michael Blundells New Kenya Group). I have agreed with them the termsof a statement (text at Annex B) which, with the Governors agreement, I proposeshould be made, both in the debate in the Kenya Legislature and by reply to a written question in Parliament here.3. This statement confirms the Land Policy set out in the Sessional papers and proposes that it should be put into effect by Order in Council. Action byOrder in Council is necessary in any case; the question is how far this action should be completed by local legislation or by executive action by the Governorunder direction by me. I am sure that it is right to take the latter course, both because the emotion which this subject creates in Kenya will prevent the locallegislature from handling the problem with the necessary degree of objectivity andalso to demonstrate to public opinion, both here and in Kenya, that Her majesty&apos;s government is still in control of policy in this matter and is determined to remainso. My detailed proposals for handling this question are set out in paragraph 10of Annex A.4. It will also be seen from Annex A that I have not yet reached a conclusion on the difficult problem of long-term security of title. I am sure that this problemmust be solved. The ideas so far canvassed are not wholly satisfactory for reasonsset out in paragraph 11 of Annex A, but I still regard this question as being of prime importance and hope that my colleagues would be willing to assist me in finding a solution by setting up a special ministerial working party to consider it.The working party should aim at formulating a statement to be made in Septemberor October.5.   I invite my colleagues:(a) To endorse my view that we should reaffirm the non-racial policy on land,as outlined in paragraph 10 of Annex A.(b) To agree that announcements should be made about the 20th July bothin Kenya and in Parliament in the terms of the draft statement at annex B.(c) To agree that a ministerial working party be set up to study the problemof how to reassure existing and potential investors in Kenya about thesecurity of title to land after independence with a view to a statementj of policy being made, if possible, not later than the middle of October.Colonial Office, S.W. 1, I.

ANNEX ALAND POLICY IN KENYAIntroductionThe prospect of early independence for Kenya under an African Government^has created considerable fears among overseas investors and local Europeans. Theyshave not been effectively reassured by our policy that the advance to independencemust go hand in hand with a non-racial approach, since they fear that Africans arestill far from accepting such an approach and will use their power regardless ofnon-African interests.2. European alarm is closely related to their right to own farming land.Europeans derive their whole raison d&apos;etre from the deliberate policy of whitesettlement in the past. The origin, extent and value of European farming to Kenyais set out in the Appendix. Land is also fundamental to African political thought.The future of land in Kenya, although strictly not a constitutional issue, cannot bedivorced from the question of who controls the Government.European Attitudes to Land3. Europeans say, with justification, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government invitedand persuaded them to come to Kenya. They feel that now that they have built up their farms from nothing and made their homes there they are to be handed over toa vindictive and irresponsible group of African politicians. Their instinct makesthem:(a) Resist any change in the status quo on land (but those who feel thisis possible are growing fewer every day).(b) Demand &quot; compensation &quot; in some form from Her Majesty&apos;s government so that they can get out while there is still time.(c) At the same time hope that some way can be found whereby they can safelystay without the risk of wholesale expropriation, unfair compensation, orlimitation of their holdings to a sub-economic size.The market for agricultural land in the Highlands is still restricted to Europeans byrace, and even among Europeans it excludes anyone except the genuine farmer. Asa result of recent lack of confidence the market has virtually dried up altogether.African Attitudes to Land4. Africans do not view land from a racial so much as from a tribal outlook.Tribal interests vary; the main distinction is between the pastoral and semi-pastoraltribes who have plenty of land, and the large agrarian tribes whose population is growing every day and where the landless are becoming an increasing political force.The latter demand &quot; reforms &quot; (i.e., resettlement of the landless, free, on good land).There are also many clan, sectional and tribal land disputes which are redoubled inforce as the prospect of a change in the status quo approaches. Not all Africans wishEuropeans to leave, because many are afraid that tribes other than their own will succeed them.Lancaster House and Subsequent Events5. The conference was preceded by the publication of. detailed proposals bythe Kenya Government, prepared in close conjunction with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, for a non-racial policy towards land and for the opening of the highlands to good farmers of all races. It involves the adoption of economic, andnot racial or tribal, principles for land use, but allows for safeguards for the morebackward areas which in effect will remain tribally closed. At Lancaster Housewe put forward two complementary ways of solving the land problem. The first is to press ahead with the non-racial policy and within its limits to encourage, bya Kenya Government scheme backed with World Bank money, the settlement ofgood African farmers in the Highlands. This would put about  1 million per yearinto the land market. The second is to guarantee the inclusion of safeguards in thenext Constitution circumscribing the purposes for which the Government canexpropriate and ensuring fair compensation if expropriation takes place. were fused flatly to consider any proposal for &quot; compensation &quot; to European farmersfor the effects of the constitutional changes.
6. This might have reassured Europeans if the African politicians had beenable and willing to take a responsible line over land. But the Africans are sodeeply divided under constituency and tribal pressures that most of them are onlytoo anxious to avoid having to face up to the subject at all; and this has left the running to those who promise &quot; reforms&quot; to the landless. At the same time theyhave on occasions declared that no Bill of Rights or constitutional safeguards will cover &quot; land which is in dispute &quot;.7. These remarks have had a serious effect on overseas investors, particularlyin the plantation and agricultural industries. Several large firms have cut their investment programmes right down. The small farmers are doing the same; andthe banks and insurance companies are transferring deposits outside East Africa.The capital outflow from the time of the Lancaster House conference until30th June is estimated at  4,285,000.8. If this situation continues, the economy of Kenya will break down. Theimmediate problem is how to put the non-racial policy into effect this year, so thatpilot settlement of good African farmers in the Highlands can begin at once. Thisis necessary to take some of the heat out of the land issue before the elections, whichare due in February 1961. The long-term problem is how to give investors,particularly in agriculture, effective reassurances about their prospects after independence.The Immediate Problem: Implementing the Non-racial Policy9. Consultation with the Governor and his Ministers suggests that we can secure acceptance of the new policy on land if the following is done:(a) A resettlement scheme for the landless on unused and under-used landmust be announced to neutralise active African opposition and retain the support of the African Ministers. The Kenya Ministers think this can be done although it will place special strains on their development plan for 1960-63 and it may well be that they will need further assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government later on.(b) The main legislation required to bring about a non-racial system must been acted by Order in Council (this would be necessary to some extent inany case) and Regulations, and not by local Ordinance.(c) The Legislative Council must still be given the opportunity to debate thegeneral question at its meeting on 20th July.(d) Thereafter the changes should be made as soon as possible.(e) During the debate Kenya Ministers must be able to give some preliminaryreassurance about the urgency with which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentview the long-term problem, and their intention to make a definitestatement on the subject.The Long-term Problem: Land Titles after Independence10. The Governor and his Ministers have so far canvassed four possible ways of dealing with this. On first consideration, none of them seems satisfactory.These &quot; solutions &quot; and the reasons for rejecting them are briefly as follows:(a) Insurance SchemeHer Majesty&apos;s Government, the Kenya Government, and the farmers themselves would together contribute to build up a fund outsideKenya from which after independence any expropriated landownercould obtain say 50 per cent, of the value of his land if not granted faircompensation.Unless we were prepared to remain in effective control in Kenyafor a definite period of 10 years or more, the premiums to be paidannually would be penal.(b) Compensation SchemeThis would commit us to buying back at a fair valuation any property offered and to a phased take-over of farms and plantationsover a period of years, which would not ensure an immediate breakdown of the economy.SECRET57316 b 2
iiWe have always set our face against compensation, since we shouldnot only certainly be confronted with a bill of at least  140 millions,but such a scheme would amount to an admission that the non-Africanfarmer has no place in an independent Kenya. Further, it would notinduce private investors to place more capital in Kenya agriculture,rather the reverse.(c) Guarantee SchemeHer Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake to give anyexpropriated landowner full compensation after independence if anindependent Kenya Government defaulted on their obligations to do so.Such a guarantee would be an open incitement to an independentKenya to take over all the farms, leaving us with the bill for  140millions or whatever value they then had; and it is hard to see whateffective deterrent we should have to prevent this.(d) Modified Guarantee SchemeWe would undertake now to ensure that as part of theindependence negotiations the Kenya Government should conclude aninternational agreement with us, binding them to observe therestrictions in the Constitution upon acquisition of property; andrecognise a special obligation towards Crown lessees and granteescomparable to our obligations to the local non-African civil service.Thus, although not explicitly pledged to bring pressure to assistthreatened farmers after independence, or to compensate themex gratia if the threat matured, we should implicitly be morally boundto do so.But this is also unsatisfactory in that it equates the claims of farmers on Her Majesty&apos;s Government with those of civil servants;despite the importance of farmers to the economy, the claims of farmerson the Government cannot be equated with those of the governments own employees; and again it is not clear what sanctions we could infact employ effectively to prevent unjust expropriation. Withholdingtechnical and financial assistance to an independent Kenya for instancemight only drive it to look to the Soviet bloc.11. In the long or short run we should most probably be forced to extendwhatever was done to Tanganyika and perhaps Uganda and probably also to northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Colonial Office, S.W.1,July 1960.
appendix the SCALE OF NON-AFRICAN FARMING IN KENYAOrigin of SettlementA policy of deliberate but controlled European settlement in the highlandzone began in 1902-3, and has continued ever since.2. The main areas of settlement were in the climatically suitable highlandzone; the Europeans were restricted partly to land where no African tribe had established rights, but mainly to land acquired from the Masai under treatyagreements. Other agreements were made with the Nandi. Around Nairobi theKikuyu claimed to have been expropriated unfairly in several cases, and the Kikuyuand European lands form an intricate patchwork whose boundaries are difficultto follow.3. In 1933 the boundaries of the Highlands and all native reserves weredefined by the Carter Commission, compensation being paid or adjustments madeaccording to the evidence. The Highlands in effect became the &quot; European tribalreserve &quot;, apart from a small area which is still farmed by Asians. The CarterReport adjustments were not accepted by the Kikuyu near Nairobi, who continuedto demand the return of the &quot; lost lands &quot;.4. The policy of racial and tribal reservations is now to be replaced by anon-racial policy based on economics, as recommended by the 1953-55 RoyalCommission. Africans see this, however, in tribal and racial terms; hence thereis inter-tribal anxiety about the future of the &quot; no-man&apos;s-land &quot; if the Europeans go.Area of Non-African Farming and Number of Farms5. Non-African farms, of 20 acres and more, excluding certain land at theCoast owned by Arabs and others, cover 11,582 square miles in the highlands and 439 square miles elsewhere. (By contrast, the native lands which form the traditional African farming areas amount to 52,000 square miles.) There were3,593 farms in .1959. 70 per cent, of the holdings were less than 1,500 acres in size,and 478,000 acres were used for plantation crops.Value of the Land6. The farms are valued very roughly at  140 millions. This does not includethe value of the Asian farming area or non-African farming outside the Highlands,i.e., at the Coast and Voi.Contribution to the EconomyGross Farm Revenue7. In 1959 gross revenue from non-African farming was just under  34millions, of which plantation crops brought in over half at  17-3 millions.8. African cash agriculture brought in gross revenue of  9-1 millions, of whichplantation crops were  3-4 millions.Exports Outside East Africa9. In 1959 Kenya domestic exports were  33-3 millions. Agriculture fromAfrican and non-African sources brought in  29 - 6 millions.Employment and Wages10. In 1959 non-African agriculture employed over 244,000 Africans, or over45 per cent, of the total African labour force. These employees earned about 8-8 millions in wages and nearly 20,000 of them also occupied part of their employers&apos; farming land for their own use.Investment11. In 1959 private investment in non-African agriculture was  5-45 millions,or 22 per cent, of all private capital formation ( 28 - 7 millions).
Industry12. The large body of non-African farmers provides a stimulus to nearly allindustry in Kenya, since they and the rest of the non-African population form a relatively easy home market on which production and sales can be based.13. Much industry in Kenya rests directly on agriculture; and in otherindustries local products have an important role. A rough analysis of manufacturing industry in 1957 shows that gross production in these industries was nearly 30 millions, or over half the production of all manufacturing industry.Flight of Capital14. Estimates supplied by three British banks show that the net outflowbetween February and April was  3-4 millions and for May  -885 million. Therehave been considerable withdrawals from the Building Societies. The KenyaBuilding Society has taken an overdraft of  500,000 to cover withdrawals and theymay need another  300,000 by the^end of December. For the First PermanentBuilding Society withdrawals have exceeded new investments by about   - 5 million and there has been a net deterioration in the accounts of the Savings and LoansSociety by nearly  200,000. All three Societies have stopped making new advancesfor housing (though the demand for mortgages is still high), Legal and GeneralAssurance have refused to assist First Permanent at all, although they are theirinsurers, and Norwich Union have similarly refused help to the Kenya building society.July, I960ANNEX draft StatementHer Majesty&apos;s Government have been in close touch with the Governor andhis advisers on the security of title to land and on the general land policy in Kenya.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government regard the future security of title to land asa matter of vital importance. They have already had discussions with ministers of the Kenya Government about the best method of ensuring such security and considerable work has already been done. As soon as detailed proposals havebeen prepared further discussions will take place with the Governor and his ministers with a view to a final statement being made.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that the principles in SessionalPapers 10 of 1958-59 and 6 of 1959-60 represent the right way forward in landpolicy since they would put land tenure on a proper basis and enable thedevelopment and resettlement schemes mentioned in the Lancaster HouseConference Report to begin. These matters are clearly of the greatest importance.For this reason it is proposed that after the debate on the Sessional Papers thenecessary legislation will, subject to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, be enacted by Orderin Council.July, I960.
