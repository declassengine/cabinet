SECRET144C. (60) U8 COPY NO.    ^ 3?19th July, I960CABINETFARM IMPROVEMENT scheme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Farm Price Review Committee have recently considered thefuture of the Farm Improvement Scheme.    This scheme was introduced bythe Agriculture Act, 1957, which provided for grants at 33 per cent towardsthe cost of specified types of landlords&apos; improvements included in applicationsmade over a period of ten years.     Provision was made in the Act for expenditure of  50 millions, which could be increased by Order by   5 millionsif the response proved strong enough.2.     In fact applications are now running well ahead of the average rateforeseen in 1957.     Expenditure this year is expected to be  8 millions andat least this amount in 1961-62.    The prospects beyond that have been reviewed by a Committee of officials who concluded that, barring unexpected develop-ments, total expenditure on the scheme would certainly exceed  55 millions and might well rise to between  70 millions and  85 millions.    TheCommittee also reported that if steps were to be taken to keep expenditure within its original limits the best method was a reduction in the rate of grant from 33^ per cent to 25 per cent.    Legislation in the coming session would be needed to amend the 1957 Act.    Even if the scheme were leftuntouched, however, an announcement to this effect would be necessary before long, with legislation following, in two or three years&apos; time toprovide the money in excess of  55 millions.The views of the Agricultural Ministers3.      The Agricultural Ministers emphasise that our agreement with the farmers in 1956 was for 33^ per cent grants over a period of ten years (see annex A).      50-  55 millions was an estimate of the likely cost, expresslystated to be inserted in the Bill for constitutional reasons, and not an absolute limit of expenditure.    It would be difficult to rebut charges ofbreach of faith if we now sought to reduce the rate of grant  or shorten the duration of the scheme purely to keep expenditure within this limit.    Thiswould be undesirable at any time and particularly now, when we are engaged in talks with the Farmers&apos; Unions.    We had to make our estimatefour years ago on the best available evidence:  but experience is showinghow much more worth-while work there is to be done than we then thought tomake up the leeway resulting from 35 years when capital improvements were held up by agricultural depression followed by wartime or post-warrestrictions.-1-
SECRET-    145&quot;The industry must seek progressively to reduce its workingcosts and so require less support against the effect of low market prices if it is to make its full contribution to the national economy.But efficient working on many farms today is still handicapped by inadequate or out-of-date farm buildings or other permanentfarm equipment.    Modernisation of these items offers the best way of making an effective contribution towards the lowering ofproduction costs.&quot;This is just as true today as it was then.    It is indeed particularly relevantnow that, in our talks with the Farmers&apos; Unions, attention is being focussedon the value of increasing efficiency as an offset to cost increases and reductions in guaranteed prices.    We should add greatly to our present difficulties with the farmers and considerably weaken our position at futureAnnual Reviews if we now sought to curtail the Farm Improvement Scheme.Our position will be correspondingly strengthened if it goes ahead withoutrestriction.The views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer5.     I do not find the arguments of the Agricultural Ministers conclusive,and suggest a cut in the rate of grant to 25 per cent.    I cannot agree thatwe committed ourselves firmly in 1957 to making no change in the terms ofthe Farm Improvement Scheme.    In fact I expressly reserved theGovernment&apos;s right to make such changes in my Second Reading speech,as Minister of Agriculture, on the Bill.    (The relevant passages are setout in Annex B to this paper.)6.      This is only one of many schemes for Government expenditure whicharc now outrunning the original estimates of cost.    We cannot agree toallow all of them to expand;  otherwise current Government expenditure willtake an ever-increasing proportion of our gross national product.    a choice between them is essential;  and it must be accepted that increases insome directions will have to be accompanied by  reductions in others.7.     I would not myself put additional expenditure on the farm improvement Scheme high on the list of priorities.     We are spending ever-increasing sums on agricultural production grants.    In 1956-57 they were 67 millions;  in 1960-61 they are estimated at  102 millions.    We had hoped that more on production grants would mean less for price supportsand guarantees.    In fact there has been no significant reduction over thepast five years, and the latest forecast estimates show that a substantial increase is in prospect over the next two years.8.     In other words the savings we had hoped for have not been realised.In the five years since 1955 we have cut the price guarantees in two yearsby a total of  28 millions;   and increased them in three years by a totalof  42 millions - a net increase of  14 millions.9.     I must emphasise that I do not propose a cut in spending on the farm Improvement Scheme - only a reduction in the rate of grant, designedto prevent an increase above the top limit of  55 millions envisaged in the19 57 Act.-2-
10.    The Agricultural Ministers say that this expenditure justifies a very high priority indeed in the field of agricultural support.    If this limit is torise from  50 millions to  70 or  85 millions I must ask them where theyare going to find a comparable saving to make room for it.Conclusion11.     The Agricultural Ministers wish the rate of grant to remain at33-f per cent and are in favour of legislation to be introduced shortly toauthorise the necessary additional expenditure of from  20 millions to 35 millions.    I suggest that the rate of grant be cut to 25 per cent so that expenditure may be limited to the higher figure of  55 millions envisaged in the Agriculture Act, 1957.12.    I submit the two alternative courses for the consideration of mycolleagues.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.19th July, I960.-3-
secret 4IANNEX AExtract from Memorandum dated 26th February, 1957,by Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodAGRICULTURE BILL, 1957Our agreement with the farmers incorporated in the White Paperprovided for the payment of 33-1 Per cent grants for a period of ten years.We estimated that the grants were likely to cost something of the order of 50 millions.    I propose that provision for this sum should be included inthe Bill with power by Order to increase the provision to  55 millions.I am, however, anxious to make it clear that we have no intention, by asystem of quotas or otherwise, to restrict the volume of grant-aided work from year to year with a view to keeping within this financial limit.    Forthis purpose, I would propose to include in my Second Reading speech ageneral statement on the lines attached to this note which has been agreed with officials of the Treasury by my Department.ANNEX extract from Second Reading Speech on the AgricultureBill, 25th March, 1957.Clause 18 is the financial Clause, and states that the grants will be33^ per cent.     We estimate the cost at about  50 millions for ten years.For constitutional reasons, we thought it desirable to put this figure in theBill, though it is necessarily a very speculative figure.    We worked it out rather like this.    We estimate that, without any grants, the work of thekind covered by these schemes is running at about  8 millions a year atpresent, excluding work of a kind already aided under other schemes.We believe that with a stimulus of this sort, the flow might be doubled, say, 15 millions, of which  5 millions would represent the cost of the grant.We are now asking Parliament to authorise an expenditure up to 50 millions for ten years, and to give us the power to increase that sum to  55 millions, if the estimates prove too low.    If the expenditure seems likely to exceed that figure, we shall have to look at the question afreshwhen the time comes.    If, on the other hand, the volume of work is lessthan we estimate, we are taking power to extend the period from ten to twelve years.I cannot give a definite undertaking as far as ten years ahead thatnever, in any circumstances, will there have to be a limitation of this expenditure.    The Government must retain freedom of action there, butI hope that we shall avoid any form of limitation and be able to allow thescheme free play and permit grant-aided improvements to go forwardwithout restraint.-4-
