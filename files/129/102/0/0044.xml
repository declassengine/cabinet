Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1960C. (60) 144 Copy No.    575th October, 1960CABINETPUBLIC INVESTMENT, 1961-62 AND 1962-63Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 19th July the Cabinet agreed that total investment in the public sector in1961-62 should not exceed  1,730 millions, and asked my predecessor to have furtherconsideration given to the individual proposals (C.C. (60) 47th Conclusions,Minute 5). They also invited him to circulate a draft of the proposed White paper on public investment.Public Investment, 1961-622. The original proposals put forward by Departments totalled  1,760 millions.My predecessor put forward in his paper C. (60) 112 suggestions for pruning this figure to  1,730 millions by restraining the proposed growth of certain programmes and, in particular, by holding investment in the road programme and british transport Commission combined to  274 millions. The Cabinet asked that theseproposals should be further discussed and this has now been done. The figures nowproposed for 1961-62 set out in the table on page 10 of the draft white paper attached have all been agreed by Departments and their aggregate is, in roundfigures,  1,730 millions. The combined total for the road programme and british transport Commission is  273 - 5 millions. I am grateful for my colleagues&apos; help,especially that of the Minister of Transport and of the Minister of Power, who has accepted a reduction in the power programmes as the Cabinet suggested.3. Subject to the settlement, through the normal channels, of the final detailsof borrowing by nationalised industries and in the Estimates, I invite my colleagues to approve public investment expenditure in 1961-62 as set out on page 10 of thedraft White Paper.Public Investment, 1962-634. My predecessor was also asked to arrange for officials to report on theproposed investment for 1962-63 on the lines suggested in C. (60) 112, i.e., toprepare a report which would enable us to determine within the total figureproposed for each programme a minimum to be provisionally approved this year which there would then be no question of cutting save in the most exceptional circumstances. Official discussions are proceeding on this point and I hope toreport on the outcome shortly.Draft White paper . My colleagues will remember that on 26th July the Leader of the Housereferred to &quot; the autumn White Paper on Capital Investment&quot; and promised thata day would be allocated for debating it before Christmas. The accompanyingdraft is circulated accordingly. It has been prepared after full consultation withthe Departments concerned.6. The most important section of the paper and the part which is likely to attract most interest is Part I.   This consists of a general discussion of the57835
principles and methods of influencing public investment and is intended to providematerial for the promised debate. Unless a broad framework of this sort isprovided, it is very likely that we shall be faced with a series of unco-ordinatedattacks on, or defences of, the various programmes, with some skirmishing aboutthe financing of the nationalised industries.7. Part II of the White Paper consists of factual notes on the variousprogrammes. This should be welcomed as being more informative than anythingpreviously published and I trust my colleagues see no objection to the draft, whichhas been agreed with Departments.S.

1. The gradual growth of public utilities in this country, the increasingconcern of &apos;the State over the last hundred years with social services, thepost-war assumption by Government of the supervision of some of the basicindustrial services, both old and new, and the increased scope of localauthorities&apos; activities have together conferred on public authorities in GreatBritain to-day responsibility for a wide variety of services, ranging fromeducation and health to railways and power. To sustain and develop thisnational heritage, to meet the needs of an expanding economy and tokeep abreast of new knowledge and techniques, requires large investment.Such investment, by its very size and complexity, raises some importantproblems which are discussed in Part I of this paper.2. The Economic Surveys 1959* and T960f gave the figures of expen-diture on public investment provisionally approved for the following year.On 15th March 1960, the then Chancellor of the [Exchequer announced(House of Commons Official Report, Cols. 1113-14) that the government intended to publish these figures in a separate review of public investment.The table on page 10 shows the revised approved expenditure for 1960/61,approved expenditure for 1961/62 and the out-turn for 1958/59 and1959/60; Part III gives notes on the various programmes and, where appropriate, gives references to statements of the policies which theyimplement.PART public Investment Programmes3. The various programmes of public fixed investment (as defined inAppendix I), set out in the table on page 10, can be summarised as follows:    million	1960/61*	1961/62Coal       ........................	100	96Gas        ........................	48	47Electricity          .....................	337	358Air Corporations.....................	60	33British Transport Commission...............	200	175Roadsf    ...................	97	108Atomic Energy Authority       ...............	44	45Post Office         .....................	94	96Education J        ............      .........	152	162Housing^           .....................	273	277Water and sewerage      ..................	92	99Hospitals, and other health and welfare services    ......	45	55Other public investment..................	171	185Timing adjustmentH      ..................	- 1	- 5Total       ...............	1,712	1,731Rounded to        ............	1,710	1,730* 1960-61 programme as at 1st October, 1960.

4. The programmes of the nationalised industries coal, gas, electricity,the British Transport Commission and the air corporations account for about two-fifths of all public investment. The electricity programmes arethe largest in this group, followed by the British Transport Commission.Another two^fiftihs consists of the programmes carried out by local autho-rities and similar bodies. Of these the housing and education programmes are the largest; this group also includes water, sewerage, some health and welfare services, and a number of smaller programmes. The remaining one-fifth of the total consists of the capital programmes carried out by centralGovernment departments and certain other programmes mainly financed from Votes. The largest items in this group are investment in roads (partof which is financed and carried out by local authorities) and by the PostOffice. The programmes of the Atomic Energy Authority, the university grants Committee and for hospital services also belong here.Public Investment and Economic Policy(i) General5. The basic economic and social ends which public investment is designedto fulfil are fundamental to the achievement of an expanding economy anda rising standard of living. The programmes meet many differentimmediate objectives, and many are inter-related; thus the housing pro-gramme may affect investment in water, sewerage, gas, electricity, health and education. Despite the fall since .1953 in investment by local authoritiesin housing, total public investment has increased steadily over the past ten years and, in real terms, grew by 35 per cent, between 1950 and 1959.The proportion of the gross national product taken up by public investmentvaried in these years between 7 per cent, and 8J per cent, (at current prices) ;in the last five years it has remained fairly constant at around 1\ per cent.Total fixed investment, public and private, rose from nearly 15 per cent,of the gross national product in 1950 to nearly 18 per cent, in 1959*. public investment has been about half of all fixed investment during this period.6. Public investment is thus an important element in total demand on theresources of the country and the long-term aims of economic policy could be jeopardised in periods of high demand if it were allowed to place too muchstrain on resources, in particular those of the industries directly con-cerned. The Governments policy on public investment must therefore take into account both the aim of expansion and the balance between demand and resources.(ii) Finance7. The Exchequer is a major instrument in maintaining this balance andthe financial implications of public investment for the Exchequer have tobe borne in mind when the programmes are settled. There are differences in the way in which the investment is financed, and the respectivemethods are described in the note on each programme in Part II. the programmes of the nationalised industries, in so far as they are financed by external borrowing, are a direct call on the Exchequer. The industriesborrowed  500m. from the Exchequer during their accounting year 1959or 1959/60, excluding day to day advances to the National Coal board under the Coal Industry (Nationalisation) Act, 1946, and advances to the* For details see Appendix II.5
British Transport Commission under section 2 (2) of the Transport (RailwayFinances) Act, 1957. Also a direct call on the Exchequer is the investmentfinanced from Votes; this amounted to  277m. in 1959/60 (excludinggrants to local authorities, etc.). Local authorities finance most of their investment by borrowing ; certain services, such as education and housing,are aided by Exchequer grants, either specific or as part of the general grant to local authorities. These grants may be made towards the loan charges, or, for classified roads and certain other services, towards thecapital cost. While local authorities borrow from the market when theycan, and in recent years have largely done so, the Public Works Loan Boardremains their lender of last resort, so that their investment too, constitutes a contingent liability on the Exchequer. Their decreasing reliance onborrowing from the Public Works Loan Board is illustrated by the followingtable showing their borrowings from the Board between 1955 and 1960.  million	P.W.L.B. advances	Repayments of capital to P.W.L.B.

Much of the investment in hand each year will have been startedpreviously and so most of the money to be spent represents a prior commit-ment. The figure for total expenditure on each programme for 1961/62is, however, provisional until final decisions have been taken in the lightof the availability of finance. Thus, the expenditure to be financed fromVotes is subject to scrutiny and approval by Parliament of the estimates for 1961/62. In the case of the nationalised industries, although theGovernment has approved in principle proposals for capital expenditurein 1961/62 at the level shown in this white paper, the amount of money toibe lent by the Exchequer to these industries will not be settled until theamounts available from the internal resources of the industries can be more precisely estimated and taken into account. Their prospective borrowingsin 1961/62 will be set out in a white paper to be published in the spring of 1961.(iii) The balance of demand and resources9. The Governments policy on public investment in relation to itsresponsibility for keeping the economy in balance is a development of thatset out in paragraph 62 of the 1944 white paper on Employment Policy(Cmd. 6527). That white paper foresaw the use of public investment asan instrument of employment policy: its words were: &quot; for the purpose ofmaintaining general employment it is desirable that public investment shouldactually expand when private investment is declining and should contractin periods of boom&quot;. The implication was that large and prolongedeconomic fluctuations, as had been experienced before the war, would call for equally large counter-variations in the level of public investment. In theevent, however, the role of public investment in preserving the balance
of the economy has changed from that envisaged in 1944. There are several reasons for this. The improved knowledge of the eoonomic situationderived from the better statistics now available has been utilised in thedevelopment of counter-cyclical policies ; and monetary and fiscal measures,complemented by only marginal adjustments of public investment, have proved sufficient to prevent variations in economic activity from gettingout of hand. Again, world economic fluctuations have been less violent andshorter than they were before the war. The pre-war problem of massunemployment has gone and the problems of this country to-day are primarily those of expansion and price stability. This aim of expansionwithin stability conditions is the pace of those of the programmes which are designed to meet basic economic requirements, and so the bulk of the workon them cannot lightly be deferred or advanced. Other programmes areconcerned with important social needs ; these, too, as the 1944 white paperitself pointed out, cannot readily be postponed though there is, on occasion,opportunity to accelerate or retard them marginally when the general levelof demand requires. Finally, once work has begun on a project, it is usuallyuneconomic to attempt either to accelerate or to retard it at short notice.There is therefore a large proportion of public investment where it would notbe sensible to try to engineer isihort-term variations in momentum to matchchanges in economic circumstances as rapid or as relatively mild as thoseexperienced in recent years.(iv) Short-term adjustments10. With these considerations in mind, the Government seeks as far aspossible to avoid interference with investment plans which have beenapproved. There is, however, in all the programmes some scope for short-term adjustment should the economic situation call for it; in particular,marginal variations can be made by concentrating on projects which canbe started and finished relatively quickly. In recent years there have beenadjustments in both directions. In 1957 steps were taken to moderate separately of public investment which would otherwise have imposed an excessivestrain on resources; late in 1958 circumstances had changed and theGovernment took action to stimulate the rate of expenditure in certainprogrammes. In view of the number and variety of bodies immediately concerned (see paragraph 12), and the impracticability in most cases of varying the rate of work on projects already in progress, a decision to stimulate or restrain the rate of expenditure must be made in good time ifit is to have a counter-cyclical effect. It may be six months until significantresults begin to become apparent and the full effect may not make its impactfor a year longer.How Public Investment is controlled11. Each summer the Government considers the proposals put forward by the authorities concerned for expenditure on public investment in thefollowing financial year and re-examines the future growth and pattern ofpublic investment as a whole. The various programmes are considered inrelation to the total outlay proposed and against the (background of theeconomic situation. Levels of expenditure are approved for public investment as a whole and for each programme.  This review is the focal point in the
control of public investment and the various procedures described in thefollowing paragraph are operated in accordance with the decisions thenreached.12. All public investment is subject in varying degrees to a measure ofGovernment control and approval, but only the programmes of Govern-ment departments are the immediate responsibility of Ministers. Overthe rest of the field immediate responsibility is widely diffused : thereare 27 gas and electricity boards, some 180 local education authorities, over950 local government water undertakings, over 1,600 sewerage authorities,about 1,700 local housing authorities, and 20 regional hospital boards and 36boards of governors of teaching hospitals. The form and degree of theGovernments influence over the investment of these and the other publicfoodies concerned varies, depending partly on their constitutional position.The main lines of the capital programmes of the nationalised industries,and also their borrowings, within the limits approved from time to time by Parliament, are subject to the approval of Ministers. In the education programme, both each major project and the total of minor projects to be started by each local education authority require the approval of theMinister of Education or the Secretary of State for Scotland ; in thehousing programme, the acceptance of tenders by the housing authoritiesrequires the approval of the Minister of Housing and Local government or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Control of most other local authorityinvestment depends on the necessity for a local authority to obtainfor each amount borrowed a loan sanction from the appropriate Minister,e.g., the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretaryof State for Scotland. This is not necessary, in England and Wales,if borrowing powers have been obtained under a private Act of Parliament,but in all cases local authorities&apos; borrowings require Treasury approval underthe Control of Borrowing Order, 1958. For some programmes, such as most of water and sewerage in England and Wales, the loan sanction pro-cedure or Treasury control of borrowing is the only form of direct Govern-ment control. Local authorities&apos; investment expenditure must, however, take account of their general financial position, in which the level fixed by theGovernment for the general grant is an important factor, and it is influencedindirectly, like the rest of the economy, by monetary measures affectinginterest rates.Estimates and out-turn13. The scale, complexity and variety of the programmes and the variety of bodies administering them make forward estimates subject to many un-certainties. The phasing of payments may be altered by changes in deliverydates or in the rate of progress by contractors ; plans for new projects maybe reviewed in the light of revised forecasts of requirements or changes inthe availability of productive capacity or finance ; preliminary procedures for example for ithe acquisition of land or completion of detailed surveys and plans may take more or less time than expected. The effect of these un-certainties varies from programme to programme but the general tendency in recent years has been for total expenditure to fall short of the levelapproved in advance. In 1958/59 total actual expenditure on public invest-ment was  1,470 m. against approved programmes totalling  1,480 m. ; in1959/60 the corresponding figures were  1,620 m. and  1,670 m.
14. In the summer of 1960 it was apparent that a state of excessive demand was developing. The Government therefore decided, as announced by the thenChancellor of the Exchequer on 23rd June (House of Commons official report, Col. 651) that, along with other measures of restraint designed to moderate the growth of demand generally, the Government would hold &quot;the approved level of total public investment in 1961/62 to that of 1960/61. Atthe time when this statement was made, the approved expenditure for1960/61 totalled in round figures,  1,730 m., and this is the total approved forall public investment for 1961/62. The figures for 1960/61 in the table on page 10 and in Part II have, however, been revised downwards by 20 m. to take account of certain minor changes which are alreadyforeseen with reasonable certainty by the authorities concerned. It is stilltoo early to estimate with any certainty the extent to which the programmes as a whole will be fufilled since much depends on the pressure of demand on the investment industries in the next six months, but the provisional estimate of the out-turn for the April-June quarter 1960, coupled with thegeneral tendency mentioned in the previous paragraph suggests that thefinal out-iturn for 1960/61 may be in ,the neighbourhood of  1,670 million.

The Revised Plan for Coal, published in October 1959, contemplated the investment of  511 million over the six years 1960/65 and an output of200-215 million tons of coal from all sources in 1965. Home consumption and exports fell sharply to 195 million tons in 1959 but are expected to recover to 200 million tons in 1960.16. It was stated in the white paper on capital investment in the coal,electricity and gas industries, presented to Parliament in April 1960 (Cmnd.993) that the National Coal Board had modified its plans for 1960 andexpected its capital expenditure in that year to be below the approvedfigure of  120 million. It is now expected that the figure for 1960/61will not exceed  100 million; this reduction reflects the restraint the board is exercising on capital expenditure.17. In addition to replacement of plant, the expenditure now foreseenprovides for the continuation of work on 151 new collieries and majorreconstruction schemes, of which about 25 are due to be completed in1960.   Seven schemes have been approved to start in 1960.18.

projects put forward for approval. Provision has also been made for expenditure on commercial scale plants for manufacturing smokeless fuelsand on the most efficient methods of preparing and disposing of theBoard&apos;s products.20.

The development plan for the gas industry was set out in the gas council&apos;s booklet Gas Looks Ahead, published in February 1960. the investment programme is essentially one of modernisation and integration,with the aim of reducing costs by concentrating manufacture at the most efficient works and using the most economical methods. The Gas Councilforecasts a small increase in the demand for gas over the next five years from a total of 2,591 million therms in 1959/60 to 2,741 million thermsin 1964/65.22. The plan for development up to 1964/65 provides for some investment in new methods of gas supply, such as the use of liquefied natural gasas a raw material, large scale production, and bulk transmission of gasby high pressure pipeline between Board areas in conjunction with under-ground storage. Such projects are unlikely to call for appreciable expenditure as early as the year 1961/62, but the estimates for that year provide for expenditure of  4-8 million on the two plants for the total gasification ofcoal by the Lurgi process which are already under construction in Scotlandand in the Midlands. 1 :&apos;

Investment by the electricity supply industry in England and Walescomprises expenditure by the Central Electricity Generating Board ongenerating stations and the main transmission system and by the twelveArea Boards on local distribution.24. The white paper presented to Parliament in April 1960 (Grand. 993)showed expenditure on fixed assets in 1960/61 of  275-4 million as approved in August 1959, but stated that the Boards had later found it necessaryto revise their estimates. This was mainly because payments under contracts for. construction of power stations seemed likely to fall due earlier than hadbeen expected and because the rapid growth of load, resulting from theexpansion of the economy last year, required a revision of the Area Boards&apos;plan for extending and reinforcing their distribution: networks. The estimates for 1960/61 in the table above are those which the Minister of Power hasnow accepted after discussion with the Electricity Council and Boards.25. The generating programme is designed to keep pace with the growth in peak demand for electricity, which has been at an average rate of 7 percent, a year for the past decade, equivalent to a doubling of demand in just over ten years.  This rate of growth shows no sign of diminishing.26. The annual amounts for conventional and nuclear power stationsrelate not only to expenditure on the generating plant commissioned in theyear, but also to terminal expenditure in respect of plant previously corn-missioned and expenditure in respect of work in progress.27. The Generating Board&apos;s power stations had a total output capacityof 25,529 MW on 31st March 1960, and it is expected that a total of11,358 MW of new plant will Ibe commissioned in the years 1960/64 inclusive.This figure includes 9,184 MW of conventional steam plant to be installedin 16 new stations and in 4 new sections of existing stations ; 1,825 MWof nuclear plant to be installed in the 5 nuclear stations now under con-reconstruotion for the Board ; and 349 MW of hydro-electric plant in two newstations. It is estimated that after allowance for the plant expected-tobecome unserviceable, and certain other adjustments, the output capacity, of
the (Board&apos;s stations will he 27,130 iMW at the end of 1960 and 29,360 MiWat the end of 1961. The new stations expected to be commissioned in1961 include the Board&apos;s first two nuclear stations (Bradwell and Berkeley)with a combined output capacity of 575 MW.28. The expenditure on nuclear fuel shown in the table represents pay-ments, including advance payments, to the Atomic Energy Authority forthe initial fuel charges and reserve fuel stocks of the nuclear stations.Replacement fuel will toe charged to revenue account.29. The expenditure on main transmission provides for the developmentof the grid and supergrid to provide adequate interconnection betweenthe various parts of the country and to permit large transfers of energyfrom areas where production costs are relatively low to those where costs are higher. In addition it covers the connection to the system of newgenerating capacity and the provision of new points of supply to area boards.30. The bulk of the expenditure by Area Boards is devoted to reinforce-ment of existing networks to meet the increasing loads placed on themand extension of the networks to provide supplies to new consumers. provision is made to continue the rural electrification programme, on which progress has been faster than originally expected. Under present plans it is hopedthat at least 87 per cent, of the farms in England and Wales will beconnected by 31st March, 1963. Further expenditure will also be incurred in standardising voltage ; this is a non-recurring item, tout there remains asubstantial volume of work in this field.South of Scotland Electricity Board  million	1958	1959	1960	1961Generation 				Conventional stations......	9-7	5-9	4-5	60Nuclear station     ............	7-9	10-7	9-7	5-5Main transmission    ............	2-4	2-5	3-0	3-5Distribution and other       .......j:	7-6	8-3	8-8	90	27-6	27-4	260	240The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the South of scotland electricity Board at 31st December, 1959, was  141 million.31. Expenditure on conventional generation is mainly on constructionof the coal-fired station at Kincardine, but it also includes work on thesmaller station at Braehead, which accounts for  l-6m. in 1961. The first three generating sets with a total output capacity of 336 MW have been commisioned in the Kincardine station and the fourth and fifth, each with an output of 188 MW, are due to be commissioned in 1962 and 1963respectively. The extension (56 MW) of the Braehead station is expectedto toe commissioned in 1961. Progress payments on the nuclear station atHunterston continue. Main transmission includes the provision of a 275 KVsupergrid connecting Hunterston, Neilston and Windyhill in the west withKincardine and Edinburgh in the east. The new system should be complete
by 1963 and will connect with England through the existing line fromClyde&apos;s Mill, and also with the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board  million	1958	1959	1960	1961Generation     ...............	11-5	8-8	7-8	11-7Main transmission.........	1-4	1-5	1-5	1-7Distribution   ...      .............	2-5	2-7	3-1	2-6	15-4	13-0	12-4	160The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board at 31st December, 1959, was  184 million.32. Expenditure on generation covers the Loch Awe and StrathfarrarSchemes (440 and 102 MW output capacity respectively) and a number of smaller hydro-electric schemes. The rise in expenditure in 1961 chieflyreflects the progress of work on the Loch Awe Scheme, which includes400 MW of pumped storage, and on the Strathfarrar Scheme. Main trans-mission includes 275 KV lines between Beauly, Aberdeen and Dundeeplanned so^ that in future a connection can be made with the South ofScotland Electricity Board&apos;s Central Scotland supergrid. 275 KV lineswill also connect the pumped storage scheme at Loch Awe with theSouth of Scotland Electricity Board&apos;s network at Windyhill. The additionalgeneration, transmission and distribution facilities are to meet the expectedgrowth of demand in the Board&apos;s Area, to supply the South of scotland board during peak periods and to continue the programme of ruralelectrification.33. Since the programme of expenditure for 1960 was approved inAugust 1959 both the finalisation of contracts and the progress of constructionwork on now contracts have been slower than expected, with the result thatthe expenditure in 1960, shown above, is lower than the amount previouslyauthorised.Air Corporations  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62British Overseas Airways Corporation: Aircraft and spares...      .......

Provision is made in the years 1960/61and 1961/62 for expenditure on 15 Boeing 707s, 35 vickers vc10s and10 Vickers Super VG.10s (fiOAC) and 10 Comet IVBs, 20 Vanguard V.951sand 953s, and 24 de Havilland Tridents (BBA).35. Investment under the heading &quot; Other&quot; relates to the provision of equipment for handling aircraft on the ground and the provision, maintenance and equipment of technical, office and sales accommodation. The BEAprogramme includes provision of  2 million over the two years 1960/61 and1961/62 for the construction of permanent tbuildings at the London AirTerminal in Cromwell Road.British Transport Commission  million	1958	1959	1960	1961*British Railways:				Building, works and plant.........	52-3	68-5	75-0	Rolling stock 				locomotives    ............	17-9	43-2	47-0	coaching vehicles.     ...      ......	31 1	34-0	28-0	freight vehicles............	38-3	20-6	10-0	Total...     ............	139-6	166-3	160-0	125-other activities:				London Transport ...      .........	2-8	6-7	13-0	160Docks       ......      .........	5-6	60	9-0	5-british Railways collection and delivery				services   ...............	1-1	1-3	10	1-british Road Services      .,.......	5-7	4-7	5-0	5-0Provincial and Scottish Buses     ......	5-0	51	60	4-0Ships............      ......	4-1	4-3	2-0	2-0Inland waterways......      ......	1-4	1-3	2-0	10Other services      ...     ...      ......	1-2	1-2	2-0	10Total..................	26-9	30-6	40-0	35-0Subject to review.............	-	-	-	150Total B.T.C..........	166-5	196-9	200-0	1750The net book value of fixed assets show inn the balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1959, was  1,800 million.37. The major part of the British Transport Commission^ investment expenditure is on work on the railways in furtherance of the modernisationplan set out in Proposals for the Railways (Cmd. 9880) and subsequentlyrevised in the Reappraisal of the Plan for the Modernisation andRe-equipment of British Railways (Crond. 813). The present plan, muchof which is a replacement programme, provides for comprehensive improve-ments in traok, signalling and other fixed operating equipment on maintrunk routes, the progressive elimination of steam in favour of diesel orelectric traction, the provision of modern passenger rolling stock, and there-modelling of railway freight services, including the construction of* Provisional see paragraph 41.16
modern marshalling yards to replace a much larger number of old yards,and the concentration of goods terminal facilities at a limited number of modern depots. The aim is to produce a more efficient and compact railway system.37. The London Transport programme includes replacement of obsoleteunderground rolling stock, extension of electrification from Riekmansworthto Aimershaim and Ohesham, and improvements at various stations includingthe provision of car parks. The London Transport programme also includesreplacement of trolley-buses and old type buses by &quot; Routemaster &quot; buses.38. Dock works reflect the need to modernise facilities at some of theCommission^ ports. It is planned to provide some new vessels for portmaintenance. The expenditure on road services (both passenger and goods)is mainly on new and improved vehicles and depot facilities. In additionto maintenance, the Commission proposes to improve selected waterwaysand their associated terminal facilities.39. As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his statement on 10thMarch 1960 (House of Commons Official (Report, Col. 642), a SpecialAdvisory Group was set up on 6th April 1960 to examine the structure,finance and working of the organisations at present controlled by theCommission and to advise the Minister of Transport and the commission as a matter of urgency how effect can best be given to the governments intentions as indicated in the Prime Ministers statement.40. The Prime Minister referred also to the financial difficulties of theCommission. In accordance with the arrangements announced in theBudget Speech, the Commission^ revenue deficit for 1960 will be met outof moneys voted by Parliament (Class IX, Vote 10)*. In these circumstances,it is necessary for the Minister to review proposals for investment expenditurein greater detail than hitherto, and the Commission are submitting particu-lars of all new projects of which the cost exceeds  250,000, before work on them is started. In practice, therefore, the modernisation plan is being kept under review toy the Minister and the Commission.41. The detailed review of the investment requirements of the commission for 1961 has not yet been completed. Meanwhile, however, after discussions with the Commission, a limit of  175m. has been set for investment expenditure on its undertakings as a whole for 1961.  125m. has been pro-visionalry allocated to railways and  35m. to other activities;  15m. is subject to further consideration of certain investment projects.* References to Votes in this white paper are to the Estimates for 1960/61.17

The road programme provides for capital expenditure on motorways,trunk and classified roads, and on trunk road lighting; Expenditure onunclassified roads and other lighting is the responsibility of local authoritiesand is included among the other investment of public corporations and localauthorities (page 28).43. Capital expenditure on motorways and trunk roads is administered by the Ministry of Transport in England and Wales and by the Scottish home department in Scotland, partly through highway authorities acting asagents of the Ministry and Department. Both motorways and trunk roadsare financed entirely by the Ministry of Transport and Scottish home department (Class &apos;LX, Votes 2 and 9); expenditure on classified roads and on trunk.road lighting is financed partly by grants from the Ministry ofTransport and Scottish Home Department and partly by local authorities.
44. The table shows the rapid expansion of the road programme. InEngland and Wales the work is largely on five major projects designed toimprove the main trunk network. These are the building of the London-Preston and London-South Wales motorways and the modernisation of theGreat North Road and of the roads between the Midlands and South wales and between London and the Channel Ports. Major schemes in Scotlandinclude the Forth road bridge, the Clyde tunnels and reconstruction of the trunk roads between Glasgow and Stirling and Glasgow and Carlisle.45. The figures for 1961/62 provide for the further expansion of the road programme announced on 28th July 1960 (House of Commons official report, Cols. 1888 and 1906). In England and Wales this will permit asubstantial increase in expenditure over the next five years both on motor-ways and on classified road schemes for Che relief of urban congestion.The aim is substantially to complete the five major projects within the next five or six years and to start the Yorkshire motorway in the same period.Planning for classified road schemes will be on the basis of a total of 150 million of Exchequer grants over the next five years.46. In Scotland the reconstruction of main trunk routes is to be accelerated. The emphasis in the recent past has been on classified road schemes. Further planning in Scotland is on the basis of Exchequer grants for classified road schemes totalling approximately  31 million over thenext five years. Work will include completion of the Forth bridge andClyde tunnels and there will foe higher expenditure on the Highland road programme.Atomic Energy Authority  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62Land and buildings............	17-7	17-5	19-9	21 plant and machinery............	24-4	19-8	23-9	23-6Total   ...	42-1	37-3	43-8	44-6The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Atomic energy authority at 31st March, 1959, was  250m.47. These figures include the investment of the Atomic Energy Authorityitself, grants by the Authority to the National Institute for Research inNuclear Science and all capital expenditure on the O.E.E.C. project (Dragon)for a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at Winfrith Heath, which isfinanced partly by contributions by the Authority, partly by contributions by other O.E.E.C. countries. The Authority&apos;s expenditure is financed fromthe Atomic Energy Vote (Class IX ,Vote 7).48. The fall in capital expenditure in 1959/60 marked the completion ofall the production reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross and the mainphase of construction at the experimental fast reactor station at Dounreay.49. The Authority^ investment for 1961 /62 will have two broad objectives,namely, production, and research and development. Investment for production will include plant for the extraction of uranium from its oresand the production of fuel elements, both for the Authority&apos;s ownexisting production reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross and for the
nuclear power stations under construction for the Central electricity generating Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board. It willalso include plant for the chemical separation of fissile material fromirradiated fuel elements, including those re-purchased from the Boards.50. Investment for research and development will include a relatively small sum in support of the current civil nuclear power programme, whichis based on developments of the reactor system in use at Calder Hall. Muchmore will he spent on more advanced reactor systems which are likelyto form the next generations of nuclear power stations. These include theDragon project at Winfrith Heath, the experimental fast reactor atDounreay, and the prototype advanced gas-cooled reactor at Windscalewhich should he completed during 1961. Looking still farther ahead, theAuthority are establishing laboratories at Culham for research into controlledthermonuclear reactions and plasma physics.51. The major project of the National Institute (for Research in NuclearScience is the construction of a 7 percent proton synchrotron (Nimrod) atthe Rutherford Laboratory, Harwell, which will be used by universities and other bodies for research on nuclear structures.Post Office  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62Land and building    ............	11-1	11-2	10-8	11-9Plant and machinery:				Telephone system        .........	72-3	73-3	73-7	75-0Telegraph         ............	2-1	3-4	3-0	2-3Postal mechanisation   .........	0-4	0-4	0-3	0-general service works.........	2-7	2-4	30	3-0Trans-Atlantic telephone cable No. 3...	 	 	 	1-0Road vehicles...............	1-0	1-1	21	2-4Cable ship     ...............	 	0-7	11	 	89-6	92-5	94 0	960The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Post Office at31st March, 1960, was  802 million.52. At present Post Office investment, which is financed partly from internal resources and partly by advances from the Exchequer under PostOffice Money Acts, is subject to the normal Parliamentary control of theannual Estimates (Vote Rev. 3). Proposed changes in the status of the PostOffice were set out in the white paper presented to Parliament in March 1960(cmnd.. 989), which said that the Government hoped to seek the approvalof Parliament for these changes in the next Parliamentary session. Underthe proposed new arrangements the Post Office finances would be severedfrom the Exchequer and the Estimates procedure replaced by broader andmore flexible forms of Parliamentary control, but Post Office borrowingfor capital purposes would continue to be made from the Exchequer.53. A survey of investment plans was given in the white paper on PostOffice capital expenditure 1960/61, presented to Parliament in March 1960(Cmnd. 973). Over three-quarters of the expenditure is for the telephoneprogramme, which aims at completing by 1970 the automatisation of the
telephone service and the extension of subscriber trunk dialling to nearly all telephones, and at providing telephones for new applicants. Expenditureon land and buildings includes new telephone buildings and replacement of old and inadequate postal buildings. Provision is made for a limited pro-gramme of postal mechanisation, and in 1961/62 for the initial U.K. shareof expenditure on a third trans-Atlantic cable.54. The Post Office figures for 1958/59 include the cost of work under-taken by the Post Office for the provision of television links for the B.B.C.and I.T.A., which in the returns for subsequent years has been includedin the B.B.C. and I.T.A. programmes (page 28).University Grants Committee  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62Land and buildings............	12-6	17-3	19-9	20-plant and machinery............	2-1	2-7	40	4-4	14-7	200	23-9	24-855. Funds are voted annually by Parliament (Class IV, Vote 12) for exchequer grants to the universities. These include capital (or &quot; non-recurrent&quot;) grants for the erection of new, and the adaptation of existing,buildings, equipment for new accommodation, and the purchase of sites and properties. Investment (and the Exchequers commitments for non-recurrent grant) is subject to limits on the total value of new building workto be started in each year ; within these limits, allocations between universitiesare made by the University Grants Committee. In 1960, and in the next three years, new building work is being started at the rate of  15 million ayear under a programme designed (as the then Chancellor announced inParliament on 20th February 1958, Official Report, Cols. 1400/1) to make possible an increase in the student population to about 124,000 by the mid-1960&apos;s, with the possibility of a further temporary increase of 10 percent, in the second half of the decade. Investment in 1960/61 and 1961/62includes substantial expenditure on halls of residence, and the provision ofexpanded or additional accommodation for science at most universities andfor the technologies in universities where these are studied.Education  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62England and Wales Buildings:  Primary and secondary schools Further education       .........

56. The major proportion of public investment in education is undertaken by local education authorities, working within overall limits administered by the Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. Thecapital expenditure of the local education authorities is, for the most part,financed by borrowing, and the loan charges (together with capital expendi-ture from revenue) are taken into account in fixing the general grant tolocal authorities.57. In England and Wales the renewed rise in expenditure on school building expected between 1960/61 and 1961/62 reflects the fact that  115million worth of new work on major projects is being started in these twoyears, compared with  93-4 million in the immediately preceding two years.This is the first instalment of the programme of  300 million over five years,announced in the white paper Secondary education for all a New Drive(Cmnd. 604), presented to Parliament in December 1958. The five-year programme will complete the elimination of all-age schools, and about three-quarters of the building needed for this is included in the work proposed for1960/61 and 1961/62. It will also get rid of the worst existing schools(about half of our children are attending schools built before the 1914/18war, many of which provide conditions well below modern standards) anda significant start is being made, particularly on modernising or replacingold secondary schools, in the first two years.58. Investment in further education is mainly for building new colleges and major extensions. Special emphasis is being given to the expansion of facilities for advanced technological education and for the part-timeeducation of craftsmen and technicians. The white paper on technical education, presented to Parliament in February 1956 (Cmd. 9703),announced a building programme of  70 million in England and Walesfor the five years 1956 to 1961. New projects included in that programme are now starting at a rate of about  15 million a year (plus  3 million for equipment) and it is intended that the rate should be maintained in1961/62 and the two subsequent years.59. An important element in the increase in building expenditure on other services is a steep rise in investment in teacher training. The announcedprogramme to provide 16,000 additional places in the training colleges hasbeen accelerated and is now planned for completion in 1963 (House ofCommons Official Report, 26th June 1959, Col. 166-7W, and 21st March1960, Col. 175).60. In 1960/61 and 1961/62, in consequence of the recommendations ofthe Allbemarle Committee (Cmnd. 929), presented to Parliament in February1960, extra provision is included for investment in youth services. Workcosting  3 million will be started in the two years 1960-1962 ; it is estimatedthat  0-7 million will be spent in 1960/61 and  1-9 million in 1961/62.61. The pattern of investment in Scotland is similar to that in Englandand Wales. The provision for school building follows the five-year programmeenvisaged in the White paper Education in Scotland the Next Step,presented to Parliament in December 1958 (Cmnd. 603). Expenditure on further education is rising more steeply in Scotland, because the  10 millionprogramme of investment in Scottish technical education (plus  2 million for equipment), announced in the 1956 white paper, took longer to getunder way than was expected.

Public investment in housing comprises investment by local authori-ties, housing associations, including the Scottish Special Housing Association,and new town development corporations, and is mostly financed toyborrowing.63. Local authority housebuilding now consists chiefly of providing new houses in slum clearance and overspill schemes and in building housesspecially designed for occupation by old people. The acceptance of tendersby the housing authorities is subject to approval toy the Minister of housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland.64. Besides house building the programme includes the cost of improve-ments carried out by local authorities and housing associations to their ownhouses, tout not grants for the improvement of privately owned houses.For houses built for approved purposes local authorities receive subsidiesfrom the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and Department ofHealth for Scotland (Class V, Votes 2 and 11). The Scottish Special housing association is financed from the Exchequer by loans, subsidy, and annual payments of deficit on revenue account under the Housing (Scotland) Acts,1950-1957. New town development corporations are financed by loans fromthe Exchequer under the New Towns Act, 1946.Water and Sewerage  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62England and Wales Water     ...............

This is the work carried out toy local water boards and authorities,and toy local sewerage authorities ; investment by private water companies isnot included in the above figures. It is for the most part financed toy loan.For borrowing, the boards and authorities in England and Wales requireloan sanction from the Minister of Housing and Local Government, unlessborrowing powers have been obtained under a private Act of Parliament,and in all cases in Scotland loan sanction is required from the Secretaryof State for Scotland. To assist certain schemes in rural areas anddevelopment districts grants are paid by the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government and the Department of Health for Scotland under the RuralWater Supplies and Sewerage Acts and the Local Employment Act, 1960(Class V, Votes 1 and 9).66. Investment in water is for augmenting inadequate supplies and tomeet the rapidly growing demand, principally from industry tout also for domestic use, including the provision of putolic services for the first timein rural areas. Sewerage expenditure is principally for new housing develop-iment, works in rural areas and to make rivers and beaches clean. Therehas been a marked increase in this investment since 1958/59 and the level is expected to continue to rise.67. Among the water schemes in England and Wales for which provision is made in the expenditure approved for 1960/61 and 1961/62 are theTryweryn Valley for the Liverpool Corporation, the Coquet scheme forTyneside, the Haweswater extension scheme for providing an extra 11 million gallons a day for Manchester Corporation and the North-West, the YorkshireDerwent scheme for the industrial West Riding, and Llandegsedd reservoirwhich Cardiff Corporation is to construct to meet its own needs and thoseof the Newport, Pontypool and Abertillery districts, including some of therequirements of the new steel mill at Llanwern. In Scotland there is theLoch Lee scheme serving the counties of Angus and Kincardine ; the LoohTurret scheme which will supply wide areas in the counties of Perthand Clackmannan and important industrial development at Grangemouth ;the West Water scheme which provides for new industrial development in west Lothian ; and the Daer scheme which will provide additional supplies to the whole of industrial Lanarkshire.68. Sewerage and sewerage disposal schemes for which provision is madeinclude the reconstruction of the works dealing with much of the domestic and industrial wastes from Birmingham and neighbouring districts, thereconstruction of the Manchester Corporation works and the constructionof a northern trunk sewer in Hull. Among other schemes for improving the cleanliness of toeaches are those at St. Mary&apos;s Bay, Dymchurch andWorthing.Local Authority Health and Welfare Services  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62England and Wales (i) Health: Mental health services......

69. These programmes are the responsibility of local authorities ; overmost of the field they work within allocations administered by the Ministryof Health and Department of Health for Scotland. The local authorities&apos;expenditure is financed partly from their revenues and partly by borrowing ;loan charges, together with capital expenditure from revenue, are takeninto account in fixing the general grant.70. The provision for expansion of mental health services follows therecommendations of the Royal Commission on mental illness (Cmnd. 169),presented to Parliament in May 1957. It includes provision for trainingcentres both for children and adults, and residential accommodation for a variety of needs. Expenditure on old people&apos;s homes, provided under theNational Assistance Act, 1958, is to meet the demand for residential accom-modation resulting from the increasing proportion of older people in thepopulation.71. Scottish expenditure is on the same lines as in England and Wales,except that local authorities are not responsible for the ambulance service or to the same extent as in England and Wales for training centres formentally handicapped children. The provision for the expansion of mentalhealth services is timed to begin somewhat later than in England and Wales.Hospital Services  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62England and Wales				(i) Hospitals:				Major projects      .........	&quot;)	r	10-0	15-0Normal works      .........

Subject to the general direction of the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland, the building programme for hospitals iscarried out by Regional Hospital Boards, except for the teaching hospitals in England and Wales, where the Boards of Governors of these hospitals
are responsible ; it is financed through the National Health Service Votes(Class V, Votes 5 and 10).73. The main aim is to modernise the hospital service by replacing obsoleteaccommodation, building new hospitals where required by shifts of popu-lation or for rationalisation and economy, providing up-to-date teachingfacilities and keeping abreast of advances in medical science.74. Many large hospital schemes are in progress. Details are given inthe Appendix A to the 1960/61 Estimates (Class V, Votes 5 and 10). new schemes planned to start in England and Wales during 1961/62 include a new teaching hospital at St. Thomas&apos;s, a new hospital at Truro, a newdental teaching hospital at Birmingham, and an expansion of High WycomfoeMemorial Hospital and new radio-therapy departments there. Other schemes are at Newcastle General Hospital and Sheffield General Hospital. Scottishschemes include a new hospital at Fort William, a second major extension to the Victoria Hospital at Kirkcaldy, a new out-patient department forthe Victoria Infirmary at Glasgow and the development of the teachinghospital at Maryfield, Dundee.Other Central Government Investment  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62Agriculture and fishing       .........	1-4	1-5	2-3	1-8Forestry Commission............	2-7	2-7	2-9	3-1Government buildings        .........	9-8	9-6	11-1	12-5Factory building       ............	1-5	5-5	9-0	140Civil airport services (Ministry of Aviation)	3-6	3-3	5-5	7-8Ministry of Aviation research and develop-	]      r			ment.........      ...      ......

Almost all this investment is financed from the appropriate depart-mental Votes.76. The investment in agriculture and fishing is iby the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (Class VIII, Votes 3 and 5), and theDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (Class VIII, Votes 11and 12), and includes the Agricultural Land Commission, National Stud,fishing research vessels, etc.
77. The Forestry Commission^ investment expenditure is mainly onconstruction of forest roads (Class VIII., Vote 11).78. Current projects in the Government buildings programme are detailedin the Ministry of Works Estimates (Class VII, Votes 2, 3, 5 and 6); they include the new Meteorological Office at Bracknell, enlargement of the science Museum in London, and work on the reconstruction of Nos. 10,11 and 12 Downing Street and the old Treasury building.79. Factory building is expenditure by the Board of Trade (Class VI,Vote 4) on land and buildings in 1958/59 and 1959/60 under the Distributionof Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and in 1960/61 and 1961/62 under theLocal Employment Act, 1960. The figures for 1960/61 and 1961/62 include provision for land and buildings for the motor industry projects at Bathgatein Scotland and on Merseyside.80. The largest single projects in the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s expenditureon civil airport services in 1961/62 (Class VI, Vote 10) will be at london airport on the new long-haul building and at Prestwiek on extending the runway to take large jet aircraft and a new terminal building. The Ministry&apos;sresearch and development expenditure (Class VI, Vote 9) covers both theMinistry&apos;s own establishments, e.g. Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farn-borough, and agency factories.81. The War Office expenditure (Army Votes 7 and 8) covers royal ordnance Factories, vehicles, certain research and development capitalexpenditure, etc.82. Expenditure on Services married quarters is rising in accordance withplans outlined in successive defence white papers. Married quarters forwhich civilian tenants could without difficulty be found if they were nolonger required for the Services are financed by Exchequer loans underthe Armed Forces (Housing Loans) Acts, 1949 and 1958. Quarters whichbecause of their location would toe unlikely to find civilian tenants insuch circumstances are financed from Votes (Admiralty Vote 10, War OfficeVote 8 and Air Ministry Vote 8). The figures include houses built on an agency basis toy the Air Ministry for the United States Air Force.83. Expenditure on harbours toy the Ministry of Transport (Class IX,Vote 3) concerns the provision of emergency facilities at various ports and capital expenditure at Faslane Port in Scotland.84. Oil storage and distribution expenditure is by the Ministry of Power(Class IX, Vote 5) for emergency facilities.85. Expenditure on prisons is financed from the Home Office and theScottish Home Department Prisons Votes (Class HI, Votes 4 and 16). TheGovernments plans for penal reform, including new building andmodernising of old prisons, were set out in the white paper on penal practice in a changing society, presented to Parliament in February 1959 (Cmnd.645). The programme includes new prisons and borstals of both maximumsecurity and open type, detention centres and wholly new types of establish-ments such as remand centres and regional observation prisons, and apsychiatric establishment. It also includes some 3,000 new or improvedquarters for prison staff.
86. Expenditure by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research(Class IX, Vote 8) is on capital equipment, etc., for the Departments ownestablishments and capital grants to universities and others.87. Investment by the Stationery Office (Class VII, Vote 9) is mainly in office machinery for Government establishments;. the higher level ofexpenditure in 1960/61 and 1961/62 provides for increasing mechanisation,including the use of computers.Other Investment by Public Corporations, Local Authorities, etc.  million	1958/59	1959/60	1960/61	1961/62Public Corporations				British Broadcasting Corporation	4-5	4-4	5-7	5-5Independent Television Authority	0-5	0-7	1-7	2- new towns (excluding housing, water				and sewerage)				England and Wales.........	7-1	7-2	7-0	6- scotland     ............	0-8	0-8	1-7	1-8Local Authorities, etc.				Great Britain				Road passenger transport      ......	6-1	4-7	4-8	4-5Car parks...............	0-8	10	2 0	2 0Municipal airports      .........	0-4	0-7	2-0	2-0England and Wales				Unclassified roads and road lighting ...	8-0	9-6	7-1	7-0Police and fire services.........	5-4	4-9	6-8	9-expenditure under Town and Country				Planning Acts............	6-9	9-2	14-3	12-7Agriculture, fishing, sea defence	8-8	10-3	11-6	13-3Docks and harbours    .........	0-3	0-9	1-8	1-general services............	23-9	31-0	32-2	35- scotland				Unclassified roads and road lighting ...	2-6	2-8	2-7	2-7Police and fire services.........	0-9	1-3	1-4	1-4Expenditure under Town and Country				Planning (Scotland) Acts     ......	neg.	0-2	0-7	0-7Fisheries, coast protection, etc.	0-5	0-6	0-6	0-general services............	1-6	2-3	3-8	4-0Total      .........	79-1	92-6	107-9	113-288. Investment by the British Broadcasting Corporation is financed fromthe Broadcasting Vote (Class IV, Vote 13); the great majority is for the in-ternaj services, for which the amount of the Vote is related to licence revenue.It consists chiefly of the extension of very high frequency sound coverageto new areas, the enlargement of Broadcasting House in London, and theextension of television coverage to new areas and improvement of receptionelsewhere. Investment by the Independent Television Authority is financed from the Authority^ internal resources ; it has the object of extendingcoverage to new areas. From 1959-60 onwards the B.B.C. and I.T.A.figures include the cost of work undertaken by the Post Office for theprovision of television links.89. The expenditure on new towns shown here is that by new townsdevelopment corporations on factories, offices, shops, etc. ; houses, water
and sewerage in new towns are included in the main programmes underthese headings. Expenditure is financed by borrowing from the Exchequerunder the New Towns Act, 1946.90. Investment shown under local authorities, etc. is carried out by localauthorities, river boards, harbour boards, etc. and is primarily a matter forthese bodies. In a few cases there is a specific Government grant or account is taken of local authorities&apos; expenditure in assessing the general grant, butfor the most part this investment is financed from internal resources or by borrowing, which is subject to the machinery described in paragraph 12.91. Expenditure on road passenger transport is mainly for vehicles for localauthority bus fleets.92. About half the expenditure on municipal airports in 1960/61 and1961/62 is for Manchester and Birmingham; the main items at both theseairports are extensions to the terminal buildings to handle the rapidly in-creasing numbers of passengers and runway extensions to enable larger air-craft to be used.93. The expenditure shown here on unclassified roads and road lightingis in addition to that on roads within the road programme (see paragraph43); the lighting is on non-trunk roads.94. Expenditure on the police service two-thirds of the total for police and fire services in 1961/62 has in recent years been mainly on policehousing ; this will continue, and in addition an increasing amount is to be spent on new police stations and on modernising old ones. Expenditure on fire services is also increasing; it is mainly on rebuilding and re-sitingexisting fire stations and providing new ones in accordance with shifts of population.95. Expenditure under the Town and Country Planning Acts is for re-building areas of extensive war damage and other re-development of blightedareas; most of it is for the acquisition, clearance and preliminary develop-ment of land.96. Investment in agriculture, fishing and sea defences includes expenditureon small holdings and allotments, rural roads, cattle markets, slaughterhouses,arterial drainage, work by drainage authorities to prevent flooding by thesea and work by local authorities to prevent erosion of coasts. The provisionfor slaughterhouses is mainly in consequence of the Slaughterhouses Act,1958. Expenditure on arterial drainage, which accounts for more than halfthe total shown, is increasing, mainly because more large schemes are being undertaken by river boards, internal drainage boards and by county councils in the London area.97. General services include erection of town halls and office buildings,libraries, swimming baths and other recreational facilities, vehicles and equip-ment for refuse collection and street cleaning, burial grounds and crematoria.Expenditure on children&apos;^ homes, approved schools, remand homes, courtbuildings, the probation service, civil defence and other services not sepa-rately listed is also included under this item. The Scottish figures also include some factory building by local authorities, mainly in areas takingindustry and population from Glasgow. This is in addition to the factory building by the Board of Trade referred to in paragraph 79.
APPENDIX INotes on Definitions1. This white paper is concerned with public gross fixed capital formation in GreatBritain. Except that sales of land and fixed assets are not deducted, the definition of gross fixed capital formation is the same as that used in the National Income BlueBook, as explained in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods, published by H.M. Stationery Office. It comprises expenditure on replacement of, and additions and major improvements to, fixed capital assets located in Great Britain.Fixed assets are land, buildings, civil engineering works (e.g., roads, reservoirs,drainage works, etc.), vehicles, ships and aircraft, plant and machinery. The word&quot; fixed &quot; denotes the exclusion of changes in stocks (if any), and &quot; gross &quot; that no allowance is made for depreciation. Ships and aircraft, wherever based, are includedif owned by public authorities in Great Britain.2. The figures for individual programmes are for the accounting years of theauthorities concerned. Most use the financial year (1st April-31st March), but theSouth of Scotland Electricity Board, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Boardand the British Transport Commission work on calendar years. The National coal board has an accounting year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31st December,but the figures for the Board in this white paper are for financial years. In the tableon page 10 a timing adjustment is included to produce the grand total for financial years.3. As in the Economic Survey, the figures for public gross fixed capital formationin this white paper (except Appendix II, where the figures are taken from the national income Blue Book) exclude capital formation in Northern Ireland and by the ironand steel companies still in public ownership, and include capital formation by privatebodies financed from public funds e.g. by the University Grants Committee. In the blue Books, the figures for the public sector include Northern Ireland and these ironand steel companies, and exclude private capital formation financed from public funds, and the figures are for calendar years.4. The white paper follows the Blue Books in excluding from public investmentnearly all expenditure on buildings and equipment for the Armed Forces (which isregarded as central Government current expenditure), while including married quarters and land for the Services. Land, buildings and equipment for civil defence,and expenditure by public authorities on buildings and plant for research on, anddevelopment and manufacture of, arms and equipment for the Forces and civil defence are included, but expenditure on Admiralty dockyards and research estab-lishments is excluded.5. Since the Economic Survey 1960 certain revisions have been made in the definition of expenditure to be included in certain programmes, notably the education programme.All the figures in the white paper are on the revised basis and therefore differ fromthose in the Economic Survey 1960. These changes in statistical classification do not reflect any variation in the work done. Other changes are mentioned in this white paper.6. The following table shows the adjustments necessary to convert the totals for public fixed capital formation in this white paper to the Blue Book basis: Total public gross fixed capital formation on white paper classificationconverted to National Income Blue Book basis (totals for financial years at current prices)  million	1958/59	1959/60White paper total (as in table on page 00) ...	1,471	1,618Add: Northern Ireland       .........	34	34Deduct: University Grants Committee	-15	-20Other adjustments.....,	-22	- 6Total on Blue Book basis     ......	1,468	1,626
APPENDIX HInvestment and Resources1. The figures in tables A to D below are taken from the National Income andExpenditure Blue Book 1960 and are on a different basis from the figures for financial years on the classification used elsewhere in this white paper. The differences areexplained in Appendix I.2. Table A shows for the last ten years gross fixed capital formation, both public and private, at current prices, as a percentage of the gross national product.3. Table B gives the same information at constant 1954 prices and shows thegrowth of investment in real terms during this period on the basis of an index(1950=100).4. Table C shows public as a percentage of total gross fixed capital formation,and gives a break-down by each main type of asset, showing public as a percentageof total fixed capital formation in each type of asset. Naturally there are variations in the pattern of demand which the different programmes place on resources. Forexample, most capital expenditure by the Post Office is on plant and machinery, bythe air corporations on aircraft. But over half the total of public investment is inbuildings and works and, while the proportion represented by the public sector oftotal investment in buildings and works has declined in recent years, this, too, is stillabout half.5. Table D shows public gross fixed capital formation in each main type of asset as a percentage of total public fixed capital formation, and gives the corresponding per-centages for the private sector.Table a gross fixed capital formation as percentage of gross national product(at current prices)	Gross		Gross fixed capital formation					national						Year	product	Public		Private		Total				(b) as per-		(c) as per-	id)	id) as per-	id)	(b)	centage	(c)	centage		centage			of (a)		of (a)		of (a)	 m.	 m.		 m.		 m.	1950   ...	11,695	820	7-0	913	7-8	1,733	14-81951   ...	12,850	988	7-7	932	7-2	1,920	14-91952   ...	14,005	1,168	8-4	969	6-9	2,137	15-31953   ...	14,951	1,314	8-7	1,078	7-3	2,393	1601954   ...	15,981	1,299	81	1,289	8-1	2,588	16-21955   ...	16,936	1,305	7-7	1,544	91	2,849  ,	16-81956   ...	18,338	1,387	7-6	1,760	9-6	3,147	17-21957   ...	19,392	1,482	7-7	1,927	9-9	3,409	17-61958   ...	20,229	1,481	7-3	2,051	10-2	3,532	17-51959   ...	20,882	1,578	7-6	2,095	10 0	3,673	17-6
