(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 111 COPY NO.12th July, I960CABINETSUPERSONIC AIRLINERMemorandum by the Minister of AviationEarlier this year, the Hawker Siddeley Group and the BristolAircraft Company (the latter now merged into the British aircraft corporation) were given contracts to study the most suitable types of longrange supersonic airliner.2.        Each firm has submitted proposals for an aluminium alloyaircraft with a speed of Mach 2.2, and a steel (or titanium) aircraft witha speed of Mach 2. 7 (the limit at present imposed by the effects of hightemperatures on certain materials).      Both types would be capable ofcarrying 100-120 passengers non-stop from London to New York.3.        In their reports, the British Aircraft Corporation express astrong preference for the Mach 2. 2 aircraft.   The Hawker Siddeley Grouprecommend that design work should proceed on both types and that a decisionbetween them be made later.4.        These reports have been carefully studied in my Department.   Withthe Mach 2. 2 aircraft, the present flight from London to New York of nearlyseven   hours in a Boeing 707 would be cut to just over 3 hours.   AMach 2, 7 aircraft would cut only twenty-five minutes off this time, andwould be much more costly to produce and operate.5. It would seem, therefore, best to go for a Mach 2.2 aircraft,embodying the latest aerodynamic techniques, in which we believe that britain is in the lead.6.        The firms have estimated the cost of development (excludingproving flying) at between  60 millions and  70 millions.   However, littlereliance can be placed on these figures at this stage;  and I think it wouldbe safer to assume that the cost will be not less than  100 millions, spreadover ten years.   The price of each aircraft to the operator would dependon the number produced.   For a total of 50, allowing for completerecoupment of development costs, it might be as high as  5 millions.Even so, the operating cost per passenger, on the North Atlantic route,should make it competitive with subsonic jets.7.        The Americans, on the whole, seem to favour a steel aircraft of the highest practicable speed (i. e. , about Mach 2. 7) based upon theexperience gained in developing their supersonic bomber (the B.70).   Likeus, the French are studying designs for a Mach 2.2 aeroplane, but arethinking of limiting it to medium ranges, which neither we nor the Americansthink would be economic.-1-
CONFIDENTIAL .        191J. W JL8.        Both British aircraft Groups have had preliminary discussions with American and French firms about the possibilities of collaboration;but the reactions have so far been inconclusive.   Further progress seems unlikely until a Government decision is announced, and one or other ofthe British Groups is chosen to carry out the negotiations.9.        It is not necessary for the Government to commit themselves to&quot;going it alone&quot;.   On the other hand, it would be unfortunate to throwaway our technical lead through delay.10.      I therefore recommend that we should choose one aircraft firm and one engine firm, and authorise them to continue their design work ona Mach 2. 2 aircraft (including wind tunnel and other tests) within a maximumexpenditure of  500,000 over a period of 12 months.   This would preserve the momentum and allow design teams to be built up.   Whilst the Governmentwould have to meet a very high proportion of the cost of this project, the firms should be expected to bear some reasonable share of the risks.   Theextent of their willingness to do so should be taken into account in makingour choice.11.        The two chosen British Groups should then resume discussions with firms in America and France.   In the light of the results, we coulddecide whether or not to proceed to the prototype stage.   While seeking to convince the foreign firms concerned of the wisdom of our preference for an aluminium Mach 2. 2 design, we should not rule out the possibilityof our being persuaded to join with the Americans in developing a steelaircraft of higher speed.12.       I invite my colleagues to approve the course of action proposed above.D. S.Ministry of Aviation, W.C.2.11th July, I960- 2-
