ROAD programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have considered a report by officials on the considerations to be taken into account in determining theroad programme for the next 5-10 years in the light of the proposals setout in the memoranda by the Minister of Transport and the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C. (60) 58 and 59).     The Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to these memoranda on 11th April, I960 (C. C. (60) 25thConclusions, Minute 4).2.      The following facts lend perspective to the size of the problem:-(a) We already have the highest density of vehicles per mile of roadin the world;   and the number of vehicles on our roads is likely toincrease from 8jr millions now to 15j millions in 1975.(b) A steady shift from rail to road has resulted in 58 per cent of all goods traffic measured in ton-miles going by road in 1959.(c) Already 35-40 per cent of the total through traffic in England andWales is moving on severely overloaded routes.     If the current expenditure on road programmes were not increased, the mileage ofoverloaded trunk roads would nearly double between I960 and 1970.(d) The Government and local authorities are already spending verylarge sums on investment in roads and railways, meeting railway losses and maintaining roads - a total of nearly  500 millions in 1959-60.3.      Against this background the members of the Economic PolicyCommittee are agreed on certain general propositions: -(a) To combine flexibility with adequate certainty for planning purposes, there should be as a general rule a 5-year programme forroad building, revised and projected annually.(b) Road and rail investment cannot be decided separately.    it follows that on certain parts of the road programme only interimdecisions should be taken until the amount of capital which the Govern-ment will have to provide for investment in the railways is known.(c) The investment programme for transport must be decided in the context of the claims made by public sector investment as a whole.- -C. (60) 115 COPY NO.15th July, I960CABINET
(d) Investment in roads yields a quicker return (in the form of reducedcongestion and fewer accidents) than many other forms of investment .Current programmes and Master Flans4.      The current programme of major improvements in England andWales involves Exchequer expenditure of  65 millions a year.     the master Plan for England and Wales would mean expenditure by theExchequer of  630 millions in the first five years and  870 millions in the second five years.5.      In Scotland  10. 5 millions is being spent by the Exchequer in1960-61 and  8 millions a year is to be spent in the later years of thepresent programme.    The Master Plan for Scotland would meanexpenditure rising to  17 millions in the fifth year, totalling  68 millions in the first five years and  90 millions in the second five years.6.      The considerations affecting decisions on classified roads and onthrough-roads (motorways and trunk roads) are different and they are besttreated separately.Classified Roads in England and Wales7.      Most of the urgent work to be done on these is in towns wherethe road/rail issue, except possibly in London, is less acute.    Thepreparation of urban schemes takes a long time and there is a case for deciding on a programme for five years ahead as a basis for planningby local authorities.     Officials have suggested that the choice liesbetween a total of Exchequer grants over five years of  170 millions (whichis based on proposals put forward by the local authorities themselves) anda total of  150 millions.    Most members of the Economic PolicyCommittee thought that, subject to further consideration in the light ofthe public investment programme as a whole, Government expenditureon these roads should be limited to  150 millions over five years.     TheMinister of Transport reserved his position.Through-roads in England and Wales8.      Here it is necessary to consider what it would be reasonable tosettle now in advance of decisions about future investment in the railways.The Minister of Transport considers that, in order to completesubstantially the five major projects already announced (i. e. ,(a) reconstruction of much of the Great North Road (A.1);  (b) completionof London-Preston motorway and connecting links;   (c) London to theChannel ports, including the Medway motorway;   (d) Birmingham-South Wales;   Birmingham-Bristol;   and (e) London to the Airport andon to the West, including Severn Bridge) and to start on the Yorkshiremotorway, it is necessary to settle now the scale of expenditure for a five-year period.    While he would accept a two-year limit for trunk roads in present circumstances, subject to review next spring when therailway position should be clearer, he considers that a decision onmotorways should cover a period of five years.    In his view, therefore,the Government should decide now for planning purposes to spend-2-
4 9id 185 millions on motorways over five years and  44 millions on trunk roads over the next two years.    Other Ministers consider that, in viewof the uncertainty about railway investment, the programme for allthrough-roads, including motorways, should be decided for only twoyears ahead ( 75 millions for motorways and  44 millions for trunk roads).    This would not prejudice conversion of the two-year programmeinto a five-year programme later.Classified roads in Scotland9.      During the last few years a disproportionate amount of the funds available has had to be devoted to two river crossings (the Forth bridge and Clyde Tunnel).     Taking into account these and other commitments,the Secretary of State for Scotland considers that for planning purposesa programme of Government expenditure of  31 millions on classifiedroads over five years would be reasonable.    The Economic PolicyCommittee did not disagree with this estimate.Through-routes in Scotland10.    The Secretary of State for Scotland considers that the Governmentshould decide for planning purposes to spend  31 millions on through-routes in Scotland over the next five years.     Ke argues that there isneed for increased expenditure on these roads since expenditure hasbeen concentrated in recent years on classified roads, in particular onthe Forth Bridge and the Clyde Tunnel.     I feel that it is questionable whether so rapid a build-up as this - from  3. 5 millions in 1960-61 to 8.5 millions in the fifth year of the programme - is justified and suggest that an increase to  7 millions in the fifth year would be reasonable.     The Secretary of State, while not going as far as my proposal, would be prepared to accept a reduction of  2 millions in thefive-year programme for through-routes if Ministers decide on the loweralternative of  150 millions for classified roads in England and Wales.11.     If Ministers decide to confine authority for expenditure on through-routes in England and Wales to the next two years only, it is necessaryto consider whether a similar arrangement should be made for Scotland.But while expenditure on both through-roads and classified roads inEngland and Wales would be expanding, annual expenditure on Scottishclassified roads would be tending to fall and the substantial expansionof expenditure on through-routes would not show itself until after thefirst two years.    If decisions were limited to two years, the Secretaryof State would wish to announce that the through-route programme wouldcertainly expand in the latter part of the quinquennium.Other points12.    The programmes discussed in this memorandum, even if thelower alternatives were chosen, would impose a heavy burden on thecivil engineering industries.     But these industries say that they are under-employed at present and, since road work is heavily mechanised,the demand for additional labour would be small in relation to cost.Nevertheless, other investment programmes in the public sector makecompeting claims on the civil engineering and materials industries and it would be necessary to keep the total demand on this sectorunder review.-3-
13.    In accordance with views expressed at the Cabinet on 11th April, I960,officials have given preliminary consideration to the arguments for and against the imposition of tolls.    Further enquiries have been set in handand a report will be made to minister rs later.    Immediate decisions arenot required in any case.14. I have not attempted in this memorandum to discuss the relativemerits of financing road building from Exchequer grants or from loans,or the question of increasing the fees for road fund licences.Re commendations15.     (a)   As a general rule, a five-year programme for road build-ing ,. revised and projected annually, is required.Road and rail investment should not be decided separately.Only interim decisions should be taken on certain partsof the road programme until more is known about thefuture level of investment required in the railways.(c) The investment programme for transport must be decided in the light of other claims for investment in the public sector.(d) Subject to (c) above, it is recommended that a decision should be taken for planning purposes to fix government expenditure: -(i)   At  150 millions over five years for classifiedroads in England and Wales.(ii)   For a period of two years only in respect ofthrough roads in England and Wales, amount-ing over the period to  75 millions formotorways and  44 millions for trunk roads.(iii)   At  31 millions over five years for classifiedroads in Scotland.(iv)   For a period of two years only in respect ofthrough-routes in Scotland;   the amount ofGovernment expenditure over five years onthese roads should be limited to  29 millions.The Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State forScotland have reserved their position on these recommendations.16.       I seek the views of my colleagues on the recommendations inparagraph 15(a) to (d) above.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.15th July, I960.(b)(e)
