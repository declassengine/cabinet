Printed for the Cabinet.   October I960c (60) 146 copy no- 5 27th October, I960CABINETPENSIONS AND NATIONAL assistance memorandum by the Lord chancellor on 10th May, 1960, the Cabinet asked the Social Services Committee toconsider what form the next increase in retirement pensions should take, whenit should take place, and the amount of the increase (C.C. (60) 30th Conclusions,Minute 5). The Committee have held several meetings to discuss the somewhatcomplex issues involved and their conclusions are as follows:(a) The next pensions increase should take the customary form of anall-round increase in benefits: it should not provide for extra benefits for older pensioners.(b) The increase should take effect from the date of operation of the newgraduated pensions scheme in April 1961; and for this purposelegislation should be&quot; introduced immediately the new Session opens.(c) The increase should be 7s. 6d. on the present 50s. rate (single) and12s-. 6d. on the 80s. rate (married).2. The Minister of Pensions has taken informal and confidential soundingsof the Chairman of the National Assistance Board from which it appears thatthe Board would in all probability be content with recommending an increaseof 3s. (single) and 5s. (married) in national assistance scale rates to take effect at the same time as the national insurance increase. The Committee consider thatsuch a recommendation, if made, should be accepted.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees with the Committee&apos;s conclusions on both national insurance and national assistance. He wishes it to be noted,however, that he intends very shortly to bring proposals before the Cabinet foran increase of Is. in the national health element in the stamp to take effect atthe same time as the pensions and national assistance increases. This increase would bring the minimum combined insurance and health contributions abovethe present level in April 1961 at a time when the present expectation is thatthe contribution of the lowest paid workers will be reduced. On the other hand,it would of course bring relief to the Exchequer. But we do not consider thatthis proposal need affect a decision to make the increases in national insurance and national assistance proposed in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.4.   We recommend accordingly.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,7th October, 1960.57846
