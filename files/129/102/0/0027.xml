Printed for the Cabinet. July I960C. (60) 127 Copy No.    g 520th July, 1960CABINETNORTH BRITISH LOCOMOTIVE company memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in amplification of my views as expressed in the Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (60) 120) my colleagues may like to have additionalbackground information.2. The North British Locomotive Company is the only firm in Scotland whererailway locomotives are still manufactured. At present it employs nearly 3,000 menin the Glasgow area, where the unemployment rate, even in June, was 3 - 7 per cent,(last winter it reached 4-7 per cent.). The number of unemployed (22,099)represents more than 30 per cent, of the total Scottish unemployed.3. I am advised that if the Company do not receive a further order very soonthere will be an immediate acceleration in the run-down of their labour force. Bythe end of this year 1,500 are likely to be affected and by June 1961, the whole works.4. This loss of employment in itself will be serious but there are additional, andeven graver implications for the Scottish economy. The British transport commission have a railway workshop rationalisation plan in Scotland. until recently there were six main railway workshops in Scotland at which repairs andmaintenance were carried out. The workshops at Inverness and Kilmarnock havenow been closed and I understand that the British Transport Commission intend to concentrate the work of their two Glasgow workshops. In addition, work available at Inverurie in Aberdeenshire has already decreased substantially. the combination of the foregoing with a serious contraction in major repair work atoutstations and open sidings is substantially reducing opportunities of employmentin Scotland for trained manpower.5. Paragraph 8 of the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s paper points out theinevitability of some contraction of the manufacturing capacity of the locomotiveindustry in the fairly near future and doubts whether, when &quot; this squeeze comes &quot;,North British will survive as locomotive producers. I must accept that until recently the management and efficiency of this firm have been unsatisfactory but I am advised that since the present Chairman, Mr. Coughtrie, took over great improvements have been made and that he is convinced that given the necessary breathing spacethe firm will become fully competitive. Should the firm disappear within the next12 months without the possibility of consolidating the reorganisation locomotiveswill provide yet another instance of the entire British production being located inthe South, with all the related economic and political repercussions.6. This would be particularly unfortunate in so much as the sole UnitedKingdom customer is a nationalised industry, as is virtually the case with aircraft and specialised post office equipment, the manufacture of both of which isalso concentrated in the South.7. While recognising the weight of argument against taking the exceptionalstep of authorising the Commission to place a repeat order for 20 locomotives of theexisting type to the value of  .1^ millions as set out in paragraph 5 of the Presidentspaper, I nevertheless feel that, as a matter of long term economic and distributionof industry policy, this action would be fully justified.J. S. M.Scottish Office,18th July, 1960.57368
