The tour was in part a demonstration of British friendship and goodwill (in Argentina I was Her Majesty&apos;s Special Ambassador to the celebrationsmarking the 150th anniversary of independence).

I met and talked with a large number of people, Presidents, Ministers,Editors, business men, radio and television executives and university teachers aswell as Information and British Council Officers.

to develop, to expand, to exploit. Inevitably, one suspects brittleness. Inflationis chronic, though in recent years, a number of Governments has made determinedefforts to bring it under control. Yet it may well be that inflation is the price that must be paid for material progress by countries at this stage of development. side by side with inflation, there are extremes of wealth and poverty. In the great citiesskyscrapers and luxurious dwellings stand within sight of conglomerations ofranchitds and favelas the shacks of squatters. Unless eventually the middleclasses greatly expand, some political turmoil, exploding into violence, seems inevitable. Yet the basic impression remains of expansion, energy and confidence.6. One is compelled to record that there is little evidence that British industryand commerce are alive to the pace of development in Latin America and the opportunities it offers. Time and time again incidents were cited of Britishindifference while the business men of Germany, France, Italy, Japan and theUnited States acted urgently and energetically. Of course the rapid rate ofindustrialisation means a declining market for consumer goods. For capital goodsthere would seem to be a strong market for a long time ahead. Nor could I findon the spot much support for the contention that many orders are lost to Britainthrough inability to offer acceptable credit terms. There is also, it is said, an anxiety to attract British investment into local manufacturing. But there has been butmodest success in comparison with our principal rivals. Although it was wellunderstood that Our overseas investment capacity should have the commonwealth as its first priority, regret remains that we are unable to do more in countries whererising populations and rapidly increasing standards of living are confidently forecast,and where opportunities are likely to be enhanced by the setting up of a latin american Free Trade Area. The Germans, it is pointed out, have had manysimilar problems of recovery and reconstruction but show an altogether livelierinterest both in selling and in investment. It is feared that we shall try to enter the race too late. In my view we need a special effort to stir and stimulate and informBritish industry of the possibilities as well as the hazards.7. It is possible that, taking into account our opportunities elsewhere andthe limitation on our resources, we must inevitably be prepared to have only a smallstake in this expanding continent. But we should be alive to the loss this mayrepresent, not simply in terms of trade and investment, but also in terms of influence. The Latin American continent represents 20 votes in the united nations. Through the Organisation of American States the Latin Americannations have the opportunity to affect United States policies. Some of them maywell become important powers in their own right: certainly this seems likely ofBrazil. We need powerful friends in all the continents and should not neglectSouth America.8. Taking a more negative view, we must be alive to the dangers of Sovietsubversion in Latin America. Cuba is a pointer to the kind of situation the soviet union will try to promote elsewhere particularly perhaps in Venezuela and the adjoining Bolivarian countries. In combating this infiltration the United states is at a disadvantage because of the emotional anti-American sentiment. We donot suffer from this disadvantage and our influence, discreetly applied, could wellbe significant.9. All these are reasons why we should look to strengthening our relationships with the Latin American countries, on the basis of the disposition they already have to friendship with us. No doubt, there must be a strict limit to the economicrelationship. But we can, at least, foster the cultural relationship. During theperiod of post-war stringency, our information and cultural work in Latin Americawas accorded the lowest priority and suffered the savagest of the cuts. To someextent the position has been retrieved and I do not now suggest any sudden and expensive expansion. But I do believe that by modest and carefully appliedstrengthening here and there we can achieve results out of proportion to theadditional effort. Above all, we should encourage the exchange of human beingsbetween this country and the countries of Latin America. In the Annex to thismemorandum I indicate how I believe we should strengthen our effort.C. H.Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,4th July, I960.
ANNEXWORK OF THE OVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES INLATIN AMERICAWe have two basic handicaps, one the absence of a British news agencyservice to Latin American newspapers (with a single exception of a limited service by Reuters to one newspaper in Buenos Aires). The other is the lack of anillustrated magazine to compete with other national magazines, especiallyAmerican.2. But we have advantages. There is the basically friendly attitude to Britain.There are a number of excellent British schools. There are anglophile institutesand associations which are excellent vehicles for British Council activity, except where their effort is too narrowly concentrated on the teaching of English.3. The absence of Reuters represents a gap which cannot be adequately filled by official Press services. However, a special Latin American service is to be instituted within the London Press Service. It will contain a higher proportionof news than is customary in the official services and arrangements are being madefor its speedy transmission. If this service is to be effective, one requirement isspeedy and efficient handling at the posts. This may involve some minorstrengthening of staff and organisation. This ship must not be spoilt for a ha&apos;porthof tar.4. The prospects of a Reuters &quot; come-back &quot; seem remote, so firmly entrenchedare the American agencies and Agence France Presse (A.F.P.). If the limitedexperiment in Buenos Aires proves successful, however, it might be extended toselected newspapers in other Latin American countries. Incidentally Reuters&apos;extreme repugnance to receiving any official subsidy looks less convincing when one hears from editors that they are fully aware of the subsidy arrangements forA.F.P. but do not mind because of the high quality of the A.F.P. service and because, anyhow, they consider themselves perfectly capable of recognisingpropaganda slants when they see them. Also, of course, the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) news bulletins have achieved high prestige and acceptability,although it is well known that the BBCs overseas services are financed by her majesty&apos;s Government.5. A project is on foot to expand the existing magazine run by the BritishTravel and Holidays Association into a high-quality glossy magazine of generalappeal for sale in Latin America. While we found a general welcome for the idea,we found also some scepticism about the ability of a semi-official magazine to compete successfully with the highly professional American magazines. It is clearthat only a first-class production, free from any suspicion of propaganda intent,would have any real chance of success.6. The British Schools are generally impressive and command a high prestigeamong local parents. The influence of these schools can hardly be over-estimated.In the aggregate, thousands of children, drawn mostly from important and influentialfamilies, are receiving their education at schools which are British in character and method and exercise a strong British influence. All experience difficulty in gettingstaff of first-class calibre from Britain, but the British Council gives help inrecruitment which is greatly valued and appreciated. There has also been directfinancial aid in some instances, and one recently-founded school, the Anglo-Colombian School in Bogota, seems to merit a grant to help to ensure its firmestablishment. I propose to discuss with the Foreign Office and the British council the form such direct financial aid should take.7. Before leaving on this tour, I had heard a great deal about the work of&quot; the Culturas &quot; the institutes which are organised and managed for the most partby a combination of local Anglophiles and members of the British community.Especially, I heard praised the work of these institutes in teaching English. in isolation this particular activity did not impress me as having any special value tothe United Kingdom. A great many people in Latin America want to learn Englishin order to acquire an additional qualification for employment by American firms or to be able to understand American movies and read American magazines.Teaching English is extremely profitable. Language schools in great profusion are
doing it, as well as the American institutes. The teaching work of the Britishinstitutes has value to the United Kingdom only to the extent that it is buttressed byBritish cultural activities. Where the institute is linked with separate and adequateBritish Council activity, as well as cultural activities of its own, then the results canbe entirely admirable. Our purpose should be to ensure a separate British Councilidentity and activity linked with the institute rather than absorbed by it. And weshould be wary lest the institute becomes no more than a library and meeting place for the British community. The institutes do, of course, have a claim on our support,and in some instances there might be justification for a financial contribution, orgift of equipment, especially when improved premises are being acquired. But ingeneral the institutes are doing so well from the teaching of English that no strong case exists for help of this kind.8. I have one other general observation. On this tour, as on my two previoustours, an almost unanimous view emerged about the BBC language services. Directshort-wave listening to foreign stations is becoming less and less as the availability of local services increases with strong signals and programmes of strong localappeal (not to mention the widespread introduction of television). Repeatedly v/ewere told that direct listening to the BBC Latin American services is negligibleexcept at times of international crisis when the news bulletins become important.A small number of local stations (out of many hundreds) relay or record andrebroadcast BBC news. Once again we come to the argument for compressingthese short-wave language services into programmes of news and news talks (plusmajor outside broadcasts as the occasion demands), with all other material madeavailable on tapes or records. There is a growing demand for transcription services,programmes on tape made available to local radio stations.9. In regard to the General Overseas Service, all we heard on this tour, ason the earlier tours, pointed to the paramount importance of the news, news talks,and outside broadcasts, with very little interest in supporting programmes. Yethere one qualification must be made. Expatriate Britons in remote communities(as distinct from those living in the cities) probably find pleasure and recreation inthe general programmes, and can listen to these only directly since it cannot beexpected that local stations should use recordings of this peculiarly British kindof material.10. I was struck by the degree to which the work of both Embassy informationsections and the British Council is being hampered by lack of staff at junior grades.Too often one found the Information Officer or British Council Representative tiedto his desk by routine administrative work. By a quite modest strengthening of staff at lower levels it would be possible to achieve a significant increase in activity and effectiveness. I hope there can be an urgent and sympathetic examination of these problems. There also seems undue difficulty in obtaining equipment such astelevision and radio sets for official use.11. In Brazil the staffing problem is rather greater. This vast country, equalin size to continental United States, with a population of 60 millions concentrated in a few centres, cannot adequately be covered by one Information Officer (withan assistant at Sao Paulo) and one British Council Representative (the british council Officer in Sao Paulo is solely concerned with the teaching of English).Strengthened representation is highly desirable at Sao Paulo and additionalrepresentation should be considered for the north (Recife or Belem) and the south(probably at Porto Alegre), as well as Brasilia.12. A special arrangement exists for the five Bolivarian countries, wherelocally-engaged officers in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia work under thegeneral direction of a United Kingdom-based Regional Information Officer inVenezuela. This arrangement works successfully because of the exceptionalpersonality, ability and local knowledge of the Regional Information Officer, and because in general he is fortunate in the quality of the locally-engaged informationstaff at the outlying posts. In Lima there could usefully be a stronger localappointment but for the rest it is largely a matter of some relatively minorstrengthening of staff at lower levels at each post (including Caracas) plus improvedconditions of service for the information officers. It seemed to us that these officersmerit much better conditions than they at present get. The absence of security and of adequate financial return is clearly an anxiety to them and hampers their work. In one instance at least (Colombia) the Information Officer has never been
to England: he should be given an early opportunity of doing so, both for a trainingcourse and to take part in a Central Office of Information tour.13. Wherever I went, I sought to find out in what respect our information and cultural work could be most usefully stepped up, should it prove possible toobtain additional funds. The answer came with almost monotonous regularity.We should try to arrange for more and more people from Latin America doctors,scientists, engineers, journalists, trade unionists, teachers to go to Britain, either for study or for prestige tours, and we should try to expand in parallel theprogramme for taking distinguished British people to Latin America to teach andlecture. It is to this that I would attach the highest priority in additional activity.14. Also urged upon me was the value of &quot; cultural manifestations &quot;, such asthe tour of the London Festival Ballet Company. Indeed, I was able to see this formyself in the performance of the Company at Buenos Aires, and in the othercapitals I heard remarkable testimonies to the lasting impression made by this visit.Because of the language problem, a theatre group might perhaps make lessimpression, but there seemed to be a general feeling that a first-class Britishorchestra would be widely acclaimed. It is to be noted that there seems no lack off first-rate theatres and concert halls. I should perhaps also record that much hurtis caused in Montevideo if tours include Buenos Aires, but not Montevideo, onthe opposite side of the estuary.15. The Universities in Latin America are numerous and the students more active politically than in this country. It is important that we should maintain the closest possible contact with them. In particular, an effort should be made toobtain the secondment of British lecturers and teachers, desirably for periods ofnot less than a term. More presentations of books could usefully be made touniversity libraries and if possible I should like to see generally adopted a suggestion by the British Council representative in Chile that the Council should take over responsibility for a particular section of a university&apos;s library (individualpresentations, while warmly appreciated, almost inevitably become absorbedwithout association with the British Council).16. There is one other respect, simple but important, in which I think wecould establish a rewarding relationship with the universities. It is the custom forstudents in their final year at Latin American universities to organise group tours to europe and /or the United States. The United States and most European countries(especially those behind the Iron Curtain) are only too ready to give practical help tothese groups in arranging a programme and in helping them, not necessarilyfinancially, to get suitable accommodation and facilities for travelling and forattendance at theatres, concert halls, exhibitions, festivals. In the United Kingdom,however, neither the British Council nor the Central Office of Information have authority to take this particular category of visitor under their wing, nor theresources to do so. The upshot is that the groups usually omit Britain from theiritinerary. It should not be difficult or expensive to remedy this deficiency.17. So far as services of material from London are concerned I heard muchpraise and some criticism and these views will be discussed with the Foreign Officeand the Central Office of Information. There is very satisfactory use of televisionmaterial, notably the two weekly programmes, and I hope that it will be possibleto take more and more advantage of the opportunities now offering themselves.18. Finally, one cannot ignore the disappointment that is caused in latin america by the lack of reporting of Latin American affairs in the British Press.At the most there are not more than two or three staff correspondents in thecontinent. It would undoubtedly be a valuable strengthening of our relations withLatin America if our newspapers and broadcasting organisations could be persuaded to demonstrate a greater awareness of Latin America.July 1960.
