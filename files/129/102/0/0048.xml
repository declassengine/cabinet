C. (60) 148 Copy No. jj JJ.12th October, I960 /cabinet national HEALTH SERVICE CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his paper C. (60) 113, my predecessor warned of the very considerable increase in Government expenditure which existing policies would produce nextyear. A considerable proportion of total Government expenditure is accountedfor by the National Health Service. The gross cost of the Service does not showmuch apparent rise between this year and next, but this is because the 1960-61figure is*unduly inflated by back-pay to doctors awarded after the Report ofthe Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration under theChairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington. Over a three to four-year span the costof the Service is seen to be both high absolutely and to be rising fast relatively to thegrowth of our resources. The following table contains the best estimate we have at present of the future cost of this Service:Cost of Health Service Excluding Local authority expenditure  millionsGross Cost    Exchequer Cost1957-58 ............... 641 5111958-59 ............... 687 5151959-60 ............... 744 5631960-61 est............. 830* 6331961-62 est.............. 836 6391962-63 est............. 870 670* Including  25 millions back-pay.History of the National Health Service Contribution2. Up to 1957, lOd. per person was paid from the Insurance Fund to finance the Health Service. In 1957 the health contribution was established by statuteas a separate legal entity; in that year it was doubled to Is. 8d. and further increased in 1958 to 2s. 4d. This was split as to Is. lO^d. to the employee, 5^d.to the employer or 4:1. My predecessor proposed in January of this year thatthe present stamp should be raised by Is. to bring in just under  50 millions ina full year. This proposal was not then found acceptable and a Working party was established to consider ways of financing the Service. If anything ofsignificance comes out of the Working Party it will not take effect quickly.Legislation arising from it could not be effective until 3963 or even later. Myproblem is immediate.Proposal3. I accept that an increase in the contribution will be controversial whatever its size. I therefore think that we must seek a substantial increase of revenue fromthis source. I propose that the contribution should he increased by Is. to 3s. 4d.,to raise nearly  50 millions. I propose further that the increase should be splitas to lOd. from the employee, 2d. from the employer, making 2s. 8^d. and 7^d.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT--,-. .-;-,-Printed for the Cabinet.

respectively in all. I attach importance to this split; every penny more from the employer and less from the employee reduces the net financial advantage to theExchequer hy  2 millions (mainly tax relief on employers&apos; contributions, whichis not allowed on employees&apos; contributions).Legislation and Timing,4. Legislation would be needed for an increase in the contribution. the effective change in the contribution should be from the same date as the changein the insurance contribution, i.e., 1st April; in order to fit that timetable, legislation would need to be completed by Christmas, or very soon afterwards. There wouldseem to be a good case for raising the health contribution in the same Bill as weraise the insurance benefit and contribution, but this will need further consideration.Possible Objections to the Proposal5. (a) It may be objected that 3s. 4d. a week, or  160 millions a year, is too high a proportion of the cost of the Service to be met from non-Exchequer sources.There is no simple yardstick by which it can easily be measured what proportionshould be so covered; but Lord Beveridge proposed 20 per cent., and I would accept that it would be easier to defend the proposal if the total proportion of costcovered by non-Exchequer sources did not rise significantly above this figure. Theincreased stamp and existing charges together would bring in about  190 -millions,or between 22 and 23 per cent, of gross expenditure in 1961-62. Moreover, forthe many who pay little or no income tax, 2s. 8^d. a week, or  7 a year, wouldseem a small price to pay towards a National Health Service free to themselves and their families. And, of course, the retirement pensioner, ithe unemployedman, the sick and those living on very small incomes do not pay it at all.(b) Secondly, it may be objected that this increase would place too great a burden on the lower-paid worker. It is true that credit has been taken on a numberof occasions for the fact that the new insurance scheme reduces the burden onthe lower-paid. But no promise was made that the lower-paid worker would never be asked to pay a bigger contribution than that established at the inceptionof the new insurance scheme; in fact it was pointed out during the passage of theNational Insurance Act, 1959 that, if benefits were increased, the Government ofthe day would have to decide whether to finance them by increasing the basiccontribution. And it remains true that, under the new scheme with existingbenefits, the lower-paid worker will be paying less than he would have done if theold scheme with the same benefits had been continued.Moreover, the total contribution in 1958, after the last increases in insurance and health contributions, was 9s. lid. for the employed man, at which stage it represented 3-9 per cent, of average weekly earnings of  12 13s. Od. By next april, earnings are likely to be about 15 per cent, above the 1958 figure; the newbasic contribution (to pay for a 7s. 6d. benefit increase and taking account of aIs. increase in health contribution) will be 10s. 7d. for the employed man, whichwill be only 3 - 6 per cent, of the probable average earnings at that time.conclusion. The health contribution is a useful and, once legislation has been passed,an easy way of raising money outside the normal fiscal channels.. I also believethat by raising it we would show our determination to keep the burden on thegeneral taxpayer under control, and at the same time to keep inflation in check.7. If the revenue from this source is to he increased next year, as I believe it must, then it is clearly desirable to raise the health contribution in the sameBill as we raise the insurance benefit and contribution. I recommend to mycolleagues that, in the light of the increases in national insurance benefits (and national Assistance) planned for next April, and against the background of mounting Government expenditure, we should seek to reduce the burden on thenormal sources of revenue by raising the health contribution by Is. to 3s. 4d. aweek; and that this increase should be split as to lOd. from the employee and 2d.from the employer, making the contributions 2s. 8^d. and 7^d. respectively in all.S.
