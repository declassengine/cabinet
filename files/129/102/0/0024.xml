(60)124COPY NO,7th September, I960CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 31st August the Economic Policy Committee met toconsider proposals from the National Coal Board for increases in theprice of coal.substantial and growing loss which will be further increased by recentawards on wages and hours by the industry&apos;s arbitration tribunal.In order to meet this situation, the Board recently proposed increases in the price of coal estimated to bring in an additional  61 millions.This would be sufficient to cover its prospective deficit of  51 millions for 1961, with a margin to set against the accumulated deficits of previous years, estimated to reach  88 millions by the end of I960.The price proposals fell into two parts, a general increase of4j per cent or 3s 9d. a ton on the price of all coal, and a series ofadditional special increases for a number of selected coals.   these included an additional 11s. 3d. on domestic and railway coal in Englandand Wales, and an additional 16s. 3d. per ton for domestic and railwaycoal in Scotland.3. At the Economic Policy Committee there was generalagreement about the Board&apos;s need to increase its income by approximately the amount proposed.    There were, however, doubts about the proposedspecial increases in the prices of house coal, railway coal, and scottish and Cumberland coals.4. The National Coal Board accordingly submitted alternative proposals under which the general increase applying to all coals is raised to 7 per cent,   (an average of 5s. lOd. a ton).   The specialincreases for Scottish and Cumberland coals are eliminated, and theother special increases reduced.
