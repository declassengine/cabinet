(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 121 COPY NO.    -f325th July, I960CABINETFISHERY DISPUTE WITH ICELANDMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorAfter the failure of the Geneva Conference in April, the UnitedKingdom fishing industry decided to refrain for three months from fishingwithin twelve miles of Iceland, in the hope that a favourable atmosphere for negotiations would develop.    At the same time, we decided that naval vessels should patrol only outside the twelve mile limit.    In the event, the icelandic Government have been unwilling to enter into negotiations, andthe self-imposed ban on fishing is due to expire on 12th August.    TheCommittee on the Law of the Sea have accordingly been considering what should now be done.2. We are agreed that the next step must be to encourage our fishing industry to enter into direct discussions with the Icelandic fishing industry.The object of these talks would be to obtain a modus vivendi under which our fishing vessels would be allowed for a period of years to fish without interference in certain areas within the twelve mile limit, provided thatinside the twelve mile limit they did not fish outside those areas.    Therepresentatives of the United Kingdom industry would make a sincereeffort to reach agreement, and we hope that there would be goodwill on bothsides.    The United Kingdom side would, however, undoubtedly stress twoconsequences of failure to reach agreement.    These would be, first, an unofficial landings ban on Icelandic fish, which would deprive Iceland of a market of      million a year, and secondly, a request to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to resume naval protection within the twelve mile limit.3. It might improve the prospects of success of these talks if at thetime the United Kingdom delegation go to Iceland, it were made known tothe Icelandic Government through diplomatic channels that they must notassume that the United Kingdom industry would be prepared to extend theirvoluntary ban on fishing after 12th August, and that if inter-industry talkshad not begun or were unsuccessful Her Majesty&apos;s Government would haveto reconsider the whole position, including the possibility of having to resume naval protection within the twelve mile limit.4.        We have to recognise, however, that the Icelandic industry mayrefuse to talk, or that the talks may quickly break down, in which case weshall be faced with a serious situation on 12th August.    It seems     desirableto decide now what we should do in that eventuality.    In theory, therewould be three courses open to us;--1-SECRET
(i)     trawler owners could be asked to extend the present voluntaryban for a further period to give more time for the startingof negotiations;(ii)      the industry could be told that we would not resume protectionwithin twelve miles, and that British trawlers would fishwithin twelve miles in future at their own risk;(iii)      naval protection within twelve miles could be resumed in one form or another.5. In our view, course (i) is impracticable.    The United kingdom industry would certainly not agree to extend the ban unless they were givenfinancial compensation by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    Apart from thefinancial and legislative difficulties which this would raise, it would be tantamount to abandoning our rights within the twelve mile limit.Course (ii) carries the gravest dangers;   some trawler skippers would doubtless fish within the limits without protection, and serious incidentswould occur.    We should also come under very heavy pressure to compensate the industry for their loss of fishing rights by a subsidycosting at least  3 millions a year.6. The Committee therefore conclude (the Foreign Secretary reserving his position) that the best course would be to announce our intentionto resume protection in havens between twelve and six miles for a limited period, say five years, after which we would not object to the exclusion of our vessels.    We could also refrain from fishing in the conservationareas, from which the Icelandic Government exclude even Icelandicvessels.    The announcement would be accompanied by a statementexplaining that, in view of the Icelandic Governmenfs refusal to negotiate,to accept arbitration, or reference to the International Court, we wouldadopt proposals based on the United States/ Canadian formula, which sonearly secured acceptance at Geneva,and taking into account Iceland&apos;special situation, which we have always recognised.    We could alsoemphasise that we would prefer an agreed solution and would still be glad to enter into talks with Iceland.Summary7. The Committee on the Law of the Sea invite the Cabinet toagree:-(a) that the Minister of Agriculture should ask the United Kingdomfishing industry to enter into immediate talks with the icelandic fishing industry on the lines of paragraph 2;(b) that the Icelandic Government should be informed thatthey should not assume that the voluntary ban on fishingwithin twelve miles will continue after 12th August andthat, if inter-industry talks had not begun or were unsuccessful,Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to reconsider the whole position, including the possibilityof having to resume naval protection within the twelvemile limit;-2-
SECRET -        15(c)   that in the event of the Icelandic fishing industry not agreeing to discussions with the United Kingdom industry, or of thediscussions breaking down before 12th August, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should announce their intention to resume naval protection within twelve miles on the lines of paragraph 6.K.House of Lords, 8.W.I.25th July, 1960.-3-
