FOREIGN  MINISTERS&apos;   TALKS  ON  MARSHALL  OFFER y;,;  &apos;  ^Memorandum; by the Secretary op State for Foreign Affairs.&apos;,MY colleagues will be generally aware of the course of the: discussions wittM. Bidault and M:; Molotov-in which I was engaged-in Paris from: 27,th june to 3rd July,: but they will no doubt wish: me to give: them a brief; account of,theproceedings...      .     - i... -, -.-;: ,&apos;,uy,-&apos;.-M&apos;(. .-.iwi;ifn..,ri;y*y(i2.; The object Of the talks was to Organise ^^S^SS^^^M^^^^^if jprfssible, to - the suggestion contained in Mr..&apos; Marshal 1&apos; s. Harva rd speech.M. Mol6toV&apos;s acceptance of the invitatibh&apos;to these talks had aroused.high hopesin France, and indeed throughout Europe, that economic co-operation might help to heal European political divisions as well as assist in the work of economicreconstruction. It was generally recognised therefore that, in addition to their economic importance, the talks would be of great political,sigmfica&quot;nc^e!y&apos;^&apos;::&apos; &apos;3. M. Bidault and myself approached the task before us from essentiallysimilar points of view. We both recognised that the Marshall speech containedless an offer than a challenge-a challenge to Europe to help itself and indicatehow it proposed to put its own house in order as a preliminary to seeking UnitedStates aid. We had no prior understanding but our identity cf view on thisbasic point was complete.4. Our five days&apos; argument with M. Molotov centred entirely round thissingle issue. M. Molotov, whose opening move was to suggest that we should firstask the United States to state the amount, conditions and probability of aid,refused to consider any course except that of presenting the United States witha statement of each country&apos;s requirements. Any other course, he said, wouldmean interference, political and economic, in the internal affairs of the participat-ing countries. He went through the motions of meeting us on drafting points and on matters relating to machinery; but on this central issue, despite every effort to reassure him and meet any reasonable criticisms, he would not budge. Indeedhis attitude seemed to harden as the talks went on. In the latter stages hedefended his own position by attacking what he professed to believe was ours.He said that it was totally impracticable to draw up a European ReconstructionPlan (which we had neVer^u^ that any kind ofco-ordinated economic programme for Europe would mean an infringement ofnational sovereignties and the domination of weak by stronger Powers (a subject on which he enlarged with justifiable authority at one point). At the last meetingof all he had recourse to threats saying that if Britain and France proceededin the manner which had been suggested they would rue the consequences and become responsible for the division of Europe into hostile groupings. Such a gross distortion of the facts was vigorously repudiated by M. Bidault and myself.5. Looking back on those apparently interminable discussions revolvinground a single point, I am confident that our conversations were doomed fromthe start in the sense that there. was never any prospect of getting Sovietcollaboration except on M. Molotov&apos;s unacceptable terms, Moreover, had theRussians decided to come in, even on our terms, the opportunities which theywould have had to delay and obstruct would have been almost unlimited; sothat from a practical point of view it is far better to have them definitely outthan half-heartedly in. That was why I insisted from the outset on thrashing14192   [33868]
out the differences of principle between us and making that the breaking point.Any other tactics might have enabled the Soviet to play the Trojan horse andwreck Europe&apos;s prospects of availing themselves of American assistance. Theymay do their best to mobilise European countries against the French and ourselvesas things are; but at least the gloves are off, and we know where we stand withthem. The Soviet Government itself can never have hoped to be able to getmuch for itself out of the Marshall invitation; and its refusal to undertake a heavy job of work which offered little return is not, on the face of it; unexpected.Less understandable, but more significant, however, was the open hostilitydisplayed towards other countries wishing to take advantage of the opportunity.If the Soviet Government persists in this attitude, European relations will have entered a new phase of tension. .6. I cannot speak too highly of the attitude of M. Bidault and his advisersduring these conversations. Not for one moment did they show any sign ofwavering on the central, issue. What went on in their, Cabinet discussions Ihave no means of judging; but M. Bidault certainly realised, as soon as I did,that any compromise on fundamental principles was impossible. But it can have been no easy task to convince his colleagues of this unpalatable&apos; truth. Inthe middle of the talks the French were threatened with a political crisis, and Ihave little doubt that M. Molotov, with his delegation of 88, was doing his best outside&apos; the conference room to undermine the position of the FrenchGovernment and hence to achieve by political pressure what he could not achieveby negotiation. His concluding threats were^ directed particularly at France,and M. Bidault so interpreted them; but the Jbrench Government remained firm,and I am confident that we can rely on M. Bidault, as long as he remains ForeignMinister, to stand beside us in the work which we have now resolved, to put inhand together. ,     .v;;...,;;I HSfM T^m -   $m&amp;s\i e. b:Foreign Office,, . .5th July, 1947.     &apos;
