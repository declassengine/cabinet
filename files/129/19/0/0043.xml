Printed&apos; for the Cabinet.   July 1947CP. (47) 1933rd July, 1947CABINETELECTORAL legislation memorandum by the Home secretary at their meeting on 6th March (CM. (47) 26th Conclusions, Minute 7) theCabinet approved the appointment; of a committee under my. chairmanship toconsider, in the light of the reports of the Committee on Electoral Registration,the Speaker&apos;s Conference, and the Committee on Electoral Law Reform, what should be the scope and form of any legislation on electoral reform to be introduced in the 1947-48 session.2. We have made considerable headway with our task and although theFinal Report of the Committee on Electoral Law Reform (dealing with technical matters of electoral procedure and voting) has not yet been issued, we have thoughtit desirable to submit for the approval of our colleagues, the conclusions we have so far.reached in order that the drafting of the necessary legislation may be put inhand. C&apos;..^^.. -.&apos;.&apos;&quot;. &apos; . -\: - &apos;3. For convenience we have divided our report into two main sections. Wedeal below with a number of major matters which are complex and in some casesraise important political issues, and in the Annex to this memorandum will befound the other unanimous recommendations Contained in the three Reports;showing separately those which we accept and that which we reject.The Business Premises Franchise4. ;We are agreed that the business premises qualification for the Parlia-mentary vote should be abolished.A decision to abolish the qualification, however, involves consideration of thespecial position of the City of London constituency. This constituency is excludedfrom the scope of the parliamentary boundary commission by the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944, which provides that the questionwhether this constituency shall for the future return two members or one member shall be determined in the Bill required to give effect to the recommendations of the boundary Commission. If this constituency were to remain and the business premises qualification is to be universally abolished the City electorate would,on the most recent figures, be reduced to 4,585 voters, since the present total of12;503 contains 7,918 persons possessing a business premises qualification.The Representation of the People Bill, 1931, provided that the business premises qualification should be specially retained in the City of London, butthat at a General Election no person should exercise more than one vote (atpresent no voter may at a General Election exercise more than one business premises or university vote). In Committee an amendment to the relevant clausewhich would have abolished the business premises vote in the City was rejectedon a free vote by 283 votes to 206, most of the Labour members voting for theamendment which was, however, opposed by members of the Government withConservative and Liberal support.It wjould be difficult to justify the retention of the City of London as a constituency even if the business premises qualification be retained there: Wecan see no logical grounds for the retention in the City of: London alone of this qualification which would involve granting a privilege, e:g., to a solicitor or stockbroker, merely because he carried on business in the City ipi London instead ofin some other area, and we recommend that the City of London constituencyshould be abolished,[33850] B252SECRET Copy No.     31
5. We do not consider that abolition of the business premises vote entailsabolition of the local government vote in respect of premises for which a person is not in pcssesion of the parliamentary vote. The parliamentary vote nowautomatically carries the local government vote, but a person in possession ofthe parliamentary vote in respect of his residence may, in addition, claim to be registered in the Ratepayers Register as a local government elector in respect ofthe occupation, or, in Scotland, the ownership, of premises in another area. Thereason for giving such a person a second vote, is, of course, the fact that he is directly concerned as a ratepayer with the local government administration of thearea, even though he does not normally reside there. &apos;;University Representation6. Resolution 26 of the Interim Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference proposes that the existing University representation and methods of election should beretained and that every person who has received or receives a degree (or its equivalent) should be automatically registered without payment of a fee.We do not consider that there is any justification in modern conditions forthe award of the privilege of a Second vote based on the possession of an academicdistinction and we recommend that University representation should be abolished.Extension of the Franchise to Government Officials Serving Abroad7. Apart from special war time legislation* and special provisions for theServices, the legal position is broadly that a person who leaves the UnitedKingdom ceases to be entitled to a vote.. The Committee on Electoral Registration assume that thi$ pririciple will be substantially maintained, but they suggest (paragraph 44) that if any exceptionis to be made it should be confined to members of the Control Commission for germany and Austria on the ground that these persons have a claim to special consideration as being employed alongside the Services on work arising out of thewar. Representations have, however, been made for the enfranchisement ofmembers of the Foreign Service serving abroad and in a reservation to the Reportof the Committee on Electoral Reform it is suggested that all Government servantsabroad Who are paid by the Treasury should be given votes.It seems to us that it would be impossible to confine any exception to thegeneral principle to members of the Control Commission for Germany and austria and/or the Foreign Service. If these were admitted claims might be made inrespect of all classes of Crown servants serving abroad and later the claims ofwives, adult children and servants might be urged. Moreover, if a concessionwere made in favour of all or oven., some of these classes it would be difficult to withhold it from members of commercial firms sent abroad and by degrees the geographical foundation of the franchise might be seriously impaired.We recommend, therefore, that apart from members of the Services theprinciple should be maintained that an individual who ceases to be resident 5nthe United Kingdom loses his vote.&quot;-Electoral Registration Arrangements(a) Reversion to a Canvass :;. &quot;.&apos;      ,8. The Committee on Electoral Registration recommend that the present procedure whereby electoral registration depends on the address for which aperson is registered in the National Register on the qualifying date should bereplaced by a reversion to the pre-war system which was based on a canvass andthe Use of registration forms - -i There can be no doubt that the present system is not generally popular.Indeed the County Councils Association, the Association of municipal corporations and the Incorporated Association of Rating and Valuation Officers---the representative Association of officers who Would be concerned with a canvassin England and Wales-have all gone on record as advocating the earliest possiblereturn to a canvass. i -On the other&apos; hand it Was suggested in the course of our discussions thatthere are advantages from the point of view of administration in retaining thepresent system, at least as long as National Registration is continued for other* Section ll of the Parliamentary Electors (War-Time Registration) Act, 1943.
purposes; we do not feel, however, that legislation should be based on an assump-tion that National Registration will continue for a considerable: time to come and we support the recommendation that there should be a reversion to thecanvass. . &apos;   . &apos;r r On the question of the practicability of reverting to a canvass, from the pointof view of staff j we have been informed that there is no evidence in the HomeOffice or in the Scottish Home Department that electoral registration officers would find difficulty in obtaining staff to conduct a canvass, nor was any such evidence available to the Committee on Electoral Registration on which english and Scottish registration officers were represented.(b) Compilation of RegisterThe Committee on Electoral Registration recommend that in order that, onpublication, a register may be as closely up-to-date as possible, there should beho qualifying period of residence, a. person being registered for the address atwhich he is normally resident on the qualifying date (paragraph 13).The abolition of any qualifying period of residence is ah essentialconcomitant to the publication of an up-to-date register. The effect of a quali-fying period is to secure the disfranchisement of persons who have during thatperiod removed to some other part of the country. Sincer 1918 the length of a qualifying period has gradually been whittled down, and there would appearto be no grounds on which objection can be taken to its total disappearance.A reservation signed by three Members of the Electoral Registration Com-mittee advocates&apos; the retention of a qualifying period of three months as regardsthe qualification to vote in Northern Ireland at elections for the Imperial Parlia-ment. It is contended that movement over the Eire border raises special con-siderations and that it would be difficult to test eligibility for registration if the qualification were to depend on residence on a specific date. It is also pointedout that before the war the qualifying period was six months in Northern Irelandwhile only three months in Great Britain;While it can perhaps be conceded that there are special factors operative inNorthern Ireland, we do not consider that they are of sufficient force to justify thecreation of the anomalous position whereby a more restricted franchise would obtain in Northern Ireland.(c) Claims and ObjectionsThe Committee on Electoral Registration recommend that the procedure fordealing with claims and objections should be abbreviated (paragraph 14).We are satisfied that a procedure on the lines recommended by the Committeeis essential if the period between a qualifying date and the publication of a register is to be kept within reasonable proportions. The proposal tp dispense with formal hearings will not deprive a. person of the right to make writtenrepresentations nor will it prevent Party Agents being in attendance on considera-tion of claims and objections.(d) Should there be two registers a year?The Committee on Electoral Registration recommend that a register shouldbe published twice a year, on 1st October and 15th March (paragraphs 16 and 17).The recommendation that there should be two registers a year would, if imple-mented, result in a return to the state of things in the period 1918-26, in whichyear the Spring register was abolished as part of the economy cuts. &apos;While there is much to be said on grounds of economy of man-power and money in favour of the compilation of only one register a year, we feel that theconsideration that registration should be up-to-date is overwhelming.In a reservation some members of the Committee on Electoral Registrationrecommend that there should be only one register a year in Northern Ireland.We recognise that the case for only one register a year in Northern Ireland isstrengthened by the consideration that separate registers are in force for NorthernIreland parliamentary and local elections. Nevertheless We feel that it is very desirable that as far as possible the arrangements in Northern Ireland should conform with those in Great Britain and&apos;we recommend that the reservationshould not. be accepted;The Committee1 on Electoral Registration make a number Of detailed recom-mendations in paragraphs 22 to 28 of their report on the operation of theprocedure in Northern Ireland and we agree that these should be implemented.[33850] ^ &apos; &apos; b 2
Dates of Local Elections: 9. If there are to be two registers a year it will be necessary to review the dates for such local elections as are now held in the Autumn, i.e., Municipal and metropolitan Borough Council and all Scottish local elections. The Associationof Municipal Corporations are in favour of a Spring date for municipal electionsas are also the majority of local government: authorities in Scotland.We agree that all local elections should be held in the Spring, and discussions on the subject are now in progress With representative Local Governmentassociations.The Registration of Service Voters10. The recommendations of the Committee on Electoral Registration, whichare designed to ensure that every person who will be serving with the Forces atthe age of 21 will be in a position.to exercise his vote, involve the issue of a formof: declaration (a) to entrants on regular engagements at the time they join theForces, and (&amp;) to the relatively small number of National Service men who willbe serving at the age of 21, when they attain the age of 201. (Paragraphs 30 to 34.)It is, of course, essential to obtain from each individual information as to the address at which he would be residing but for his service and the name of theperson he desires to appoint as his proxy, and we accept the detailed recommenda-tions of the Committee on the procedure to be followed.In view of the unfortunate experience of Service voting arrangements at thegeneral election of 1945, however, we have given careful consideration to themeans for ensuring that the Service authorities, particularly commanding officers,fully understand their responsibilities in the matter of providing facilities for registration and do not treat their duties lightly.We were attracted by a suggestion that the Bill should impose a duty onthe appropriate service authority to provide facilities to the men concerned andto make an omission a civil offence triable by a civil court, but we were informedthat where a statutory duty in relation to a civil obligation is placed upon theService authorities the usual course is to impose it on the Admiralty, the ArmyCouncil and the Air Council, who are required to make the necessary arrange-ments, any breach by subordinate officers being dealt with as a matter of discipline.It is pointed out in support of this course that if an obligation is expresslyimposed by Statute, in a matter of this kind, on particular serving officers,difficulties arise not drily in defining the class of individuals on whom theresponsibility rests,, but also in framing charges, applying sanctions for non-observance and dealing with officers who may be serving overseas.In the light of these considerations we agree that the matter should be dealtwith by Service Regulations, enforceable as a matter of discipline, but we would urge that the Service Ministers should issue emphatic instructions to ensure thatcommanding officers are left in no doubt about their responsibilities in the matteror about the seriousness with which any omission or negligence on their part willbe regarded.Postal and Proxy Voting11.-(a) Civilians. The Committee on Electoral Registration recommend :-(i) that all the existing categories of absent voters should be retained, andthat in order to remove doubt about their eligibility under the existing law legislation should specifically provide that candidates at parlia-mentary elections (but not their wives) should be eligible to vote asabsent voters (paragraphs 46 to 48);(ii) that as far as practicable civilian absent voting should be permitted at. local elections; in respect of the same categories of person as areentitled to such facilities at parliamentary elections, except candidates for Parliament and persons who have given up residence in the area in which they have a local government vote (paragraph 52).; A reservation to the Report of the Committee on Electoral Regis-tration proposes that postal and proxy voting facilities at localgovernment elections should be extended to persons registered asowners in Scotland who reside in another local government area (i.e.,another county or burgh)-and also to the absentee occupier of business premises in England as well as in Scotland.
......We agree with the recommendations in (i) above but as regards (ii) weconsider that it would impose a totally disproportionate administrative burdenif postal voting facilities were provided at parish council elections in England andWales, and, since the Rural District Councils Association are of opinion that facilities for postal voting in Rural District Council elections are unnecessary,we think that postal voting facilities should be limited to county council,municipal and urban district council elections in England and Wales and toW country, town and district council elections in Scotland. These facilities shouldalso be given to absentee occupiers.As regards absentee owners of premises in Scotland, however, while it istrue that the system of levying rates on the landlord in Scotland gives him adirect interest in the administration (of the area we do not feel that this justifiesexceptional treatment for such persons and we do not recommend that postal andproxy voting facilities should be extended to absentee owners in Scotland.(b) Service voters.- We accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations as regardsproxy voting and voting in person or by post in the United Kingdom.As regards postal voting overseas, at the general election in 1945 postal votingwas in operation virtually everywhere except in the Far East. This meant thatthe count could, not take place until twenty days after the polling date, and weare informed that facilities are not likely to improve in future.We attach great importance to retaining the ppwer of holding a - GeneralElection in as short a period as possible, if the need should arise, and to thedeclaration of the result of an election as soon as possible after the close of voting.Moreover,-in peace-time there will be relatively few service men of voting ageserving overseas and in view, of the facilities which exist for voting by proxy wedo not think that on balance facilities need be given for postal voting by the&apos;Services overseas.J.

Recommendations Accepted by the Committee on Electoral Legislation(a) The registration of seamenThe Committee on Electoral Registration recommend that the registration of seamen should be effected by means of the canvass rather than by arrangementssimilar to those for the registration of members of the Forces (paragraph 42). ;&apos; They also recommend that when the canvass form shows that a.person is aseaman, the Registration Officer should send him a notification of his right toappoint a proxy and a proxy appointment form.(b) Legal maximum scale of candidates&apos; expenses -Resolution 1 of the Final Report of the Speakers Conference proposes thatthe legal maximum of expenses should be a basic figure of  450 with an additional allowance of l%d: for each elector in a county constituency and a id. for eachelector in a borough constituency. &apos;(c) A gent&apos;s Fees rResolution 2 of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference proposes thatthe whole of the fees payable to agents should be included in the legalpermitted maximum of election expenses.1 This point has also been considered in informal discussions with members ofthe Speakers Conference and Party Agents and there is general agreement infavour of the recommendation.(d) Expenses incurred by party organisations or by individuals other than theY candidate.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended amendment of Section 34 of the representation of the People Act, 1918 so that the-prohibition on an unauthorised
person^ would, not be limited to expenses incurred by holding meetings, issuingadvertisements, &amp;c, for the purpose of promoting a candidature. &apos;The-Committee on Electoral Law Reform suggest that this might be achieved by a provision on the lines of Section 34 (1) of the Act of 1918 but omitting the limiting clause.  The section as revised would read as follows&quot;A person other than the election agent of a candidate shall not incurany expenses [on acount of holding public meetings, or issuing advertise-^&apos; ments, circulars or publications^ for the purpose of promoting or.procuringthe election pf any candidate at a parliamentary election unless he is authorised in writing to do so by such election agent.&quot;The Committee on Electoral Law Reform make suggestions for a procedure for a declaration of all expenses incurred, which they propose should be trans-mitted to the Clerks of the Crown in Chancery, and in Ireland to the Clerk of theCrown for Northern Ireland, ,(e) Relief in respect of venial errorsThe Speaker&apos;s Conference (Resolution 6 of the Final Report) recommendedthat relief in respect of inadvertent or venial errors in returns of expenses shouldbe sought through a County Court, with a corresponding provision being effective in respect of Scotland. The Committee on Electoral Law Reform (paragraph 2$of the Interim Report) while admitting the practicability of the speakers conference recommendation, preferred that the jurisdiction of the High court should not be &quot;completely ousted and suggested that in respect of the venial errorslisted in paragraph 26 of their Interim Report, relief should be available fromthe Acting Returning Officers rather than the County Court in England, and fromthe Returning Officers in Scotland subject to a right of appeal to the High court and the Court of Session respectively.Subject to. the views of the Lord Chancellor, we consider that the most convenient course would be to permit relief to be sought through a County Court.Comparable arrangements would be sought in Scotland.(f) Issue of Poll cards by Returning OfficersResolution 4 of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference proposes thatPoll cards should be issued to electors by the Returning Officer at public cost, inadequate time before an election, and that no other poll cards should be issuedprovided no restrictions are placed on candidates communicating the information given in poll cards otherwise than in the actual form of a poll card.(g) Use of schools and halls for election meetingsIt is proposed (Resolution 7 of the Final Report.of the Speaker&apos;s Conferenceand paragraph 19 of the Interim Report of the Committee on electoral reform):     &apos; 1  &apos; .&apos;&apos;-*&apos;       .(i) That halls normally used for letting and maintained from public funds should be made available for engagement by candidates at reasonabletimes, subject to any bom fide contract previously entered into by theauthority controlling the hall-       , -(ii) A candidate should be able to get from the Returning Officer a list of schools and halls available for his use in his constituency, and in thecase of schools the local Education Authorities should book them for him.(iii) The statutory use of schools or halls should be at reasonable tijne$ during a period not exceeding three weeks before polling day. ;(iy) The prescribed maximum charges both for schools and for halls should,;     &apos;(    in addition to covering the actual cost of lighting, cleaning andheating, include an item to cover the cost of the hire of caretakers inthe case of schools, and of the usual attendants in the case of halls.(h) Acceptance oj\ deposit by Returning OfficerResolution 12 of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference proposes thatit should be made lawful for the deposit to be received by the Returning Officerat any time between the issue of the writ and nomination day and that it should be payable either by cash or by banker&apos;s draft drawn by a reputable bank.
(i) Acceptance of nomination papers by Returning Officer  *Resolution 13.of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference proposes thatit should be made lawful for nomination papers to be lodged with the returning officer at any time between the issue of the writ and nomination day.(j) Hours of PollingResolutions 15 and 16 of the Final Report of the Speakers Conferencepropose that 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. should be the fixed hours of polling throughout theUnited Kingdom and there should be no local variations.(k) Prohibition of Broadcasting from a Foreign StationThe Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended (Resolution 18) that it should bemade an offence for any British subject to promote or to aid in promoting anybroadcast affecting Parliamentary elections from wireless stations outside theUnited Kingdom. The Committee on Electoral Law Reform (paragraph 29-33of the Interim Report) pointed out that there would be a number of difficultiesin formulating and enforcing a wide prohibition of this kind and recommendedthat if legislation were to be undertaken the most appropriate method would beto make it an offence for (i) any British subject to broadcast from a foreign station any matter with intent to influence the manner in which persons in this country shallvote at any election (Parliamentary or local government);(ii) any person (whether British subject or alien) or any organisation in thiscountry to procure or attempt to procure any person abroad to use aforeign station for such a purpose.We see great difficulty in enforcing legislation on these lines.,. On the otherhand, it is desirable that the subject should be covered by legislation and, since thedeclaration of the illegality of the transmission in question would strengthen thehands of the General Post Office in dealing with infringements involving the useof telecommunications facilities in this country, we agree that a clause on theselines should be included in the Bill.Note: We have not yet completed consideration of the following two recom-mendations: Speaker&apos; expensesThe Speaker&apos;s Conference (Resolution 4) recommended the payment ofspeakers&apos; expenses, such expenses being included in the candidate&apos;s return of expenses. The Committee on Electoral Law Reform (paragraph 24 of InterimReport) considered that, if in order to prevent evasion of the law, payments tospeakers are authorised expenditure, they should be included under a separateheading in the election return of expenses, but not all members of that Committeewere agreed as to the desirability of coming to any decision on this point pendingthe general review of the law of corrupt and illegal practises on which theCommittee will make its final report. The Chief Whip is making some inquiriesand the results of these will be considered by the Committee.Increased polling facilities in rural areasResolution 14 of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and para-graphs 34-48 of the Interim Report of the Committee on Electoral Law Reformpropose that increased polling facilities^ in rural areas should be provided by administrative action, but that certain minor subsidiary points, e.g., a variation of the definition of &quot; polling place &quot;to cover the locality in which voters are to vote, might be covered by legislation.   We will report further on this.Recommendation rejected by the Committee on Electoral LegislationRefund of DepositResolutions 10 and 11 of the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference pro-poses that where there are more than three candidates (or in the case of a doublemember constituency, more than six candidates) the deposit should be returned ifa candidate polls l/10th of the votes cast.We think that a provision on these lines would tend to encourage the appear-ance of freak candidates and we do hot recommend its acceptance.
