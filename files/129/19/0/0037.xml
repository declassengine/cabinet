Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1947ciRcauTec../.j&amp;..;...At..secret copy No.   9CP. (47) 18728th June, 1947CABINET:MALAYAN policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 5th December, 1946, my colleagues gave their provisional approval(CM. (46) 103rd Conclusions), to certain revised proposals (CP. (46) 439) for anew Malayan Constitution, on &quot;Federal&quot; lines, which had resulted from thediscussions of a local Working Committee representing the Malayan UnionGovernment, the Malay Rulers and the principal Malay Political group (theUnited Malays National Organisation).2. In conveying this provisional approval to the Governor of the MalayanUnion, I made it&apos;clear that there was no question of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentgiving their final approval to any proposals along these lines until all interestedcommunities in the peninsula had been given full and free opportunity to express their views. Accordingly, in December 1946, the Governor appointed a. Cqnsul-tative Committee composed mainly of influential representatives of the non-Malaycommunities, which was instructed to hold meetings throughout the peninsula, toreceive oral and written representations, to collate the evidence submitted to it,and to report the substance of this evidence to him with such comments and recom-mendations as they should think fit.;3. After a series of meetings in various centres, the Consultative committee presented its report to the Governor at the end of March 1947. It was not to beexpected that the Federation proposals would escape, all criticism, and in factthere sprang up from the outset a small but vocal section of opinion which rejected the proposals outright and which refused even to lay its views before the Consui-tative Committee. I am satisfied,,however, that these elements; in spite of theirextravagant claims, never represented more than a noisy minority amongst thepopulation, and that the Consultative Committee, in recommending that the basisof the Federation proposals should be maintained (though with substantialmodifications), spoke for the great bulk of the people, whose firm desire is to seethe early establishment of a stable system of Government. It is noteworthy thatthe Governor&apos;s Advisory Council, in resolving early in April that the consultative committee&apos;s Report should be submitted for the consideration of the MalayRulers and His Majesty&apos;s Government;, expressed the unanimous view that theCommittee had fulfilled His Majesty&apos;s Governments pledge of full and free con-sultation with all interested parties.4. The final stage in the local consultations-the consideration of the Con-consultative Committee&apos;s Report by the Malay Rulers and Representatives-dulytook place in the latter part of April, and the Governor&apos;s comprehensive recom-mendations were submitted to me in May. Before describing briefly the main features of these recommendations, I should say a word about the political back-ground against which the Governor has had to work. There has been no doubtthat the Malay attitude, partly owing to the mere fact of enforced inactivitywhile the other communities were being consulted and partly owing to the more extreme Chinese and Indian points of view which were expressed during thatconsultation, hardened considerably during the early months of this year; andI therefore regard it as all the more remarkable that the Governor and those whohave assisted him should have been able, by dint of patient persuasion, not onlyto hold their ground but to secure the agreement of the Malays to several notableadvances on the earlier proposals.33825B
5. These earlier proposals, as my colleagues will recall, provided for a*.&apos; Eederation of Malaya &apos;&apos; with a strong Central Government, having control overall matters of importance to the progress and welfare of the country as a whole,and for a form of common citizenship whose object was to afford political rights to all those, of whatever race or colour, who might fairly be held to regard Malayaas their true home and as the object of their loyalty. There has been no departure from these two fundamental principles of constitutional cohesion arid commoncitizenship (which have throughout, of course, represented the basic objectives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in their whole Malayan policy), and this fact aloneshould, I think, influence us greatly in favour of accepting the scheme in itslatest form. Having emphasised this general point, I have the following comments on matters of greater detail:- (a) Introduction of an Electoral System. The original Federation proposalsdid not provide for the immediate introduction of elections, either in the central legislature or in the Legislatures of the individual States and Settlements. Iaccepted this position in view of the practical difficulties in the way of theimmediate establishment of an electoral system; but whereas the original proposals merely spoke in non-committal terms of the introduction of electionsat a later date, there is now to be a firm undertaking that, as soon as circum-stances and local conditions&quot; will permit, legislation should be introduced for theelection of members both to the Central Legislature and to the State and Settle-ment Councils.  I regard this as a welcome advance.(b) Citizenship. The Consultative Committee recommended no fundamental change in the Citizenship provisions as set out in the original Federation pro-posals and as provisionally approved by my colleagues last December, butsuggested that certain comparatively minor modifications should be effected, andin particular that the terms of application for citizenship, as opposed to auto-matic acquisition, should be made less onerous. The Malays have now gone someway, though not the whole way, towards meeting the Consultative Committee&apos;suggestion. As the matter is inevitably somewhat complicated, I attach a brieftabular summary as an Annex to this memorandum. I regard it as particularlysatisfactory that the Governor should have secured some modification, howeverslight, in the Malay attitude on this matter which they consider to be absolutelyfundamental to their interests, and I am confident that the citizenship provisions,in the form in which they now stand, are designed to achieve the essentialobjective of common citizenship in Malaya as throughout upheld by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(c) Composition  of  Central  Legislature.-The  original   &quot;Federation&quot;proposals envisaged a Central Legislature of forty-eight members, with an unofficial majority.  On the unofficial side, the seats were to be so arranged thatthe Malay Representatives (including the nine Malay Chief Ministers from theindividual States, who would attend in virtue of their official State position but would nonetheless rank, at least for some purposes, as unofficials on the central legislature) would outnumber all other representatives by a small margin.   the consultative Committee recommended a large increase in the size of the Counciland in the preponderance of unofficial over official members, coupled with a slightreadjustment in the balance of Malay and non-Malay representatives which would deprive the former of their base majority on the unofficial side of the Council.The Malays have now accepted the conception of a larger Council (numberingnearly eighty members) and a large unofficial majority, but have again insisted that the Malay representatives amongst the unofficial members should slightlyoutnumber all the rest.   The Governor has recommended the acceptance of the malay point of view in this matter, and I support his recommendation.   Theincrease in the unofficial majority is an undoubted advance, and as regards thebalance between Malay and non-Malay representatives, I do not consider thatthe Malays are asking more than is justified by their essential position in thecountry.   In the absence of recent census figures, it cannot be said whether the malays form an absolute majority of the population in the territories now com-prising the Malayan Union; but there is no doubt that they form an absolutemajority amongst those who really belong to the country, who will qualify forcitizenship, and who are justified in demanding a stake in the country&apos;s future.My support for the Governor&apos;s recommendations is. very closely linked,however, with the proposals for the early introduction of elections. In formu-lating his latest proposals for the basis of nomination of unofficial members ofthe Central Legislature, the Governor has been able to steer away from an overtlyracial system.   That is to say, members will not be nominated as representing
Malays, Chinese or Indians, but as representing certain functions or interests.The fact remains, however, that these functions and interests have been chosenwith the avowed object of producing certain fixed proportions as between races,and I can only accept this system, which is obviously far from ideal, provided it begins to give place in the near future to a system of elections whereby repre-sentation is demonstrably based upon the will of the people. I dothe Malays have anything to fear from the introduction of elections, and Ipropose, with my colleagues&apos; approval, to make clear to the Governor my viewson this point.(d) Immigration policy. It is in this connection that the recent hardeningof the Malay attitude has been most- apparent. At the time when the original&quot;Federation&quot; proposals were formulated, the Malays were content with aprovision which laid it down that the High Commissioner should consult theConference of Rulers about immigration policy and that differences of opinion between himself and the Conference should be referred to the Secretary of Statefor a decision. Now, however, they will be content with nothing less than aprovision which enables the Malays, in the last resort, effectively to block anyimmigration policy which they regard as inimical to their own interests. I mustsay at once that I have some sympathy with the Malay point of view on thismatter, though it must be confessed that the degree of economic prosperitydepended in large part on the immigration into Malaya of other races. Theirpresent precarious numerical position in their own country is mainly due toimmigration policy in the past, over which they had no control, and I think itwould be both wrong and fruitless to try to deny them the substance of their claim. The Governor&apos;s recommendation, however, is based on a proposal thatin matters of immigration policy the final decision should rest with the unofficial members of the Central Legislature (on which, as we have seen, there is to be an absolute Malay majority); and it appeared to me that this proposal, as it originallyreached me, might enable the Malays not merely, in the last resort, to block changesin immigration policy which they did not like, but also to introduce innovationsin such policy which would not be subject to the normal checks and safeguards.I pointed this out to the Governor, who has now submitted a revised recom-mendation which in my view obviates the danger. Put briefly, the recommendation is that the High Commissioner shall discuss with the Conference of Rulers any important changes in immigration policy which he proposes to introduce, andthat if the Conference cannot be brought to agree to any particular change, thematter shall become the subject of a resolution by the unofficial members of theLegislative Council. If this resolution sustains the objections of the Conferenceof Rulers, no further action will be taken (whether by legislation or administrative action), unless the High Commissioner can certify that Such action is essential in connection with the external affairs or defence of the &quot; Federation &quot;-matterson which His Majesty will continue to exercise jurisdiction. The Governorpoints out, however, that this revised recommendation has not been put to the malays and that their reaction to it cannot be guaranteed.6. Such, then, is the essence of the Malayan constitutional proposals in theirlatest form. I consider that the Governor has achieved a remarkable measureof success in evolving proposals so satisfactory, in the face of a difficult and some-times intransigent Malay attitude, and I am satisfied that the scheme, asa starting point, meets the real needs of the country and its various communities.The Governor-General, Mr. Malcolm MacDonaldj has throughout been closely associated with the discussions and gives his full support to the Governorsrecommendations, being convinced that the essential need is the early establishmentof a staple form of Government. Before proceeding to my recommendations,however, I wish to draw attention to the following further points :-*(a) the Malays have pressed that the Malay Rulers should in future havethe right of concurrence in the appointment of successive high commissioners. Besides constituting a most dangerous precedent, thisis a point touching on His Majesty&apos;s prerogative, and I have fully explained to the Governor the reasons why the Malay demand cannot.:- be granted.  He has advised me, however, that it would be unwise tore-open this individual point with the Malays in advance of a settle-ment on the whole range of the proposals. He recommends, in fact,that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s negative decision on this point should be conveyed together with their acceptance of the proposals asa whole. I propose to act accordingly.33825 B 2
(&amp;) It is proposed that, at the outset, the &quot; Federation of Malaya &quot; should consist, as does the present Malayan Union, of the nine Malay Statesand the British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, and shouldexclude Singapore. The imniediate Union of Singapore with the restof Malaya has been one of the demands most loudly reiterated by that section of local opinion which has flatly opposed the Federation pro-posals, and there is no doubt that there are many links between the mainland and Singapore which may render desirable the early inclu-sion of Singapore in the &quot; Federation.&quot; But after fully considering this problem in consultation with the two Governors, the Governor-General has recommended to me that any reorganisation on these lines should only be further considered after the &quot; Federation&quot; has beensafely established. I agree with the Governor-General, and 1 would now propose, with the approval of my colleagues, to inform theGovernor of the Malayan Union that His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided in this sense.(c) As I have indicated above, the Governor&apos;s latest proposal regardingimmigration policy has not yet been put to the Malays. I proposenow to invite him to do so, and to urge him to advise them most strongly to accept the proposal, on the grounds that it meets their essential point of view and that it is coupled with the general acceptance of a scheme which is largely of their own making.7. I now recommend that my colleagues should authorise me to inform theGovernor, subject to points (a), (b) and (c) paragraph 6 above, and subject to thenecessary emphasis being placed on the early introduction of an electoral system(see paragraph 5 (c) above), that the proposals are approved by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. If, vas I greatly hope, the Governor is able to tell me in the nearfuture that he has secured Malay agreement on all outstanding points, I would propose to take an early opportunity of announcing His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s decision in Parliament and of publishing a summary of the proposals intheir final shape, in the form of a Command Paper. Thereafter, an Order inCouncil would have to be made providing for the establishment of the Federationof Malaya in place of the Malayan Union, and the necessary new agreements would have to be signed with the Malay Rulers. With these formalities cpm-pleted, it is hoped that it will be possible to establish the &quot; Federation &quot; early next year.&apos;       ;&quot; -   .   C. J.28th June, 1H7
