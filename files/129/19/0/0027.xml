(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)secret .P.C47) 177 . COPY NO. 3/8TH JUNE ,  1 947CABINETPRODUCTION OP FOODSTUFFS AND RAW materials in THE COLONIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonleaThe Cabinet will be interested to learn of the steps taken in the Colonial Office recently to increase productionof foodstuffs and raw materials in the Colonies.   ,2.      Colonial Governments have been repeatedly urged to do everything possible to increase food supplies both for localconsumption and for export.     Explicit instructions were sent out to them in -the early part of&apos;1946, when&apos; the gravity of thepost-war food crisis was appreciated and these have beenfrequently followed up. .3.     Agricultural and other economic expansion has a bigplace in the Ten Year Development Programmes of the respectiveterritories under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts,Many of the schemes are - already in operation.      particulars of some of these are mentioned in the Appendix.4.      Provision under these Acts has been made for a number ofcentrally controlled schemes aimed at the assistance ofeconomic development, including (a) comprehensive organisations for topographical and geological surveys and many: researchprojects,  (b) training of technical staffs etc.      provision has also been made for the restoration to full activity ofthe Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, which trainsagricultural workers for employment, all over the colonial empire.      An Agricultural Adviser, an expert AdvisoryCommittee and an Agricultural Research Committee function to urge forward development work over the whole field ofagriculture, ainimai health and&apos;forestry. &apos;.;5.      The Colonial Office has also paid particular attentionto particular fields of production in which development projects would be of special value at the present time.Investigations, have lately been systematised by the formationof an Inter-Departmental Committee under Colonial Office .Chairmanship, which .is studying all the products of which we ,might get increased ,supplies from the Colonies, in con-sultation with the other Departments and experts in this
1A Qcountry.     It is beginning with the most urgent or promisingpossibilities such as tobacco in Central Africa, rice inSierra Leone and Borneo, timber in a number of Colonies andmanila hemp in Borneo.6.      Where departmental examination suggests prima facie apossibility of expansion, special enquiries are instituted inthe Colonies, and expert missions despatched.     Many Coloniesare, as a result of such enquiries, examining the possibilitiesof linseed and soya bean production.      A mission has just leftto look into the possibilities of groundnut production in&apos;West Africa, following the scheme already initiated in EastAfrica as a result of the report of a similar missionorganised last year.      Experts are looking into the develop-ment of coal production in Nigeria and in Borneo, and a specialmission will examine-the possibilities of rice production inBorneo.7.     A number of undertakings are already in operation.     Mycolleagues are familiar with the proposals concerning theEast African groundnut undertaking.      The Nigerian Governmenthas organised a Government Corporation under local legislation to carry out the development of large ex-German- Estates inthe Cameroons for the- production of bananas and other crops.The Nigerian Government has for many years operated the coalmines in that country.8.      I have,  however,  felt more and more the need for an instrument of wide and general powers to undertake specificprojects of this kind and I am accordingly submittingseparately a Memorandum proposing the establishment of ageneral Colonial Development Corporation.9.      Private enterprise is also being encouraged to go aheadwithin the scope of pur development programmes with new projects where government enterprise is difficult.      In theWest Indies Tate and Lyle, Ltd.,  in Jamaica Booker Brothers,and McConnell and Co, Ltd., in British Guiana are eachspending more than  1 million on new sugar factories, or the modernisation of old ones.      Another example among many isthe recent establishment by the United Africa Company of an up-to-date plant for the production of timber and plywood in nigeria.      My Department is facilitating these enterprises   -where necessary (e.g. by expansion of transport and docksfacilities, etc.). and I have also, in the mining sphere,agreed to several new concessions oh carefully regulatedlines to mining companies to prospect and develop in areas where Government organisation cannot for some time be created.There are promising prospects,  for instance, with regard tothe development of lead and coal in Tanganyika.10.    Certain .Colonies have had special rehabilitation problems.In Malaya the Governments have given very extensive financialand other assistance to the tin, palm oil and rubberindustries.      In Mauritius and.Trinidad His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have made special grants to assist in the recovery of the sugar industry which had lost ground duringthe war owing to the diversion of labour either to thegrowth of local foodstuffs or to work on military bases.Substantial grants or loans have also been made by theTreasury to the recovery from hurricane damage in the caseof Jamaica bananas.and Mauritius sugar.
11.    Production for the future is already &quot;being assisted by anumber of important projects of research, e.g, into the diseases which are afflicting West African cocoa, into thegeneral problems of sugar production in the West Indies and into cotton production.      It has just been agreed with theEmpire Cotton Growing Corporation that a general CottonResearch Station should be set up in Uganda, to be financedjointly by the Corporation, Colonial Development and Welfarefunds, and the African Governments concerned.      In manyColonies experimental stations and demonstration - farms haveincreased.12.    Yet another factor in encouraging the maximum output isthe stabilisation of the marketing position so as to give the producer a firm assurance for the future.     A new permanent organisation to deal with the marketing of West African cocoahas now been established and I am paying particular attentionto the establishment of similar marketing&quot;&quot; organisations forother. Colonial Products, e.g. palm kernels, sisal, etc.13.    There are in many areas big schemes to arrest erosion,secure fertilisers,  improve irrigation and conserve water,improve animals and agricultural methods, develop co-operative practice   etc. Also the general problems of theorganisation of African agriculture in relation to nativesocial conditions and customs have received much attention as this is an important factor in expansion.14.    These activities have of course to surmount many difficulties.      Briefly, among the practical obstacles torapid increase of production are:-(a) The general infertility of land in most of tropical africa, and the dangers of destroying the fertilityby wrong methods.(b) The shortage and comparative inefficiency of nativelabour and the danger of competition within any given territory of different schemes demanding labour at the same time.(c) The shortage of technicians,  including agricultural,veterinary, forestry and geological officers in theGovernment services.(d) The very inadequate existing capital, equipment,particularly of the African native producer, andthe great difficulty of getting&apos;quick delivery ofnew equipment, including railway equipment, tractorsand other necessities for mechanical cultivation.(e) Difficulties in securing supplies of imported foodsand consumption goods which are necessary asinducements to labour.  .   In some Colonies,particularly in the East,  the shortage of food is .a very real obstacle to full productive effort.(f) Shortage of fertilisers, of which, under theexisting international allocation system, Coloniesare still getting only a percentage.of theirordinary requirements.
(g) Pears among some producers that the existing conditions oC shortage may fairly soon hereplaced by over-production as is alreadythreatening in the case of rubber.(h) The physical difficulty that a great many Colonialproducts,  including palm and cocoanut products,cocoa, coffee, tea, rubber and sisal, are treecrops or other slow growing,plants which do not come to bearing until from three to eight yearsafter planting.15.    I sho\ild. add that many territories have increased their local food supplies (e. g. Nigeria by establishing bacon and cheese factories and in Tanganyika where a meat extractfactory is being built) and the higher standard of livingenjoyed and the measures adopted to prevent famine all involvea bigger consumption of products.16.    I attach, in an Appendix, a few examples of particularprojects included in Colonial Development Programmes, and ofrecent increases in Colonial production.(Intld.)

-   appendix a few examples of provision for economic development in Colonial Ten Year Development programmes.      Kenya.      Provision has been made for a largenumber of local schemes for soil erosion,irrigation and settlement involving a totalexpenditure of  4,500,000.2.      Nigeria, has made provision for the expansionof the Agricultural, Veterinary and ForestryDepartments,, at a total cost of  3,230,000.3.      Jamaica has provided for the expansion ofagricultural advisory services and other features of the Agricultural Department at a cost of 1,378,000 over 10 years.Recent increases in Colonial production.      Timber.British Guiana.    Total production of timber onCrown Lands has increased from an average of1,274,000 cubic feet in 1936/40, to 2,307,000cubic feet in 1945-Gold Coast.      Production of hardwood hasincreased from an average of 5,690,000 in1934/38 to 13,090,000 in 1945.Nigeria.     Output of hardwood increased from 46,800 trees average for the 5 years1934/38, of approximately 14,000,000 cubicfeet, to 73,903 trees in 1945.2,      Groundnuts.Production in Nigeria has increased from228,000 tons in 1945 to 302,000 tons in 1946.3.      Palm products.During the last five months purchases in nigeria from many producers have increasedto a weekly average of 7,70.0 tons of palmkernels and 3,900 tons of palm oil as comparedwith 6,700 and 3,100, in 1946.4.      Sugar.&quot;production in Jamaica has increased from anaverage of about 83,000 tons in the two years1935/36 to an estimated production of167,230 tons in 1947-
5.      Tohacco.Jamaica&apos;s production of cigars has increased from 4,564 lbs.  in 1939 to 312,704 lbs.  in1946 and is now practically wholly supplying the demand in this country formerly met byCuba, and so saving dollar expenditure.6.      Tea.Exports from Kenya have increased from 9,600,000pounds in 1938 to 11,600,000 in 1945, Nyasalandfrom 10.200,000 to 13,700,000 and Tanganyikafrom 300,000 to 900,000.
