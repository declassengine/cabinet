COPY NO.18TH MAY,  1947.CABINETPALESTINEFINANCIAL SITUATION;    COST OP TERRORISTDAMAGE AMD OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.1.      The. Palestine Government have for some time been increasingly pre-occupied with financial problems resultingfrom the two main forms of Jewish illegal activity - terrorismand illegal immigration.      They have evinced much concern,which I share,  at the mounting damage to public and private property and at-the heavy financial burdens imposed by their efforts to counter illegal immigration and check the activitiesof the terrorists.    So far as property is concerned, no publicprovision exists for compensation and the   Palestine government do not,  of course, admit any responsibility for losses.    Butpublic expenditure both by the Palestine Government and byHis Maoesty&apos;s Government continues to rise and the HighCommissioner is much exercised as&apos;to the right method of meeting these additional charges,2,    The Palestine Financial Position.The surplus funds of the Palestine Government are beingrapidly wiped out.    The direct cost to public funds inPalestine of terrorist activities over the last two years iswell over  5,000,000, while  the cost of security measures,including the evacuation of non-essential civilians and theloss resulting from the reduced effectiveness of thedepartmental services is probably even higher.    The annual expenditure of the Palestine Government on security measuresis now more than  8,000,000 in a budget totalling  25,000,000.This does not include a liability for, the cost of the Cypruscamps for illegal immigrants and the hire cf shipping in thatconnection,. evacuation expenses, pensions and gratuities to-dependants of officials killed in terrorist outrages and security measures,such as the requisitioning of property.      In 1946/47these claims alone amounted to  2,650,000.    During 194-7/48 a .deficit of  1,000,000 in the Palestine budget is expected, quite apart from the considerable cost of measures directed againstillegal immigration, of Government losses from terrorist action and other security commitments.    It is impossible to estimate theprobable expenditure on these counts, but it may well be considerable.    Furthermore, if the re-imposition of thevigorous measures taken a few months ago becomes necessary, theeffect on general revenues would be serious.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
3.     During the last two years military expenditure fromImperial funds in Palestine has amounted to  82,000,000,   -\ The Defence Committee  (D. 0.(47)  Seventh Meeting) expressed theview ,that in present circumsfr&apos; nces funds could not &quot;be found from United Kingdom sources  to contribute towards expenditure by the Palestine Government on the Cyprus camps and othersecurity measures, and urged that Palestine&apos; should considerways and means of raising additional revenue- to cover theseexpenses.    In framing their general budget,  the Governmentof Palestine have been constrained to eliminate all expenditureon development and social services which Is not essential,    toavoid regression.    No further economy in this direction ispossible.4.      I therefore consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding new means of taxation to meet these heavily increasingburdens and as a result I have referred certain proposals tothe High Commissioner for consideration.    The High Commissioneris now examining these proposals, but he has already indicated that the amount realisable in this way will in any event notbe commensurate with the need, and that the additional burdeninevitably placed on the Arab taxpayer would arouse a justifiableresentment in that Arabs would be made to pay taxes because of jewish lawlessness.    Discriminatory taxation is difficult    to devise, for even when it is shown that the Jews will undoubtedly contribute the larger amount of the sum it isproposed to raj,se,  and that that proportion of the sum whichwill fall on the Arabs can be returned to them in the way of social services, Arab political objection will still be strong.Jewish opposition to new taxation,is also inevitable.Nevertheless, I am of . the &apos; opinion that some increases in  ,general taxation must be made.5,      Compensation for damage caused by terrorismIn regard to damage to property by terrorists,  the HighCommissioner, while admitting that Government has no responsibility to compensate for losses, has represented thatthe damage to the oil installations of the Shell Company atHaifa - estimated at  400,000 - is by its very magnitude aspecial case.    On the. day following the&apos; attack on the Haifainstallations,  the Palestine Government, through its publicInformation Officer^, publicly stated that the cost of the damagewould be recovered from the community,  in one way or another.It is,  of course, possible for the&apos;Shell Company to recover their losses by an increase in prices to local consumers, but such astep would produce windfall profits for other distributingcompanies in Palestine who would increase their prices inconformity.      The High Commissioner therefore suggested thatthere should, be imposed a special tax of 3- mils per litre onbenzine, and 400 mils per metric ton on furnace fuel for 18 months in the first instance.    This tax is estimated to yield over thatperiod  477,000,  of which  344,000 would be derived from Jewishsources and  133,000 from non-Jews.    Of this total sum, the oil company would be reimbursed by Government.up to an agreedpercentage of their loss,, and a sum equivalent to the estimatedcontribution by the Arab section of the population would be set aside by Government from, its general revenue and devoted tomeasuresfor which funds would not otherwise be available, for improving the more backward Arab   areas of  the country.    The tax would thus be discriminatory in effect, but not in form.      TheHigh Commissioner is advised that it would^not infringe thenon-discriminatory provisions of Article lb of the Mandate.
6.      This proposal is opon to objection on the grounds thatit xavours an-oil company in preference to all other interestspublic or private, so far damaged by terrorism in Palestine.I feel that the singling out of a wealthy oil company to bethe first recipient of    compensation&quot; at the expense of theJewish community,,would be represented, by those concerned to make&apos; anti-British propaganda, as* a demonstration of the underlying purposes for which Great Britain is in palestine and in general as an indication of the subservience of ourPalestine, policy to strategic interests and especially thoseof Middle East oil.       Moreover, so far as I am aware, no other private concern in Palestine has been thus compensated for damage caused by terrorist action.    I put this objection tothe High Commissioner and suggested, as an alternative,  the-creation by the imposition of a tax on oil of a &quot;compensation&quot;fund from which ex gratia payments might be made to any interest, public or private, injured by terrorist action,although I recognise that, from such a fund, a substantial contribution would be made to the Shell Comnany.    I suggestedthat the regulations establishing such a fund might Provide &apos;that the receipts from Arab sour cos,should be devoted to theextension of social services and development work in Arabareas.    Such an arrangement, which would not exclusivelyfavour Oil interests,  could be defended against charges of discrimination against the Jewish community, on the grounds that by their refusal fully to co-operate with Government againstterrorism, it was right and proper that they should contribute to remedy part of the damage which terrorism had caused.    invite my colleagues to. endorse this proposal.7,     Establishment of a more courprehensive compensation fund.The High Commissioner has submitted a further proposaldesigned to secure a contribution from the Jewish communitytowards the heavy costs incurred by Government in meeting theoutrages and disorder caused by the Jews.    He has asked for my approval of a. draft bill to provide for the establishmentof a &quot;compensation&quot; fund of  5,000,000&apos;, to be financed by amounts arbitrarily sequestrated from certain Jewish communal&quot;funds.    The legislation setting up this fund is so drafted asto avoid difficulties of communal discrimination under theMandate-.    It. would empower the Palestine Government to sequestratethe assets of any person or organisation specified by order and apply them to defraying the costs Of acts of lawlessnessby members of any section of the population of Palestine.    the phrase &quot;acts&apos; of-lawlessness&quot; would cover illegal immigration.The legislation would not be enacted immediately,, but theHigh Commissioner desires to have approval for its enactmentin the event of further large-scale terrorist outrages.Simultaneously, with the enactment, he would make an order under it sequestrating certain corporate - funds held, in the nameof various Jewish institutions,  including the Jewish agency and the Revisionist Organisation, both of. whom are known toapoly part of their coriaorate funds to the illegal immigrationtraffic.    Funds devoted primarily to social services would be excluded.    It would be made clear that, so far as terroristdamage is concerned, a contribution towards the cost ox suchdamage would be recovered from the &quot;compensation-   fund^ onlyin res-oect of incidents occurring after the enactment of the ordinance;    if no such incidents took place no recovery wouldbe made.
8. \   This proposal is so drastic and far reaching in its implications, that I must give it further study before&quot;making any recommendation to ray colleagues.  . I feel, however,  thatthey should.  now of its existence.    It is of course avariant of the proposal made at the time of the JerusalemSecretariat disaster, when the High Commissioner recommended the imposition of a fine of  500,Opo on the Jewish community and the enactment of legislation to provide for the freezingof the funds of various Jewish corporate &quot;bodies and theirsequestration, i&apos;f necessary, as security against the paymentof the fine.    This recommendation was not approved by theCabinet (CM. (46) 75th Conclusions, Minute l).    I shall&quot;bring the-matter -gain to the attention -of, ray colleagueswhen I am in a, position to state my considered views.(intld. )    .... C.J.Colonial.Office, S.W.I.18TH MAY,  1947.
