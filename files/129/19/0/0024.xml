(47) 17a9th June, 1947.v  CABINETowFILM    REMITTANCESMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeDollar remittances for films in the year .to March 1947amount to above  17 million.      This is far too heavy .a drain onour dollar resources and^public opinion clearly expects action toreduce it.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have consideredvarious possible ways of enforcing a substantial economy in dollar expenditure on films(a) The supply of British films even with their exploitationassisted by quota legislation (which will be continued and strengthened,by a new Bill in the autumn) is altogether inadequate to meet the demands of the cinema going public, and a merereduction in the number of American films allowed to be importedwould not, therefore, help us at all. .   The reduced number wouldbe shown for longer periods,  and in more cinemasj    and the totalbox office receipts -which govern remittances would not be substantially reduced.(b) No permanent economy could be found by refusing to all.the remittances to be. made, so that sterling would pile, up^ in thehands of the American producers. Apart from the fact that such a remedy would be contrary to our international engagements, blockedsterling of this kind must eventually be paid off.(c) We cannot rely on any rapid or substantial &quot;increase inthe dollar income from British films,  shown in the United States,to offset our own dollar expenditure.      It will be a very longtime before net remittances (after taking into account ,the very heavy expenditure made on advertisement&apos; etc.) will begin to be anadequate offset to our expenditure on American films.      For 1947incomings are estimated at about  2 million net.&apos;   . . . . -3. &apos;In our present situation we cannot wait on such slowmoving remedies.      Drastic action to secure,  as early as may be,a very sharp reduction in these dollar outgoings cannot be postponed any longer.     We have come to the conclusion that thereis no,alternative to the imposition of a heavy ad. valorem duty onfilm imports,  and we suggest, therefore, that the necessary action should be taken in the present Finance Bill.h. The procedure,  shorn of technicalities, would be to makea provisional valuation, at the moment of import, of the receiptslikely to be drawn in respect of each film; this valuation -wouldbe adjusted subsequently in the light of the profits actually-1-
earned from the exhibition of the film.     The duty should be at separately sufficient to reduce the remittances very substantially.      Tohalve remittances would, mean a charge of 100 per cent of the valuation, which is of course,  calculated on the import value beforethe payment of duty.35 (if the cut were to be one-third thecorresponding rate of duty would be 50 per cent,)      In view of our international commitments,  the duty will have to apply to films-from all sources, including the few coming from the Dominions.But news films and certain special categories would remainunaffected.5* In order to prevent the duty being passed on in higherrentals or increased admission charges to the public, the Board ofTrade would propose if need be,  to use their price regulation powersto control film rentals.6. We must recognise that whatever is done is bound to be extremely unwelcome to the American film interests, all the moresince it is understood that their receipts in the home market havenot recently been as satisfactory as before -and.that they have sustained heavy losses because    of recent Hollywood strikes and rising Hollywood costs;    they will,  therefore, be all the more concerned .at a reduction in their receipts from this country,(which may account for as much as one-fifth of their total receipts from all sources)&apos; and at least one or two of the principal Tcompsniesmay well become involved in really serious financial embarrassment.7* I am nevertheless advised that on the whole the Americanfilm interests are unlikely to take reprisals at the expense ofBritish films in America.      In the first place,  they could not do that without injuring their goodwill here, rendering it more likely that the present step would be permanent.      A more serious danger is that they might combine to send no more films forexhibition in British cinemas.      This,  of course, would completelydislocate the circulation of films in this country.      There should still be enough films (i.e. new British films and British and -probably - foreign reissues) for most people still to be able to see,say,  one picture a week (and probably more than one picture in some weeks), but this would mean that all the exhibitors would experiencea sharp fall in their receipts,  and if the boycott was prolonged,a large number of weaker exhibitors would almost certainly have to -close down for want of acceptable films to show,  thereby reducingthe outlets for British films.      Such a boycott would not beunprecedented, for there have recently been at least three or fourcoses where all the principal United States companies withheld their new films from particular European markets until the authorities of the countries concerned allowed the local distributors andexhibitors to offer more favourable terms than they had previously been willing to sanction.     -On the other hand, the companies couldmuch less well afford to boycott our important market than, say,Holland or Scandinavia,  and I am inclined to think that, ratherthan do that - especially at the present time when, as stated in thepreceding paragraph,  they are already hard up for cash - thecompanies would still carry on and make the best of a bad job.as   If a foreign seller now receives  20 for an -article, and it isproposed to reduce this in future to  10 by imposing a customs duty,  the seller will declare a valuation of  10,  and pay dutyof - 10,  i.e.  100 per cent,,  he will thus keep  10 out of thereceipts of  20.
8* With the Chancellors aoproval,  therefore, I nowseek the approval of my colleagues for the addition tothis yearrs Finance Bill of a clause imposing a customs duty along the foregoing lines.Board of Trade,  S.W.1.9th Juno,:1947.
