S E C R E : T ^ JCOPY NO.CP. (1+7)  1922nd July^HUJ^CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY:PLANNING- BILLS;CONSTITUTION OF THE CENTRAL LAND board memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland a point which. I should like to bring to the notice ofmy colleagues has arisen in connection with the constitution ofthe Central Land Board to be established for the purposes of theEnglish and Scottish Planning Bills at present before Parliament.2. The English Bill provides for the establishment of a central Land Board for the purposes of both Bills consisting,   of a chairman and not exceeding nine other members to be appointedby the Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Secretaryof State jointly.      In carrying out their functions in Englandand Wales the Board will be subject to directions of the Ministerof Town and Country Planning, and in Scotland directions will begiven by the Secretary of State.3. In the Scottish Grand Committee the Opposition moved an amendment to the Scottish Bill, the effect of which was torequire the appointment of a Scottish Committee of the CentralLand Board to whom the Board could delegate any of their functions under the Bill.     After consultation with the treasury successfully resisted this amendment as being unnecessarysince -(i) the members of the Board would be appointed by the planning Ministers jointly and Scottish interests would be adequately represented;(ii) in carrying out their functions under the Scottish bill the Board would be. subject - to the directions of &quot;theSecretary of State;    and(iii) the Board would have an office and staff.in scotland for handling Scottish business..  At the same time I undertook to consider whether the appropriateprovision of the Bill could be amplified in order to make itclear that the Scottish office of the Board would handle theordinary run of Scottish business.1+, In dealing subsequently in Committee in the House ofJH      Lords with an Opposition amendment on the English Bill the Lord&quot;      Chancellor indicated that he was not unsympathetic to the ideaof a Scottish Committee, but that it was a matter to be dealtwith by the Secretary of State on the Scottish Bill.
5* Following on the debate in the Lords further representations in favour of the appointment of a ScottishCommittee of the Board will, I anticipate, &quot;be pressed on theReport Stage of the Scottish Bill next week;    and it will &quot;benecessary for me to announce the Government&apos;s considered viewson the matter.6. Provision for the appointment of a Committee on thelines proposed &quot;by the Opposition could not &quot;be made without anew Money Resolution and would not, in my view, be the best solution.      I therefore propose to continue to resist any suchamendment;    and in fulfilment of my. undertaking in the ScottishGrand Committee I have put down an amendment to the effectthat the Board should maintain a staff in Scotland sufficient for the proper performance of Scottish &quot;business.      But in thelight of what was said in the Lords I feel that it is necessaryto go further, and I should like to &quot;be able to announce thatthere will, &quot;be appointed to the Board at least two members withspecial knowledge of Scottish conditions, and that I hope the qualifications of one or other of thea will make him suitablefor appointment as Deputy-Chairman.7. I have discussed the matter with the Minister of Townand Country Planning, who is agreeable to my making anannouncement on these lines.      I regret that time, has^not permitted similar discussion with the Chancellor of tbeExchequer, who is also directly concerned.8. Subject to the views of the Chancellor of the BxchequeI should be glad to have the agreement of my colleagues to theaction proposed.J.W.Scottish Office,  S.W.1.,  2nd July, 19U7.
