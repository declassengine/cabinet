secret.P.(U7)  1752ND JUNE.  19U7.DOUBLE SUMMER TIMEMemorandum &quot;by the Prime minister on 22nd May, in company with the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agricultureand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and national Service, I received a joint deputation from the national farmers&apos; Unions of England and Scotland, who desired to make representations with regard to the effect of Double Summer time on agriculture.2. The main points made on behalf of the ScottishNational Farmers&apos; Union regarding the effects of Double SummerTime were: - -(1)      that the dairy industry is subjected to great difficulties which entail a day&apos;s work lasting from 5 a.m. until7 p.m. and that in consequence employees are drifting away fromthis work;(2)     that hay-making, which in Scotland begins at theend of June, will not be practicable until 12 o&apos;clock double summer Time and that employees will then want to go to theirmid-day meal, leaving only three or four hours of effective workper day;(3)     that sheep-shearing cannot be begun until 12 o&apos;clockDouble Summer Time and that this often makes it impossible todeal in one day with a whole &quot;hirsel&quot; (500 breeding ewes) ofsheep.     Serious difficulties in feeding the lambs are said to result.3* The representative of the National Farmers&apos; Unionof England and Wales said that the difficulties outlined by theScottish spokesman applied equally in England and Wales, andstressed the fact that his Union had accepted in February theGovernment statement that Double Summer Time was essential inorder to facilitate the introduction of double shift work in industry, but that industry had not in fact made the correspondingsacrifice that was anticipated of an appreciable increase in working by staggered hours.U* Both.the English and Scottish representatives emphasised the acute discontent prevailing amongst their members, which inScotland particularly has taken the form of fairly widespreadthreats of refusal to co-operate ?/ith the Government in a variety of ways.      Both delegations expressed the view that there was a danger of their members getting out of hand.COPY NOCABINET
5* The essence of the Scottish deputation^ demand was that Double Summer Time should end in Scotland on29th June and of the English deputation^ that it should endon 15th June;    or that the Government should at least make some substantial concession which would do domething to conciliate the agricultural community.      The difference betweenthe dates suggested for Scotland and England is explained by thedifference in the normal timing of the hoy harvest.6. The dates of Double Summer Time for 1947 were fixed by the Summer Time Act, 1947, which received the Royal Assenton 11th March.      Under the.Act Double Summer Time will end on10th August and this date could only be altered by further legislation.     .Short of legislation, therefore, any conciliatorygesture would appear to be limited to some sort of assuranceregarding next year - either that Double Summer Time will not bere-introduced in 1948, or that it will not bei introduced withouta most careful appraisal, in the light of experience, of all the relevant considerations.      The latter of these assurances could he given at once, but it may be doubted whether it would do muchto satisfy the farmers.      As to the former alternative, it may be felt that there are objections to committing the Government toa&apos;course of action in 1948 in circumstances which cannot yet before seen and before the results of Double Summer Time this yearcan he properly assessed.7. .    If some positive action is to be taken, however, itappears necessary either to accept one of these alternatives,or to accede to the farmers&apos;  demand for an amending Bill.The Home Office has therefore sought from the Ministry ofAgriculture and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland an assessment of the strength of the case presented by the Farmers *Unions, and from the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of fuel and.Power an assessment of the advantages accruing to theindustrial and power situation from the operation of double summer Time.8. The Agricultural Departments are agreed that on purelyagricultural grounds the case presented by the Farmers&apos; Unionsis a strong one and that the continuance of Double Summer Timeuntil 10th August is likely to have a harmful effect, particularlyupon hay-making, sheep-shearing and milk production inScotland,  and upon milk production and the hay and cerealharvests in England and Wales.     The effect of Double SummerTime is to bring the farm worker to work before the physicalconditions are right;    a great amount of.vital work must therefore be done in the evenings when the labourers are unwilling or too exhausted-to work, or if they do work mustbe paid at over-time rates causing greatly increased costs to.the farmers.     Where dairy herds form part of a mixed farmingsystem,  as they almost Invariably do in England and.Wales, along day&apos;s work, involving a heavy burden on the workers,&quot;becomes inevitable if the vital operations of hay-making andharvesting are to he successfully completed.
If) ^9.     ^ All these facts were appreciated when, the SummerTime Bill was under consideration, hut there have been twodevelopments since February which may justify a reconsideration of the question.10. The first is that the.disastrous weather conditionsof March have radically altered the agricultural position andthe national food prospects to an extent which could not havebeen foreseen when the Summer Time Bill was introduced.     Therewere further heavy falls of snow early in March, and these weresucceeded by a rapid thaw and a record March rainfall.      In theresult some 700,000 acres in England and Wales were inundatedby floods and a further two million acres were waterlogged.Hardly any field work was possible in March, and     it was only possible to begin in a small way in April owing to flooding andwaterlogging.     By the middle of April therefore sowing andcultivations were nearly two months behind schedule, andalthough favourable weather since then has allowed some over-taking of arrears, there still remains a substantial volume ofwork to complete in June and July, which normally would Jaavebeen out of the way a month earlier.     There has been a parallelhold-up in agricultural operations in Scotland.11, The second is that the material advantages which were expected in the industrial field,  in the form of double-shift working and staggered hours, have not in fact been realised,and the farmers feel therefore, that they are. being asked to suffer disadvantages not imposed on any other class,12, When the Summer Time Bill was laid before parliament in March,  it was thought that, in order to lessen the   peakdemand on the electrical supply system, it would be necessaryfor industry to transfer a considerable proportion of electricallypowered processes outside normal working hours and that inconsequence many firms would work an evening shift.      Subsequentexperience has shown that, while for the winter months a verylarge transfer will be necessary, the position during the summer months may not require such extensive measures and further that,at any rate during the summer months, the majority of firmsprefer to adopt other measures to reduce their day time consumptionof electricity rather than working evening shifts.13, The Electricity Sub-Committee of the Joint consultative committee, which was set up to examine the measures necessary toreduce peak/&apos;industrial loads on the electricity supply system andto advise and assist Regional Boards for Industry in this matter,recently submitted its report.14, The Sub-Committee recommended that during the summer months the measures, already taken to transfer some of the peakindustrial load from normal working hours to off-peak hours mustbe continued.      These measures originally aimed at a reduction ofone-third in the day-time industrial load, but the exact targetvaried between districts.      Since March a considerable number of firms have abandoned the measures which, they originally took inthis connection, - .15, For.the winter months the Sub-Gommittee recommendedthat industry should transfer enough of its load to off-peak. .hours to ensure that the maximum industrial load between the
inhours of 8 a.m.  and 4.30 p.m. would not at any time exceed two-thirds of the maximum industrial load during the correspondingperiod of 1946/47.16, The times at which work so transferred would, he carried out was left to individual firms to decide, hut amongthe methods suggested &quot;by the Sub-Committee the following wererelevant:-(a) Staggering of the day shift, resulting in there being an evening shift;(b) Rota systems, under which groups of firms foregothe use of electricity in turn for, in some instances, one day a week.      To make up for all or part of the loss of production therebyoccasioned, some firms have made a practice of overtime working in the evenings.17. Statistics are not available showing the hours duringwhich firms and industry carry out their work, and consequently it is impossible to produce an accurate estimate of the amountof work which has been transferred to evening shifts, and which,therefore, benefits from double summer time.,18. The indirect evidence available however indicates that, while immediately after the crisis in February a substantial number of firms adopted alternative methods of working, at present only a very small proportion are, in fact, transferring a part oftheir normal day time work to evening shifts.    -A few more may consider doing so during the summer months as a result of theElectricity Sub-Committee&apos;s report,  and on these firms theretention of double summer time would have some psychologicallyencouraging effect.19. Plans have been drawn up by many industries which wouldresult, if   put into operation, in the transfer of a considerably greater proportion of work to evening shifts.      It is unlikely,however, that these plans will be operated until the autumn.      Atpresent their implementation is delayed partly by a feeling thatduring the summer the urgency is not so great, and that they areconsequently unnecessary,  and partly owing to lack ^f agreement on the conditions (e. g, rates of wages) under which these plans .would operate.gO, At present, therefore, the Value of double summer timeto industry is largely psychological,  since the number of workers on evening shifts who benefit from it is not probably very large.Reversion to single summer times  however, would almost certainly have -a bad effect, not only on the relatively small number of firms who are at present operating evening shifts,  and.who it isessential should continue to do so, but on the much larger number who,  it is hoped, are drawing up plans for the winter andwho might interpret a relaxation of the measures adopted for the summer months as an indication that the prohlem of transferringwork to off-peak hours as a whole was no longer urgent.
21, y::0y.\   Having regard to the relative needs of agricultureand industry, the Ministry-of Labour would not, I am informed,raise any objection to a reversion from Double Summer Time ata date earlier than 10th August provided a month&apos;s notice isgiven of the intended change.      The Ministry of Fuel and power would also not oppose an earlier reversion to Single Summer .Time.G.R.A.10, Downing Street, S.WY 1.,2nd June, 1947.
