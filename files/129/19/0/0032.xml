190Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1947SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (47) 18216th June, 1947CABINETCRIMINAL JUSTICE bill memorandum by the Home secretary at their meeting on 7th March (L.P. (47) 8th Meeting, Minute 4) the lord presidents Committee considered the annexed memorandum (L.P. (47) 39) onthe Criminal Justice Bill. At the meeting the Lord Chancellor expressed somemisgivings about certain provisions of the Bill which seemed to him to be undesirable, particularly in view of the increasing number of serious crimescommitted by juveniles. I have had some further discussion with the LordChancellor since the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee. We haveminimised our differences and the remaining substantial divergence of opinion between us is in regard to the proposal to abolish the powers of Courts to passsentences of corporal punishment. The Lord Chancellor remains of the viewthat this is not an.appropriate time to introduce this particular amendment ofthe criminal law. My own view on the matter is that it would be impossible to drop this provision which was included in the 1938 Bill and passed committee stage owing to the support of Labour members.The drafting of the Bill, which is to be ready for introduction at thebeginning of next Session, has now reached an advanced stage, and I should beglad to have the approval of my colleagues to the proposals outlined in the attached memorandum in order that the drafting of the Bill should be completed.J. C. E,Home Office, S.W.1,16th June, 1947.[33763]b
ANNEX[L.P. (47) 391. [2nd March, 1947]cabinet lord Presidents CommitteeCRIMINAL JUSTICE bill memorandum by the Home Secretary1. The Criminal Justice Bill introduced by Sir Samuel Hoare (now ViscountTemplewpod) in 1938 received general support from all parties in the house and had passed Committee Stage when the outbreak of war prevented its further progress. It was at the time regarded as a measure long overdue, and it excited no party controversy. Those who have given special study to the question of penalreform and the treatment of offenders represent that a measure dealing withthis subject should be introduced as soon as possible.;. 2. The provisions of the Bill of 1938 have been carefully reviewed. In thelight of further consideration and of experience since it was introduced, thereare many respects in which the proposals in the Bill can be improved upon, orrequire amendment. I give below a broad outline of the lines upon which Ipropose that a new Criminal Justice Bill should be framed; the main differences between these proposals and those in the 1938 Bill are set out in the appendix to this memorandum. /3.   The subject matter of the Bill falls under six heads  (1) Amendment of the law relating to the probation of offenders.(2) Restrictions on the imprisonment of young persons.(3) Alternatives to imprisonment for young persons.(4) Provisions relating to persistent offenders&quot;.(5) Changes in the penal system and amendments of the criminal law., (6) Administrative changes.Amendment of the law relating to probation of offenders4. The purpose of the proposals under this head is in the main to con-solidate the existing law with minor amendments which experience has shown to be necessary, but it is proposed also (as in the 1938 Bill) to give a courtpower to include in a probation order, with the offenders consent, where thecourt is satisfied on medical evidence that the offender&apos;s mental condition, though not justifying his certification as a lunatic or mental defective, is such as torequire treatment, a provision requiring him to submit to such treatment for aperiod not exceeding twelve months. Power will also be given for such a provi-sion to be inserted by a court, with the offender&apos;s consent; on medical evidence,in a probation order already made, and also fOr the variation or cancellation ofsuch a provision, as may be required.A valuable development of the probation system has been the exercise bycourts of their power to include in a probation order iii appropriate cases a requirement: that the offender shall reside either in a probation home, where he is given suitable training, or in a probation hostel, from which he goes out to work daily.   Probation homes and hostels are established anjdj managed by
private persons and societies, and payment is made by the. local, authority (thepayment ranking for Exchequer grant) for the maintenance of persons requiredto reside in them as a condition of probation. There is scope for a much moreextended provision of such homes and hostels. The Bill of 1938 proposed togive power to local authorities to finance the establishment or enlargement ofhomes and hostels, but it is now proposed that such financial assistance shall begiven direct by the State in the first instance, the expenditure being met in part by subsequent contributions by the local authority; and that probation homes andhostels shall be subject to rules made by the Secretary of State as to their regula-tion and management which may include a requirement of approval, by theSecretary of State of the person appointed to be in charge. The effect of theseproposals will be to give the State the initiative in arranging for the establish-ment of probation, homes and hostels, and to secure the maintenance of properstandards of management.Restrictions on the imprisonment of young persons5. The Departmental Committee on the treatment of young offendersemphasised the importance of avoiding the committal of young persons to prisonwhether on remand or on sentence. Familiarity with prison conditions maynot only in itself be harmful to a youthful offender; it may also result in hishaving less apprehension of imprisonment in future, and so gravely weaken the deterrent effect of the sanction of imprisonment. It is proposed in the Bill to restrict both the imposition of sentences of imprisonment on youthful offendersand their committal to prison on remand or awaiting trial.(1) Imposition of imprisonment by a courtUnder the existing law a court may not order a person under the age of14 to be imprisoned; and may not order a person under the age of 17 to beimprisoned unless the court certifies that the offender is too unruly or too depravedto be detained in a remand home (the maximum period for which detention in aremand home may be ordered is one month).It is proposed to provide :-(i) that a court of assize or quarter sessions shall not impose imprisonmenton a person appearing to the court to be under 16 years of age;;ii) that a court of summary jurisdiction shall not impose imprisonmenton a person appearing to the court to be under 17 years of age;(iii) that a court of summary jurisdiction shall not impose imprisonmenton a person appearing to the court to be under 18 years of age if itcould order him to be detained in a detention centre (see paragraph below);(iv) that a court, whether a court of summary jurisdiction, assize, or quarter sessions, shall not impose imprisonment on a person under 21 unless,after obtaining and considering information as to the circumstances,including the offenders character, it is of the opinion that no othermethod of dealing with him is appropriate;&quot; (v) that power should be given to prohibit by Order in Council courts of summary jurisdiction from sentencing to imprisonment persons under21, or such lower age as may be specified in the Order any such order to be laid before Parliament in draft.(2) Committal to prison on remand or awaiting trialUnder the existing law a person under the age of 17, if remanded orcommitted for trial in custody, must be sent to a remand home unless the courtcertifies that he is too unruly or too depraved to be detained in a remand home.A person over the age of 17 remanded or committed for trial in custody can onlybe sent to prison.It is proposed to provide for the setting up of State remand centres whichwill take those persons under 17 who are at present sent to prison, on remandor committal for trial, on a certificate of unruliness or depravity, and also allpersons between the age of 17 and 21 who are remanded or committed for trialin custody. These centres will be set up in various parts of the country as.opportunity occurs, and accordingly it is proposed to provide that courts in thearea concerned shall be notified When a remand centre is available for their area,and on receipt of such notification they shall be prohibited from sending persons under 21 to prison on remand or committal for trial.[33763] ;!   - &apos; b 2
, 6. Alternatives to imprisonment for young personsIf young offenders are to be kept out of prison it is essential that alternative methods of treatment should be available. The alternatives generally available at present are :- &apos;(i) Binding over;(ii) Probation order, with or without a condition of residence;.  -.   (iii) Fine;(iv) For persons up to 17, committal to an Approved School, or detentionin a remand home for not more than a month;(v) For persons between. 16 and 23, detention in a Borstal Institution.There are many cases in which the first three methods are inadequate, andthe last two methods inappropriate to the offender. It is proposed to providespecial institutions, called detention centres, in which persons between 14 and 21may be sentenced to be detained for a period of three months or, exceptionally,up to six months. The purpose of sentences of detention in detention centres isto provide a means of dealing with the young offender who does not require thetraining provided in an Approved School or Borstal, but needs to be pulled upmore sharply than can be achieved by fining or making a probation order. Thispunishment is intended to be primarily deterrent, since effective training couldnot be attempted in so short a time. The basis of the treatment will thereforebe brisk discipline and hard work, but the staff will be selected and trained witha view to bringing to bear such educative and reformative influences as are practicable. These centres will be set up gradually throughout the country, and where a court of summary jurisdiction has been notified that a centre is availableto which it may commit offenders, the court will be prohibited from sentencingto imprisonment any person under the age of 18 (see paragraph 5 (1) (iii) above).The proposal in the Bill of 1938 for the establishment of compulsoryattendance centres where young offenders would be required to attend afterworking hours, has been dropped, as further consideration has shown that therewould be insuperable difficulties in giving practical effect to it. similar difficulties have led to the abandonment of the proposal in the 1938 Bill to empowerCourts to order offenders under 17 to be detained overnight in police stations onnot more than three occasions.The Bill of 1938 also gave powers for the establishment of residentialinstitutions for young offenders to be known as Howard Houses, from whichthe offenders would go out to their daily work. It is now considered that theintention of this provision will be better achieved by a more extended provision and use of probation homes and hostels, which the proposals under paragraph above are designed to assist, and accordingly the proposals relating to HowardHouses have been dropped.7. Provisions relating to persistent offendersThe existing law provides that a person who, having been sentenced to penal servitude, is found by a jury to be a habitual criminal may be sentenced to a term of preventive detention of from 5 to 10 years. A charge of being a habitualcriminal may not be included in an indictment without the consent of theDirector of Public Prosecutions, and a person may not be found by a jury tobe a habitual criminal unless the jury find on evidence that he has at least three times previously been convicted of a crime and is leading persistently adishonest or criminal life. It is a defect of the existing system that a sentence of preventive detention can only be passed in addition to a sentence of penal servitude, and this is one reason why sentences of preventive detention are rarelypassed at present.The Departmental Committee on Persistent Offenders recommended thatthere should be two types of sentence of detention: one of from 2 to 4 years,suitable to less hardened offenders, with a view both to the protection of thepublic and to the provision of the training and discipline calculated to. check the offenders&apos; criminal propensities, and one of from 5 to 10 years for hardenedoffenders, with a view not only to remedial treatment but to their relegation fromsociety for a prolonged period.It is proposed to follow these recommendations in the provisions of the bill and to provide for two forms of sentence for persistent offenders, one whosepurpose will be the training and. if possible, the reformation of the offender,
-which it is proposed to call &apos;&apos;extended training,&apos;&apos;.and the other, which will be primarily custodial in character and intended for hardened offenders (thoughthe possibility of training will not.be excluded) to be termed &quot;preventivedetention.&quot; Some of the offenders in the latter, category may require, for theprotection of society, to be segregated from society for an even longer period than ten years, and it is therefore proposed to provide for a maximum sentence of preventive detention of fourteen years.A sentence of extended training will be for not less than two or more than four years, and may be imposed on any person over 21 convicted on indictment ofan offence for which a sentence of two years&apos; imprisonment or more may be passed,and having at least two previous convictions of offences for which, on convictionon indictment, such a sentence could be passed. A sentence Of preventive detentionwill be for five to fourteen years, and may be imposed on a person over 30 whois convicted on indictment&apos; of an offence for which a sentence of two years&apos;imprisonment or more may be passed, and has at least three previous convictions on indictment of offences for which a sentence of two years or more could havebeen passed, and has, for at least two of these, been sentenced to imprisonment.Borstal training, or extended training.8. Changes in the penal system and amendments of the criminal law(1) The most important provisions under this head are the abolition of hardlabour, of the &quot; Triple Division &quot; of offenders, and of penal servitude.The distinction between imprisonment with and imprisonment without hardlabour has long ceased to have any practical effect. The conception of hard labour is a survival of the old days of solitary confinement and labour on the crank andtreadmill. Solitary confinement has long been abolished, and nowadays all prisoners who are fit for labour are employed in association on work of onekind or another, and the nature of the work depends upon what is available atthe particular prison and not on the prisoners classification. The StatutoryRules make no distinction at all between the treatment of prisoners sentenced to&quot; hard labour &quot; and others. It is accordingly proposed to abolish imprisonmentwith hard labour.It is also proposed to abolish the statutory classification of convictedprisoners into offenders of the First, Second and Third Divisions, which has long been superseded in practice by methods of classification designed not only toprevent contamination, but to take account of all the circumstances of the indi-vidual case.There as now no distinction in the conditions under Which a sentence of imprisonment and a sentence of penal servitude is served, except in so far asit is necessary to adapt these conditions to the requirements of longer sentences,and many convicts in fact serve their sentences in local, not in convict prisons.It is accordingly proposed (as recommended by the Departmental Committee onPersistent Offenders) to abolish penal servitude. This involves the abolition of release on conditional licence, popularly known as &quot; ticket-of-leave.&quot; It isproposed in substitution for this system to give courts power in certain caseswhere they pass a sentence of twelve months or more to require the offender tokeep an appointed society informed of his address. If the offender fails to doso he may be required to keep the police informed of his address and reportto the police in the same way as a convict on licence under the existing law.The effect of these changes will be that there will in future be only one form of prison sentence, namely, imprisonment, and the nature of the treatmentof an offender sentenced to imprisonment will be determined according to thecharacter, record and requirements of the individual by the prison authorities,who will under the Bill be given full powers to classify and manage their estab-lishments so as to secure the individual treatment of offenders.(2) It is proposed, in accordance with the recommendation of the Depart-mental Committee on Corporal Punishment, to abolish the powers of courts topass sentences of corporal punishment. In the Committee on the 1938 Bill thisproposal was resisted by a majority of the Conservatives on the Committee. Itwas supported.by the Labour members. The power to impose corporal punish-ment for certain grave offences against prison discipline will be retained, butit is proposed to limit the amount of such punishment to the maximum recdm-mended by the Committee, viz., 18 strokes of the cat or birch in the case ofa prisoner over 21, and 12 strokes of the birch in the case of a prisoner under 21.(3) In 1936 by Order in Council under the Prevention of Crime Act,. 1908,the limit of age within which an offender could be sentenced to Borstal detention
t6was raised from 21 to 23. Experience has shown that the application of Borstaltraining to this age-group is not wholly,successful. These are mature young;men, many of them married and with families&apos;, who have often served severalprison sentences., They must be segregated from the younger offenders, and to treat them as a group by themselves has bad results-they need the steadyinginfluence of older men. It is accordingly proposed to revert to the age limit of21 for Borstal training. The young men of this age group will in future, if they receive. sentences of suitable length, be trained with older prisoners in theTraining Centres for adults; some of them may qualify for thenew sentence ofextended training (see paragraph 7 above).(4) It is proposed to give courts of summary jurisdiction power, where theyare satisfied of the guiltof an offender, to order, if they think it necessary, medicalenquiry and report on his mental condition before determining the method ofdealing with him; and also, if satisfied by the evidence of medical practitionersthat the offender is of unsound mind, to make a reception order under the LunacyAct, 1890.(5) It is also proposed to make various amendments of the criminal law inprocedural and other matters in which experience has shown the existing law tobe defective.A administrative Changes9. The Bill will also make provision in regard to various matters of adminis-tration, the most important of which is the transfer of the management andcontrol of Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum from the Home Office to theBoard of Control. ;10. There are two issues upon which controversy is likely to centre inconnection with these proposals. The first is the abolition of the powers of courts to pass sentence of corporal punishment. This was the subject of a unanimousrecommendation by the Departmental Committee on Corporal Punishment which reported in 1938 after a most ca exhaustive enquiry into the whole subject. I propose that the new Bill, like the Bill of 1938, should contain aprovision to carry out this recommendation.The second issue is the question of the abolition or suspension of capital punishment. During the Committee Stage of the 1938 Bill an amendment was moved to suspend the death penalty for a period of five years. The Select Com-mittee on Capital Punishment, 1929-30, recommended the abolition of capital punishment for an experimental period of five years, and an amendment in this sense is likely to be moved if a new Criminal Justice Bill is introduced. I would propose that any such amendment should be resisted on the ground that it isinappropriate that such a far-reaching change in the law should be included in a criminal Justice Bill, and that, if any such change in the law were to be effectedit should be after full consideration in a separate Bill dealing solely with thissubject.11. I should be glad to have the approval of the Committee for the proposals  have outlined above. -- J. C. E.Home Office, S.W.1,2nd March, 1947.
