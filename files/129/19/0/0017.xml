(47) 16728th May, 1947CABINETIMPORT PROGRAMME 1947-48Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have repeatedly warned my colleagues-most recently in OP. (47) 100 that we were racing through our United States dollar credit at a reckless pace,and that they should be prepared to take hard and difficult, but necessary,decisions in the early future. -The attached memorandum by the Treasury on the Import Programme for1947-48 brings us face to face with these decisions. .2. The Treasury originally proposed a cut of  200 millions in the import programmes submitted by the Departments, of which  150 millions was on&apos; food(mainly hard currency). (As explained in paragraph 12 Of the Treasury Paper,the programme of the Ministry of Food was designed to improve the standard of consumption above the 1945-^46 level.) This proposal was designed to carryforward to June 1948 $800 millions of unused North American credits. This,with our reserves, would have enabled us to finance a similar, and no worse, import programme for 1948-49. A preliminary review of these proposals was madeby a group of Ministers,, and the proposals were remitted for further considera-tion at the official level. As a result, a revised proposal has been put forward for consideration by the Cabinet, namely that we should make a cut of only 80 millions in the food programme, all in hard currency. The other cutsoriginally proposed would stand. This would mean a hard currency deficit overthe next twelve, months of more than $2 billions.3. As a result, we shall carry forward, at June 1948, not $800 millions ofthe credits, but at most $500 millions. That is all that will be left of the originalcredits of $5 billions. And for the import year 1948-49, even assuming afavourable trend of import prices, and success in forcing our exports against a.possible sag in the sellers&apos; market, we cannot expect a hard&apos;currency deficit of less than $1,250-1,500 millions.4. If, therefore, we accept only the modified cut of  80 millions in the food programme, we are running a very grave risk that in 1948-49 we might have tomake far more drastic cuts in our imports of food, and also of raw materials,which would immediately affect employment and our export income, unless wesupplement our reserves of hard currencies either by increased, exports or by further assistance from the Americans.5. I ask my colleagues to pay special attention to paragraph 33 of theTreasury Paper. Action on these lines must be pressed forward at once, witha full sense of urgency.  Otherwise we are sunk.6. As regards further assistance from the Americans, I will state my viewsorally.   But we should certainly take the earliest opportunity of making the-[33667]--,.;;,- . *      . ..-b:&apos;
whole position clear to them. We are entitled to point out to them that all the assumptions on which the original line of credit was negotiated have beenfalsified: (a) The credit was not as large as we originally asked for and thought necessary.(b) Since then, costs in the United States have risen rapidly.  The wholesaleprice index in the United States has risen 40 per cent, since december 1945.(c) Owing to the slow recovery of the non-dollar world, we cannot getconvertible currency for our exports and we remain far more dependentfor supplies on the American Continent than we foresaw.(d) We are still having to use large quantities of our scanty dollars, not forour own people but for the Germans.The net result is that not only is this country having to buy more, and at higher prices, from the Americans than we had contemplated, but that we are not alone in this position. Already &quot; strong countries,&quot; such as Sweden and Canada, facedrastic decisions about their dollar imports. The shortage of dollars is a worldshortage, and only the Americans have it in their power to put it right.7.   To sum up, I ask my colleagues for the following decisions : (1) The food Import Programme for 1947-48 to be reduced by at least 80 millions from hard currency . sources. The reduced food programme should be authorised for the next six months only. the subsequent six months must be reviewed in September in the lightof our foreign exchange position towards the end of this year.(2) Reduction of the other Import Programmes on the lines set out in theTreasury Paper.(3) An export target of 140 per cent, of 1938 volume to be reached by thesecond quarter of 1948.(4) The long-term proposals in the Treasury Paper to be pressed forwardvigorously.(5) An early approach to the Americans on the whole question.H. D.Treasury Chambers,28th May, 1947.Memorandum by the treasury the Balance of Payments Problem1. We now face a crisis in our external financial position which affects our ability to import our food and raw materials.At the end of May nearly half the two North American Credits will havebeen exhausted. We have $2 billions of the United States Credit and $570millions of the Canadian Credit ( 640 millions in all) left from the originaltotal of $5 billions.We have also  325 millions drawing rights on the International Monetary&quot;Fund. We can draw on these at a rate not exceeding  81 millions a year andsubject to limits on the amount we can draw at any time within a year. Wecannot count with certainty on being able to draw upon these monies, for theyare meant to meet a temporary situation and not a continuing disequilibrium.The Board of the Fund, acting on behalf of all the Members, including particu-larly the United States, are bound to scrutinise carefully the situation of anyMember which is drawing heavily.We have reserves, mainly of gold but including some dollars, of some  625millions. Ordinary prudence requires us to regard  250 millions of this reserveas a &quot; war chest &quot;-a reserve to meet ah unforeseen crisis in international affairs.Reserves are meant to be drawn upon at time of need, but they are our finaldefence and we must handle them with great caution. Moreover, they are thecentral reserve, not only for ourselves but also for the sterling, area, and while we need not, perhaps, concern ourselves with the difficulties which will.confrontsome members of the sterling area, there are others, such as Australia, NewZealand and the Colonies, who will have to look to us to tide them over temporarydifficulties. In the uncertain Conditions of the next three or four years, the handling of our reserves will be of crucial importance.  The willingness of other
countries to sell to us for sterling will be influenced by the rate at which we are &quot;drawing upon these reserves; if they take alarm about our position they will want gold for their supplies.2.   Our balance of payments is worse since last October.   The followingevents have produced this : (i) 10 to 15 per cent, increase in world prices, equivalent to an extra importcost of  200 millions a year. This increase falls immediately upon us, but any corresponding upward adjustment of our export prices,even if it is assured, takes longer to produce results. On this latter point see paragraph 30 below. In any case, a rise in export pricesdoes not compensate the extra dollar cost of our imports,(ii) The fuel,crisis has cost us two months&apos; exports and has set back theexport drive by nine months; this is equivalent to a loss of exportincome of  200 millions in 1947. This estimate makes the favourableassumption that the end-1946 export level is regained by this autumn,and that by the second quarter of 1948, exports will have reached 140per cent, of 1938 volume.(iii) The losses suffered by United Kingdom agriculture have delayed the recovery of a major &quot;potential dollar saver.(iv) Political difficulties, war damage, and the coal shortage have delayedthe progress of recovery in Europe and the Far East; this delays theprospect of a switch to other sources of supply,(v) The cost of the restoration of Germany&apos;s economy, which is crucial to therestoration of Europe, has increased and may increase still-further.(vi) There is a cumulative dollar shortage showing itself in the world evenin strong countries such&apos; as Sweden and Canada. This threatens tocreate a world economic crisis. The International Monetary Fundhas only just begun operations; only one small loan has yet been madeby the Reconstruction Bank.(vii) Quite recently the Canadians have informed us very confidentially thatthey are in acute difficulties about their United States dollar positionand they are unlikely to be able to allow us to draw upon the CanadianCredit as we need it.3. Last October it was hoped that the total deficit for 1947 would be about 200 millions. This was subsequently increased to  350 millions in the economic survey. On the, present import programme, however, the total deficit for theyear 1947 will be over  700 millions. On the import programmes as originallysubmitted (Appendix B), and. assuming a favourable course of exports (i.e,.,achievement of the target of 140 per cent, of 1938 volume by the second quarterof 1948), the deficit in,the second half of 1947 will be  400 millions and in thefirst half of 1948 will be  150 millions a total of  550 millions for the year mid-1947 to mid-1948.4. The hard currency deficit is even more serious, for half our imports comefrom hard currency sources. On the same basis as above, the hard currency deficit for mid-1947 to mid-1948 will be about  650 millions. This would mean that theUnited States and Canadian credits would be exhausted by the middle of 1948(Appendix C). ,5. We dare not take this risk. We have no hope of being able to stand onour own feet so early as the middle of 1948. We might by then get some relief from lower prices, but this would signal the end of the sellers&apos; market for our exports as well. European and Far Eastern production will gradually recover,but this cannot relieve us of the bulk of our hard currency expenditure by the year1948. With the credits gone we should be forced into catastrophic import cuts of food and raw materials.6. The crisis which is coming upon us differs in kind from any other we have experienced. Currency depreciation or adjustment or repudiation of externalindebtedness provides no way out. Our overseas income is insufficient for our overseas needs. Our food consumption and our industrial activity depends upon our ability to export. We are not yet, exporting nearly enough. Superimposedon this is the hard currency problem which can be solved only by a recovery of thenon-dollar world; this is not yet in sight. No juggling can dispose of these twobasic facts which will condition our life for the next few years.This crisis has been developing inexorably since the early years of the war andhas been concealed successively by lend-lease, borrowing for sterling and the[33667] b 2
United States and Canadian credits. We have been living beyond our means, notonly in consumption levels, but also in overseas financial commitments. We are faced now with a reduction in the whole of our standard of living, or a supremeeffort for five years which will enable us to restore our pre-war standards withprospect of improvement.The rapid worsening of our position requires immediate short-term measures- a sharp cut in imports and an increase in the proportion of our output whichgoes in exports.Cut in the Import programme. The first Treasury proposal was for ian immediate cut of  200 millions(of which  150 millions would fall on food) in the import programme for the yearmid-1947 to mid-1948. The purpose of this was to enable us to carry forward tothe year mid-1948 to mid-1949 some $800 millions of unused North AmericanCredits. These, together with our reserves, would have enabled us to finance a fairly tolerable import programme for that year. It must be emphasised that theimmediate position for mid-1947 to mid-1948 is not the crucial issue, for wecould buy practically all the imports we could secure if we choose to use up thewhole of the North American Credits for this purpose. But this would bringcatastrophe in mid-1948 to mid-1949.8. It was proposed that the cut should fall almost exclusively on the. hard currency imports, for these are a direct and immediate charge on our reserves.For this purpose the hard currencies are shown in Appendix E and a further sub-division is made between the other sources of supply. It must be emphasised,however, that certain sources of supply are hardly less difficult than the so-called hard currency sources. It is entirely wrong to think that imports from non-dollar sources cost us nothing; indeed, we cannot get imports from any sourceexcept by sending exports or by paying dollars or by borrowing from that source.9. A major cause of this crisis is the rise in import prices. The proposed reduction in our purchases should have a useful effect in easing the pressure in world markets. This cannot affect the price of our imports much in 1947-48,but it has an important potential effect upon 1948^49. The cut should likewiseease the demand upon our shipping and increase its foreign exchange earnings and relieve the pressure on the freight market.10. A cut of the scale proposed cannot be secured by pruning &quot;non-essentials.&quot; About 50 per cent, of the hard currency import programme repre-sents food; 40 per cent, represents raw materials, petroleum (other than for privatemotoring), machinery and other supplies for industry and agriculture; only 10 percent, represents the so-called &quot; luxuries &apos;&apos; tobacco, films, private motoring,consumer goods. Even if decisions were taken literally to stop smoking, close thecinemas, prohibit private motoring, &amp;c, this would save only about  80 millions a year.11. The Treasury proposal was discussed with the Departments principally concerned with particular reference to the effect of the proposed foodcut of  150 millions. The view was taken that a cut of this scale would be toosevere and an alternative proposal has been made that the cut should be 80 millions, all from hard currency sources. The other proposals made by theTreasury have been accepted departmentally. The following table shows thevarious proposals : Food-&quot; Basic&quot;Total m.hard currency m.Cut proposedby the   Alternativey   Treasury   proposals m.  m.&quot; Supplementary1166098742452332531515080Raw materialsPetroleumMachineryGoods for industry i Seeds and animalsConsumer goodsTobaccoFilms......267493612210461525425422214321431,776879200130
On the alternative proposal, the cuts must all be made on the hard currency -programmes.   The sayings must be made, as far as possible, in the second halfof 1947, and the position will, in any case, be reviewed again in September, whenthe firm programme requires to be fixed for the first half of 1948.12.   Food. On the alternative proposal of a cut of  80 millions in food from hard currency sources, the lay-out of consumption might be as follows : (i) An immediate cut to Is. 2d. in the meat ration, the ration to remain at this level until the end of June 1948. The carcase meat portion tobe Is. for most of the period, but reduced to lOd. for about two to threemonths. The recent reduction of one-third in manufacturing meat tocontinue until the end of June 1948.(ii) Maintenance of the present fats and sugar ration.(iii) Abolition of bread rationing and unrestricted flour consumption.(iv) Maintenance of the present tea ration (unless cut necessary on supply grounds)^ A 50 per cent, cut in coffee compared with the present rateof distribution.(v) Restoration of the bacon ration from 2 oz. to 3 oz. during January toJune 1948.(vi) The usual increase in the cheese ration from 2 oz. to 3 oz. during thewinter months.(vii) Consumption of dried eggs, together with shell eggs, to be equivalentto 98 eggs per person in 1947-48 compared with 87 eggs per person in1946-47. Stocks of dried eggs to be exhausted by June 1948. In1948-49 to rely entirely on shell eggs (estimated at 86 per person),(viii) Increased supply of liquid milk with the same quantity of condensed milk distributed during the winter of 1947-48 as was distributed last winter. Issue of milk powder would have to be discontinued sometime during 1947-48.(ix) Maintain supplies of points canned meat and canned fish,(x) 40 per cent, reduction in dried fruit and 62 per cent, reduction incanned fruit, compared with 1946-47.(xi) Citrus fruit at about the same level as 1946-47. A 66f per cent,reduction in apples compared with 1946-47 (no imported applesduring the winter). 50 per cent, increase in bananas, three times as many tomatoes and 25 per cent, more of other fresh fruit than in1946-47.(xii) Considerable increase in fresh fish consumption and a 25 per cent, cut in poultry compared with 1946.This programme would provide a total caloric intake approximately at the1946 level. The effect of the alternative proposal compared with the cutoriginally proposed by the Treasury is to restore a number of important items andin particular increases next winter in the bacon and cheese ration and the main-tenance of supplies of points canned meat and canned fish. It must be rememberedin considering this programme that some  40 millions of the  442 millions hard currency food programme represents improvements in consumption and that thereis a substantial quantity of supplies from other sources-some  75 millions which will contribute to improve the standard of consumption above the 1945-46level. On the alternative proposal, the total food programme for 1947-48 wouldbe some  790 millions compared with&apos;  677 millions (at lower prices) in the yearmid-1946 to mid-1947.13. Raw Materials. Our proposed cut of  25 millions is only 4 per cent,of the total programme and less than 10 per cent, of the hard currency programme.We have deliberately proposed only a small cut as compared with the cut on foodbecause upon imports of raw materials depend employment and our capacity to earn our export income.To achieve this cut would involve certain specific economies, such as thelimitation of the size of newspapers to four pages for an indefinite period. But,broadly, the position is that imports of basic raw materials, such as steel and timber, would still be possible to the limit of availability under the proposed cut.The imports of raw materials would be  584 millions compared with 448 millions (at lower prices) in the year mid-1946 to mid-1947. If the quantities of basic raw materials estimated to be available have been under-estimated, the position can be reviewed again at the September import programmedetermination in the light of the development of our financial and economic position.
14. Petroleum.- We propose that the import of motor spirit be reduced by500,000 tons, He., a reduction of 10 per cent, in consumption below the programmedlevel. This would save  4 millions and consumption would only be reduced tosome 90 per cent, of pre-war.It would not be practicable to secure this reduction by curtailing the basicration for private motor cars without a much stricter control and limitation ofthe petrol made available for commercial transport and certain types of publicpassenger transport [e.g., charabancs). It is the issue of petrol for commercialtransport which is the source of the present Black Market.To control and limit petrol issued for commercial transport would require a large extra staff and even so it would be difficult to secure effective control.Moreover, any such control and limitation would of course be criticised on theground that it was interfering with a basic economic service and need. but without an effective control of petrol for commercial purposes it is impossibleto prevent a large Black Market in petrol and to secure a saving in imports; andthe Black Market would become more lucrative and extensive if the present basicration for private motor cars and cycles were reduced.In spite of these difficulties we think that the Ministry of Fuel and Powerand Ministry of Transport should endeavour to devise a scheme which would yield.the saving in imports of 500,000 tons of motor spirit on the assumption thatit will have to continue for at least three years, even though it will mean asubstantial increase in staff.15- Machinery. It is proposed to maintain the existing relatively liberalimport policy for machinery. There still appears to be some misunderstandingin industry about our willingness to provide hard currency for this purpose, andwe propose that our policy should be made absolutely clear to industry.16. Goods for Industry. A small cut is proposed which can best be achieved by normal administrative action through the Import Licensing Committee.17.   Seeds and Animals. No cut is proposed.18. Consumer Goods. We propose a cut of  2 millions on the hard currencyprogramme of  10 millions.  The programme is shown in IV (ii) of Appendix E.The token import policy should be maintained for the time being but noaddition should be made to the list.The cut should be achieved by tighter scrutiny by the Import LicensingCommittee and.importsof consumer goods generally should be kept very low.19. Tobacco. The size of the purchase from United States next autumnwill have to be re-examined in the light of the effect upon consumption of theincrease in duty. For the purposes of this programme, a saving of  14 millionsis envisaged, i.e., a purchase of some 175 million lbs. compared with an estimatedusage at the previous consumption rate of 260 million lbs. and the manufacturers&apos;proposal to buy 211 million lbs. and draw upon their stocks. Reduction of con-sumption has the dual effect of reducing the annual import requirements and increasing the value of the stocks in terms of years&apos; consumption. The extentto which stocks should be drawn down this year will depend largely uponcommercial considerations and the tactics of purchase, and if a smaller purchasethan allowed here proves desirable, this should not alter the amount of foreign exchange available for other programmes.20. Films. The Board of Trade estimates a reduction in the remittancesfor the year 1947-48 to  15 millions as compared with  17 millions in 1946.This results from British films winning more screen time at home. No significantnet earnings from British films in United States are expected in 1947 but thereare prospects of a gradual increase.We believe it impossible to justify a cut in food, tobacco, motor spirit, andraw materials, but no cut in United States dollar expenditure on films. A schemeis under discussion between the. Board of Trade and the Treasury with thepurpose of securing a saving of at least  3 millions in the year 1947-48 (thetime-lag makes a large immediate saving virtually impossible to achieve).21. Private Travel-Private travel is not included above but needs examina-tion. Expenditure in 1946 was  25 millions-about half to Eire and will expandappreciably in 1947. The technical difficulty of securing a cut is considerable.There can be no exchange restriction on movements to sterling area countries and this raises an acute problem, of non-discrimination.   In any case it will
be difficult to provide varying allowances for different destinations. Moreover,we hope to develop ah increasing income from tourism and we can hardly expect to secure this if we adopt a highly restrictive tourist policy ourselves. TouristAgencies operate on a two-way traffic.Moreover, unless we are prepared to restrict, facilities for travel, a cut inthe present allowance of  75 to, e.g.,  50 would only produce a saving of about 1 million. Most United Kingdom travellers abroad are modest people.22. Non^discrimination-^ will be impossible to carry out these programmeadjustments in a manner consistent with the strict terms of Article 9 of theAnglo-American Financial Agreement. If we buy from the easy sources ofsupply freely and restrict imports from United States and Canada, we are in breach of tine Agreement. That means that we could hot take supplies fromeasy currency sources because we could not afford to take them from. UnitedStates and Canada. -The problem arises on this programme with particular force in relation tofruit. It is therefore of great urgency that we should obtain the agreement ofthe United&apos; States Administration to a less restrictive interpretation of theprovisions of the Agreement. It is proposed that we approach the americans in a number of specific cases of this kind; in general it should be possible tojustify such suggestions as we put forward by reference to the clause in theAgreement which permits us to discriminate in order to assist countries whoseeconomies have been disrupted by war.23. Government Eticpenditwe. Government expenditure is examined inAppendix D. We must again draw the attention of the Committee to the factthat gross military expenditure is of the order of  140 millions in 1947--48 ofwhich some  30 millions, nearly all on oil and food is equivalent to hard currencyexpenditure. The general context of this report makes it doubtful how longwe can afford to continue expenditure. on that scale. This, however, raisesquestions of Government policy outside the scope of this report. This expenditure is now being examined by the Service Departments, in co-operation with theTreasury.Another part of our overseas expenditure is on Germany which will costus at least  80 millions about half in dollars in the year 1947-48. We make no recommendation on this for the whole matter will doubtless be considered when the Foreign Secretary makes ihis report on the consequences of the moscow conference.Immediate Increase of Exports24. The short-term export target was fixed in the Economic Survey white paper at 140 per cent, of 1938 volume, to be reached by the end of this year.The analysis in this paper postulates that this level is reached in the second quarter of 1948. This, at the very least, must be made certain. Export targetsshould be arranged to secure a rate of 125 per cent, of 1938 volume by the endof 1947 and of 140 per cent, by the second quarter of 1948.The full implications of this are still being examined, but it is clear thatto lift exports to this level in this time will involve grim decisions. Much ofthe export field is already restricted by our pressing home needs (e.g., coal, steel,certain types of machinery and equipment). This means that really drastic action is needed elsewhere.25 Textiles. The present estimated yield of textile exports at the endof 1947 is an annual rate of  170 millions, compared with  220 millions at theend of 1946.We propose that sufficient production be allocated to exports to give a rate(at the same prices) of  250 millions a year at the end of 1947, and that special consideration should be paid to exports to hard currency areas. Textiles areour readiest earners of hard currency they are the British goods which can Usold in Canada and United States and Argentina.This is compatible with a 48-coupon ration from November onwards. Thiswould, represent a continuation of the present rate, the current ration havingbeen recently cut from 32 coupons for six: months to 32 coupons for eight months.A difference of 1 coupon for twelve months is equivalent to exports of  4 millions-or a^slightly higher figure if household textiles which do not come into the rationare included.&quot;Increase beyond this ration cannot be considered until the textile industriesachieve an increased production. &apos;
J526. Vehicles. The motor and cycle industry should contribute over  100millions a year to the target. To secure this would involve upward revision ofthe passenger car export proportion from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent., with similarincreases in motor cycles.and bicycles, and an increased export proportion for commercial vehicles (including buses). This may involve a system of prioritypermits for new purchases.27. Machinery, &amp;c.-1Yl&amp; division of the output of critical capital equip-ment between home and export is under discussion between the Departments.The home need is assuredly great, but we must emphasise the crucial part whichthis equipment plays in the total export pattern. This strengthens the claims ofthe engineering industry for a sufficient steel allocation, if necessary at the expenseof building.A reduction in the claims of the Services upon our engineering capacity, fora period of one year could give considerable assistance to exports.28. Consumer Goods. Exports of other consumer goods are of the order of 80 millions a year. In these, also, it will be necessary significantly to increasethe export proportion.29. Food and Drink. We propose that the ban on exports of certain pro-cessed foods and drink should be lifted; the lifting of the ban would give an extra  10 millions a year, at very little cost in imported material.30. Export Prices. The prices of our imports are rising faster than thoseof our exports, and there is some reason to believe that British manufacturers and merchants are not charging enough. In countries where there is general shortage, the local importer is getting a large rake-off between the landed priceof our exports and the ultimate buyer&apos;s price. The fault of this is often laidat our door. If we increase our export prices and the importers try to maintainthe same margin, this criticism may increase. We must also watch the ratiobetween our landed price and the landed price of other countries who are beginning to export against us, and the importance of establishing our exportssecurely m markets&apos; with some long-term prospects.This paper assumes an increase 0* 10 per cent, in the price of exports duringthe next twelve months. With the obvious qualifications above, we suggest thatthe Board of Trade should examine, as a matter of urgency, whether we are notselling our exports below the price which they could reasonably and steadily fetchSummary of Immediate Plan31. The immediate implications of the alternative proposal may besummarised as follows : (i) Cut in food as described in paragraph 12.(ii) Continuation of present clothing ration (unless production increases).(iii) Other cuts in manufactured goods for the home market, including news-papers, motor cars and household requisites.(iv) Cuts in petrol, tobacco and films.(v) To provide enough steel for steel-consuming exports (plus machinery,&amp;c, for United Kingdom) will interfere with housing and otherbuilding, and so will the cut in raw material imports.32. On the original proposals of the Treasury we could reasonably hope toreduce the hard currency deficit for 1947-48 to some  450 millions and in July1948 we should thus still have had some  200 millions of the United States and canadian Credits together with our reserves. We could then have reasonablyhoped to afford an import programme for 1948-49 of similar volume to that thenproposed for 1947-48. The alternative proposal worsens this position consider-ably. It means that instead of carrying forward  200 millions into the second half of 1948, we may only be able to carry forward, say,  125 millions. Further-more, since the original Treasury Memorandum which proposed the  200 millionscut was prepared, the position has continued to deteriorate and our reserveposition at the middle of next year is likely to be less favourable than we thenhoped.While the arguments for the alternative proposal are recognised and thedanger that a food cut of the scale proposed might have damaging effects uponindustrial production is understood, the fact remains that the alternative pro-posal runs serious risks for the 1948-49 import programme.
33. These additional risks for the future make it all the more urgent thatwe should immediately press forward the measures which are necessary to enable us to right our position. The crisis in our ability to buy food and raw materialswill continue until our export income is enough to meet our import needs. Nothingcan change this fact. - The following are the main things which must be done : (i) Coal. We must increase coal production so that it meets essential needsof home production and provides a reasonable volume for export. Coalis of fundamental importance to the whole matter. If we take riskson our import expenditure, we must make more certain of our exportincome.(ii) Power and Transport.- These other essentials to our whole economy are affected by supplies of coal and by supplies of steel which in turndepends upon coal.(iii) Agriculture-We must expand our agriculture as fast as possible aridparticularly expand livestock and other production which saves expen-sive dollar imports. For this purpose, housing in agricultural areas should have high priority and the industry should be given sufficientpriority for supplies of machinery. &amp;c.(iv) Building. We do not see how the production required to secure thenecessary volume of exports in the next twelve months can be obtainedwithout setting free some part of the resources of material and labour at present allocated to building,(v) Import-Saving Production. We must develop production in thiscountryof materials and other supplies which will save expensive hard currency imports. This should be done with the same determinationas the corresponding war-time measures for saving bulky imports.(vi) Alternative Sources of Supply.^-Departments are switching as far asthey can, but the important items in the import programme shouldonce more be re-examined and every effort made to create alternative sources of supply.(vii) Guidance of Exports: -This must continue to be pressed forward even at the cost of some disappointment to other old customers.  In parti-, cular we should do what we can to guide exports to Canada and latin america, especially Argentina.   These will, for the next few years,remain a large and indispensable source of supply.Conclusion34. The result of the original Treasury plan, as far as this can be predictedin a rapidly changing situation^ would have been-(i) To stop the immediate decline in our position.(ii) To create an essential margin, so that we should be able to avoidcatastrophic cuts in food and raw materials in the next two years.(iii) To allow time for the constructive proposals summarised in paragraph 33to begin to take effect.(iv) To help to carry us over the interval-the length, of which no one canforetell until the prices of our imports at last begin to fall.(v) To tide over the United States Presidential Election year without-  catastrophe, and to allow dollar starvation to reach the point wherethe Americans are driven, in their own interests, to produce moredollars.35. The alternative plan will contribute towards the same results, but the gain secured under each of these heads will be correspondingly less, and the risks of early disaster correspondingly greater.   :
APPENDIX ATHE RESULTS FOR 1946-471. The actual imports for the year 1946 worked out very closely accordingto programme, although this is to some extent deceptive in that the increases inErice meant that a significantly smaller volume of imports was brought in thanad been planned. The volume of imports was 65 per cent of 1938. The followingtable (in   millions) makes the comparison: Imports in Year 1946	/ awwaty	April	October		1946	1946	194.6	A dual	programme	programme	estimate	paymentsFood......	580	591	592	&quot;555Raw materials	380	360	373	351Tobacco	46	59	63	70Petroleum	37	37	55	62Other ...	69	70	80	63	1,112	1,117	1,163	1,1012.

The deficit wasfinanced largely by drafts of  275 millions on the United States and Canadiancredits, and partly by accumulation of sterling balances, &amp;c. A full capital account is given in the National Income White Paper.4. The import programme for the first half of 1947 was fixed in Octoberat  682 millions.   This is now estimated at  770 millions, as follows : First half of 1947October 1946   April 1947programme estimate m.  m.Food......      ...      ......            343 397Raw materials       ...      ...      ...            235 250Tobacco       ...      ...      ...      ...             22 25Manufactured goods       ...      ...             48 .58Petroleum products         ...      ...             26 31Seeds and animals ...      ...      ...               8^ 96821 770The food aud raw materials programmes are likely to cost more than programmed,partly because of increased prices and partly because supplies which failed&apos;toarrive in the second half of 1946 (when imports fell substantially below expecta- (tions) are expected to come in the first half of 1947. The increase in themanufactured goods imports is attributable almost entirely to increased available-bility of goods for industry, and particularly of textile yarns and manufactures.The increase in petroleum products primarily results from a sharp increase
1.1in prices. In the import programme as a whole, however, if previous experience is repeated, the excess over previous expectations is unlikely to be as great as now forecast.5. This increase in import cost, coupled with the effects of the fuel crisisupon our exports; is having a disastrous effect upon our balance of payments, asthe following&quot; forecast for the first half of 1947 shows: October 1946 April 1947estimate estimate m.  m.Imports         ...      ...      ...            -682 -785*Exports and re-exports     ...            + 615 1+525Other net expenditure       ...            - 55 - 65-122 -325* Including 15 for ship purchases.The net effect of the higher prices for imports and the loss of export income whichis expected to result from the fuel crisis is a deterioration of nearly  200 millions,in the half-year; -6. The total deficit is almost entirely a hard currency deficit. Last october the hard currency deficit was expected to exceed the total deficit; the difference,however, is not likely to be very marked in the first half of this year. However,we shall be drawing much more heavily on the United States and Canadiancredits than had been expected. At 30th June, 1947, we expect to have no morethan  650 millions of the two credits left, with a gold and dollar reserve of 650 millions. , ^ .-&apos;APPENDIX BTHE 1947-48 IMPjOET programme . Departmental requirements for the year July 1947 to June 1948 havebeen examined by the Exchange Requirements Committee, and are summarised in Appendix E.2. Food. The food programme is  870 millions, of which  755 millions is&quot;basic&quot; (i.e., required to maintain the 1945-46 consumption level, with someimprovements, e.g., in meat, sugar, fruits) and  115 millions &quot;supplementary.&quot;As we move forward from the base year, the distinction between &quot;basic&quot; and&quot; supplementary &quot; becomes increasingly artificial. The programme as a whole would : &apos;(i) Permit the abolition of bread rationing throughout the period,(ii) Maintain the present fat ration.(iii) Permit increase to 10 oz. in sugar ration.(iv) Maintain Is. Ad. meat ration to end-1947, and then cut to Is. 2d.(v) Permit increase to 3 oz. bacon ration at end-1947.(vi) Permit 3 bz. cheese ration next winter, with increased supplies ofprocessed milk. Supplies of liquid milk for consumers will continueto expand.(vii) Increase fresh fish consumption by about 25 per cent, and restore cannedfish consumption to immediate post-war level (i.e., substantially abovecurrent level).(viii) Increase egg distribution (shell and dried) from current level of 87 per head per year (and 98 in 1945-46) to 101.(ix) Large increase in fruit consumption, to 90 per cent, of pre-war incitrus fruit, 70 per cent, in apples, and 4 tins per head of canned fruit. *This programme represents-supplies which there is a good prospect of securing,and is based upon market estimates of prices.3. The programme of  870 millions contrasts with  555 millions in the calendar year 1946, and expected  677 millions in the year mid-1946 to mid-1947.[33667] . c 2
The volume of supplies represented by this import programme (i.e., value at constant prices) is 86 per cent, of 1938, compared with 63 per cent, of 1938 inthe year 1946. The price level is 260 per cent, of 1938, compared with 255 percent, in 1946. It will be seen, therefore, that two-fifths of the increased, cost over 1946 is represented by prices and the rest by increased quantities, partlyneeded because of the running down of stocks in 1946.4. Of the total of  870 millions,  442 millions comes from hard currencysources,  133 millions from intermediate sources, and  295 millions from easycurrency sources. The proportion from hard currency sources shows no reductioncompared with previous programmes. This follows from the continued absenceof supplies from Europe and the Far East, which leaves the Western Hemisphereas the most important source of supply.5. As sources of supply in the non-dollar world recover, the problem ofnon-discrimination will be real, for the United States supplies will in certain cases be cheaper than those from easier currency sources. This raises difficultynow on fruit, but the area of difficulty will widen, especially when it is necessaryto enforce drastic cuts on purchases from dollar sources.6. Raw Materials. The raw materials programme is  609 millions. Thisis framed on the assumption that raw materials, as far as they are physicallyavailable, are supplied to the full amounts which industry can absorb. TheMinistry of Supply and the Board of Trade have taken some account of the limitations created by fuel shortage, but their estimates are somewhat optimisticin that they in general postulate a rapid recovery and possibly a more rapidrecovery than the Board of Trade is implying in its export forecasts. On theother hand, it must be realised that a reduction in industrial activity becauseOf coal shortage will not automatically result in a reduction in required rawmaterial imports; indeed, setbacks in United Kingdom production of steel and paper, in particular, can increase import demand considerably. It is felt, there-fore, that no writing down should be done on this score. Nor is there any reasonto write down on grounds of lack of programmed supplies.7. The programme of  609 millions contrasts with  351 millions in the calendar year 1946, and expected  448 millions in the year mid-1946 to mid-1947.The volume of supplies represented by this import programme (i.e., value ofimports at constant prices) is about 88 per cent, of 1938, compared with 66 percent, in 1946. It will be seen, therefore, that two-thirds of the increased cost over 1946 is due to larger quantities, corresponding with the running down of stocks in 1946 and the expected higher industrial activity in 1947-48, and therest is represented by higher prices.8. Of the total of  609 millions,  276 millions comes from hard currencysources,  89 millions from intermediate sources, and  253 millions from easycurrency sources. The proportion from hard currency sources shows no sign ofdecreasing.9. Tobacco.-The tobacco programme is  52^ millions, framed on theassumption that supplies for a full 12 months&apos; consumption are brought in theUnited States auctions next September. Of the total  42^ millions would berepresented by the United States purchase.10. The rate of manufacture of tobacco is estimated in the year 1947-48 at28 million lbs. a month, of which 23^ millions would be for home consumption and 4J millions for export. Exports would be at a rate substantially in excessof pre-war. ,11. The programme provides for maximum supplies from Empire sources,but nevertheless 75 per cent, of consumption will be drawn from United States.12. The manufacturers have suggested a limitation of their purchases fromthe United States crop, and would propose to purchase 211 million lbs. comparedwith a requirement of 260 million lbs. for a full year&apos;s consumption. Extrastocks were purchased last year, and the manufacturers consider that this isa good opportunity to use them. The effect of this policy, given a maintenanceof present consumption, would be to reduce the stocks at end-September 1948to 7J months&apos; stock, which is the minimum for effective operation. This would reduce the cost of the United States purchase to S140 millions (which would begiven to the manufacturers as a quota) and the total cost of the programme to 49 millions. .
.13.   Manufactured Goods. The manufactured goods programme, allowing -for machinery, goods for industry, consumer goods (including token imports) and imports for re-export is  126 millions.  This is divided as follows ,(a) Machinery.. -The programmes for the two half-years are  20-4 millions and  21-5 millions respectively. This is tending to increase asdevelopment plans get under way, and it is likely to continue at ahigh level. The policy of the Ministry of Supply and the Board ofTrade is to grant import licences where like machinery is not readily available from United Kingdom production. The machinery is almostentirely from hard currency sources.(b) Goods for Industry-The programme provides  22-6 millions -and 22-1 millions in the two half-years, and it covers a wide range of semi-manufactures, the main item of which is.textile yarns and manu-factures. About one-quarter of these supplies are drawn from hard: currency sources, and represent small but important elements such asfilm base, clock and watch parts, spares for United States vehicles,handtools, and drugs.(c) Consumer Goods. The programme provides  13-4 millions and  13-2millions in the two half-years, plus  3 millions in each half-year fortoken imports. These represent either goods which are particularlyshort, or goods which we have to take as part of the token importpolicy or as part of bargains on other items or small quantities ofnon-essentials drawn from war-shattered countries. Excluding tokenimports, the amount from hard currency sources in the year is  millions.(d) Imports for Re-export. These are self-explanatory.14. Many items included in these programmes are under discussion betweenthe Board of Trade and the Treasury. The import of consumer goods is more closely screened than any other part of the total import programmes, and thescope for drastic further limitation is not large. Our non-discrimination com-commitments represent a serious limitation upon policy; there are many products which we should like to import in greater quantity from Europe (e.g., footwear),but which would involve us in dollar commitments which we cannot afford. Thiswill become progressively more serious as European production recovers.15. Peiroleum.-,The petroleum import programme is  47-1 millions and 40-4 millions in the two half-years. This programme is expanding fast. In1938, United Kingdom consumption is estimated at 9-7 million tons; consump-tion in 1947-48 will be nearly 17 million tons. This expansion results primarilyfrom the oil conversion programme; consumption of gas oil, diesel oil and fuel oil is now running at 50 per cent, above pre-war, and by the middle of 1948, itwill be about 2^ times the pre-war rate. In addition to this, there is a consider-able expansion of motor spirit consumption; the number of goods vehicles on theroad is 20 per cent! above pre-war (and the number of private cars nearly backto pre-war), so that in spite of petrol rationing, consumption of motor spirit in1947-48 will hot be far below the 1938 level. Furthermore, prices have risen bysome 20 per cent, since last September.16. The present programme makes some net provision for stock-building,primarily of fuel oil to support the increasing consumption. An increase in stocks of motor spirit is also required, stocks being expected to fall to six weeks&apos;consumption by the middle of this year.17. After 1st June, a policy of complete &apos;&apos; non-discrimination &apos;&apos; betweensources of supply will be adopted. This does not cost us any dollars, for theBritish companies&apos; production facilities are fully-employed in supplying eitherUnited Kingdom or sterling area or approved third country markets, and there-fore there would be no net gain in a discriminatory policy. AH increases in supplies of petroleum products are marginally 100 per cent, dollar cost (with theexception of fuel oil), and all savings are likewise 100 per cent, dollar savings.18. The Ministry of Fuel and Power estimates that the abolition, of petrol rationing would involve an additional expenditure in dollars of  4-1 millions ayear; a reduction in the basic ration to the level ruling last July would saveperhaps  2 - 5 millions a year, all in dollars. ,
&apos; 19. Seeds and Animals. The seeds and animals programme is  13-2millions and  9-4 millions in the two half-years. The main item is store anddairy cattle and horses from Eire; there are substantial imports of agricultural and vegetable seeds, and some imports of bulbs, flower seeds, &amp;c, from &quot; war-shattered &quot; countries.20.   Prices.- The prices and quantities are set out in Appendix F.APPENDIX CBALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN 1947-481. If the import requirements were accepted as they stand, the balance ofpayments position in 1947-48 would be as follows (  millions) :-Payments Imports(a) ...      ...Net Government expenditure(ft)Receipts Exports and re-exports (c)Net other income, &amp;c.(d)DeficitYear	2nd half	1st half	Year1946.	1947.	1948.	1947-48.1,100	900	870	1,770300	95	55	1501,400	995	925	1,920890	550	720	1,270110	45	55	1001,000	595	775	1,370400	400	150	550(a) Appendix E, Table I.(6) Appendix D. ..&apos; (c) See paragraph 2 below.id) See paragraph 4 below.   Includes purchases of ships.2. The above receipts from exports and re-exports are derived fromestimates of recorded exports by the Board of Trade, adjusted for the time-lagon payment and for the addition of re-exports. These estimates are inevitablymost precarious, for the full consequences of the fuel crisis cannot yet be assessed.The Board of Trade has taken the following working hypotheses : (i) The fuel crisis will lose us two months&apos;exports.(ii) We shall have recovered the end-1946 export volume by this autumn.(iii) The end-1947 target of 140 per cent, of 1938 export volume will bereached in the second quarter of 1948.&apos; (iv) Export prices will rise by 1 per cent, per month throughout.On this basis, the recorded exports would be  475 millions in the first half of1947,  575 millions in the second half, and  775 millions in the first half of, 1948.The payments estimate above is consistent with this, except that in order to makethe price assumption analogous with that of the import programme, it is assumed that there is no further price rise after the end of 1947.3. The Treasury is unable to comment upon the validity of this assumption,the net effect of which is that the events of the last three months have set our export drive back by nine months. It must be clearly recognised, however, thatthere is an implicit assumption that (i) The coal problem is solved this year.(ii) The sellers&apos; market continues into 1948.(iii) Industrial activity generally will permit exports to break through thelevel of 110 per cent, of 1938 volume, at which they stuck in the latter part of 1946.If these implicit assumptions are not justified, the figure for the first half of1948 may be  100-150 millions too high.

The total deficit for the second half of 1947 is estimated at  400 millions,and that for the first half of 1948 at  150 millions (subject to the export levelbeing achieved).6. But the hard currency situation is worse even than this. The followingtable shows our prospective balance of payments position with the hard currencycountries Western Hemisphere, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Persia, Russia(  millions) : Year 1947-48Imports (excluding oil) ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       - 816Net Government expenditure ...      ...      ...      ...       54Exports and re-exports ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      4-320Net other income (including ship purchase) ...      ...      -100Deficit   ...      .......      ...      ...      ...       6507. We have a trading deficit with the hard currencies for the twelve months to mid-1948 of  650 millions. Against this, there are receipts of gold from SouthAfrica and other Empire sources (perhaps  125 millions); we shall pick up somegold and dollars from our trading with other countries (e.g., France); the saleof the Argentine railways and other investments may yield us hard currencyincome of perhaps  50 millions; on the other hand, the rest of the sterling area has a prospective adverse balance with the hard currency countries of the orderof  100 millions, and convertibility will cost us some gold and dollars elsewhere.On balance, it would seem unlikely that our trading with the rest of the worldwill make a significant contribution to our deficit with hard currency countries.8. Relating this to the position at mid-1947, when our gold and dollar reserves will be about  650 millions and the undrawn United States and Canadiancredits about  650 millions, it would appear that if the import programme were accepted in full, and even if the rather favourable export assumptions turned out to be correct, we should have virtually exhausted the United States and Canadiancredits by the middle of 1948.APPENDIX D .OVERSEAS  GOVERNMENT expenditure . The following are estimates of overseas Government, expenditure in theperiod mid-1947 to mid-1948. These represent Government expenditure of a non-trading character; they do not include the results of Government trading opera-tions, such as the purchase of rice from Siam for re-sale to Malaya; nor do they include the proceeds of sale Of raw material stocks held abroad; these are includedin the &quot;-other net income &quot; item, for they are not readily distinguishable inprinciple from similar transactions carried on by private traders.2. The estimates arehound to be precarious, for many of the items cannot be predicted with accuracy. There are substantial claims and debts arising from thewar, the time of payment of which cannot be predicted.   The figures are therefore
given with every reserve, as an indication of scale, rather than as precise fore-casting. The definitions are not entirely consistent with those of previousestimates; the scope covered by these returns is steadily becoming more compre-hensive. On a broadly comparable basis in principle, the actual expenditure in1946 was some  300 millions.3.   The estimates are set out as follows : Military expenditure (net)   ...Germany and AustriaColonies ...      ...Administrative, diplomatic, &amp;c.Miscellaneous  ...      ...      ...2nd half1947 m.-   40:     41514-F 5951st half1948 m.2239516H-2755Year1947-48 m.62801030: +S21504. The military expenditure is a difference between substantial figures on both sides of the account. * In the year as a whole, the figures are of the followingdimensions: Expenditures-Service expendituresFood for ServicesOil for ServicesMiscellaneousYear 1947-48 m. -... 98...   14226Overseas purchases (other than forForces in United Kingdom andBA.O.R.)Receipts Disposal of surplus storesSale of stores ... &quot;...Settlement of war claims1401832.28Excluding sales of fixed assets, and sales to India.These figures have not been fully examined by the Treasury, and economies maybe possible.5. Expenditure in Germany and Austria represents the foreign exchange cost of these commitments; the change-over to the fused operation of the Britishand American zones makes the forecast extremely speculative. The figures do not include the cost of the Control Commission and other similar costs which are aBudgetary but not a foreign exchange cost to this country.6: The administrative and diplomatic expenditure involves large sums ( 10millions) for diplomatic and consular services;  1^ millions for our share in thecost of U.N.O., &amp;c.; substantial cost for pensions, &amp;c. .7. The miscellaneous item includes the residue of U.N.R.R.A. expenditure( 5 millions), and a number of war-time trading claims ( 5 millions). This isoffset by substantial expected receipts from repayment of advances by Burma,repayment of credits by Russia, Turkey, &amp;c, and by repayments of debts due tous by European countries in respect of Civil Affairs supplies.8.   Of the totals, expenditure in the various currency groups is as follows :&apos;- 2nd half 1st half     YearCurrency GroupsA (Colonies, &amp;c.) .B (relatively easy)C (intermediate)D (hard)1947	1948	1947-48 m.	&apos;  m.	 m.31	32	6343	26	69+ 7.	 4 29	^ 3628	26	5495 55       150
9. The main hard currency items are Germany ( 40 millions in the year)and the Services&apos; consumption of petroleum products, which, though in factdrawn mainly from British companies, largely represents marginally dollar oil-There is significant hard currency expenditure for Service food, and for diplomatic and consular purposes.10. By far the most important items are Germany and the Services&apos; consumption of food and oil. But over the whole field, these Government expenditures are competitive with imports as claims upon our foreign exchange resources.APPENDIX EI.

APPENDIX FPrices and Quantities1. The following table estimates the quantities of the import programme,,in comparison with 1946 and 1938 : Retained Imports   Retained Imports       Programme: 1938 1946 July 1947-June 1948.	at	.;   at	at	Quantum	at	Quantum	1938	current	current	as % of &apos;	current	as&apos;% of	prices	prices	prices	1938	prices	1938	 m.	 m.	 m.	%   -	 m.	. ,    %Pood   ...      ...	380	995	631	63	850	86Raw materials         ...	245	596	395	66	525	88Manufactured goods ...	. 84	225	75	33	125	56Tobacco        ......	21	55	70	127	51	93Seeds and animals   ...	9	31	23	74	20	65Oil..........	31	69	76	110	88	128	770	1,971	1,270	65	1,659	852. The increase in prices over the whole programme compared with 1938;is estimated at over 150 per cent. The increase in food is about 160 per cent.; inraw materials about 140 per cent.; and in petroleum 120 per cent. These repre-sent the current f.ob. prices as shown in the import programmes for the first half of 1947; they are considerably more than the increases shown in the regularBoard of Trade indices, because of the time-lag between f.o.b. prices and the arrival of the imports in United Kingdom.3. British export prices are running at about 110 per cent, above 1938.The evidence suggests that the terms of trade have moved against us sharply.4. The import prices of food and raw materials are now 12^-15 per cent-above those of 1946.
