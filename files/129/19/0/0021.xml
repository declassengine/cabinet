(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETcp. (47)1711ST JUNE. 1947.COPY NO.CABINETCEYLON    constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies at the meeting of the Cabinet on 6th May(CM.(47) 44th Conclusions, Minute 2) I was asked tosubmit a draft of a communication regarding the future of ceylon which might be made to Mr, Senanayake.     I now submit this draft (Annex i), together with the draft(Annex Ii) of an announcement which might be made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    I submit the second draft as i feel that my message to Mr. Senanayake should contain the text of an announcement which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould reasonably make at this stage.   The Foreign secretary and the Secretars^ of State for Dominion Affairs agree withthe drafts.    I have also consulted the Minister without portfolio.2.     The Governor (Sir Henry Moore, with whom I have beenin   close consultation) has done his best to relieve thelocal pressure for an immediate statement and the state council has been adjourned until 10th June.    It will thensit for a few hours only and the Governor very stronglyrecommends that my reply to Mr. Senanayake should arrive in time for an announcement to be made on that day.3*     The drafts in their present form fail short of what has been urged upon me by Mr. Senanayake with the supportof the Governor, who recommended that the most serious and urgent consideration should be given to Mr. Senanayake&apos;srepresentations.&apos;     Mr. Senanayake clearly contemplated that Ceylon should now be promised independence withinthe Commonwealth as soon as the new Parliament met, on.the understanding that specific agreements would be made between Ceylon and His Majesty&apos;s Government to safeguard our vital defence interests and to secure that Ceylonwould enter Into no Foreign commitments which might beembarrasing to the Commonwealth as&apos;a whole.4*     The main difference between the present drafts andMr. Senanayake&apos;s proposals is that we do not use the wordindependence&apos; and we make it clear that the 1946Constitution must be brought into force and actually functionbefore any agreements involving further constitutional changes can be entered into.
j5t     The Governor has represented that the inclusion ofsafeguards for minorities in the subjects specified for formal agreement to be made between the two governments may cause some difficulty.    In view of the feeling evincedby my colleagues on this point when the subject was last discussed, I, informed Sir Henry Moore that I consideredthat a specific mention of minorities must be included.6,     Another point to which considerable importance isattached in Ceylon is the transfer of responsibility forits affairs from the Colonial Office to the Dominions0ffice6    I appreciate that there may be difficulty incommitting ourselves specifically at this stage to such a transfer, seeing that the future handling of Indian andBurmese affairs has not.been settled, and that the implications-tions of such a transfer, from the point of view of theDominions, would have to be gone into.    I feel, however,that it is important to do something to satisfyCeylon1snatural desire to see any change in her status reflected in our administrative arrangements, and for this reason Ihave added what I consider to be an appropriate sentence^,at the end of the draft announcement.7*&apos;    finally, considerable importance is attached in Ceylonto the change of the Governor&apos;s title to Governor-General,This was recommended by the Soulbury Commission but theGovernment decided not, to make the change during theoperation of the 19u7 constitution.    A reconsideration ofthis decision now would have an excellent psychological effect in Ceylon, and would help to soften any disappoint-ment which may be caused by our inability to meet theirwishes in other respects.     The.change is one which couldbe made without difficulty by a simple amendment of theOrder-in-Council,    I recommend that we should meet Ceylonover this.    If this is agreed, a paragraph can be addedto the draft announcement.. (Intld.)      A.C.J.Colonial Office,^ S.W.I.1ST JUNE,  1947.
DRAFT OP COMMUNICATION TO MR.  D.S.  SENANAYAKE,VICE-CHAIRMAN OF CEYLON1S BOARD OF MINISTERS-&apos;    -19     In response to your representations, my colleagues andI have reviewed the constitutional position of Ceylon as it now stands as a result of the Soulbury Commission Report andthe White Paper of 1945.     We are most appreciative of theco-operative spirit displayed by Ceylon in war and in peace,and we recognise that recent events in India and Burma havequickened the desire of the people of Ceylon to achieve full responsibility in their affairs within a more clearly definedspace of time than was envisaged in the White Paper of 1945.2,     We have therefore sought means of accelerating-theevolutionary process to which reference was made in that paper.     We do not feel that the present time, when the 1946Constitution has not yet come ,into force and the elections for the new Ceylon parliament have not yet been held, isopportune for making further pronouncements with regard to possible changes in. that Constitution.     We are, however,prepared to undertake that, as soon as the new CeylonParliament has come into being, and is functioning, we shallbe ready to enter into discussions with the Ceylon Governmentwith regard to the matters now reserved under the 1946Constitution,: that is to say defence, external affairs andthe position of minorities.      If as a result of these dis-cussions it is possible (as we hope and believe it will bepossible) to draw up agreements satisfactory to both partiescovering all these matters, we shall be prepared to proceedwith the necessary action to amend the present Constitutionso as to advance the status of Ceylon within the BritishCommonwealth of Nations,! 1;-   - &apos;. ; -5-&apos;   ;
3,     further, in order to&quot; obviate any avoidable delay in the negotiation of the agreements, we are arranging for thecompetent authorities to proceed at once to examine the detailed subjects which should be included in the proposedagreements.     You will appreciate how necessary it is forme, in-dealing with a matter of such immense concern, notonly to the United Kingdom and Ceylon but to all members ofthe Commonwealth, to ensure that all proper consultationshave been carried out and all relevant considerations takeninto account.4.     For example, in the sphere of defence, it will clearly be necessary  to formulate the essential conditions needfulto provide for the security of Ceylon itself and its position in relation to the strategic needs of .theCommonwealth.     Again, in the field of external affairs,the relationship of Ceylon to other members of the Common-wealth will have to be thought out.     Both these questions will involve not only careful study by United kingdom ministers and their advisers but also consultation with theother Commonwealth Governments,     Moreover, in view of theobligations of His Majesty^ Government towards the minori-ties of Ceylon, some assurance as to their&apos;future position in new conditions, would be expected.     Finally, the effectiverealisation of another constitutional advance might wellinvolve not only amendment of the Order-in-Council but also an Act of the. United Kingdom Parliament.      It is obviousthat Parliament would not be in a position to pass sueh an act until it is satisfied that all necessary agreements have been arrived at and would remain in force after any constitutional change.u4h
5,     While, therefore, as Xhave said, we pan and will atonce institute preliminary work on these subjects, mycolleagues feel that it is impracticable for them to give an unconditional promise of independence now.     We realise that you for your part had quite understood the need for consultation and negotiation, but had hoped that an assurance from you of Ceylon&apos;s willingness to enter into agreements would enable su*h a promise to be made.     We aregrateful for and gladly accept your assurance, but you will,we are sure, understand that we are bound at the moment to regard it as given in your personal capacity, and that wo.cannot publicly involve ourselves in an advance &quot;commitment which would tie our hands in negotiating with whatevergovernment may be in power in Ceylon when the time comes,6,     The main reason emphasised to me by* Goonetilleke for taking immediate action was distrust of India,     He saidthat it was unrealistic to suppose that His Majesty1 sGovernment would be willing to face a major clash with indian order to protect the interests of Ceylon,     The Cabinetwish to make it clear that they cannot accept any suchassumption.7,     Taking all these matters into consideration His Majesty^Government propose, at a suitable date in the near future,to be ,decided in consultation with the Governor, to make anannouncement to the following effect,^/See Annex Il7 &apos;
ANNEX ii draft OP ANNOUNCEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1.     The new Constitution of Ceylon is about to corne intoforce, and it is anticipated that the newly elected parlia-ment will assemble in October.      In their statement ofpolicy of October, 1945, which followed on the Report, ofthe Soulbury Commission and led to the grant of the newConstitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government declared theiranxiety to co-operate with the people of Ceylon in their advance to Dominions status, and expressed the hope that ina comparatively short space of time such a status will beevolved.     Meanwhile political developments in India and burma of immense importance have occurred, and, although itwill be noted that there are many difficulties to overcomethere, these changes have quickened the desire for the realisation of full self-government in Ceylon.     His Majesty*sGovernment have consequently reviewed the programme of constitutional development contemplated at the time of the Soulbury Commission.2.     As they have already made it clear, His Majesty&apos;-sGovernment are wholly in&quot;&quot; sympathy with the desire of thepeople of Ceylon to achieve a fully responsible status withinthe British Commonwealth of Nations.      In order, therefore to accelerate the steps&apos;by which Ceylon can proceed towards a further constitutional advance. His Majesty*s Governmentwill be,prepared to discuss with Ceylon, as early as is practicable after the new Caylon Parliament elected underthe 1946 Constitution has come into being and is functioning,the possibility of drawing up an agreement covering the
sub-jecrts^at^preece^^(namely defence,  external affairs and the safe-guarding of minorities).     If a satisfactory agreement can be reached on these matters,  the way will be open to consideration of amendment of the Constitution,     In the meantime, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have given directions that the matters which might be included in such an agreement should be studied by the competent authorities in order to obviatedelay,3.      His Majesty&apos;s Government will lend their full support to any application by Ceylon for membership of united nations as soon as Ceylon&apos;s constitutional position make sit possible for such an application to be entertained,   ,4,     Any future change in the constitutional status of ceylon will naturally involve reconsideration of the present arrangements by which Ceylon affairs are the responsibilityof the Colonial Office,7,w.
