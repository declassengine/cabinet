The Social Services Committee have now considered amemorandum by the Minister of National Insurance on thisquestion,  the Home Secretary, Chairman of the Civil ServiceMan-Power Committee, being present at the meeting at whichthe memorandum was discussed.3. The Social Services Committee were informed by theMinister of National Insurance that it had already been agreed,on the  recommendation of an Inter-Departmental Committee underthe Chairmanship of a Treasury officer,  that everything possible should be done to secure staff economies by housing the local office staffs of the... Minis try and. of the Assistance Board inthe same premises;    by arranging for the work of home visitingto be carried out by officials of the Ministry acting on behalfof both Departments;    and by sharing to the maximum extentcommon service staffs,  such as typists,  clerical officers,messengers, cleaners and telephonists.     About ,90 per cent, ofthe- staff in ares, offices of the Assistance Board were inthese grades and could, therefore,......oome within the arrangements &apos;for sharing or common user, provided that the- necessary commonoffice premises could be-made available.      The Minister ofNational Insurance agreed that,  in the light of the OivilService Man-Power Committee&apos;s recommendations,  these,arrangements should be extended to cover the regional, as wellas the local, offices of his Department and the Bot.rd.      he submitted that when suitable premises became available to house the joint staffs the plan which had already been accepted would secure substantially- all the economies desired by the CivilService Man-Power Committee without the serious countervailingdisadvantages which that Committee&apos;s proposals would involve.I4. On the question of a complete merger of staffs the copy NO
Minister represented to the Social Services Committee thatto make him directly responsible for those officials, of theAssistance Board who exercised discretionary functionsrelating to.the grant or refusal of assistance in individual cases v/would be undesirable since it would jeopardise theexisting practice under which decisions of these officials were not regarded as open to challenge in Parliament:.Moreover, at a time when the Assistance Board v/would be taking over new functions from the local authorities,  it would be aconsiderable handicap to them not to have a trained and experienced specialist staff working under their direct control.5. The Social Services Committee accepted the viewof the Minister of National Insurance that on general grounds of policy a complete merger of the local and regional staffs of the Ministry and of the Assistance Board at all levelswould not be practicable,  and that at the point at whichofficials of the Board exercise their discretion in deciding .individual cases there must be a separation of function.The Committee invited the Minister, however, to take jrllpossible steps to arrange for the maximum sharing ofr staffsconsistent with safeguarding the points which he had made.The Committee also agreed that the efforts which were beingmade to secure, suitable common premises in order to-facilitate the sharing of local and regional staffs should be intensifiedand that the possibility of making use of premises of localauthorities should be energetically explored as soon as thedetails of the new National Assistance Scheme &apos; were published.A.G.Gwydyr House,    S.
