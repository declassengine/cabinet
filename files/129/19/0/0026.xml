.....IWm9$Wi.&apos;   ill I 143(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47)  1768TH JUNE.  1947EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTS scheme memorandum by the Minister of food at their meeting on 13th January (CM. (47) 5th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet approved the proposals outlined in CP. (47)4and 10 for the large-scale production of groundnuts and other food products by means of the large-scale mechanised clearance of land in East Africa,  and invited me to arrange for- the necessary legislation to he prepared in time for its introduction atthe outset of the 191+7/48 session of Parliament.     One ofthe points made in discussion at this meeting was that thelegislation might with advantage he framed in terms &apos;sufficiently wide to cover other similar schemes for colonial development.2.      Since then the Colonial Secretary has discussed with me the proposals which he has outlined to the Prime Minister andto the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and which he is puttingbefore the Cabinet in his paper CP. (47) 175 for theestablishment of a Colonial Development Corporation.     Wo .have-agreed that there would be advantages in combining into one Bill the powers required to set up the colonial development Corporation and those required to set up a.Corporation to manage the East African Scheme.3&apos;.     As the Cabinet is aware, I have already announced the names of the men I have invited to become members of theCorporation which must take over the East African Scheme(work on which is now being pressed forward - clearance of thebush started on 1st May last and some 8,000 acres have so far been cleared)..      I believe that the men selected will form amost energetic and efficient body to which other schemes for producing food for the United Kingdom in the Colonies could with advantage be entrusted.      In any case it has been fromthe outset necessary to seek powers for this Corporation to grow food products other than groundnuts, since it must rotateits crops -on its original East African lands, and for it togrot;   groundnuts elsewhere in the Colonial territories since no one yet really knows where the most suitable lands will befound.      I have little doubt that the-main development workof this Corporation will remain within Colonial territories.It does seem possible,. however, that it may be advantageousfor it in the future, and as. it acquires experience,, to do work,probably on a contractual basis, or by acting as a managingagent, elsewheiee.     As a matter of fact we have already hada tentative enquiry from an Indian ruling Prince as to whetherthe Corporation would be willing to show him how to put the j:groundnut cultivation of his State on a more mechanised basis.        IThe production of a larger Indian exportable surplus of fgroundnuts would, be of very great value to this country and [COPY NO.5/CABINET
work of this kind - by which contracts of technical andmanagerial assistance were entered into/ might be highlyremunerative to the Corporation and allow it to pay backits advances from public funds at an earlier date.     Thiskind of activity might prove to be of great value, in helping Governments who may be greatly in need of managerialskill and technical knowledge for the development of their resources to expand their food production for export to theUnited Kingdom.      If schemes of this sort materialise theymight lead to further benefits to the United. Kingdom in t heway of providing markets for our own manufacturers ofagricultural machinery and equipment.      On the other handnothing may come of this kind of development.     Onlyexperience will show.     But it would seem a pity if theterms in which the Legislation were drawn actuallyexcluded it.      I therefore suggest that the geographicalfield in which the Corporation which is to be responsibleimmediately for the East African Scheme should be empoweredto operate should be defined widely enough to allow it towork outside the Colonial Empire if this appears to be advantageous.     No such operations would, of course, beundertaken in any territory unless the Government of that territory and,the appropriate Minister of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom were in favour of it.^&quot;h\.     After discussion with the Secretary of State for theColonies, I suggest that the Bill to set up the twoCorporations should be called The Overseas resources development Bill, and that the Corporation to be responsibleimmediately for the East African Scheme, and for any subsequent activities on the lines of the preceding paragraph-should be known as the Overseas Pood Corporation.The distinction between the functions of the Overseas PoodCorporation and the Colonial Development Corporation would,I think, be clearj    the Colonial Development corporation would have wider powers to develop mineral resources,improve communications, develop water power, etc, as wallas to produce food and other agricultural products such as-rubber, cotton, fibres and so forth;    in so far as itproduces food in the Colonies it would normally do so as apart, of its plans for the general development of the colonial empire, whereas the Overseas Pood Corporation would be concerned primarily with production of food for export tothe United Kingdom as part of the Ministry.of Food&apos;s overseasprocurement programme.5.      To ensure that the two Corporations work closelytogether &quot;the Colonial Secretary and I have agreed torecommend that the Chairman of each of. the Corporationsshould be an ex officio member of the other.6.     As explained in CP. (2+7) 10 the maximum investment of..public money which is estimated to be &quot;at risk&quot; at any given moment in the East African Scheme is  25i million.To give the Overseas Pood Corporation, sufficient scope toundertake new schemes (each of which would, of course, besubject ,to the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer)without further legislation I suggest that the aggregate ofamounts outstanding &quot;in respect of any Treasury advances tothe Corporation and of the.principal of any stock issued andof any temporary loans raised by the Corporation, should beincreased to  50 million.
7.      I ask for the approval of the Cabinet to theproposals contained in paragraphs 2,. 3, k$ 5 and 6 ofthis Paper.J. S.Ministry of Food, S.W.1.8th June,  1947.
