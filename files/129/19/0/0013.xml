&quot;7IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-2/SECRETCP. (47)  16519TH MAY.  1947COPY NO.CABINETLEVEL OF GERMAN industry memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs on 26th February my colleagues agreed (O.R.C,(47) 3rdMeeting) to the proposal submitted in my paper O.R.C.(47) 14that our delegation to the Council of Foreign Ministers in moscow should attempt to secure agreement,  in connection with      .the revision of the Level of Industry plan, on an annualproduction of ten million tons as the permitted level of theGerman steel industry.2, It was not found possible to reach a quadripartitesettlement on this question in Moscow, and we therefore agreed with the Americans that a revised level of industry, to beapplied in our two Zones, should be worked out between&quot; us inBerlin.      This is now being done,  and the Americans have presented a plan, for raising the general level of industryto 85-90?S of tWel936 level, which envisages a permitted steel production off 12^ynillion tons, with an additional o.ne million tons for direWt-export.3. I therefore asked the Working Party which producedthe report in O.R.C.(47) 14 to give urgent consideration tothese American proposals.      They now recommend,  in the report annexed to this memorandum,  that we should not accept thehigher American figure for steel production.4. I invite my colleagues to endorse these recommendations which,  if acceptable to my colleagues, would serve as a basis for further negotiations in Berlin with the Americans.5. To the considerations put forward in the report Iwould.add that acceptance of the American figure&quot; would belikely to revive French suspicions of our intentions in Germany,and might cause a setback in our relations with the FrenchGovernment.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.I.19th May,  1947.
ANNEXGERMAN STEEL INDUSTRYSecond Report by Working party . In&quot;the discussions now taking place in Berlin betweenthe British and the Americans about the revision of the levelof industry plan for Germany,  the Americans have proposed apermitted steel production for Germany as a whole (exclusive ofthe Saar and Silesia) of 15^ million ingot tons a year, of which12;? million tons would be for internal consumption and 1 million tons for export of finished steel.The figure of 13g- million tons compares with the 10million tons proposed by the British.      The British figure includes no allowance for export of finished steel.2. The Working Party has considered whether the figureof 10 million tons could justifiably be increased in an effort to meet the Americans.     The result has been to confirm thefigure of 10 million tons of permitted production as a.reasonablefigure, desirable- on security grounds and,  so far as information at present available shows, not, making a balance of paymentsimpossible.3. It is not possible to state categorically that any&apos;&apos;higher figure than 10 million tons would be a serious threat to security-^^The Working Party is clear, however,  that anincrease to&apos;713 ^million tons as suggested by the americans would be a rasi&quot;&quot; potential danger to security.      This figure would be only 8% below average United Kingdom consumptionthroughout the war years, and considerably above her averageproduction before that period.      It would leave the Germans &apos;the ability to allocate a material quantity of steel for warlikepurposes,  if they chose to keep their standard of living downto a very low level.      The Germans themselves have estimatedthat German internal requirements of steel will amount to 14million ingot tons a year taking /pre-war standards as theirbasis.4. We regard the security aspect as the predominant ,one in considering this question, but if the permitted productionin Germany were raised to 13g- million tons with exports of upto 1 million tons, there would be two subsidiary consequencesdisadvantageous to the United Kingdom -(a) Export of finished steel from Germany on the scalesuggested by the Americans would be bound to compete with United Kingdom exports in a few years&apos;time, when the world&apos;s steel position will be easier than it is now.      In the intervening years,the United Kingdom itself would like to takesemi-finished steel from Germany, but from thepoint of view of the German balance of payments,the export of semi-finsiehd steel would be lessattractive than the export of finished steel.(b) While the raising of the permitted steel productionin Germany even to 13g- million ingot tons, would still leave a substantial margin of steel plantsfor reparations.(although it would make it moredifficult for the United Kingdom to obtain theparticular plants she wanted), the raising of the
level of the steel-consuming industries in germany which is a necessary corollary might well, taking into account the plant and machinery already removed,reduce to negligible proportions the plant etc.available for reparations from these industries.5.      (a)    We wish to emphasize that the figures we have &quot;been discussing are of permitted steel production in Germany and thatthe plant capacity to he left there would have to be put at a rather higher figure.      To achieve a production of 10 million tons, we have put forward a figure of 11.5 million tons plantcapacity.      This margin was deliberately put on the generousside in order to. ensure that Germany could achieve the steeloutput proposed year in, year out without excessive&quot; strain. &apos;   Thegenerous margin of capacity does, however, mean that from timeto.time, e.g.  for a special export drive or for war-like purposes,a higher output than iO million tons could be achieved, but at thiskind of level we should not regard temporary spurts as threatening.It would he quite otherwise if the American proposal for 13.5 million tons permitted production were adopted.(b)    In this connection it should be noted that it is notpossible to measure capacity precisely:    by adjustments in rawmaterial supplies,, etc.  the output of a given plant can be       ^altered within fairly wide limits.      For balance of payment    freasons Germany will have to make the maximum use of indigenousores for some time to &apos;Come;    and this has been taken into account in the selection of the plants to be .retained to form the nominalcapacity of.11? millions tons mentioned above.      By the use ofricher ores,  and by certain technical adjustments,  the same plantswould be capable of producing not the 10 million tons permitted,but some 12g- to 13g- million tons.      For these reasons limitationof nominal capacity does not by itself afford security, and wehave always regarded it as an essential part of a steel plan for germany that in the long term some measures are taken to see that german steel production does not exceed a certain figure.      Themeans of implementing this will presumably be considered inrelation to the Peace Treaty for Germany.      In the meantime, the controlling Powers will be able by administrative action to keepthe steel output in Germany within whatever figure, is agreed between them.6. On the basis of the level of industry plan now underdiscussion in Germany a revised estimate of the German balance ofpayments will be available in a few weeks&apos; time.      If, when thisestimated balance of payments is available,  it shows a substantialdeficit,  it might be -necessary to reconsider the question of allowing for exports of finished steel from Germany.      In that event it.might be possible to agree to an increase in the permittedlevel of production from 10 million tons to say-10^-11 million tons,on the ground that this would not involve any really serious consequences.      But, while it cannot be categorically stated thata level of lO^-ll million tons would constitute a threat to security we should regret any such increase both because any increase necessarily weakens the security position and because ofthe competition to the United Kingdom export trade in steel which,would be involved.     We recommend therefore that if possible any concession on a level of production in excess of 10 million tonsshould be avoided and that in no circumstances should we agree&apos;to a level of more than 11 million tons.8th May.  1947
