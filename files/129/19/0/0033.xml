Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1947copy m 31CABINETGERMANYMEASURES TO IMPROVE THE MACHINERY FOR THE delivery of REPARATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs ask my colleagues to agree to art important change.in our approach to theproblem of reparations on two grounds : (a) the present procedure offers us no reasonable assurance of obtaining in time (or indeed at all) certain key plantswhich we ourselves urgently require; and (&amp;) the slowness of the present proceduremakes it doubtful whether it will be possible to complete the.process of listing,allocating, dismantling and shipping the plants available for reparations while we can still count on the necessary minimum of German co-operation in some ofthese tasks. Indeed, my advice from Berlin is that, if the entire programme isnot completed within a year or thereabouts, it may never be possible to completeit at all.2. Present reparations procedure is determined (a) by the quadripartitearrangements laid down to give effect to the Potsdam decision that Russia should obtain 25 per cent, of reparations from the Western zones, and (b) by the paris agreement on Reparations of 14th January, 1946. Plants eligible for reparationsare listed singly or in batches by the Zone Commanders and subsequently valuedby a quadripartite team. The list and valuations are then considered by aquadripartite Committee in Berlin and, if agreement cannot be reached as tothe division between Russia and tihe other parties entitled to reparations, thematter is referred to the Co-ordinating Committee. No procedure exists forresolving difficulties which cannot be settled at this level, so that failure to agreewithin a reasonable time means either indefinite delay or acceptance of Russianclaims. Under (&amp;) the plants which are Ultimately allocated to the I.A.E.A.Powers are divided up on the basis of bids from the interested countries; it isthe. practice of the I.A.R.A. Secretariat at Brussels to reconcile these bids sofar as possible, and then to submit their recommendations to the periodicalmeetings of the I.A.R.A. Assembly. Disagreements are in theory settled by a simple majority vote, with provision for appeals to arbitration, but in practicea long time is spent in endeavouring to settle disputes out of court. An analysis of this elaborate procedure shows that the time taken from the moment when aplant is declared available to the moment when the Zone Commander is informed by LARA, of its allocation could easily exceed 18 months. For the reasons have indicated above, it is essential-(a) to reduce this period drastically, and(b) so to recast the procedure as to increase our chances of getting the plantswe covet.3.   A number of alternative methods of achieving these two objects havebeen examined in conjunction with the departments concerned and with repre-sehtatives of the Control Commission for Germany and the United kingdom delegate to I.A.R.A. These alternative methods range from a simple acceleration of the existing procedure to a plan under which we would in effect take theJfc   plants in which we are interested and leave the remainder for division between^0   Russia and the other I.A.R.A. Powers.   I have reached the conclusion that,urgent though our own needs may be, we should not be justified in deliberatelythrowing over the Paris Agreement to which we put our signature.   Instead,I recommend that we should adhere in form to the procedures to which we are[33764]secret.P. (47) 18316th June, 1947
bound by that agreement while imposing a strict timetable for their completion.In order to enforce this timetable, it would be necessary to keep certain sanctionsin reserve. As regards the procedure in Berlin for the division of plants between russia and the other I.A.R.A. Powers, the sanction would be that, if agreement could not be reached within a stated period, the Western Zone commanders,acting jointly or if necessary separately, would themselves determine Russia&apos;s25 per cent, share. In this way we should at least be sure of being able to preventplants in w&apos;hich we are specially interested going to the East. As regards theallocation procedure at I.A.R.A., the sanction would be that, if no agreement can be reached within the time limit, the Zone Commander would be at liberty to suspend dismantling indefinitely, with the probable effect that the plantsconcerned would never be removed at all.4. These measures will not be acceptable to the Russians and we must beprepared for a display of indignation. We have, however, a good defence against any attacks : -(i) We are asking for quadripartite approval of our proposals which we make because the existing machinery has proved so slow,(ii) The sanctions involved in the scheme do not infringe the letter of the potsdam Agreement, which provides only that Russia shall get25 per cent, of the plant available for reparations; it does not definehow that 25 per cent, should be allocated to her.The sanction involved in the scheme breaks the spirit of the agreement, butit does not come into force until (a) the other Powers have refused their agree-ment to the new scheme, and (&amp;) Russians have failed to keep to the time-tablewe have laid down in other words, until Russian non-co-operation has made thescheme unworkable.The measures are equally open to objection from the I.A.R.A. Powers, butin their case their dislike of an admittedly high-handed procedure should be offset to a considerable extent by the assurance it gives of the receipt of aconsiderable quantity of reparation at an early date rather than unsatisfactoryquantities at a later date or perhaps never. The scheme may be a technical breach of the Paris Agreement, but there again our defence is that the sanction doesnot come into operation until or unless I.A.R.A. have failed to agree up to time as to what they want done with the plants.The fundamental question upon which the Reparation Clauses of Potsdamand the Paris Agreements rest is the Level of German Industry. Here we havequite frankly broken away from quadripartite Agreement and Ministers have approved the establishment of a new and higher level for the two Western Zones.This being so, it would scarcely be consistent to object to other departures fromthe spirit of the Potsdam and Paris Agreements which have a similar purpose,namely, the more efficient economic functioning of the bizonal area. I am there-fore satisfied that the procedure which has been worked out, and the salient features of which I have outlined above, offers the best method open to us, withouta,n actual breach of our international engagements, of ensuring that in our shareof reparations we shall get within a reasonable time some of the plants we shouldmost like to have. But, as we are necessarily dependent on the decisions of aninternational organisation, it obviously provides no guarantee that we shall getany particular plant. Nothing short of direct seizure and removal of plantswe want can give us this.5. The policy proposed cannot be put into effect until agreement has beenreached with the Americans on a revised level of industry to be applied in theBritish and American Zones, and until a final list of plants available for repara-tions in the British and American Zones can be drawn up. Its prospects ofsuccess depend substantially on American support both in Berlin and in Brussels;if this is not forthcoming, it will depend on the nature of American reactions to the plan whether we should apply it unilaterally in our own zone.6. Subject to this, I ask my colleagues to endorse the proposals which Ihave outlined above and, in particular, to agree (a) that the scheme should be submitted to the Co-ordinating Committee inBerlin and that, if necessary, we should be prepared to implement it without Russian consent, making our own allocations of plants asbetween them and the I.A.R.A. Powers if agreement is not reached with the Russians on each batch of plants submitted for allocationwithin the time limits proposed;
3196(6) that idea, should be informed of our intention to apply a rigid time-table to all these processes for which we are responsible and warned that, unless they similarly establish and keep to a timetable in brussels, we shall not be able to accept any responsibility for thecompletion of the reparations programme in accordance with the paris agreement. This means that we shall not be able to dismantle andpack goods which I.A.R.A. fail to allocate up to time. The reasonfor this is that the power of packing and despatching plant is our only effective sanction, but the excuse is that it the Reparation pro-gramme is delayed more than some 12 months it may not be completed at all;(c) that the Military Governor in Germany should be requested to ensurethat the selection, valuation and allocation of plants for reparationsshould be accorded every possible priority, and that sufficient man-power and equipment are made available to dismantle and removeplants allocated as reparations in accordance with the timetableproposed.E.
