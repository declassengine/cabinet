3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C RET C.P. (U7) 15917th May, 191+7.COAL__IMPORTSMemorandum py the Minister of Fuel and power on 16t.h April (F.C.(h7) 16th Meeting) I was authorised&quot;by the Fuel Committee ;to make an immediate approach to theEuropean Coal Organisation for the import of coal (notnecessarily from the United States) to the United Kingdom,  andto &quot;base the claim on the special economic conditions in thiscountry.&quot;2. The situation since that date has changed in certain important aspects, and I feel my colleagues should he aware ofthose changes,  and of the action&apos; I have taken inconsequence.3. In the first place, consultation with the Chairman ofE.CO.  established that (subject to a proviso set out inparagraph 9 below) there was no prospect of the United Kingdombeing able to secure an allocation of coal for the second quarter,  as all supplies available to E.C.O.  had already been allocated to other countries.      Consequently, my attention hasoeen concentrated on the prospects for the Third Quarter.k. The American attitude has undergone a significant change since February, when President Truman offered to divertcoal cargoes from Europe to this country.      The Americans haverecently informed us that,  should our application to E.C.O.  foran allocation in the Third Quarter be unfavourably received bythe French,  they would not feel able to give us positive support.They have,  in the., past few days,  slightly, modified this to theextent of saying that they do not consider the French have anyprescriptive right to American coal, and that they woulddeprecate any attempt hy the French to make their support of our proposal at E.C.O.  conditional on our conceding other Frenchrequests,  e. g.  over the Sasr.5. In view of this American attitude, discussions havetaken place with the French at the official level, when theFrench, expressed concern at our intention to apply for an E.C.O.allocation,  and ptated they could not agree to any proposal whichwould hove the effect of reducing their expectations of importedcoal,  either now or in the future.      They then made certain proposals affecting the future status of the Saar, which they regarded as the only method whereby they could be &quot;compensated&quot;for the American coal we would hope to secure.      This development has wide political implications,  which are a matter for theForeign Secretory.COPY NO.    S*CABINET
6. No firm figures are yet available for the tonnages of american and German coal which will be placed at the disposalof E.C.O.  for the Third Quarter.      It is probable that the americans v/ill declare two alternative figures viz.  2.6 and 3.million tons per month, the latter figure being contingent onthe success of their efforts to expand coal exports to Europe,and both being contingent on the labour situation in the UnitedStates coal industry as it is likely to develop on or about1st July.      The German situation remains obscure, by reason ofthe depressed Ruhr coal output,  and any forecasts which may begiven to E.C.O.- for the Third Quarter will inevitably beunreliable as a guide to actual delivery prospects.7. In these circumstances,  there may be special difficulties about pressing our request to S.C.O.      The text of the.documentsubmitted to E.C.0.  is given in the Appendix to this memorandum and it will be noted that our request is for an allocation of upto 1+00,000 tons a month (as reduced by any allocation under our agreement with Poland)&apos; wholely or mainly in the form of Americancoal,  provided American availabilities are in excess of the 2.million tons a month declared by them to S.C.O.   in the second quarter.8. In view of the difficulties attending our applicationto E. CO.,  I feel that my colleagues should know of the positionand consider in advance of the E.G.O.  Allocations meeting on-21st May,  how far our bid is to be pressed.9. My colleagues should know also of a further, and somewhatpuzzling, development announced by the United States authorities on 5th. May, namely that their allocation procedure would- be revised for May and June, whereby coal (understood to be mainlyUtah&apos;coal) would be made available for shipment to Europe throughUnited States West Coast and other &quot;exceptional&quot; ports &quot;without reference to,  and in addition to,  the established country bycountry coal allocation&quot; i.e.  outside the E.CO.  Second Quarterallocation pattern.      The matter has been carefully consideredbut the National Coal Board has advised against entering this field,  since the coal involved would be of indifferent quality,its dollar cost would be extremely high (about 30 dollars perton c.i.f.) apart from the fact that suitable tonnage for the longvoyage from theWest Coast would be difficult to obtain.      Itseems to me that to import indifferent coal at such a high price(equivalent to about  8 a ton delivered cost) cannot be justified,but if my colleagues wish, we might import one trial cargo tosee what the actual quality is and how the freights work out.10. It will be recalled that it has been our intention that-all imports of coal should be handled by and through the NationalGoal Board.      This is necessary(a) to ensure the working of the present allocation system;(b) to avoid the price of coal and freights being put up&apos;by, competitive bidding by British interests in the U.S.A.It is known,  however, that important steel and cottoninterests hove representatives in ,the United,Statestrying to buy coal on their own account alongside the National Coal Board who have already secured an option on some good quality coal in anticipation thatour application for an allocation will be successful.
I assume my colleagues will agree that(i) we should., maintain the principle that all imports;      should he handled by the Coal Board;    and(ii) that such imports must be put into the general pool,and that it should not be open to particularBritish interests to secure coal on their own account.Subject to this,  I would propose that the Coal board should get in touch with the interests concerned,  so as to useany information or facilities they may have acquired in theU.S.A.S.S.Ministry of Fuel and Power-.17th May,  1947.
APPENDIX .EUROPEAN COAL ORGANISATIONAPPLICATION BY THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR AN ALLOCATION OF GOAL .IN THE THIRD QUARTER.  1947Memorandum by the United Kingdom Delegate1. His Maj esty&apos;s. Government has decided to make applica-tion to the European Coal Organisation for an allocation of coal for importation during the Third Quarter of 1947.2. In reaching this decision, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas given very careful consideration to the general principles,which have hitherto &quot;been adopted by the European CoalOrganisation in deciding allocations,  and to the position ofother mernbers who in. the past have been accustomed to receive them.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government further &quot;believe that it isin the interest of the European economy as a whole that an allocation should be made, as an insurance against any threat to the economic stability and recovery of the United Kingdom.In particular,  it desires to rebuild distributed stocks duringthe next few months which is imperative if there is to be norepetition in the coming winter of the fuel emergency which occurred last winter in the United Kingdom.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government along with other members ofthe Organisation has played an active part in the establishment and continuous development of the existing formula, which (withall its recognised imperfections) has nevertheless come to beregarded as one of the main features of allocations procedure.But the formula was not designed to deal with the situationwhereby one -of the principal coal producing countries inEurope finds itself compelled by force of- circumstances tomake application for an allocation of imported coal.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government considers, however,  thatthe present is an abnormal situation, which should be of short-term duration only,  and is anxious that it should beregarded as a special case which is not susceptible of treatment in terms of the existing formula.      On these grounds, HisMajesty&apos;s Government proposes that a special ad hoc allocationshould he made to the United Kingdom for the Third Quarter inadvance of,  and outside, the application of the existing,formula.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to place before theEuropean Coal Organisation the following factors(i)   The anticipated conclusion of a commercial agreementbetween the United Kingdom and Poland, which.willprovide, inter alia, for the delivery by poland to the United Kingdom of coal to the value of 800,000 during, the twelve months commencing1st June-,  1947.It is estimated that this representsapproximately 60,000 tons for delivery in theThird Quarter.      The- United Kingdom propose to regard this as an &quot;ordinary&quot; agreement, and have requested that the European Coal organisation should regard it as such. .
(ii)    It is the United Kingdom desire that the balanceof whatever allocation the European Coal organisation should decide upon for the United Kingdom, should consist wholly or mainly of American coal.7. It is recognised that the task of the AllocationsProposals Committee in assessing the total availabilities&quot;to the European Goal Organisation for the Third Quarter willbe difficult,  in view of the current uncertainties affectingthe declaration of availabilities from the United States ofAmerica and Germany.      His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to makeit clear that,, in putting forward their request for an allocation,  it has been assumed that total availabilitiesfor the Third Quarter would be larger than for the previousQuarter.      They are fully mindful of the requirements &quot;ofother European Coal Organisation member countries and it iswell to recall here that,  in February of this year, thePrime Minister&apos;s reply to President Truman&apos;s offer ofassistance in relieving the United Kingdom coal shortagewas that the United Kingdom &quot;could not   v::,k that cargoesshould he diverted from Europe&quot; at a tir ? when the need for coal in Europe was no less pressing.      It is true to say,however,  that the level of the European Coal Organisationallocations in the Second Quarter was higher than at any previous time, and there is good prospect that the totalavailability in the Third Quarter will be higher still.It is in these circumstances that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave felt justified in putting forward the present claim.8. It is understood that,  in view of the presentuncertainties,  it is not possible for the United states authorities to present a firm forecast of availabilities forthe Third Quarter.      In so far, however, as it is possibleto allocate, even on a contingency basis, tonnages of UnitedStates coal in excess of those allocated for the Second&apos;Quarter,the United Kingdom would press for an allocation from thoseadditional tonnages, up to a maximum of 400,000 tons per month.      This request for an allocation is itself subject tothe final estimate of total availabilities declared to theEuropean Coal Organisation.
&apos;1 ii(ti)    It is the United Kingdom desire that the balance&apos;of whatever allocation the European Coal organisation should decide upon for the United Kingdom, should consist wholly or mainly of American coal.It is recognised that the task of the AllocationsProposals Committee in assessing the total availabilitiesto this Soropoan Coal Organisation for the Third Quarter willa Iff ic alt,  in view of the current uncertainties affectingthe dec, of availabilities from the United States ofand Germany.     His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to makeIt clear that, in putting forward their request for an allocation,  it has &quot;been assumed that total availabilitiesfor the Third Quarter would be larger than for the previousQuarter.     They are fully mindful of the requirements &apos;ofother European Coal Organisation member countries and it iswell to recall here that, in February of this year, thePrime Minister*S reply to President Truman&apos;s offer ofassistance in relieving the United Kingdom coal shortagewa3 that the United Kingdom &quot;could not ask that cargoesshould be diverted from Europe&quot; at a time when the need for coal in Europe was no less pressing.      It is true to say,however, that the level of the European Coal Organisationallocations in the Second Quarter was higher than at any previous time, and there is good prospect that the totalavailability in the Third Quarter will be higher still.It is in these circumstances that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave felt justified in putting forward the present claim.8.

This request for an allocation is itself subject tothe final estimate of total availabilities declared to theEuropean Coal Organisation.
