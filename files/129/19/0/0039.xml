Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1947SECRET CopyJNo,CP. (47) 18930th June. 1947CABINETA NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee held on 6th June(L.P. (47) 16th Meeting, Minute 3) we had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Labour and National Service (L.P. (47) 92) on the develop-ment of national arbitration machinery, At the end of our discussion theCommittee invited me to circulate to the Cabinet a paper setting out my viewsregarding the case for the establishment of a central arbitral body for the purposeof ensuring that in the settlement of questions of wages and conditions of employ-ment due regard is paid to the prevailing economic conditions.2. Nearly a year ago I put before the Lord Presidents Committeemy ideas on the need for a national wages policy in a memorandum (L.P. (46) 255),a copy of which I attach hereto. My main proposal was the establishment of aNational Wages Authority, consisting of representatives of the Government andof both sides of industry to advise the Government on applications for wagechanges, having particular regard to the inflationary danger, the need to promote a better distribution of our man-power, and the revision of systems of wages to give greater incentive to increased output and efficiency. This paper Wasconsidered in a preliminary way by the Lord Presidents Committee at a meetingheld on 1st November, 1946 (L.P. (46) 36th Meeting, Minute 2), but no recom-mendatidns thereon were then submitted to the Cabinet., 3. The same general issues are involved in the paper on the developmentof national arbitration machinery which was considered at the recent meeting ofthe Lord Presidents Committee and which is now being circulated to the Cabinetin a slightly expanded form as CP. (47) 190. r/ersonally I cannot accept theMinister&apos;s conclusion that &quot;The results to date of the working of the existing system have been most satisfactory,&quot; for, although it may be true that theexisting system has succeeded in avoiding some strikes which would otherwise have occurred, it is equally true that that system has failed to secure theestablishment of a proper relationship between the levels of wages and earnings in one industry and those in another. Nor can I regard as adequate the very limited proposals put forward by the Minister of Labour and National service in his paper, for in essence those proposals would leave wage-fixing as a matternormally for negotiation merely between the employers and the trade unions inparticular industries. In such circumstances, there would be no assurance oreven likelihood that due account would be taken not only of the circumstancesof the particular industry concerned but also of the wider issues affecting the economy of the country        Whole.4. The defects of the current method of wage-fixing seem to me to bevery serious, and especially so in the present economic situation and that which lies immediately ahead. A satisfactory system of wage-fixing should, in my view,give the following results :- .(a) All wages should be at least sufficient to provide the wage-earner witha minimum standard of living, covering all the essential needs of life.[33832] b31
.T (b) This minimum should broadly apply to men and women alike; to meetthe greater needs of workers with families to support, the existing system of family allowances should,be augmented, by increasing the weekly payments and providing for their further increase if condi--  , tions warrant.(c) Above this minimum, actual wages in different occupations should notvary one from another erratically on account of factors like the bargaining strength of different negotiating parties. They should bear a consistent relationship, depending on the different degrees ofskill required in different occupations, and especially important inour current man-power situation the comparative reluctance or readiness-ness of workers to engage in particular occupations; we must, in short,be able to use wage relations towards solving the problem of the vitalbut undermanned industries.[d) Wherever piece-work systems prevail, and do in fact provide an effectivestimulus to increased productivity, these methods should be continued.5. It is apparent that these results are not consistently achieved by the pre-vailing methods of wage-fixing. Wages vary from industry to industry, and even within a single industry, for reasons quite unrelated to differences of skill andto relative shortages of labour in different occupations. One main cause of varia-tion is the strength or weakness of the trade unions concerned. Again, wages ina particular industry are often conventionally related to wages in other industries,so that variations in a particular industry, where they are necessary and appro-priate, may provoke changes in other industries where no change is required inthe general interest, and where,, indeed, such changes may negative the benefits ofthe initial wage variation.6. To avoid these defects and to move towards the results listed in para-graph 4 above, I consider that some adjustment must be made in the machineryfor determining wage-rates. This adjustment could be made without in any wayprejudicing the position of the trade unions, for it would be possible to bring thegeneral interest to bear on the process of wage-fixing by measures which wouldneither weaken, nor reduce the status of, the unions in negotiation.7. The sort of adjustment I have in mind is this. We might establish a central Advisory Council composed of men of broad knowledge and experienceof industrial relations with the duty and authority to investigate and report onclaims for higher wages, taking into account the wider economic and social issues raised. The arrangement would be that any wage claims made by a trade union on behalf of its members would be put in the first place before this Council. (this could be done either direct by the trade union concerned or through the Ministerof Labour and National Service.) The Council would make its report on theclaim, which would then go for negotiation between the two sides of industry inthe normal way. . By this method, all negotiating parties would be fully appraisedof the economic and social factors involved in changing particular wage rates; soalso would any arbitrator who might later be appointed if the two sides failed toreach agreement.8. The Central Advisory Wages Council might also be asked by the Govern-ment to comment on the advisability of determining minimum wage ratesgenerally, and its observations could be made known to both sides throughout industry. There may be other issues of general importance in wage-fixing whichcould thus be widely disseminated to those concerned through.the medium ofsuch -a Central Council-without, I would again emphasise, weakening theposition of the trade unions engaged in particular negotiations,9/ I realise that proposals on the lines of the above would require legisla-tibn, if they were to be effective. Before we discuss statutory provisions, however,I should like to invite my colleagues to discuss; in more general terms, my sug-suggestions for modifying existing wage-fixing practice to take into account the wider economic and social needs of our day.Ministry of Fiiel and Power,7, Millbank, S.W. 1,30th June, 1947.
ANNEX-&apos;[L.P. (46) 255 -22nd October, 1946]cabinet lord President&apos;s CommitteeA PROPOSED NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at our meeting held on 26th July (L.P. (46) 28th Meeting, Conclusion 3) wehad a preliminary discussion on wages policy in the course of which I outlinedcertain broad considerations by which, in my view, the Government should guidethemselves in their approach to this problem. At the conclusion of our discussionI was invited by the Committee to circulate a memorandum setting out in greater detail the suggestions I had put forward. This I have now done in the present paper. &apos;The Two-fold Nature of the problem. I think it became clear in the course of our discussion that we wereup against a two-fold problem in regard to wages :-(i) the danger that in the present situation not merely of full employment,but of. general labour shortage, wage increases might proceed at sucha rate as to impair our price stabilisation policy;(ii) the difficulty of securing wage differentials in favour of high priorityundermanned industries owing to the tendency of wages in the less important industries to increase at the same rate or even faster.(i) The danger of an inflationary spiral3. We all know that stability of prices is an essential condition for thesuccess of our whole economic policy. It is essential to safeguard the real valueof the people&apos;s earnings and of social security benefits; it is essential for the orderly progress of our domestic economic planning; and, finally, it is essentialto preserve our competitive position in relation to the outside world and tosecure and maintain a balance of our international accounts.4. During and since the war, price stability has been achieved--in so faras it was achieved- mainly by means of subsidies. In the circumstances thiswas to be preferred to a policy of allowing the prices of essential goods to riseto the full extent of the increases in costs&quot;. But in the long run such a methodof preventing inflation has serious disadvantages. If wages, other costs and profits were allowed to rise unchecked, the subsidies needed to hold the cost ofliving would become increasingly burdensome, and the taxation necessary to finance them and prevent inflation would operate as a disincentive to effort and enterprise (as well as largely counterbalancing for the wage:earners the benefits of the initial wage increases). We must therefore aim at stabilising the cost ofliving, by preventing general price increases from occurring rather than bycompensating for them by means of subsidies after they have occurred.5. In so far as the inflationary potential is due mainly to shortage of goodscombined with excess purchasing power in the hands of consumers, it may be effectively checked by measures of price control and rationing. But thistechnique cannot suffice to hold back an inflation due to continually increasingwages. In addition to measures of price control, therefore, some control of general,wage increases, is required if an inflationary spiral is to be avoided.[33832]
(ii) Wage differentials in favour of undermanned priority industries6. With the disappearance of direct labour controls, economic incentivesbecome the main instrument for guiding labour into one industry or another.As an essential prerequisite for our general economic planning, we must have some means of guiding our man- and woman-power into those occupations where their services are most urgently needed, and for this purpose we must exercisesome control over the relative attractiveness of wages and conditions in different industries.7. I realise that, particularly with the current shortages of goods in the shops, money wage rates are not the only, and perhaps not even the most important,economic incentive. In present circumstances, hours of work, holidays, housing,working conditions and amenities may play an even greater role in attractingpersons to different industries or in keeping them there once they have arrived.Nevertheless, money earnings will become of increasing importance as consumers&apos;goods become more plentiful and the scope for spending those earnings increases.An obvious first step in trying to get the additional labour we so urgentlyneed in the mines, foundries, and in agriculture, has been to encourage an increasein wage rates in these industries relatively to those in industries of lower priority.But efforts in this direction up to date have been largely frustrated by the factthat any increase in wages granted in one of these essential industries has beenimmediately followed by a host of demands for wage increases in other, less essential, industries.Defects of the Traditional Collective Bargaining System8. In respect of both the problems discussed above, the traditional systemof collective wage-bargaining conducted industry by industry has serious short-comings under present-day economic conditions. A situation of general labour shortage naturally offers favourable opportunities for wage increases throughoutthe system. But in conditions of full employment, general increases in wage-ratesmay easily fail to secure any increase in the real income of wage-earners as awhole, since they will generally lead to price increases of at least similar dimen-sions. Moreover, in addition to failing in their objective of raising the standardof living of wage-earners as a whole, such general wage increases may, as Ihave already indicated, undermine the price stabilisation policy which lies atthe basis of our whole economic planning. So long as wage-fixing is undertakenindependently industry by industry (whether by collective bargaining, concilia-tion boards or any other method) there can be no guarantee that wages in.general will not rise faster than is compatible with the requirements of a stableprice level.9. Similarly, in so far as it is relative wages that influence the flow oflabour into one industry or another, the desired relative wage structure cannot possibly be arrived at by any method of fixing wages in one industry alone.Wages in all industries must be considered at the same time if differentials areto be secured in favour of those to which it is most necessary to attract newrecruits.The Need for a National Wages Authority10. All these considerations point to the need for some central authority which will supervise wage changes with a view to ensuring both that they arenot incompatible with the Governments price stabilisation policy and that theywill promote and not impede the distribution of man-power , in the desireddirection.11. It is not enough, in my view, to set up machinery merely for discussing the problems, as envisaged in the recently established National Industrial Con-ference. This will no doubt fulfil a valuable educative function, but in additionto this there is a judicial or executive job to be done.12. It is clear that although wage-earners as a whole cannot gain byexcessive pushing up of money wage rates, when this leads to an equal or even greater increase in prices, this is not true of each individual wage-group. In ageneral scramble for wage increases carrying price increases in their wake, thereis always a chance that the more powerful and better organised unions may securewage increases in the industries for which they are responsible more rapidly and on a greater scale than those secured by the weaker or less well-organised
workers. Even though the real income accruing to wage-earners as a whole maynot increase, the better organised workers may in this way be able to increase their share of it at the expense of their less fortunate fellows. Moreover, forevery union that is actually in a position to improve the relative situation of its members in such a free-for-all wage scramble, there would be a number of others who would think they could do so although, in fact, they might well lose. It is because of the genuine conflict of interest involved, that some judicial or executive authority is necessary to ensure a national wages policy consistent with therequirements of general economic planning. It is true that the acceptance ofsuch an authority in place of the traditional system of unrestricted individualcollective bargaining will call for a considerable effort of self restraint and sense of working class solidarity, particularly on the part of the larger and more powerful unions. Yet this measure of self-restraint is absolutely essential if weare to secure any stability in our economic system in conditions of full employ-ment, and in particular if we are to influence the flow of man-power into theindustries and trades where it is most urgently needed.Constitution of the National Wages Authority13. Since the primary function of the National Wages Authority would beto &quot; divide up the cake &quot; between groups of wage earners in different industries,ii is essential that the various interested parties should be fairly represented.Wide trade union representation should thus constitute the first element.Employers should also be Included, though, in so far as there is an efficientlyfunctioning price control, they will probably be less interested in the sharing ofthe spoils. They will, however, be interested in the effects of changes in therelative Wage structure on labour supply, and possibly also on the export trade.Finally, since the whole purpose of the National Wages Authority would be toensure that wage changes should be in conformitjr with the requirements of theGovernments general economic policy, Government representation, or at least aGovernment chairman, would be essential.14. The representatives of wage-earners and. employers might be nominated by the T.U.C. and Employers&apos; Federation respectively, the nominations to.be approved by the Government. The Government would presumably be repre-sented by officials from the Ministry of Labour on labour-supply questions; andfrom the Treasury or Cabinet Offices on matters of general economic policy.Function of the National Wages Authority15. I do not believe that so important a function as actually determiningwages should be delegated to a statutory body of the kind described. The finalresponsibility for decisions regarding national wage policy should lie with theGovernment; the function of the National Wages Authority should be confined to that of making recommendations to the Government regarding wage changes.16. The National Wages Authority could operate either passively, in response to applications for wage changes in different industries, or actively, by itself initiating proposals for such changes. It would tend to operate rather inthe first manner in conditions such as those prevailing at the present time, when,owing to the general labour shortage, there is an inflationary upward pressure on wages which needs to be held in check in the interests of price stability. In a timeNof slack trade and unemployment, on the other hand, the National Wages Autho-rity might itself try to promote wage increases, particularly in the worst paidindustries. The National Wages Authority would-also operate as a check on anytendency to wage-cutting which might develop in such conditions. Applications tothe National Wages Authority for wage changes might be received from tradeunions, from employers or from Government Departments.Principles of Operation17. As I have already stated, the two main functions of the National WagesAuthority would be : 1(a) to ensure that changes made in wages are not incompatible with generalprice stability;(6) to develop a structure of relative wages which would help to promote aflow of labour in the directions desired and to prevent a flow in the opposite direction.[33832] B 3
18. Generally speaking, it must be expected that wage increases will be passed on to consumers in the form of price increases. How far this process can take place without causing a general price inflation will depend on the extent towhich other factors such as increases in productivity and the squeezing of profit margins by means of efficient price control are at the same time effective in depressing prices. The National Wages Authority would, therefore, need tokeep itself fully informed of developments in uhese other fields which affect prices.In particular, it would require to study changes in the general level of produc-tivity and changes in profit margins.19. The first task, that of keeping wages in step with the requirements of price stability, consists therefore in limiting the extent of wage increases ingeneral, so that, in their effect on prices, they will do no more than counter-balance the fall in other costs due to improvements in productive efficiency,together with reductions in profit margins resulting from price control and anyother measures directed against restrictive practices. This does not mean, ofcourse, that wage policy or price policy, for that matter need be directed to preventing any individual price increases from occurring. To safeguard the valueof money, it is necessary only that some fair representative index of average price is kept stable. The scope for wage increases in any particular industry is notnecessarily dependent, therefore, on increased efficiency or a reduction in profit margins in that particular industry, but could equally be rendered possible(consistently with general price stability) by improved efficiency or reduced profit margins in quite another industry.20. The second task of the National Wages Authority would be, consistently with the requirements of price stability discussed above, to determine in whichindustries wages should be permitted to increase and in which industries, on theother hand, demands for wage increases should be resisted. Two main principles should be applied in making such decisions. The first would be that of promoting a desirable redistribution of the nation&apos;s labour force, and the second, the elimination -tion of unduly low wages and &quot; sweating &quot; in badly organised industries.21. In the application of the first principle, those industries and occupa-tions which were (a) of high priority, and (&amp;) suffering from particularly seriouslabour shortage (as measured by the number of unfilled vacancies) would receive more favourable treatment in respect of demands for wage increases than less essential industries or those in which the labour shortage was less acute.22. The second principle, that of eliminating &quot; sweating &quot; and unduly low wages, would be particularly important in times of slack trade and. unemploy-ment, when the workers in those industries would be especially vulnerable owingto the absence of alternative employment. The main object, at all times, wouldbe to ensure that no one was receiving wages for a full week&apos;s work which were insufficient to provide a reasonable minimum standard of living. The minimum wage for men should be based on the cost of providing a reasonable standardof living for a man plus the average number of dependants say, a wife and two children, taking into account the 5s. a week family allowance (subject to incometax) now provided in respect of the second child. The minimum for women wouldhave to be lower, on account of the smaller number of dependants, who, on theaverage, have to be supported by each female wage-earner. For juveniles the mini-mum would be lower still, since they are not normally self-supporting, but live athome. Some fixed proportion of the adult minimum for the same sex wouldbe appropriate, rising by stages, say at&apos;16 and 18 years, until it reached 100 percent, of the adult minimum at the age of 21.23. In considering wage changes in particular industries, the national wages Authority should devote particular attention to the incentive effect of the wage structure. Wherever, possible the structure should be such as to offer ahigh incentive to effort and efficiency. This can in many cases be achieved bymeans of piece-rate systems of payment, or by means of a high production bonussuperimposed on a basic rate related to a given production target. From thepoint of view of recruitment, it is mainly the weekly earnings that count. Fromthe incentive viewpoint, it will be better in general that any increase in rates should take the form of an increase in piece-rates or in the production bonusrather than in the basic rate. Questions of grading and differentials for skillwould also have to be taken into account, and the National Wages authority would require a trained staff of economists, statisticians and industrial psyeho-logists to investigate and advise on the effects of different systems of wagepayment.
The Role of Price Control24. As I indicated in paragraph 5 above, wage policy is only one element in our general price stabilisation policy; to be fully effective, it must be accom-panied by measures of direct price control (and, in certain cases, of rationing).Similarly, in regard to our second objective, that of influencing the distributionof labour between different industries, wage policy will be unlikely to be effectiveunless accompanied by a price control policy directed toward the same ends.For, although it may be perfectly feasible to establish minimum wages by law,it is far more difficult, and probably impracticable, to establish maxim-urn, wages in the same way. If this is true, we might easily find that even if we were to succeed in pushing up minimum rates in priority industries above those in less essential industries, the actual rates in the latter might rise still higher. Thisis where the need for direct price controls comes in. If the prices of less essential goods and services were strictly controlled, the temptation to entice labour intothem by the offer of wages in excess of those ruling in the essential industries would be strictly limited. In these circumstances wage increases, though theymight serve to secure some additional labour and thus make possible an expansionof output, would inevitably reduce the profit margin on each unit of output sold.Beyond a certain point the latter effect would outweigh the former and theinducement to further wage increases would disappear.25. At the present time the Board of Trade are inevitably hampered intheir efforts at direct price control by the absence of an effective wage policy.The argument that wages have in fact gone up has almost inevitably to be accepted as a justification for raising the controlled price. But once a distinction is drawn between permitted wage increases, based on a published recommendation of theNational Wages Authority, and other unauthorised wage increases, the pricecontrolling authority would be in a far stronger position. In the case of wage increases of the latter kind, they could adopt a firm line in resisting price increases, and might thereby succeed in preventing the unauthorised wage increases from occurring. This would be of advantage both from the point ofview of price stability as well as that of establishing wage differentials in favourof priority industries.26. In view of the close and vital relation between wage policy and price control, I feel it is most important to consider what means are available tbtighten up and extend the existing price controlling machinery. This is a matter on which it would be valuable to obtain the views of the Board of Trade, both inthe light of their past experience and also in view of the possible effects on theirprice control machinery of the adoption of a national wage policy of the kindadvocated in this paper. In particular, I would like them to consider how thecontrol of prices of the less essential goods and services could be tightened up.I realise that, in view of quality variations and the large number of smallenterprises concerned, effective price control in this sector is extremely difficult;nevertheless, as I have tried to show, it is particularly important, not only fromthe point of view of price stability, but even more from the point of view of thedistribution of labour between different industries.The Problem of General Labour Shortage27. While we may be able to secure some improvement in the labour supply to the high priority undermanned industries by means of the proposed national wages policy, combined with the provision of other kinds of incentive, it is nouse deceiving ourselves that the task will be an easy one or that a spectacularredistribution of labour is likely to follow such a policy. The truth is that weare up against labour shortages all round. All industries appear to be under-manned, and the logically corresponding &quot; overmanned, industries &quot; are nowhereto be seen.28. Apart from the wage policy discussed in the earlier part of this paper,there are two general approaches to this problem of overall labour shortage. Thefirst is to seek to increase the effective laboUr&apos; supply as a whole, which would offer sources of additional labour for the undermanned industries without thenecessity of raiding the hypothetical &apos;&apos; overmanned industries.&apos;&apos; I indicate brieflysome possible lines of attack in this direction in paragraph 31 below, but the total&quot;scope of such measures is obviously limited, particularly in the short run.
29. For our immediate purposes, I feel that we must inevitably have recourse to the second of the two general approaches referred to above. We mustconsciously select the industries which, from the point of view of government policy, we wish to regard as &quot; overmanned,&quot; and take deliberate steps to reducethe scope of these industries, thus forcibly releasing labour from them for thegenuinely undermanned industries. The &quot; overmanned industries &quot;in this senseare not industries in which there is no demand for, or even a surplus of, labour from the point of view of the employers concerned, under present market conditions.&apos; On the contrary the employers concerned no doubt regard these industries to-day as grossly undermanned. They are, however, overmanned inthe sense that if the existing resources of the country were to be distributed,according to the scale of urgency of their different products in the light of our general economic policy, these particular industries would be smaller than theyare to-day, and other basic industries (such as coalmining, agriculture and ironfoundries) would be larger.30. I feel convinced that the only really effective contribution to the problemof the undermanned industries in the short run would be to undertake a thorough,weeding out of labour from the less essential industries and occupations. Inthe absence of powers of direct labour control, the only way to achieve thiswould be by a ruthless cutting down of the scope of these industries. this could be effected by the use of the raw material allocation system, buildinglicences, investment control, and, in certain extieme cases, even by means of totalprohibitions.31. Apart from such methods of releasing labour from less essential occupa-tions, we should, as I have suggested above, neglect no opportunity of increasing our total labour force. In the first place we should increase, as far as possible,the proportion of our population engaged in productive employment (by offeringincentive to the married women who were employed during the war to returnto industry, inducing older workers to postpone retirement, &amp;o). At the sametime, we should do all we can to make more effective use of the man-poweralready at our disposal. There is plenty of scope for improvements in the efficiency of our industries, and we should press on with all the means at our disposal for promoting such improvements. The extension of mass production of standardisedarticles through the utility goods scheme; rigorous price control directed towardsthe elimination of the inefficient, and therefore high cost, producers; compara-tive studies-of production techniques adopted in different countries; reorganisa-tion and nationalisation of inefficient industries. Only by a vigorous pursuit ofall such methods of increasing productive efficiency shall we be able to providefor our people the standard of living to which they are entitled, and which,after all, it should be the primary aim of the economic policy of a SocialistGovernment to establish.Summary of Principal Conclusions and RecommendationsMy principal conclusions and recommendations may be summarised asfollows: (1) Both from the point of view of avoiding inflation and from that ofsecuring a rational distribution of man-power, the existing system of wage fixing by means of independent collective bargaining, industry by industry, has serious defects (paragraphs 1-9).(2) A National Wages Authority should, therefore, be set up to advise theGovernment on all wage changes (paragraphs 10-12).(3) The Authority should consist of representatives of trade unions,employers and the Government (paragraphs 13-14).(4) It should be responsible for ensuring (a) that wage changes should not be incompatible with the require-ments of price stabilisation policy;(&amp;) That the wages structure should be such as to promote a distri-bution of labour in accordance with the Government&apos;s economic policy;(c) that in no industry should wages for a full week&apos;s work be belowa level required to provide a reasonable standard of living;(d) that systems of wage payment should be designed, as far as pos-sible, to provide the maximum incentive to productive efficiency(paragraphs 15-23).
(5) The national wages policy must be accompanied by an effective price control policy directed towards reducing profit margins, as well aspromoting price stability and a rational distribution of resources(paragraphs 24-25).(6) An examination by the Board of Trade of possible methods of tighteningand extending the existing price control machinery particularly inthe less essential industries, would be of great value (paragraph 26).(7) Deliberate steps should be taken, by means of raw material controls,building licences, &amp;c., to reduce the scope of employment in less essential industries and occupations with a view to releasing labour for the undermanned priority industries (paragraph 30).(8) Further efforts should be made to increase the proportion of the popula-tion engaged in productive employment, particularly by persuadingwomen to remain in industry and older workers to postpone retirement(paragraph 31).(9) Measures to increase the efficiency of British industry should be accelerated, e.g., standardisation combined with large scale produc-tion, comparative international studies of production techniques,elimination of restrictive practices, reorganisation and nationalisa-tion of industry in general (paragraph 31).:       E.
