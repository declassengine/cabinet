Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1947 a        157Copy mo. 31CABINETDOUBLE DAY-SHIFT WORKING IN FACTORY EMPLOYMENTMemorandum by Minister of Labour and National service in March 1945 my predecessor (Mr. Bevin), after consultation with the then President of the Board of Trade, obtained1 the approval of the War Cabinetto the setting up of a Committee to consider double day-shift working in factories. Briefly, the reasons for setting up the Committee were that manyindustrialists foresaw great difficulty in meeting our production needs underpost-war conditions unless they could plan the installation of up-to-date machinery and plant with some assurance that they would be able to; run the machineryon a double shift system, say for 80 hours a week, whereas such planning washampered by existing legislation as to the hours of women and young personsin factories. Under the existing law the Ministry of Labour could authorisedouble day-shift working for women and young persons over 16 between. 6; a.m.and 10 p.m., but this could be done only by granting a special authority for aparticular factory, and (subject to an exception for new factories) such anauthorisation could only be given if the Minister were satisfied, after a ballotat the factory, that the majority of the workpeople concerned^ consent. If ageneral or widespread extension of the double shift system were contemplated the law appeared to require amendment so- that the system would no longer betreated as one requiring special permission to meet exceptional circumstancesat a particular factory, though there should at the same time be safeguards fortihe health and welfare of the workers. Further examination of the subject bya special&apos; Committee appeared; therefore, to be- called for. The War cabinet agreed that, though the Committee would be appointed by Mr: Bevin in consulta-tion with the-President of the Board of Trade as regards its constitution and terms of reference, the setting upiof the Committee and any decision, taken as aresult of the Committee&apos;s Report should be announced a,s a Government decision.2. The Committee has now submitted its Report and I attach a copy of aproof together with a summary (Annex I). It will be seen that, while emphasising the economic importance of making far greater use-of the double shift system in future, and pointing out that its social inconveniences^ would&apos;be offset to a; great extent by compensating advantages, and could be diminished in various1 ways;the Committee nevertheless recommend that a special authorisation&apos; shouldcontinue to be necessary, in the case of each factory and that the&apos;ballot&apos; shouldbe retained except for new factories. Moreover, while recommending that1 thenormal finishing time should be 11 p.m. instead of 10 p.m:, a majority o!f theCommittee consider that the overall period (including&apos;meal&apos;breaks) should&apos;stiirhelimited to 16 hours, though there should normally be no Saturday, work-sothat (allowing a meal break of half&apos;an hour for each shift)- tihe &quot;normal wdrkifaghours per shift per week could not exceed 37 . The&apos;other members suggest thatthe permitted hours should be 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. in view of the difficulty thatthey anticipate will be experienced in. regard to Saturday morning, work.3. I have carefully considered this Report in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade, ft seems clear that the Government&apos;could hardlyr&apos;ftnaUsetheir views on. the detailed&apos; questions raised by the Report&apos; until it nas&apos;been published and the numerous sections of industry concerned have had an oppor-tunity of studying it and submitting, through appropriate channels; any repre-sentations they may wish, to make as to the course to be taken. &apos;0n the otherband, if the Report is simply published without any Government comment,[33756] bSECRETCP.

many industrialists would tend to be discouraged from proceeding with plans for modernising their plant on the assumption that the Government are likelyto accept the recommendations of the majority of the Committee, or at any ratepending some indication from the Government as to their next step. I suggest,therefore, that the Report be presented to Parliament and published with a simultaneous preliminary statement in the terms of the draft in Annex II to the effect that, while endorsing some of the findings in the Report, the Govern-ment are not at present satisfied that some of the recommendations are sound and propose to consult the National Joint Advisory Council for Industry about them.4. I would propose, after the Report has been published with such a preliminary statement, and after a reasonable interval has been allowed for industry and others to consider it, to consult the National Joint Advisory Councilon the basis of the following provisional propositions : (a) It should no longer be necessary to obtain permission from the Ministerof Labour to introduce double day-shifts into individual factories; butthe firms should inform the Factory Inspector beforehand and theMinister should have power to impose special conditions for safe-fuarding the health and welfare of women and young persons,lowever, it is decided to keep the system of individual permits, theneither the ballot should be retained as a means of informing theMinister of the views of the workers or alternatively (following theusual practice in other cases where Orders authorising departures from normal Factories Act hours are applied for) there should be somerecognised but less formal and rigid procedure 01 inquiry by a FactoryInspector as to their views.(c) Consideration of the question of prohibiting the employment of youngpersons under 18. on double day-shift should be postponed for thepresent.(d) Subject to the necessary modifications being obtained in the InternationalLabour Conventions as to night work in industry (see below) the normalfinishing hour for shift work should be altered from 10 p.m. to11 p.m. with the possibility of an extension to midnight in special cases.(e) (i) The overall period of the double shift should not be rigidly confined to 16 hours, but an extension to 17 hours (including meal intervals)should be legally permissible,(ii) Arrangements for shift working with only 37^ working hours would not necessarily be inadequate, but in many cases the advantages of double day-shift working would be greatly diminished if it entaileda disproportionate reduction of working hours.5. The International Labour Conventions as to night work of women and young persons in industry are in somewhat too rigid terms to permit of thesubstitution of 11 p.m. for 10 p.m. as the normal finishing hour for double day-shift working. It is proposed, however, that the Conventions should come upfor review at the International Labour Conference next year, and I proposethat we should take that opportunity of endeavouring to secure amendments of the Conventions to permit of this extension of the finishing hour, in view of changes in social habits since the Conventions were originally framed. Thereis reason to believe that such amendments would receive support from some other important Governments. The matter is, however, complicated by certain time limits governing procedure; unless these Conventions are denounced before november next we shall be bound by them for a further ten years, and I proposethat, in order to safeguard our freedom of action and keep the position open,we should formally denounce these Conventions before next November. Thedenunciation would not actually take effect for another 12 months, and we could then review the position in the light of what has happened at the Conference of1948.6. Fresh legislation in this country as to double day-shift working in factories does not appear to be a matter of urgency indeed we are at presentprecluded by the International Conventions from permanent legislation toauthorise an 11 p.m. finish as a normal arrangement. Meantime, shifts between  a.m. and 10 p.m. can be (and are to some extent being) authorised for individualfactories under the present ordinary law, double day-shifts with these or otherhours (sometime with a stop after 10 p.m.) are temporarily authorised in special cases under Emergency Powers, and it may be found justifiable to do this on
a wider scale either as an incidental part of schemes for spreading the electricityload especially after the summer or in the case of particular factories produc-ing supplies essential to the well-being of the community.7.   I accordingly ask for approval of the following: (i) The Report of the Committee should be Presented to Parliament and published, with a simultaneous preliminary statement (or preface)in the terms of Annex II to this memorandum.(ii) Thereafter, I should consult the National Joint Advisory Council for industry as to various points of detail, on the basis of the provisionalpropositions in paragraph 4 above, before tine Government finalises itsviews.(iii) We should formally denounce the two night-work conventions in question by November of this year so as to keep the position open for reviewnext year.G.

ANNEX I summary of Report of Committee on Double Day-shift Working1. The Committee was appointed by Mr. Ernest Bevin in March 1945,under the Chairmanship of Professor J. L. Brierly, C.B.E., J.P., D.C.L., LL.M.,&quot; to enquire into the economic need for and the social consequences of the doubleday-shift system in manufacturing industry and the changes in the existing lawthat would be necessary to facilitate its wider adoption, and to make recom-mendations.&quot;Economic need for the system. The Committee deal in the main with the need for a more extensive useof the system as a normal and permanent feature of industrial organisation.This need arises because of the tendency for machinery and plant to get moreelaborate and costly and also to be quickly rendered out of date, since the system would lead to a reduction of over-heads in relation to the value of the productand to more work being got out of machinery before it became out of date.Social consequences3. The adoption of the system will be of advantage in so far as it will be a factor influencing favourably the country&apos;s standard of living and, the leisureof industrial workers. It must, however, involve some measure of dislocation of family life and of education and recreational activities for which facilities are normally provided only in the evenings.Prospects of adoption of the system4. The wider adoption of the system will depend on the willingness of individual employers to examine closely its advantages in their particular cases and on the workers being convinced that its social inconveniences to themselvescan and will be offset as far as possible by compensating benefits. These factorswill be at least as important as any changes in the existing law.State of the existing law5. Generally speaking, the present legal restrictions on the hours of women and young persons mean that they cannot be employed in factories on this systemunless it has been specially authorised by the Minister of Labour and NationalService for the factory concerned. Except where it is proposed to open new factories on a double day-shift basis such an authorisation can be granted only if, after a secret ballot, the Minister is satisfied that the majority of the work-people concerned consent. Subject to these conditions, shift systems between  a.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays and 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturdays may beauthorised for women and young persons over 16.Committee&apos;s recommendations. The Committee recommend that authorisation should continue to begranted only in respect of individual factories or departments of factories andthat the ballot should be retained except for new factories, although it should benecessary to secure only a favourable majority of the workpeople who actuallyvote. As regards hours, they recommend that there should normally be noSaturday work but that provision should be made for a limited amount of over-time on Saturday mornings. They also recommend that the hours should normallyfall between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. but recognise that international labour con-ventions may not be wide enough to allow this recommendation to be fullyimplemented.These recommendations are unanimous except that three of the nine members have entered two reservations. They consider that negotiations with representa-tives of the workpeople should be substituted for the ballot and that the permittedhours should be 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. in view of the difficulty that they anticipate willbe experienced in regard to Saturday morning work.The Committee also recommend unanimously that double day-shift workingby young persons under 18 should in general be prohibited but that latitude inthis matter may be allowed for a period not exceeding two years. They do not recommend any change in the law which at present permits double day-shift working by youths in certain industries under Section 81 of the Factories Actand they express no opinion on shift arrangements in connection with certainperishable commodities under Sections 94 and 95 of the Act.

DOUBLE DAY-SHIFT WORKING1 REPORT OF COMMITTEE.To:  . . . v-.&apos;-    &apos;      ...The Rt. Hon. George Isaacs, M.P.,Minister of Labour and National Service.Sir,The Committee was appointed on 20th March, 1945, by.the.&apos; (then) Ministerof Labour and National Service with the following terms of reference:  To enquire into the, economic need for and the social consequences of the double day-shift system in manufacturing industry and the changes in theexisting law that would be necessary to facilitate its wider adoption, andto make recommendations.We now have the honour to submit our. report.We have received a considerable amount of.written evidence and most ofit has been supported by witnesses who appeared before the Committee.Details of the sources from which we have obtained information and evidenceare given in Appendix B.I. The double day-shift system (or two-shift system as it is sometimes called)is a system of working in which production continues over a very long workingday by means of two shifts of workpeople, each of which works only a normalor even a relatively short number of hours each day. A common form ofthe system in the past in this country has been one of two shifts workingfrom 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. respectively on Monday toFriday and one shift working from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, though there have been variations on this general practice. It is desirable, we think,to give a brief account of the extent to which the system of working has been used in the past.HISTORY OF DOUBLE DAY-SHIFT WORKING2. In general, shift working of any kind seems to have been most unusualbefore the war of 1914-18 except in those industries in which certain processesare. for technical reasons, continuous and in. which work has necessarily to becarried on in shifts.. A&apos;double day-shift system was adopted-in certaininstances in connection with men&apos;s employment by employers who wished tosecure increased output and a greater turn-over in proportion to the capitalengaged, but the extent to which it was used was very limited indeed. Sofar as women and young persons were concerned, the provisions of theFactory and Workshop Act, 1901, regulating the hours of employment and work of women and young persons in factories at that time precluded theemployment of women in shifts for all practical purposes, and no substantialneed for such working by women seems to have been experienced by manu-facturers before 1914. In general they were able to increase output as requiredby enlargement of premises and plant or, if the pressure for output wastemporary, by extension of the ordinary working hours, and it should beborne in mind that at that time the permissible working hours for women and young persons were 60 a week in non-textile factories (and in textilefactories 55J) and that such hours were in fact frequently worked. Between1914 and 1918 the need for munitions led to a widespread increase in shift working by,men, women and young.persons, the employment of the lattertwo categories on shifts being sanctioned by Orders issued under the Defenceof the Realm Regulations.   In the early part of the war the system chiefly
adopted was that of two alternating day and night shifts, but later this wasreplaced to a considerable extent by a system of three eight-hour shifts, andwhen night work was not necessary by a system of two day shifts or, as it isnow called, the double day-shift system.3. After 1918 an extensive demand arose for articles required for recon-struction and for commodities the production of which had been restrictedduring the war, with the result that various industries which had not been active during the war were overwhelmed with orders. These could not bemet by pre-war methods, and a shortage of skilled male labour and of materials to a great extent made extension of premises and plant impossible and a strongmovement in the country for the introduction of shorter working hours notonly made recourse to overtime difficult but rendered it desirable to re-organisework on the basis of the 48 hour week. In these circumstances the possibilityof continuing shift working for purposes of peace production was widely con-sidered in industry. The Government was not prepared to sanction in peacetime the employment of women and young persons on shift systems involvingnight work,* but during the transition period their employment on the doubleday-shift system was authorised in suitable cases, and at the same time aCommittee was appointed to consider whether it was desirable &quot; that theFactory and Workshops Acts should be so amended as to allow women and young persons to be employed on the system of two day-shifts, and if so, what should be the length- of the shifts and the time for beginning and ceasingwork &apos;&apos;. The Committee recommended-.amongst other things that the Secretaryof State (then responsible for the administration of the Factory and WorkshopActs) should be given power to make Orders allowing the employment ofwomen and young persons of 16 years of age and over on a double day-shift system, the shifts to be of not more than eight hours average duration betweenthe hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Friday and 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.on Saturday. Following the Committee&apos;s report, Section 2 of the Employmentof Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1920, provided that the Secretaryof State might on the joint application of the employer or employers of anyfactory or group of factories and&apos;the majority of the workpeople concerned,make Orders authorising the employment of women and young persons ofthe age of 16 years and upwards in any factory or group of factories between  a.m. and 10 p.m. Monday to Friday and 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturday inshifts averaging for each shift not more than eight hours per day and thatthe Secretary of State might attach to any Orders issued under Section 2 suchconditions as he considered necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the- welfare and interests of the persons employed in pursuance of the Order. Thislegal provision was introduced on a temporary basis and Section 2 of the Actwas to remain in force for a period of five years. It was, however, regularlycontinued year by year after 1925 until it was superseded by the Employmentof Women and Young Persons Act, 1936, which continued, on a more per-manent basis and with some important changes in the procedure of applicationsfor and granting of authorisations, the Secretary of State&apos;s power to authorisedouble day-shift Working within the limits set out in the Act of 1920. TheEmployment of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936, which is dealt within greater detail later in this report, followed on the report of a departmentalcommittee appointed in 1934 &apos;&apos; to enquire into the working of the temporary provisions contained in Section 2 of the Employment of Women, YoungPersons and Children Act, 1920, and Orders made thereunder whereby womeinand young persons of the age of 16 years and upwards may be employedin a factory or workshop on a system of two day-shifts, and to advise whether* Night work continued to be permissible under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, formale young persons in certain industries.
.or not this system should be continued on a permanent basis, either with or without alteration of the existing law and procedure &quot;, and gave effect tothe Committee&apos;s recommendation that the temporary provisions of the 1920Act should be made permanent with certain modifications of, the law and procedure.4. A good deal of information is available in respect of the employment ofwomen and young persons on the double day-shift system between 1920 and1939, because an employer had to obtain a special authorisation under the1920 Act or the 1936 Act referred to above. 2,931 authorisations for theemployment of women or young persons or both on the double day-shift system were issued from the beginning of 1921 to the end of 1938 at thefollowing rate: 1921-1924 425 (average 106 per year)&quot;J Under the Employment of1925-1930 619 (average 103 per year) \- Women, Young Persons and1931-1936   1,596 (average 266 per year) J  Children Act, 19201937 ... i26\ Under the Employment of Women and Young Persons1938   ... 165/ Act, 1936.During 1937 an enquiry was made into the use of the 2,640 authorisatioinsissued before the beginning of that year and 1,687 were &quot;written off becausethey had not been used for one year or more; and&apos; after 1937 a furthernumber were revoked, leaving about 560 effective at the beginning of the war.Of the authorisations granted in 1937 and 1938, 219 were not recorded asdead at the beginning of the war.The number of authorisations issued is very small indeed in relation to thetotal number of factories in the country and, moreover, very few of theauthorisations applied to a whole &quot;factory. The number of women and youngpersons affected by each individual authorisation varied considerably (anauthorisation might relate to as few as two workpeople) but it was estimatedthat about 35,700 women and young persons were working on the doubleday-shift system in 1934. Comparable information.as to the extent of doubleday-shift working by men between 1920 and 1939 is not available as men could,&apos; of course, be employed on shifts without legal authorisation. Informa-tion obtained between the two wars in the course of enquiries made by theMinistry.of Labour into earnings and hours of labour indicated a number of manufacturing industries in which considerable proportions of the workpeoplewere employed on shifts. Many of these industries, however, involved con-tinuous processes in which the shifts&quot; would necessarily be arranged to cover both day and night working. On those processes men and male youngpersons are employed and there would not seem to be much double day-shift working by men except in connection with a three shift system.5. In general, therefore, between the two wars the double day-shift systemof working, though used at one time or another in a very wide variety ofindustries, was in relation to the whole field of manufacturing industry usedon a very limited scale indeed., In the cases where the system was used, itseems generally to have been for one or other of a number of special orexceptional reasons and with the exception of a few continuous industries thesystem was rarely used as a permanent part of the organisation of the work ina factory. A number of contributory reasons for the limited use made of thesystem have been suggested at one time or another. It has been said thatthe temporary character of the legislation between 1920 and 1936 deterredmanufacturers from considering the adoption of the system as a part of thepermanent organisation of industry, that the complicated procedure of appli-cation for authorisation by special order was also a deterrent, and that the
) system was unpopular with the workpeople and employers were, therefore,reluctant to try it. * These factors were no doubt important, but the main reason why the system was not adopted as part of the normal organisationof industry and why there was little or no pressure for its adoption as suchby employers, is probably that between 1921 and 1939 there was over thewhole field of industry generally no strong economic incentive to increase output. /&quot;&apos;.-.6. During the war from 1939 to 1945 the pressure for output and the needfor economic use of factory space and plant led, amongst other results, to aconsiderable increase in shift working of all kinds by men, women and youngpersons. Authorisations were issued under emergency powers permitting theemployment of women and young persons on a wide variety of shift systems,including three shifts, two (day and night) shifts and double day-shifts. Thenumbers of such authorisations current in May, 1944, and February, 1945,in the different systems were as follows:  Three       Double Two (Day and TotalShifts    Day-Shifts Night) Shifts AoMay, 1944...      ...      1,419        1,304          5.097 7fimFebruary, 1945   ...      1,145 .     1,139          4.054 6,338Authorisations of shift working by women and young persons were muchgreater in number than in peace time and the number of factories in whichthe double day-shift system of working was used increased during the war.Nevertheless, in relation to industry as a whole, the extent of shift workingeven during the war was comparatively small and the number of emergencyauthorisations issued during the war to allow extended day work far exceeded the authorisations required for shift working. In May, 1944, when therewere 7,835 shift orders there were over 20,000 orders current for extendedday work and in February, 1945, when there were 6,338 shift orders therewere over 16,000 orders current for extended day work.*ECONOMIC NEED FOR DOUBLE DAY-SHIFT WORKING.    .7. We set out below a summary of our considerations as to the probablefuture need for the adoption of the double day-shift system in industry under three heads dealing separately with the need for the system (a) to meetexceptional circumstances, (b) as a normal and permanent feature of indus-trial organisation and (c) to meet temporary difficulties in the immediate post-war period.NEED FOE THE SYSTEM TO MEET EXCEPTIONAL - CIRCUMSTANCES.- 8. As indicated above, the double day-shift system was used between 1920and 1939 on a very limited scale and in the great majority of cases to meetexceptional circumstances which did not occur generally in industry. Thecircumstances in which the system was found to be advantageous are dealtwith in the 1935 Report of the Departmental Committee on the Employmentof Women and Young Persons on the Two Shift System, and can be sum-marised as follows :.-(a) It enables a sudden demand for increase of output which might result from seasonal pressure, breakdown of. plant, or other causes, to be met withoutextension of plant,(b) In industries which are subject to rapid changes of fashion it facilitatesadjustment of production to new situations as they arise.   The changes may* The corresponding figures for August, 1946, are 1,156 emergency orders for shift workand 1,849 for extended day work.

Special circumstancesof this kind will continue to exist in industry and it can be assumed we thinkthat manufacturers will wish to. make.use of the double day-shift system tomeet problems arising from them. We would only add that if, as can be reasonably anticipated, the amount of unemployment in the future is lessthan it was between the two wars, they may well find it more difficult toObtain quickly the additional labour necessary; to work the double day-shift system for a short period to meet the temporary needs of (0) to (d) and theremay consequently be less use made of the system for this purpose an advan-tageous development in so far as it results in a decrease in the amount ofbroken and seasonal employment of persons available for regular and full-time work. -NEED FOR THE SYSTEM AS A NORMAL AND PERMANENT FEATURE&apos; OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATION.10, It was with this aspect of the subject that the evidence we. receivedfrom the Board of Trade and representatives of various industries was largelyconcerned. The principal questions to which our attention was directed werethe relation between capital charges and output and the probable future posi-tion of industry in this regard and likely future developments affecting hoursof work in industry. -..ii. The evidence we received ifrom the Board of Trade and from H.M. ChiefInspector&apos; of Factories emphasised that industry was becoming increasinglymechanised and that industrial plant and machinery were becoming moreelaborate and more expensive. These general statements, which.would not,We think, be questioned, were supported by many examples in the evidence given by the Board of Trade and by representatives of particular industries.The process results in an increase in the capital charges which a manufacturer&apos;has to meet and irr-mediately raises, the question-more or less acutely accord-ing to the proportion of these charges in the total xOst of production-of theoutput over which they can be &quot;spread. If the proportion of the capital costof machinery and plant in the total cpst of production increases, the manu-facturer will wish to increase the output of&apos;his machinery and plant by runningit for longer hours.The process of increased mechanisation of industry has been going on fora considerable time and has for many years been generally recognised as an inevitable and continuing process. It was one of the arguments advanced infavour of the adoption of the double day-shift system by some witnesses beforethe Committee which sat in 1920. It has not in the past, however, resulted inany widespread use of the system by industry and we, therefore, considered
. .    .      &apos; -     ,      9 ^ - -whether the continuance of the process in the future was likely to strengthen the economic need for the system to such an extent that it would in fact be usedon a wider scale.We were not able to get as much detailed information as we should have-liked as to the proportions of total costs to be attributed to capital equipment,labour, etc., from the industries which gave evidence to us, because of apparentvariation.in accounting practice in different firms when making allowance for capital costs, because of the great number of different factors;which have to-be;taken into account even within one&apos;industry, and because.in many cases the-industry had only limited experience of double day-shift working in the past and calculations as to its economic value in the future had necessarily beenmade in rather general terms.   We are, however, satisfied that the general considerations put before us by manufacturers and referred to in the following paragraphs were oh a sound economic basis.    - ;    -      .12. The,evidence we received from the Board of Trade and particular indus-tries made it clear that many manufacturers think that there is likely to be an.increased need for the system to be used more extensively in the future and.that many have already given detailed consideration to the working of the-system in their own factories as part of their post-war plans.- Many industries of major importance, in peace time have been working on a much reduced scale during the war-obvious examples are cotton, wool, jute, rayon, hosiery,&quot;pottery, glass and hollow-ware and these and other. industries will expandconsiderably ;now the war is over. In many of these industries there are already,plans to re-equip the factories by installing new and more up-to-date machinery and plant and on a more limited. scale to build new and more up-to-datepremises. General re-equipment of many industries which have not been ableto re-equip during the war is likely to be a widespread process in the post-war years and to be undertaken in the reasonably near future by many employers who have not, as yet, worked out detailed schemes. New premises will bemore expensive than they would have been before ,1939 because of theincreased cost of building, and the evidence we received as to the cost of new machinery as compared with the cost, 6r estimated capital value, of themachinery which industries were working before the war, made it clear thatre-equipment will mean a considerable increase in the proportion of capital costs in the total production costs.13.&quot; As one striking example, of the need felt by manufacturers to adoptdouble day-shift working in consequence of re-equipment we quote the case ofthe weaving section of the cotton industry. The cost. of modern automaticlooms runs, we were told, from between  140 and  200 to  500 or even as high as  700 lor the more elaborate types as compared with the cost of  40 for theOrdinary1 Lancashire loom which was in general use in the industry.before thewar. The automatic loom occupies more space which means less looms pershed and it requires: special ancillary machinery. On the other hand the, number&apos; of workpeople needed for automatic looms is considerably less than for.&apos;the same number of Lancashire looms and the aggregate labour cost allow-ing .for high wages is rnUchdower. - Thus in a mill equipped with automaticlooms a much increased proportion of the total cost of production will be dueto the high capital cost of the equipment. In the view of the representatives,of the industry;who gave evidence to us it will be imperative for new machinery to run as many hours as are reasonably practicable to spread the overheadcosts over-the maximum Output.. -The Cotton Spinners- and Manufacturers&apos;Association in their evidence stated:         , * -    , , -&apos; . ;-v/iri *VIt is essential for automatic looms to run at least two shifts to make thefria commercial competitive proposition.&quot;    r- * .--&apos;-&apos;&apos;-r53144 A3
10It is interesting to note that many of the very small number of authori-sations issued under the 1920 and 1936 Acts permitting double day-shift working in the cotton Weaving industry have been in respect of factories using auto-matic looms, and there seems no doubt that when the number of firms usingsuch looms increases, as it will do if the present plans of the manufacturers inthe industry are carried out, there will be an increasing desire by manufacturers to use the double day-shift system. We were informed that the replacing of lancashire looms by automatic looms would be a gradual process and thatnumbers of mills for a considerable period would continue to use the former,which under some circumstances are thought to be advantageous, but even iathose mills which do not install the more expensive automatic looms, the plans -for post-war reconstruction in the industry will result in increased capital costs. The post-war plans for these mills include the respacing of machinery,the introduction of more efficient preparatory machinery, and generallyimproved working conditions and welfare facilities. The repairs, renewals, andalterations entailed in connection with these plans will call for considerablecapital expenditure, varying from factory to factory. (Double day-shift work-ing, it was suggested, will frequently be.desirable in their case to obtainincreased spread of fixed charges over output.14. We have given some details of the position &quot;which employers thought likely to arise in the cotton weaving industry as a particularly good example of the extent to which the need for manufacturers to re-equip many of theirfactories in the post-war period will tend to result in their wishing to make useof the double day-shift system of Working. We received evidence relating toother industries, e.g., jute and rayon, which indicates that similar problemsexisted in them and that manufacturers were thinking on similar lines.Many industries did not, of course, give evidence before us and it may bethat many are not faced with this problem of re-equipping, at considerable expense in the immediate future, either because they have been active duringthe war and maintained their plant and equipment at a high level of efficiency,or because they may have installed new plant and equipment just before thewar, or because there have been no technical changes in the character of the manufacturing equipment and plant in use in the industry and the pre-warplant and equipment is not, therefore, obsolescent. It is not improbable,however, that the problem which exists as an immediate one in the industrieswe have mentioned above, will arise in other industries some time in the future and that the same considerations in regard to the need for double day-shift working will arise in the miiids of manufacturers.We have laid stress on the advantages offered by the double day-shift system in industries which are facing or may in the future have to face aserious problem of re-equipment, but we must not be taken to imply that itis only where sHch a problem exists that it may be desirable for the introductionof the system to be considered.. The system may, we think, also have animportant bearing on the. competitive efficiency of British industry in general.&quot; 15. Whatever their position as regards re-equipment, all manufacturing industries are likely to be affected to some extent by future developmentsaffecting hours of work in industry. Since 1918 there has been a general ten-dehcy towards a reduction of the hours worked in industry which, though iriter-lfiipted during the war (19391-1945),&quot;is likely to- be resumed in the &quot;post-war period; The Factories Act, 1937, reduced the maximum working hours forwomen and young persons of-&apos;iti or over from 60 per week in non-textilefactories (55J in textile factories) to 48 hours plus a limited amount of overtime.(Fuller details as to the&apos;legal&quot;position are given in Appendix A.) , But the lawhad lagged behind industrial practice in&apos; the period between;.the two wars
and, a working-week of 48 hours or thereabouts had already been widelyadopted . in manufacturing industry before the reductions effected- by the factories Act, 1937, became law. There was also during the period:a strongmovement to obtain a further &quot;reduction of hours below 48 a week;, There hasalready since the end of the war been a general tendency towards a &quot;reductionof working hours, but we cannot forecast to What extent this process willcontinue, whether there will be a further, reduction and how rapidly such a-reduction may take place, to what extent the movement for a 40 hour week islikely to be successful, and whether there is any possibility, of it resultingeventually in a further restriction by law of the hours of work of women and young persons. However, the time for which a manufacturer can work hismachinery Without using a shift system has become increasingly limited since1918, arid it seems probable that it may in the future be further hmited by&quot;industrial agreement, if not by law. / This. tendency towards a reduction ofthe hours worked :by individual workers in industry will undoubtedly &quot;actasan additional incentive to manufacturers to adopt the double day-shift systemof toofk.&apos;: ] i6\; We have so far set: out briefly the considerations which we- think, from(the evidence we received, are likely to induce manufacturers, to wish toadopt the double day-shift system to an increasing extent,in the future ,andhave indicated&apos; the economic advantages to the manufacturer likely to result from its adoption. The question is of importance not only to the individual employers, however, but to the country. The1 Government has made it clearon many occasions that British industry.is going to have a most difficult-timein. the immediate future and that all practical steps should be taken to make;it as efficient as possible by the installation of the most modern equipment.The export industries in ^particular-and these include many of those mentionedin the preceding paragraphs -must be raised&apos;to the highest point of efficiencyif the standard of living of the country is to be maintained and improved. Ifmanufacturers in these industries are prepared to undertake the re-equipment&apos; of their factories with the most -efficient machinery and plant only on the basisof a double day-shift being worked, the importance to the country of this -equipment taking place affords one of the strongest possible economic argu-Reinforcements in favour:of.the system being adopted.     &apos;.-,.v In addition, it is desirable that after the enormous expenditure and deprecia-tion Of capital during the war; efforts should be made; in the. immediatefuture at any rate, to husband, the Capital resources of-the country, which forthis reason cannot easily afford to have plant and machinery lying idle for a half or two-thirds of the day. &apos; * l17. The above considerations are of immediate and vital, importance. Thereare also economic arguments in. favour of the, wider adoption of the system which are of considerable importance from a long term point of view. Itseems likely that the use of the system will not only help to make possiblethe re-equipment necessary in the immediate future, but,will alsor be .,a longterm influence in favour of the maintenance of increased efficiency in industry.Once ^machinery arid plant have been. installed, there&apos;is naturally a--tendency:ta-go on working them as long as they will do. a job ofcwork, eventhough since their installation more efficient machinery and plant have been developed,- One result of,double day-shift jworking however, is-that plant and machinery wear out in a shorter time, and the&quot; full use is more likely tabeobtained from them before, they become out-of-date. As a result renewalwould be less dependent than it is under a single shift system on the pre-cariouspressure; exerted by the factor of &quot;obsolescence; arid the plant.,and, machinery- would,b&apos;e more likely to be as up to date arid, efficient as possible.53144, A 4
12If, as it seems reasonable to assume, this country is likely in the comingdecades to experience a general shortage, of manpower and to have a working population in which the proportion of older people is increasing, it is important that the labour force in industry Should be used with the greatest economyi and efficiency. This, can only be done if industry possesses the best possiblemachinery and plant.i A further advantage of the double day-shift system is, as the 1935 reportpoints out, that it enables processes which are essentially women&apos;s work to bekept level with those of men in industries where the manufacture is carriedon continuously by a succession of shifts, thus making it possible to keep thefullest number of men employed and to secure the maximum output. Examplesoccur in the manufacture of artificial silk, rubber tyres, latex thread, yeastand aluminium. Finally, we think it is worth while mentioning the economy in land occupied by factories and industrial premises which would result froman extended adoption of the system. In view of the need to make the mostprofitable use from the point of view of the community of the restricted national resources of land, a subject to which considerable attention has been paid inrecent years, we think this is likely to be a long term advantage of considerable importance.18. We feel we.should not end this section of our report without recordingthat the evidence we received referred to certain economic disadvantages in connection with the double day-shift system. Reference was made, forexample, to the higher hourly rate of wages which would probably have to bepaid; to the fact that when the same job on the same machine is tended by two different people, there is often waste and scrapping on a larger scale; and to theincrease necessary in the number of supervisory officers such as departmentalmanagers and foremen. As against these considerations there are a numberof subsidiary economic advantages. It is likely, we understand, that a manu-facturer working the system would obtain electric power at a lower price per unit, and though no definite estimate can be made, that there would in somecases at any rate be a saving of fuel; it has been found that the output perhour on shift working is often greater than on ordinary day work; in certainprocesses, e.g., in the rayon industry, it is advantageous that the machinesshould run uninterruptedly for as long a period as practicable, and in caseswhere certain atmospheric conditions have to be maintained in a factory,production is facilitated by maintenance for as long as practicable once theappropriate conditions have been established. There is one further aspect of double day-shift working which, while it does not affect costs or output inthe industries concerned, has a bearing on the well-being of the community as a whole and consequently, we think, deserves to be mentioned. This isthe effect which the wider adoption of the system would have on the stagger-ing of workers&apos; transport requirements. Staggering would result in a con-siderable over-all economy in road passenger transport vehicles, but wouldin its turn involve additional problems in connection with the hours ofwork of transport workers.Need.for the system in the immediate post-war period. .&apos;: : 19. We have so far considered the long term economic need for the doubleday-shift system in industry, both to meet exceptional but recurring circum-. stancesand normal-industrial conditions which seem likely to exist in thefuture. &quot;We. wish :also to make some reference to the possibly- extended use.ofthe system to meet temporary conditions of the immediate post-war period.There will in the next few years be a great deal of leeway to make up in the. way of accumulated demand.   In many cases it will be impracticable to lii-. crease production quickly by installing new plant or building new factories,
and there may be a case for working a double day-shift system on/existingplant. Whether this will in any particular case bea practicable way of in-creasing output will, of course, depend on the possibility of the necessaryadditional labour being available. It may be that in some industries theshortage of labour will be no less acute than the shortage of plant, premises,and raw materials, and the extent to which the system is likely.to be usedto meet accumulated demand will depend on the relative difficulties of supply.The National Employers&apos; Association of Rayon Yarn Producers said that&quot; On the assumption that the supply of labour temporarily overtakes the ayaila-bility of plant, .... shift working will be the only solution; and several firms in our industry have pointed out that having regard to the present shortage of plant, the rapid and smooth absorption of employees released from the -armed forces will be greatly eased by double day-shift working.&apos;&apos; On the other hand,the Federation^ Master Cotton Spinners thought that in spite of efforts beingmade to increase the supply of labour to&apos; the industry and to economise in its use by better distribution of work, the shortage was such that the generaladoption of the double day-shift system did not appear possible in the nearfuture. In any case it might be undesirable for the system to be adopted tomeet a large temporary demand which could be satisfied in.a comparatively short time, as a larger labour force would as a result be attracted to an industry than that industry-could normally use and this might prevent or delay labourgoing to some other industry which needed it on a permanent basis. It isimpossible in view of all these considerations to make a certain forecast of theneed for the use of-the system during this transition period beyond saying thatthere will be some cases in which output is so inadequate to meet accumulateddemand that it will take five or ten years to catch up and that in these casesdouble day-shift working may, if labour is available, be a most effective and desirable means of increasing production.SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOUBLE DAY-SHIFT SYSTEM20. The economic and social aspects of the subject are to a great extentinter-dependent. As we have already indicated when considering the economicneed for the system, its extension is closely related, first, to the efficiency ofa number of industries which are of first importance to the general prosperity of the country, and secondly, to future developments in regard to hours ofwork in industry. These two matters, though we have dealt with themprimarily from the economic aspect, are of major importance in consideringthe social consequences of the system, for if the considerations we have setout as to the economic need for the system are accepted, wider use of it maybe argued as desirable on social grounds in so far as this will be a factor- influencing favourably (a) the standard of living which it will be possible tomaintain in the country, and (6) the leisure which workers in industry&apos;-willbe able to enjoy. As regard (a) we do not think it is necessary to add any-thing to what is contained in the previous part of this report. It is, however,appropriate to state more fully our views as to the relation between doubleday-shift working and hours of work in industry.. .- - - -        . GENERAL. .,21. It is clearly a desirable social policy at any time to reduce hours ofwork so far as is: practicable. We have no hesitation in saying, and. wethink there&apos; would be general agreement, that if economic considerationscould be ignored, the ideal method of working in this country, particularlyduring the winter months, is the ordinary day work scheme, and the most likely way&apos; of making a reduction of the hours of work to something in the region of a 40 hour-week would be simply to reduce the number of.hours53H4 A 5
if^worked.&quot;each day so:that the working day started somewhere about ;;8 or.9iri&quot;the &quot;morning and: finished at a reasonable time in; the. late afternoon.Ordinary day: working, however, is not; and cannot be the normal practiceover a very considerable ;nelfl of industry.   We have already referred. to-manufacturing processes which&apos;have:tb be carried on: continuously &quot;for: tech-- nical reasons and in which workers have to work on shifts.. These include-the.: electricity and-gas supply industries.   In addition, a great number of-workers are employed oh shifts in industries7 which are. not covered by. theCommittee&apos;s terms of reference, &apos;e:g; the railway and road: transport industries.&quot;Persons employed&apos;in-manufacturing industries which, for economic reasonsheeded to Work a double day-shift system would not, therefore, be exceptional-iri;&apos;workmg outside the ordinary hours of day work. : Moreover, whereasmany workers in the continuous transport and supply industries are employed at one time or another all round the clock; employment on a double day-shift excludes night work and is the system which departs less;than anyother shift system from the ordinary hours of day work. We have, .we think,already shown that in certain industries in future the economic circumstances will be such that a continuance of working hours at pre-war level of about48 hours a week would severely handicap their development and that reduc-tion to anything in the region of 40 hours a week would, for economic reasons,be practical only if double day-shifts were worked.   On social grounds it;is a very strong argument in favour of an extension of the system in industry that such extension will make possible a more general reduction in workinghburs for the iridiyidual operative than would otherwise be practicable.Whether or not it is a conclusive argument depends on the other social consequences of the system.     :   &quot; :&quot;&quot; .rr&apos;    &apos; r;&apos;:&apos; U&apos;.-- &apos;] &apos;     &quot;  1    5&quot;&quot; &quot;22. The general&apos; effects of the system.so., far.as the individual worker isconcerned were very fully considered by the Departmental Committeeappointed in,1.934 which took evidence from a considerable number of indi-vidual workers-and from&apos; welfare workers and: works doctors.&apos; The Cbm-: mittce&apos;s views are set out on pages 12 to. 17 of their report.   Conclusions asto the effects of the system on the workpeople concerned must be largely. based . on an examination. of actual experience &apos; of its working.   The 1934-Committee made a detailed, study, of the experience which had been/gained; between 1920 and 1934 and we thought it.would be of little value to cover the ground in the same detail for the four years between the date of &quot;-their- report and the recent war.:   Moreover, although there was a considerable. extension of shift working of various kinds during the war, other working and-living conditions were then abnormal and a close examination of the effects of double day-shift working on the health or social life of workpeople duringthe war is, it seems: to us,., of only limited relevance to peace-time conditions.For example, a considerable number of workers during the war. were living..in hostels where their social-life and the arrangement of their meals could.be,-made to fit in with the free periods allowed by shift, working.   It is clear-that, in making our recommendations, we should&quot;,&quot;have in:.mind peace-time conditions, remembering, however, that this may. not mean conditionsidentical with those that obtained immediately before the outbreak of war.&apos;23. We wish to make one general point which we think was not given&quot;sufficient emphasis iri the: 1935 Report: For the&quot;individual&quot;worker concerned:a&quot; change from ordinary day Work to the double day-shift system is a &quot;very&apos; radical and substantial change, affecting the day-to-day organisation of &quot;his^private life. This is important becausfe it means: that rnanysworkpeopte will: be&apos; reluctant; and-m our view not unreasonably, to adopt&quot; the&apos; system iri the&quot;first.iristarice unless the reasons for doing so are:fully explained to them andEas&quot; fair an account; i as&apos; possible is given &quot;of its&apos; coriiparative&quot; advantages &quot;and
1% disadvantages and of the economic need for its introduction in the particularbusiness. All the evidence we received confirmed that workpeople wereusually reluctant to change over to double day-shift working from day workwhen the change was first suggested if they had no experience of it. Thesuggestion that the double day-shift system should be adopted more generally in industry will certainly not be popular with workpeople who have had nopast experience of it, though they will no doubt be prepared to change overto the system if they are satisfied of the need for such a change. Theevidence .we received, however, suggested that the reluctance to adopt doubleday-shift working was based on an objection to the changes it necessitatedat the outset, and that the system was not unpopular with workpeople whenthey were accustomed to working on it;. It was mentioned by certainwitnesses that workpeople on the double day-shift system were in factreluctant to change back to ordinary day work.health24. On the question whether the double day-shift system has any injuriouseffect upon the health of the workers we have considered the evidence givento the 1934 Committee and their conclusions on the subject.and have receivedadditional evidence from the Chief Inspector of Factories, a Medical Inspector,of Factories, and officers of the Industrial Health Research Board. Threefeatures of the system which it might be thought would possibly, in certaincircumstances, have an unfavourable effect on health are the early start,which might result in workers not having a substantial breakfast whenworking on the morning shift, the late finish, which might lead to a reductionof hours of sleep when working on the afternoon shift, and the change-over from one shift to another which, since it might result in a change of habitas regards sleeping and eating in particular, might have adverse effects onthe nervous and digestive systems. There is, of course, no reason why anearly start on the morning shift or a late finish on the afternoon shift should necessarily have the effects mentioned above; whether they do or not will depend on the private habits and home circumstances of the individualworkers. The effect of a change-over from one shift to another will alsovary from worker to worker.&quot; There is no positive evidence that thesefeatures of double day-shift working Have had a bad effect on the health of work people. For example, such statistical evidence as exists, though it isnot conclusive, does not show a higher rate of sickness absenteeism on the double day-shift system than on ordinary day working. In any case a gooddeal can be done to avoid the dangers by the provision of hot drinks and food at the factory in the early morning, of adequate facilities in mess-roomsand canteens for meals to be taken during the shift, arrangements for change-over of shifts so far as possible to suit particular individuals, and the provisionof transport services which will minimise the disadvantages of the earlystart from,, or late return to. home.25. To set against these features of the system, the evidence we receivedmentioned some advantages from the point of view of health. The mainbenefit is the advantage of shorter hours. In this connection it is worth noting that the comparison to some extent must not only be between about40 hours a week under the double day-shift system and the average of say,45 to -48 in ordinary day work but the latter plus a; certain amount of overtime. Secondly; the system gives greater leisure in the day time andconsequently greater opportunities for fresh air and exercise. And thirdly,the system makes possible, a,.long break- at the week-end. The effect ofthe five. day week and the long week-end on health was. mentioned by the witnesses who gave evidence, on this, aspect pf the. subject as most beneficial,53144 A 6
26. Generally, therefore, as regards the effect on health, though the factual ievidence available on. the subject is limited and for that reason not con-elusive, the facts available and the opinions of medical experts we heardsuggested that.the advantages of the system balance its disadvantages, thatit was; not less healthy than ordinary&apos; day working over hours which werecustomary before the war and probably more healthy than more extendedhours of day work.-     -    SOCIAL LIFE AND EDUCATION27. The 1935 Report mentions that the double day-shift system is some-times criticised on the grounds that home and family life is upset whendifferent members of the family work at different hours and consequentlyhave to eat and sleep at different times, but that this sort of problem is not peculiar to the system and that, generally, people had no substantial objec-tions to it on these grounds. We think, however, that these objections shouldbe given very considerable weight in any appreciation of the social conse-quences of the double day-shift system. Although the difficulties mentionedare not peculiar to the system we are examining, it is undeniable that, save in households where conditions are exceptional, double day-shift working will inevitably increase the problem of the housewife. The difficulties experiencedduring the war and during the present period with regard to shopping andthe provision of meals have no doubt tended to accentuate certain of thesedomestic difficulties. It is generally recognised that the housewife has hada particularly difficult task in war time, but even in peace time the job ofa woman whose husband and family are working at different times and there-fore require their meals at different times, is a very hard one. In additionto this it has to be remembered, in considering a scheme which may be widely applied to women, that many housewives are themselves wage-earnersand that there is a danger of strain when a woman attempts to do a full shiftin a factory and concurrently a full day&apos;s housework and shopping. Theextent to which shift working adds to the difficulties of the housewife will,of course, vary with the particular circumstances of each family, and itmust be mentioned that where the housewife herself goes out to work the double day shift system may help her to solve certain of her problems by giving her a number of daylight hours for housework and shopping.28. A fundamental difficulty in connection with double day-shift working isthat it involves1 the risk that workers are to a considerable extent cut off from normal social life and we think it of great &quot;importance that efforts should be made to alter the circumstances which give rise to this difficulty.This will involve, apart from the morning opening of cinemas, etc., whichcould probably he arranged in areas where the demand was adequate, thedevelopment of morning club and other social activities. In this connectionthere are two points to be considered. In -the immediate future considerable difficulties are likely to be experienced in getting a suitable number of qualified&apos; helpers, though these difficulties, we think, might not present greatobstacles if, as is anticipated, the development of shift working comes aboutonly gradually. The more serious difficulty is the long term objection to social activities- out of their normal time: Evidence we received showed thata club open in the morning, even when helpers are available, will not havethe same appeal as a club during its normal evening session...; 29. A similar and, we think, a. more serious difficulty is to be encountered in the field, of,education which, of course, overlaps with that of recreationalactivity. Youth centres play an important part in education, taking thktword in its widest sense/and in the training of young persons for citizenship.
It is not merely a question of organising certain activities for young persons at times when they can take part in them. The problem has to be seenagainst the Wider background of the young persons&apos; integration into the life of the community and we have no doubt that it is a serious drawback for a young person to he cut off from social life at hours when most of his con-temporaries are at liberty to join in. On the other hand, the free hoursof daylight which the double day-shift system gives may be utilised forvaluable open-air activities although the scope for such activities is inevitablylimited. As regards the effect of shift working on the facilities for further education which are provided at evening classes, an important factor for sometime to come will be the shortage of teaching staffs which will make theorganisation of classes at times specially fixed to suit shift workers almost impossible. We think it of the utmost importance that persons who wishto continue their studies should not be prevented from doing so by the factthat they are working on shifts. It may be added that the evidence given bythe Ministry of Education indicates that, although the County College scheme will in due course cover a large part of the technical or vocational trainingof young persons as well as continue their general education, many youngpersons will wish to supplement their County College work by some attendance,at evening classes. .30. The general objections to the partial segregation of young workers from,the community by putting them to work on shifts are very strong, but incertain cases a solution to some of the organisational difficulties we have mentioned may, we think, sometimes be found in local adjustments designedto meet the need of individual workers. It might often be found, for example,that workers who wanted to attend evening classes could be put on to daywork. In other cases it might be possible to arrange for them to do a fairlylong stretch on the morning shift and so leave their evenings free. Thiskind of arrangement is, however, not altogether free from objection because itresults in other workers having to do a long spell on the afternoon shift.CHANGES IN THE EXISTING LAW NECESSARY TO facilitate the WIDER ADOPTION OF DOUBLE DAY-SHIFT WORKINGFACTORIES ACT, 1937:  SECTIONS 8l, 94 AND 9531. Under the present law the broad position is that double day-shift working by women or young persons over 16 in factories is not generallypermissible, but that the employment of male young persons over 16 is allowed in certain industries either on a double day-shift between 6 a.m.and 10 p.m. or in necessarily continuous processes on a system of shiftscovering both day and night. The employment of male young persons inshifts in these industries and processes is permitted as a &quot; special exception &quot;under the Factories Act, 1937 (Section 81), that is to say the occupier hasto give not less than seven days&apos; notice to the District Inspector of Factories&apos; and post notice in his factory if he&apos;wishes to avail himself of the provision,but fie does not have to obtain permission to do so. The industries andprocesses concerned1 are the smelting of iron ore, the manufacture of wroughtiron, steel or tin-plate, certain processes in which reverberatory or regenerative&apos; furnaces are used, the galvanising of sheet metalor wire (except the picklingprocess), the manufacture of paper and the manufacture of glass.  The soecial- provisions for these industries are:in line with exceptions allowed in the Inter-national Labour Convention regarding night work for young persons.

Under the present law the broad position is that double day-shift working by women or young persons over 16 in factories is not generallypermissible, but that the employment of male young persons over 16 is allowed in certain industries either on a double day-shift between 6 a.m.and io p.m. or in necessarily continuous processes on a system of shiftscovering both day and night. The employment of male young persons inshifts in these industries and processes is permitted as a &quot; special exception &quot;under the Factories Act, 1937 (Section 81), that is to say the occupier hasto give not less than seven days&apos; notice to the District Inspector of factories and post notice in his factory if he wishes to avail himself-of the provision,but he does not have to obtain permission to do so. The industries andprocesses concerned are the smelting of iron ore, the: manufacture of Wroughtiron, steel or tin-plate, certain processes in which reverberatory or regenerativefurnaces are used, the galvanising of sheet metal or wire (except the picklingprocess), the manufacture of paper and the manufacture of glass. The special provisions for these industries are ;in line with exceptions allowed in the Inter-national Labour Convention regarding night work for young persons,
.     employment of women and young persons act, i936.       :   ,-. 32. In the main, what follows relates to the authorisation of double day-. shift working given under the Employment of Women and Young persons act, 1936, to which reference has been made in an earlier section of the report.The main features of this Act are summarised in paragraph 5 of Appendix Aand in the following paragraphs we propose to deal with the various pointscovered in the Act so far as possible in the order in which they are given inthat summary.33. T/iepower to grant duthorisaHotis.^-The first question to be consideredis whether any change is desirable in the provisions of the Act that anauthorisation is required before women or young persons can work on a double day-shift system:  This question is bound up with several of the other-points dealt with, below, and in, particular with the question of whether the ballot procedure should survive, but we have ho doubt that, in view of the- disturbance intiie ordinary life of the worker which the-shift system neces-sarily entails, some special measure of control is required where women oryoung persons are concerned.   Whatever method was devised for the cOn-,-sultation of workpeople, some.official check oh the propriety of the proceedingswould seem to us to be desirable.   Furthermore, if the. Minister is to-be in aposition to ensure that women or young persons are adequately safeguarded,it appears to us that it would be unwise to grant general, authorisations inrespect of whole industries as was suggested to us, by/the Hosiery Manufac-: turers&apos; Federation.   Such general authorisations would only be appropriateif the conditions in all-the establishments engaged in a particular industryscould be relied-upon to be the-same,&apos;but.in view of the great variety of condi---tions; wlnchis boundtp exist within any industry we think that there-should; be no departure from the principle, embodied in-the 1936. Act-that the Minister--should consider, separately -applications; in irespect: of each -individual- establish-^entwhererrit- iscproppsed ;that-r women? or young- persons should work onalthough .the exception allowed by the Convention covers a somewhat wider field than that allowed by Section 81 of the Factories Act, 1937. We havehad little evidence on shift working in the exceptional cases.dealt with in thisparagraph and we do not propose to recommend any change in the law asit affects theni. We should, however, mention at&quot; this point the evidence we have had from the Glass Manufacturers&apos; Federation regarding the special-problems which have arisen in. the glass industry, where the employment of boys under 16 on double day shifts has been authorised during the war-under emergency powers, thus reverting to a practice which had formerly.beeh legal under the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1.901.-These boys work in teams together with older workers, by whom they aretrained for adult employment in the trade. We do not think, however, that-either the exigencies of the trade or the advantages to the young persons con-^concerned of acquiring a skilled trade can outweigh the social and educational.-arguments against permitting the employment of these boys on shifts before. the age of 16.Provision is. also made in Sections 94 and 95 of the Factories Act, 1937,for variation of the general provisions of the Act as to hours of employmentin the case of women and young persons aged 16 Or over, employed in pro-cesses connected with the preserving of fish, fruit and Vegetables or in^factories where milk is treated. We have not included these special caseswithin the scope of our enquiry and do not propose to make any reeorn-mendations concerning them.
shifts. The provision that an. authorisation may, be in., respect either of awhole factory or of any department in it is clearly a reasonable one and wedo not wish to recommend any change in the law on that matter. In thegreat majority of cases brought to our notice, it appears that shifts are worked;only in part of the factory. , .34. Age Umits.-The minimum age at which shift Working is permitted;under the Employment of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936, is 16&quot; for both boys and girls. In considering whether we should recommend anychange in this minimum age, we have thought it proper to give great weight to the evidence we received from the Ministry of Education as regards theeffects.of the double day-shift system on the social life of young persons anddh the studies of those who wish to continue them in evening classes. Thisevidence is referred to in an earlier section of the Report, and is summarised inAppendix C,-and it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here. It is sufficientat this point, to say that the trend of the evidence is to show that thesocial disadvantages of the double day-shift system have particular force inthe case- of young persons. The other main source of evidence which hasinfluenced our recommendation on the matter of age limits is the TradesUnion Congress, who, while sharing the Ministry of Education^ apprehensionsas to the possible social consequences of the system, suggest that a time whenthe raising of the school leaving age is. impending is an appropriate one for effecting a change in the age above which shift working is allowed. the raising of the school leaving age first to 15 and then to 16 must, we think,result in the work which is now normally done.by boys and girls betweenthe ages of 14 and 16 being taken over by young persons between the ages of16 and 18, and we consider that a natural concomitant of such a state ofaffairs would be the the minimum age for double day-shift workingfrom 16 to 18. We wish, therefore, to recommend that the law be changedso that such shift working by young persons under 18 is prohibited. we recognise, however, that the immediate raising of the minimum age might have serious repercussions in certain industries, and that in some it might have an adverse and serious effect1 on the supply of trained workers and on recruitmentgenerally in certain areas. It is evidently desirable, in. the present junctureof our national affairs to avoid dislocation in industry so far as possible, andwe suggest, therefore, that in view in particular of the ^shortage of labour insomeareas, a special concession as regards age should be made in cases whereit could be satisfactorily demonstrated to the-Minister that if shift working/byyoung persons Under 18 were&apos; prohibited, the result would be. a serious lossof productive efficiency or undue hardship to the young persons concernedthrough loss of employment or loss of opportunity for training. The conces-sion should not be given for more than two years, by which time the main difficulties of the transitional period will probably have been overcome,1 35- Starting and finishing times.^-In considering the desirability of recom-mending any change in the starting and finishing times permitted under thepresent law, we have been impressed by the advantages of flexibility from thepoint of view of the convenience of the workers (whose preferences will vary from district to district). An overriding factor seems to us to be that withthe climatic conditions of this country the more nearly the hours of employ-ment of shift workers fall within those of persons on ordinary day work the better; Obviously the hours must extend considerably beyond the/period covered by,day work or the,point of the shift system would be lost, but wethink it desirable to avoid in particular the hardship of very early rising.- Ithas to be remembered that a 6 o&apos;clock start often means getting up at 5 a ,m.or evcn.4.30 a.m.i a. hurried breakfast or no breakfast at all and often lack
of sleep, because the worker will not always want to. go to bed early in the;week when he is on the morning shift which is also the only time when he.can engage in ordinary evening activities. Although the prolongation of thesecond shift beyond the normal hours of day work is open to the objectionswe have-discussed elsewhere, we do not think that the late finish is generally felt to be such a hardship as the early start. Wc therefore think that as a normal arrangement the hours of double day-shift working should fall betweenthe hours of 7 a.m. and n p.m. and that any new legislation should providefor the substitution of these hours for the present hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.We recommend, however, in the interests of flexibility that there should bediscretionary power to authorise a start at any time between 6.0 a.m. and7 a.m. provided, of course, that the double working period covered is nevermore than .16 hours.36. International Labour ConvenMom and night work. The law regardingthe starting and finishing times for workers on double day-shifts is bound up with the provisions of international conventions on night work for women and young persons. A 1920 Convention defined &quot; night &quot; as &quot;a periodof at least eleven consecutive hours including the interval between 10 o&apos;clockin the evening and 5 o&apos;clock in the morning &quot; and laid it down that women and young persons under 18 must not in general be employed during the nightbut that, young persons of 16 and over could be so employed in certain con-tiniious processes. The Night Work (Women) Convention (Revised) of 1934provided that the period 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. might be substituted for 10 p.m.to 5 a.m.&apos; as the barred period when there were exceptional circumstances affecting the workers employed in a particular industry or area and thecompetent authority, after consultation with the employers&apos; and workers&apos;Organisations concerned, decided that in the case of women employed in that industry or area the substitution of 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. might be allowed. Werealise that the terms of the Convention may not be wide enough to allow the full implementation of the recommendation we made in paragraph 35.37. Hours of work.- Closely connected with the question of the starting andfinishing times to be permitted are the questions of Saturday morning working and of hours of work in general. The 1936 Act provides for a normal week,including intervals for meals and rest in the course of a turn, of 40 hours on one shift and 48 hours on the other, making an average of 44 hours out ofwhich 41J hours are normally actual working time. The second shift normallydoes 5 turns a week (there being no Saturday work after 2 p.m.) and the firstshift 6 turns. It is to be noted that under this arrangement shift workers havenormally worked less hours than day workers. We suggest that the time has now come to abolish Saturday morning as part of the normal working week for double day-shift workers so as to give the workers on. both shifts theadvantage of the.long weekend, and to do this without maintaining the pro-&apos; visions which the 1936 Act made for longer&apos;, daily working hours in&apos; the case ofpersons employed on a five-day week. This will give a normal week on bothshifts of 40 hours (of 37\ hours after deduction of meal breaks). These should we think be; the normal double day-shift hours, but from time to time it maybe desirable, owing to special circumstances arising as a result of exceptionalpressure, to&apos;exceed them. When this is done the hours in excess of the normal&quot;should be treated as overtime; and in order to safeguard the benefits whichwe bejieve /wiljvaccrue&apos;-&apos;W^e&quot;-;^rork^:;fromKtKe!: shorter week, the overtimeshould be subject to restriction&apos; in somewhat the same -way as the overtime-of women ahd youngpersons-&quot;on day work is restricted ;by Section -73 of the factories Act,-1937; We think that the overtime&quot;for double^day-shift-workersshbuld be in the form of a single shift The -weekly
limit of such overtime hours will obviously be eight hours, and we should like to suggest an annual maximum for each shift of 100 hours. This will mean that neither shift can work more than 12 full Saturday morning shiftseach year out of a possible 26. We think that this provision will&apos; give thescheme the flexibility which is desirable if it is to be more widely adopted in industry, while the general reduction of hours we propose will, we think, beamply justified by the benefits accruing to the health and welfare of the worker and will consequently tend to increase the popularity of the system.In concluding our remarks on this subject we should like to add that weare aware that&apos; our recommendations leave an unduly large gap between thepresent hours of day workers and the hours of workers on the double day-shift.We do not, of course, subscribe to the view that the gap between 48 hours and 37  hours is one that should necessarily be maintained if the normal hoursof day work are reduced.38. Steps to inform workpeople of reasons for double day-shift working___Article 1 of The Shift System in Factories and Workshops (Consultation of work people) Order, 1936, which is the Order made in pursuance of section (2) of the 1936 Act to regulate the ballot procedure provides that the occupier when proposing. to institute a double day-shift system shall take steps fully to inform in a suitable manner all workpeople concerned as tothe reasons for instituting the system.   We think it of the utmost importance that a reasonably full and easily intelligible account of the reasons which make the institution of a double day-shift system desirable should be givento the workpeople concerned and we think that it will generally be foundto be in the best interests of production that this should be done.  It does not,however, appear to us practicable to amend the law in this respect so as to lay down precisely what information should be put before workpeople who areto vote by ballot for or against the introduction of a double day-shift system.The suggestion was made by the Trades Union Congress that accredited repre-sentatives of the workpeople should be informed of &quot; all the facts in the case,including full statements of the reductions in costs, increases in total turnover,etc., which it is estimated will result from the introduction of double shift&apos;working &quot;, and that where no benefit could be shown to result from the intro-duction of double day-shift Working in the way of reduction of costs thereshould be provision for reference to some special organisation or to theGovernment Department responsible for the industry to determine whether any alternative method of meeting the load could be found.  Such a procedure would be very cumbersome and would be open to the same objection as anattempt to make the granting of an authorisation dependent on the result of negotiations between employers and workpeople&quot;s organisations instead of onthe result of a ballot; there would, that is to say, be1 difficulties in determiningwho were the accredited representatives of the workpeople in a particular case(see paragraph 39 below).39. The ballot. There has been a wide measure of agreement amongwitnesses whom.we have questioned on the subject that the ballot, which isthe method laid down in the Employment of Women and Young Persons Act,1936, for ascertaining the views of workpeople as a preliminary to the granting of an authorisation, is an unsatisfactory proceeding. We have, therefore,devoted a great deal of attention to an attempt to find an alternative methodof consultation, but without success. The ballot is Unsatisfactory for several reasons. Employers do not.like it because its results are uncertain and it involves the submission of a question which may arise out of complicatedproblems of costing and planning to the decision of workpeople who maymake up only part of the labour force who will be employed if shift working
is-adopted. - They feel too that the- chances -in the ballot may be weightedunfairly against a favourable decision because workers tend to be suspicious ofinnovation, and therefore reluctant to change from single shift to double shift working if they are not accustomed to the.latter, although later, when theyhave actually gained experience of double shift working, they may find thatthey prefer it. From the workers&apos; point of view the ballot can be no morethan a second best, because it- is outside the joint voluntary machinery through which--employers and workpeople have for many years settled questions affecting terms of employment.. We have examined very carefully the possi-biiity of devising some arrangements which would fall within the normalscheme of negotiation and we had in mind that it might be possible to: make provision for a double day-shift authorisation to be granted if the employer andthe trade union representatives had reached agreement on the subject. Sucha provision might, we thought, be supplemented by one providing that, inthe event of disagreement, the matter should go before some arbitratingauthority. We have, however/reached the conclusion -that there are insuperable-able difficulties about such a proposal. One of the difficulties is that a verylarge number of women and young persons are not organised in unions. but even as regards those who are so organised the position is by no means simple:We accept the view of the Trades Union Congress that; if the matter were left to negotiation, it would sometimes be difficult to determine which wasthe appropriate trade union: to represent the workpeople in a particular case,In such a case the decision as to the organisation which had the legal rightto come to an agreement with the employer on behalf of the workpeopleconcerned, would rest inevitably with some person or authority other than the workpeople or the trades unions themselves. We think that this would introduce an innovation info industrial practice which is not desirable andwe.:recommend, therefore, that the ballot procedure provided by the Act of1936 should be retained.46. New -factones.-Where a factory is about to be or has recently beennewly established and it is intended to adopt double day-shift working as apermanent measure, no ballot is required under the 1936 Act. The point of thisarrangement is presumably that where no workers are yet employed there isno possibility of the people who are to work the shifts being consulted and thatworkers rwho join the&quot; factory will know under what conditions they are engaged, . The, arrangement incidentally has the advantage that it enables an employer, if he has [the Ministers authorisation, to go ahead with plans forplant and machinery: for; a new factory in the knowledge that, provided hecan;get the workers&quot;, he will riot be legally prohibited from starting a doubleday-shift, system, r We have had no evidence that  this provision in the 1936Act has given rise to any abuse and we do not wish to see the law on thismatter modified.41. Voting The 1936 Act lays it down that, subject to&apos; the rule about new factories (y. para. 40 above), &apos;fao application for authorisation to work on a double day-shift system shall be granted unless the Minister is satisfied that the&quot;majority of the workpeople concerned consent &quot; to the granting of. theapplication, and with this principle, we should, of course, not wish to quarrel.The only suggestion for amendment of the law which we have to make in thisconnection is that any future legislation should provide that, in cases wherea. ballot is required, instead of a favourable majority of the workpeople con-ccrned, a favourable majority of those actually voting should be required;before an application is granted. This recommendation merely. amounts tobringihg me arrangements into line with the normal democratic method of voting as practised in this country. &apos; &quot;
: 42- Conditions.-The Minister is required in granting any application for an. authorisatioh under the 1936 Act to impose such conditions as he considers necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the welfare and interests of thepersons employed, and in particular he is required to consider the expediency of requiring the-provision of suitable accommodation for clothing, of facilitiesfor meals, transport facilities for workers residing at a distance and, in the caseof young persons, of reasonable facilities for attending at continuation schools.We do not think that any modification of the law on these points is required,but we would observe that shift working schemes have&quot; sometimes broken: down on the question of transport facilities and we would stress the importanceof securing the co-operation of the appropriate transport authorities when thereis a questiomof introducing;the double day-shift system. We appreciate, how--ever, that &quot;there would be legal arid administrative difficulties in any provisionfor putting &quot;pressure; on: transport authorities tb establish or to maintain anyparticular faculties, and we think that the matter is one that must be left to negotiation in the circumstances of each case. The importance of properfacilities for meals is self-evident arid there is no doubt that the health of shiftworkers may be adversely and seriously affected by the lack of proper facilitiesbecause their domestic circumstances iriay&quot; sometimes make it more difficult forthem to obtain proper meals at home than is the case with day workers.&apos; 43i Temporary&apos;-authorisations.-Under the 1936 Act, where an authorisationis required &quot; only for the purpose of-making provision for a temporary emer-gency or for temporary pressure of work not being of a seasonal and recurringcharacter &quot; temporary authorisations are to be granted. ,We have no doubtthat the law should make some provision of this kind for emergencies and for temporary pressure of work.   We recognize, however, that there is a. risk. that some employers may take exceptional orders beyond their normal capa-city and attempt to introduce shift.working as an alternative to overtime. Thesuggestion was made by the Trades Union Congress that there should be provision, where an application: for an authorisation is made for temporary&apos; purposes, for reference to some outside body on the lines of that referred to inparagraphs 38 and 39 above, but for the reasons given in those paragraphs wedo not think such an arrangement would be practicable. . We would point outalso that where a temporary authorisation, is required, speed is of the utmost importance and any further complication of the machinery which may lead to delay is to be discouraged. ,    .44. Revocation.-We have considered; the circumstances under which an-authorisation granted by the Minister should cease to have force. The Employ-merit bfWbmen arid Young Persons Act, 1936, provides that if the authorisationis not used for certain periods it may be revoked or is automatically revoked,and there: is a further provision enabling the Minister to. revoke an authorisationif the conditions imposed in it have not been observed or if &quot; abuses of any description have arisen out of the employment of any persons on the systemof shifts..&apos;&quot;&apos; Clearly some safeguard of this kind is necessary, and we think the provisions of the present law adequate in this respect. We have considered a suggestion made to us by the Trades Union Congress that the Minister shouldbe given power in certain circumstances to direct that a new ballot should beheld to determine whether shift working should continue, but we think thatfor economic reasons any. arrangement 6ri..fhe lines of this, proposal would beunwprkable because it would afford no protection to&apos; an employer who, having-taken a-ballot arid Obtained a-favourable r^Mf^-rh^d^stalled new machinerywhicfi&quot;:GQuld&apos;6hly be&apos;paid&apos;fbr-if Wdouble &quot;day-shift system were worked!545. Delegation of Ministers powers to 7*w ecfow.-The 1936 Act&apos;&apos;gave vie.&quot;Secretary&apos; of State power to direct that&apos;tlie-duty:&apos;6f&apos; dealing-with applicationsfor shift working required only for temporary purposes may &quot;be performed by
the Chief Inspector of Factories or by any Superintending Inspector of Fac-tories, but we understand that no use has been made of this provision^ We! think, however, that this power of delegation may; sometimes be found usefuland we recommend that it should toe continued, although we have had no evidence of any undue delay being caused by reference of applications to the headquarters of the Ministry,SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.46. (1) We do not recommend any change in the law permitting doubleday-shifts to be worked by male young persons in the industries to which section 81 of the Factories Act, 1937, applies,: and we express no opinion asto shift arrangements for industries. dealing&apos; with certain perishable com-modities. (Paragraph 31.) The following recommendations relate to othermanufacturing industries:  .(2) Authorisation in respect of individual factories or departments shouldcontinue to be required before women and young persons are permitted to works double day-shift system.   (Paragraph 33.)(3) Double day-shift working by young, persons under 18 should in generalbe prohibited, but latitude in the matter should be allowed during a period not exceeding two years.   (Paragraph 34.)(4) As a normal arrangement the hours of double day-shift working should fall between the hours of 7 a.im and 11 p.m.   (Paragraph 35.)(5) Where a double day-shift system is worked there should normally beno Saturday work, but provision should be made for a limited amount of overtime on Saturday mornings.   (Paragraph 37.)(6) In all cases in which it is proposed to work a double day-shift system the workers concerned should be given a reasonably full account of the reasonsfor the institution of the system.   (Paragraph 38.)(7) The ballot should be retained as a means of consulting workpeople con-cerned in cases where it is proposed to introduce double day-shift working by women and young persons but should, as at present, not be required in thecase of a new factory.  (Paragraphs 39, 40.)(8) A favourable majority of the workpeople actually voting should berequired before an application for an authorisation for double day-shift workingby women and young persons is granted.   (Paragraph 41.)(9) Special attention should be paid to welfare and transport arrangementsfor shift workers,  (Paragraph 42.)(10) There should be no change in the present law regarding temporaryauthorisation or regarding the circumstances under which an authorisationfor double day-shift wOrk should cease to have force.  (Paragraphs 43, 44.)(11) The Minister should as at present be empowered to delegate the powerof granting authorisations.  (Paragraph 45.)(12) The Minister should consider the advisability of referring, in suitable cases, matters that may arise from time to time in the working of the doubleday-shift system to the Joint Consultative Committee or other appropriatestanding body for advice.    ;\ i        -i.-/Subject to the reservations noted below with regard to the ballot andto hours of work, these recommendations are unanimous;
17147- The facts adduced in the evidence presented to us and referred-to in. the earlier part of our Report prove, we think, that the wider use of the doubleday-shift system in industry is undoubtedly capable of making an important contribution to the economic wellbeing of the country. But the evidence hasalso convinced us that the system must necessarily involve some measure ofsegregation and dislocation of family life, and other social and educationaldisadvantages for the workers. We have sought throughout, in making our. recommendations, to give due weight to each of these aspects of the system.Finally, we would add that we think that the wider adoption of the: system which is desirable on economic grounds will depend on the one hand on the willingness of individual employers to examine closely the economies and other advantages which the system might secure in particular cases, and on the otherhand, on the workers being convinced that its social inconveniences to them-selves can and will be offset as far as possible by compensating benefits. - Atleast as much will depend on these factors as upon changes in the existing law.We desire to express our appreciation of the unstinted help we havereceived throughout our enquiry from Mr. D. C, Barnes and Mr. C. H. Sisson,who have successively served as secretaries of the Committee.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)   J. L. Brieely (Chairman).Dorothy M.

RESERVATION BY MESSRS. JOHNSON; PHEAZEY AND PILCHERON THE SUBJECT OF THE BALLOT (PARA. 39).1. In view of the weight of evidence which the Conunittee has collected, tothe effect that the operation of the ballot as a preliminary to the granting of an&quot;authorisation is an unsatisfactory proceeding, our belief is that the retentionof this unsatisfactory feature will retard the wider adoption of double day-shift working, and in the knowledge that no other country has found it necessaryto employ the ballot procedure or to treat the change to double day-shift-working any differently from other changes in working conditions, we recom-. mend that the ballot procedure by the Act of 1936 be rescinded.2. Whilst maintaining the view that a ballot is unsatisfactory and undesir-able, it is appreciated that some alternative may be considered necessary.Should such be the case, we take the following view.A changeover from single day-shift to double day-shift, or vice versa, is essentially a change in working conditions in a particular establishment. Assuch the proposed change can best be dealt with by the well-recognised practiceof prior consultation at the works between the management and the, representa-ctives ofthe workpeople directly concerned.&quot;Normally the matter should be, settled amicably at this stage, but should accommodation not be reached, theissue should then be resolved through the normal negotiating machinery in theindustry concerned.Alternatively, the Ministry: of Labour should consult the appropriate Govem-ment department chiefly concerned from the production aspect in order thatit might get a recommendation as tb whether a double day-shift is necessaryto meet the, production requirements involved.3. The following statements have a bearing on this recommendation.4. The double day-shift system has not been widely employed in the past and we believe that this has been due, in the main, to the fact that industrialmanagement would not.include it in its planning for the more efficient or expedient use of production facilities because the outcome of the ballot couldnot be forecast and because, in the event of an unfavourable ballot, the useof double day-shift for the whole or part of the unit concerned would be prohibited.5. We feel that the effect of the retention of the ballot Would be that the useof double day-shift in the future would be at best no greater than it has been. in the past and that in many cases where the employment of double day-shiftwas essential in&quot;the national interest, it would not be used.6. In areas of unemployment a number of factories will be favourablycircumstanced and when free to do so, will be able to employ double thenumber of people (on double shift), half of whom would otherwise beunemployed.7. When full employment obtains, no real hardship will result from volun-tary re-allocation of labour in any industrial community such that workpeoplewilling or preferring to work double day-shift are accommodated. Hills andvalleys in the work loads on individual factories in a diversified industrial area normally will not coincide and the use of double day-shift will reducethe amount of temporary local unemployment.8. The retention and expansion of export business, more especially in com-petitive markets, is often dependent on the ability of the manufacturer tosupply goods in time and in quantity to meet limited climatic, operating orinstallation opportunities of the customer. This forces the supplier to quotea firm and reliable delivery, sometimes months ahead, and often double
27172day-shift working is the only means by which the quantity of goods requiredcan be produced in the-time available. In present circdmstances many such orders are lost because the factory managements are unable to forecast theresult of the ballot and are alive to the fact that; an unfavourable bailqtprohibits the use of double dayrshlft.in the whole or even part of the manu^factoring unit ;concerned (e.g.-;in a shop of 100 people where the ballotindicates that 50 per cent, are able and willing to work double day-shift and50 per cent, are not, it is not permissible to work half the shop on doubleday-shift and so increase the working from the 100-to..150 people). In a largenumber of cases of markets of opportunity partial double day-shift workingwould meet requirements.. 9. Bearing in mind the vastly improved relations between management andworkpeople to-day, the care taken of the interest of shop operatives by theMinistry of Labour, by the Trades Unions and by Employers, we considerthe ballot as protective machinery to be redundant.16. Iii submitting this recommendation we emphasise that wheieas at thetime !p&apos;f drafting the recommendation world shortage conditions are soabnormal that almost any product at any price and any delivery can be soldoverseas, it remains a fact that when world shortages have been made good,this country will be entirely dependent on successful operation in a fiercelycompetitive international market under serious handicaps. -We &quot;considerdouble day-shift working to be one vital positive offset to these handicaps andconsequently to be of far greater importance now and in the future than atany time in the past. We believe that the employment of double day-shift working in cases of real necessity involves no hardship to any section of thecommunity and that relatively minor inconveniences should not be permitted to negative or discourage the, essential use of this national asset.11. The recommendation in no way implies that workpeople should bodirected to or in any way-compelled to work in establishments covered bydouble day-shift orders. ^ It assumes that workpeople would be free to engageor not in double day-shift working in such establishments and that the factorymanagements would have the onus of attracting workpeople to work the double day-shift System. It thus leaves the way open for departments orfactories ur be operated on the double day-shift system in part and provides forthe smooth transition over a period of adjustment from day-shift to doubleday-shift working.12. As was concluded by the investigators of the Industrial Health ResearchBoard (Committee Paper No. 6) it appears to be true that the most potentfactor in producing a preference for day or shift work is habit.   The figures given by these investigators are of the utmost importance and are as follows:- &quot; In a factory where the. majority of the workers had been on shift workfor six months or less, 90 per cent, of those questioned preferred day work.At a factory where the majority of the workers questioned had been ohshift work for some time, three-quarters of the workers preferred shift work.At another factory where the system had been in operation for some years90 per cent, of the workers preferred shift work, though it is noted that atthis factory&apos; the shifts were differently arranged.   It was concluded that-   the most potent factor in producing a preference for day or shift work washabit.(Signed) H. L. Johnson...      .   J. R. Pheazey.W. H. Pilcher.
RESERVATION BY MESSRS. JOHNSON, PHEAZEY AND PILGHER  /.      ON THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF WORK.   (PARA. 37.)Government and other spokesmen have, on a number of occasions, emphasised-sised the need for maximum production per man week; The dominatingfactor in obtaining more production per man week is the installation of laboursaving machinery. The lower the number of hours machinery runs per week,the greater the amount of new plant required and the greater the cost and the longer reconstruction will take. New plant in most cases requires widerspacing of machinery and new or altered buildings and the shorter the hoursmachinery runs the more building required. In many cases, the installation ofsuch machinery is very costly, and if it is to pay for itself, and if the maximum amount of goods is to be produced from the minimum amount of capital equipment, it is essential that the machinery should run as long as possibleper week. The hours of work proposed by the Committee are, in my view,such that essential new machinery would in many industries never pay for itself. The adoption of such short working hours would in fact be a deterrent to enterprising employers who wished to re-equip their factories and theintroduction of such hours would have unfortunate repercussions for employersalready committed to double day-shift working.The reduction of hours proposed in paragraph 37 of the Report will, inmy view, in large measure counteract the economic advantages of the.doubleday-shift system which are described in: paragraphs 7-19, and so lessen the contribution which the system could make to our economic recovery. I am satisfied that the economic disadvantages which must follow the reduction of hours proposed by the Committee would be serious and would have far-reaching effects.  The disadvantages I have in mind are in particular 1. The decrease in production per man week.2. The increased &quot;wage cost per hour.3. The inability to compete with goods produced in foreign countriesworking longer hours and at lower rates of pay.4. The tendency to.curtail re-equipment.It is in view of these considerations, and of the paucity of the evidencetaken on the subject, particularly from the employers&apos; side, that I feel obligedto dissent from the recommendation of the Committee on the matter of hoursof work.While I agree with the Committee that it is necessary to offer workersextra inducements to work on double day-shifts, and that it is fair to do so to compensate them for the inconveniences which the system entails, I do notthink it is necessary or desirable to go as far in this direction as the Committeeproposes. &apos;The Report recommends that under certain circumstances and to a limited extent work should be permitted on Saturday1 mornings. In recent months,there.has been a movement in industry, towards the introduction of a 45 hoursweek, .9 hours per day for 5 days with no work on Saturdays. For this reason,I.believe that difficulty will be experienced with regard to Saturday morningworking in cases where the remainder of the establishment or neighbouringfactories are working this five day week. I therefore recommend that workoh&apos; double day-shifts should be permitted between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to getover this difficulty,. ; (Signed)  H, L. Johnson.&quot; , J. R. Pheazey. -W. H.

APPENDIX AThe Present Law as it affects Double Day-Shift Working in Factoriesi. The Factories Act of 1937, as supplemented or modified by Regulations of orders made thereunder, imposes elaborate legal restrictions on the hours of employment ofwomen and young persons (youths and girls under 18) in factories. It does not,save in some very exceptional circumstances by health or safety regulations for particular processes or work, regulate or restrict the hours of males over 18, though no doubt the restrictions on the hours of women and young persons may often restrictmen&apos;s hours indirectly in practice. Under the Act a scheme of the times for workwhich are to be those normally permissible (apart fro:a &quot; overtime &quot;) for women and young persons in the particular factory has to be fixed by the factory occupierby a notice posted in the factory and specifying, for each day of the week, theearliest and latest times for beginning and ending and the statutory intervals formeals and rest. The scheme so fixed must comply with a number of general conditions set out in the Act though in certain circumstances these general conditions may be modified in various ways, such modifications being known as &apos;&apos; special exceptions&apos;&apos;.The general conditions relate among other things to the maximum number of working hours (exclusive of statutory intervals for meals and rest) in a day and in a week(9 and 48 respectively, 44 for those under 16); the period of employment (i.e. the overall period, including intervals, within which employment is permissible on anyday) (maximum i-i hours) and the maximum length of spells of work (4^ hours or,where there is a rest pause of. at least .10 minutes, 5 hours). In relation, to doubleday-shift working two of these general conditions are of particular importance:  (a) the period of employment must not begin before 7 a.m. or end after 8 p.m.(6 p.m. for young persons under 16);(6) the period of employment and the statutory intervals must be the same forall the women and young persons employed in the factory, except that the periodof employment may end at an earlier hour for young persons under 16.2. The &apos;&apos; overtime &apos;&apos; provisions of the Act authorise ,the employment without specialpermission of women and young persons over 16 for time outside the period ofemployment normally fixed for the particular day.under the scheme mentioned inparagraph 1 above. The provisions in respect of overtime employment are elaborate,with over-riding limitations on the amounts of overtime which may be worked in acalendar year and in a week and on the number of weeks in the year in which itmay be worked, but the main point ^is that except in factories where an earlier startis permitted by Regulations or Orders as a special exception overtime must not be worked before 7 a.in. or after 9 p.m. (&amp; p.m. for young persons over 16) or afterI p.m. on Saturday.3-. The provisions of. the Factories Act thus indirectly prevent or restrict the night employment of women and young persons. There is incidentally or in addition&apos;an obligation to comply with the provisions of the Employment of Women, YoungPersons and Children Act, 1920, and the Hours of Employment (Conventions) Act,1936, which deal directly with, night work. These provisions prohibit the emplby-ment of women and young persons at night (defined as &quot;a period of at least 11consecutive hours including the interval between 10 o&apos;clock in the evening and5 o&apos;,clock in the morning &quot;) in industrial undertakings.4. The provisions just referred to were enacted to carry out certain InternationalLabour Conventions on the subject of night work, those in the Act of 1936 supersedingthose in the Act of 1920 in so far as women are concerned and being the result ofrevision by the International Labour Organisation of the earlier Convention relatingto the night work of women. Certain exceptions are provided for in the Conventions.In the case of young persons there is an exception for young persons over 16 incertain-industries, e.g. irony and steel hv which work goes on continuously, and for-cases;&apos;i of emergencies/As regards women, . there are in the. Convention exceptions(i) for special emergencies, (ii) for dealing with perishable raw materials, and (iii) toallow the night period to be reduced to 10 hours on 60 days of the year in undef-takings influenced by the seasons and in all cases where exceptional circumstancesdemand it. Further, (iv) when the Night Work (Women) Convention was revised in 1934 an additional provision was inserted in the Convention to enable the periodII p.m. to 6 a.m. to be substituted for 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. as the barred period-wherethere are exceptional circumstances affecting the workers employed in a particular
industry or area and the competent authority, : after consultation with the employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations concerned, decide that in the case of women employed inthat industry&quot; or area the substitution of. u p.m. to 6 a.m. may be allowed. This,provision was inserted in the Convention in view in particular of the practice iri sometextile factories -abroad of working double day-shift systems between 6 a.m. andif p.m. &apos; The Hours of Employment (Convention) Act, 1936, did not provide forthis substitution permitted by the-Convention, as it was not at that time thought tobe.necessary to&apos;do so, so far as this country was concerned.: 5.. The. general provisions of the Factories Act of 1937 as to. the hours of employ-inent. of women and young persons in factories are framed to suit ordinary day workand not their employment on the double day-shift system. Special provision has,however, been made to permit of such employment in any factory by Section 2 ofthe Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1,920, and. subsequentlyby. the Employment of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936. The main features of the Employment of Women and Young Persons Act, 1936, are as follows:-&apos;-&apos;;V (a) The Secretary of State (whose functions under the Act are now exercised&apos; by the Minister of Labour and National Service) may, upon the application of the occupier of a factory, authorise the employment in the factory, or in any depart-ment of it, of women and young persons aged 16 or.over on a system of shiftsbetween the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on week days (2 1p.n1. on Saturdays)the hours for each shift not exceeding an average of 8 hours per day (if a five-day week is worked the hours may exceed an average of 8 hours per day but may nbtexceed 10 in any day, 48 in any week or 88 in any two consecutive weeks). Thesehours have been taken to mean hours inclusive of meal or rest intervals in the courseof aturn.  ,&apos;.,&apos;. -&apos;,--.. &apos;      .;... , . 1 ......-(b) The Secretary of State was required to make a &quot; Special Order &quot; under theFactory and. Workshop Act of 1901 (under the 1937 Act it would be &quot; Regulations &quot;)making.provision as to the,manner in which workpeople concerned are to be consulted and for the ascertainment of their opinions by secret ballot before any application is granted under the section. - Generally speaking no such application - can be. granted unless, the Secretary of State (Minister) is satisfied that the requirementsof the Order have been, complied with and that the majority of;the workpeople&apos; concerned consent to the granting of the application; but if he is satisfied that theapplication relates to a factory which is about to be, or has recently been newlyestablished and that the system of shifts is intended to be permanently adoptedtherein for women and young persons over 16 the application may be granted with-: out., such consultation, ballot of consent.   &apos;(c) In granting any application under the Section the Minister is required&apos; toimpose such conditions as he. considers necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the welfare and interests of the shift workers. (The conditions imposed in practicehave varied with the circumstances of the case.)(d) Provision is made for the granting and extension of temporary authorisationswhere the shift employment is required only for the purpose of a temporary emer-,gency or temporary pressure of work not being of a seasonal and recurring character;and for the&apos; revocation of any authorisation if it. is&apos;, not used in a. period of. 12 months(if not used in a, period of 2 years it is revoked automatically). Moreover anauthorisation may be revoked if it appears to the. Minister that any conditions imposed upon the granting of it have not been complied with or that abuses ofany description have arisen out of the employment of any persons on the shift... system,        . ...(0) The Minister can -give directions- empowering the Chief or a SuperintendingInspector of Factories to deal with applications for temporary purposes of the kindmentioned in (d) above, but not to grant or extend a temporary authorisation sothat it will last for more than 6 months.   (No such directions have.been given.)The broad position, therefore/is that double day-shift, working by women or youngpersons over 16 in factories is authorised from JLondon in each case under a special procedure.&apos;

WRITTEN AND ORAL EVIDENCE(1)   Official WitnessesFACTORY DEPARTMENT, MINISTRY OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE(Sir Wilfrid Garrett, then H.M. Chief Inspector of Factories, attended before theCommittee on 30th May, 1945OThe Chief Inspector said that after- the last war there was an outcry about theneed for double day-shift working but when the 1920 Act was passed shift workingdid not prove popular and was never used consistently in industry except perhaps in artificial silk and rubber. Its chief use in the past had   been to give flexibility. of output to seasonal trades and in the textile industry to meet fashion changes. Nowit had added importance in view of the limits the 1937 Act had set on the number of hours an employer could work his machinery with protected persons, and in viewof the increased mechanisation of industry that had been and was still taking place.After the last war part of the demand for double day-shift working was on&quot; the grounds of lack of machinery, and -although Sir Wilfrid did not think that there was in 1945a similar- shortage it was certainly true that a great deal of adaptation and renewal of- plant would be required to meet peace-time production needs.Sir Wilfrid gave two reasons for the early unpopularity of the system, which hethought had not been brought out in previous reports. On the managerial side therewas in the early days a dislike of shift work as it meant very long hours being workedby the supervisory staff. This, however, did not hold good to-day, when it wasappreciated that - shift&apos; work necessitated doubling the number, of supervisory staff.On the workers&apos; side, and particularly in the textile trade where a large number of married women were employed, the system was disliked because it made the women&apos;shome duties difficult. It had to be pointed out, however, that it was largely aquestion of habit and once the workers got accustomed to shift work they generallyliked it. provided that wages were adequately maintained.War-time experience of shift working had brought out few new features, althoughit had emphasised the value of the opportunity which shift working provided forshopping during the free morning or afternoon and the importance of adequate trans-port facilities. One new feature arising out of the increased shift work was the growing popularity of the 5,-day working week. In this connection Sir Wilfrid pointedout that while 5-day working was probably socially &quot;desirable, it might be difficulteconomically in that under such a system, with the present legal limitations, the fullweekly hours allowed could only be worked where overlapping shifts could be operated.It might be that to offset this limitation employers would recommend that the.normal working day be increased from an 8-hour to an 8J-hour shift and that an 11 p.rn.: finishbe allowed. On the grounds that in the early days of shift working a finish after10 p.m. was considered undesirable for young persons, a. solution might lie in allow-ing women over i&amp; only to be employed until 11 p.m. He did not think that toallow the concession for women only would rule out the employment of young personsaltogether. It was unusual for a whole factory to operate on a shift system and generally speaking it should be possible for the young persons to get adequate training,etc., in a part of the factory working normal day work hours. The present io p.m.finish was, of course, based on the International Labour Convention on Night Work,which prohibited employment between 10 tp.rn. and 5 a.m. These hours were probablychosen on the grounds that an early start was better than a late finish, but.it seemed unlikely that many people would share this view to-day, . -.During the war the ballot method of ascertaining the workers&apos; views had had tobe given up in the interests of speed, bit contact was maintained with the tradeunions both at District and, where necessary, at Headquarters level.   On the question
of the. frequency of change-over of shifts,. Sir Wilfrid said: that a long stretch on one-shift such as was common in. the nursing profession had never been considered in-industry. It was hard to say how. frequent a. change-over was desirable from thepoint of view of the workers&apos; health. Both weekly and fortnightly changes werecommon in industry. With regard to the practice whereby new factories were notobliged to have a ballot, it had always worked out satisfactorily in the past as it was clear to the person being engaged that she was going to work the double day-shift system.        . - .i Sir Wilfrid made several recommendations which he thought required special con-sideration in factories where shift work was in operation. In the first place headvocated greater use of canteens or facilities whereby the workers could obtain tea.&apos;and snacks. So many workers came in on the morning shift at 6 a.m. having hadno breakfast and from the health point of view the provision of a canteen was clearly-desirable. Secondly, where the factory was operating for 16 hours a day it&apos; wasnecessary for special care to be taken to ensure, that ventilation was adequate. Again,where long hours of production were involved; special steps should be taken regardingthe cleaning of work rooms. It naturally followed that where the machines were inoperation for 16 hours continuously more dirt would accumulate than,in a Depart-ment working only 8 hours a day. He advocated increased use of the vacuum cleaner&apos;so that cleaning. could be carried on during the day.The last.point stressed was adequate transport.   There were examples in industry,&apos;&apos;to-day where the firm arranged special transport themselves for shift, workers, andit should be possible for this to be done on a much larger scale.(Miss F. I. Taylor, C.B.E., Senior Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories, attendedbefore the Committee on rath May, 1946.) .&apos;-&apos;. -&apos;-The members of the Committee put questions to Miss Taylor about the possible repercussions in industry if shift working for young persons was abolished.      - ; --Miss Taylor expressed the view that the extent of the repercussions would depend largely on the extent to which double day-shift working was adopted in the nearfuture. At present few factories, if any, worked wholly on a system of double day-shifts and the number of factories working on double day-shifts at all was not large.If this position did not change substantially in the near future there was no reasonto suppose that there would be any difficulty&apos; in absorbing young persons on day work.if their employment on shifts were prohibited. The absorption&apos; of this&apos; labour in &apos;industry was not, however, the only point to be considered. . In general it was advan-tageous to an industry to recruit young persons as soon as possible after they leftschool, because otherwise the industry might lose capable recruits. If shift working for young persons was abolished industries where shift working was the general rule&apos;might obviously fail to get recruits before the age of 18, by which time many of thebrighter and more capable workers would have begun their careers in other industries.-It was also pointed out that as in general double shifts would be vorked in industries which had relatively expensive and consequently often relatively complicated machinery,it might be particularly advantageous in. those industries for young persons to havea period of training before the age of 18.The Committee then turned its attention to the provisions of Section 81 of the factories Act, 1937, and enquired what would be the repercussions on the industriescovered by Section 81 of the prohibition of double shift&apos; working by.young persons.Miss Taylor said.that industries and processes covered by Section 81,. which were thesmelting of iron ore,. steel or tin-plate, certain processes in which reyerberatofy ofregenerative furnaces were used,, galvanising of sheet metal of.&apos;wife &quot;(except by thepickling process) the manufacture of paper and the manufacture of glass, were in avery special position. . Shift working in these industries and processes was a very long-standing arrangement and it was an arrangement which had been dealt &quot;with in aninternational convention. Any question of revising the&apos; law&apos;.Iwith regard to-Section :8iwould therefore.Taise the question of foreign competition in ,the industries, concerned:It would, be difficult to disturb the arrangements, under Sub-Section. 5. of Section&apos; 81under which young persons could be employed, in. double day-shifts on non-continuousprocesses in the&apos; industries concerned without affecting the. provisions of sub-section 1,which.dealt with : three-shift working. ..Miss Taylor pointed&apos; out-that the number of boys involved in the Section 81 industries was not large and that they, were mainly confined, to a few, special areas. There was nothing in the law to prevent day workand double day-shifts being carried on simultaneously in the same department, andfurthef she. did not think that there -would, be any unfortunate,.Tepercussions in theSbction 81 industries if. double day-shift working in other industries was confined to persons aged 18 and over.. It was recognised that there had always been a difference:between the Section 8t industries and others and it was probably on this account&quot; that&apos;
the provisions now contained in Section Si had been carried over to the 1937 Act fromthe 1901 Act, whereas double day-shift working in other&apos;industries had been thesubject of special legislation, the &quot;1920 Act and the 1936 Act which the Committeewas now considering.Authorisations made under the 1936 Act were normally for an eight hour day which included meal or rest intervals, but it appeared to be legally possible for example,under the split shift system to work under the 1936 Act an eight-hour day exclusive of meal times. The provisions of the 1936 Act in this respect had never been tested ina Court of Law.(Mrs. Stuart Homer, M.B., B.S., D.P.H., Medical Inspector, attended before the.    Committee on the 311st July, 1945.)Dr. Horner said that she had not made any specific enquiry into the health of shiftworkers before coming before the Committee but she had made a special study ofshift workers before she gave evidence to the 1935 Departmental Committee on theEmployment of Women and Young Persons on the Two Shift System and in the courseof her work as a Medical Inspector she. had opportunity of studying the effects on health of a variety of systems of working.With regard to the general question of the effect of working shifts on the workers&apos;health, she found it extremely difficult to estimate how far working hours alone were responsible for variations in the health of individuals or groups. She thought thataccommodation to the system of hours worked was largely a question of the individual&apos;s&apos;reaction which depended on a number of factors. The more common double day-shiftsbecame, the less would be the interference with social and family interests.In 1935 she had found little evidence of ill-health which could definitely (be attributed to working shifts. Dr. Horner said the higher output per hour on double day-shiftsas compared with day work suggested that there was nothing fundamentally unsoundin this system while the influence of shorter hours was itself beneficial.She was hesitant in proposing a maximum number of hours to be worked by shiftworkers but felt that at any fate there should be no increase in the present legallimitations. One of the advantages of the double day-shift system was that hourswere shorter than for day work, and if, the shift turn was increased beyond 8 hours a day, it would mean the loss of this advantage without the compensations of the normalday work. On general principles the less change of habit involved in shift work theless likely were ill effects on health.The change-over from the morning to the afternoon shift did not involve.a radical change in sleeping habits as did a shift system involving night work, nor need italter eating (habits. Dr. Homer thought that&apos; the. time of the main meal of the day andbowel rhythm should be kept as far as possible the same on each of the two day shifts.The meal break should be long enough to allow of the workers having a meal without /hurrying. This was not possible in half an hour in some factories. In addition tothe main break of half an hour she thought it was important to give one or two addi-tional short breaks for refreshment and relaxation.With regard to sleep, Dr. Hornier had found on making, the 1935 enquiry that in twoconsecutive weeks of double day-shifts these workers had slightly longer hours in bedthan normal day turn workers.:&apos;-;    :   &apos; - iDr. Horner thought that there was a good deal to be said in favour of the weeklychange-over of shifts. This seemed to be the choice of the workers themselves and itmight be that it was the -variety, and change that appealed to them while there wasthe attraction of alternate: free weekends. Workers On the early shift, too, could make up their shorter hours of rest in&apos;alternate weeks. In general, .when making the 1933enquiry she had been impressed with- the well-being of the: workers and how quickly,and easily they had seemed able to adapt their lives to shift working.Dr. Horner drew attention to the importance in factories where shift work was inoperation and the workrooms were therefore in use for\ 16 hours a day, of ventilationand cleaning, particularly where there was a health risk attached to the work. :With regard to the question of medical examination, she said she had always beenin favour of pre-employment examination in order to allocate the workers to workfor which they were best suited and to promote upgrading through improvement in health by attention to defects. She,did not feel, however, that double day-shift workingparticularly raised the question of special medical enquiry of supervision, and there wasno stronger argument for shift workers being, examined than any other group of workers.With regard to the suggestion that an ix p.fn. finish might be allowed to accommodate the start at 7 a.m., instead.of 6 a.m. she thought an early start better than a latefinish, especially for young (persons,     .....    -.&apos; &apos;..&apos;.., &apos;,. - .,&apos;.&apos;l&quot;&apos;,&apos;: -
35- BOARD OF TRADE.&apos;(Mr. G. L. Watkinson, C.B., M.C., Under Secretary, Board of Trade, appeared beforethe Committee on 27th June, 1945.)The Board of Trade&apos; considered that as the supply of goods overtook demand Britishindustry would be faced with strong, competition from producers in. other countriesequipped with modern machinery. The volume of bur export traide;had: tobe raised to a level very much&apos;higher than before the war if our balance of payments position was to be restored, and our future success in certain export trades might require exten-isive re-equipment with new arid perhaps costly machinery. The issue for manufacturers-was usually.whether there was a saving on labour costs (from the greater output that-the&quot;worker inight be able to obtain from the new machine) offsetting increased over-head charges where the machine was more&apos; expensive than that in use. In some industries that saving might be sufficient without shift working, in othens not. no general answer was possible on. the economies of a change to new machinery and shift working; the matter was one for examination industry by industry, and the purposeof the Board of Trade evidence was to indicate some of the more likely portions of-thefield for enquiry.&apos; While the main concern: of.- the^Board-of Trade -in the Committee&apos;s1 field of enquiry was with the promotion of industrial efficiency by Te-equipment, with improved formsof machinery and plant, there was also the consideration that-over the next few yearssupplies of new machinery would-be limited, in relation to requirements, and that it&quot;was important to secure a large output from our industrial equipment. A subsidiaryargument in favour of double-shift working was that it accelerated the&apos;replacement:bf;old plant by more up-to-date plant arid Tendered&apos;such.replacement less dependenton the precarious pressure exerted by obsolescence as opposed to wear and tear. &apos;.     -.&apos;: The capital goods industries (iron and steel, heavy engineering, etc.) might be distinguished from the consumer goods industries the latter meriting enquiry: morethan; the former, firstly because the workers in the former- were in general morefamiliar; with ;shift working and secondly, because the factories had had a good.dealof war-time re-equipment with new machinery. On the other hand, development inthe consumer goods industries had been largely at a standstill during; the war (many-firrns having-been-closed under concentration schemes) and..&apos;the workers in those industries were less accustomed to the idea of shift working.. ...-Within the : consumer, goods field it would he useful to consider industries wherecapital costs were high compared with labour costs, rather than the industries wherethe small unit with simple plant and machinery could make an effective. contributionto -production. ; Examples in the latter class were..cutlery, hardware, jewellery, toilet/preparations, footwear and most sections, of the clothing industries. Hosiery was inan intermediate class-one section of that industry with expensive capital equipment,the fully-fashioned section, was used to working double and. even triple--shifts forother-sections of hosiery the advantages were probably, not. so great.. ... -&quot; There remained the basic textile industries,&apos;- cotton, &quot;wool,&apos; linen and rayon-Tanimportant group providing exports valued at  127 million in 1937 out of total exports of manufactured consumer goods amounting&apos;to about  200 million (arid total manufacturedexports of  400 million): All these industries would have to face strong competition from countries which had expanded their industries with modern machinery. Cottonwas the largest industry in the group (exports in 1937 were.  68million), and, bearing that mind the high cost of new equipment, it was likely that there might be a movetoward shift working on cotton spinning. Cotton . (including rayon) weaving, however,probably provided.,the, leading industry for the^Committee^ consideration. .The.pro-portion&quot; of automatic looms&apos; was&apos; much lower in this country than in other- countries,but: itwas widely believed that there&apos;could be no large-scale re-equipment in Lancashirewith: this costly: machinery without extending-the present isolated arrangements iion&quot;shift working&apos; to a .more general agreement to&quot; work on a shift basis;; :OneFdifffculfyiri this, and, indeed, in other industries, was that some manufacturers doubted thecost economies&apos; of the new machinery, urging that -for: many purposes the . OrdinaryLancashire-loom, costing  40;&apos;&apos;could be used in: a way that gave greater.economy of^prbduction&quot; than&apos; the automatic&apos; loom costing: from  140: to  700, according to-type-.&apos;&quot;: -Even where&apos; the manufacturers were satisfied that ttie; new-machinery worked by shiftswould be a business proposition, the workers might not be satisfied that there wouldibe-an-improvement in. their wages and&quot; other; ckcflrristarices sufficient to offset the-family and other inconveniences of shift working. Authoritative demonstration-of. the-facts was needed and. the Board, of Trade hoped; that the Committee would be ableto deal particularly with this aspect of the matter..     &quot; -     ,&quot; &apos;176
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.(Dr. H. H. Burness, M.C., and Mr. H. E. Melvin, O.B.E., Assistant Secretaries,Ministry of Education, attended before the Committee on the 12th February, 1946.); The Ministry of Education representatives explained that their departments interestin the subject before the Committee lay in the consequences to education and toeducational and recreational life which would follow the wider adoption of double day-shift working.   From their point of view the system was open to strong objectionbecause it involved the shift workers being cut off during their leisure hours from. workers in other employments and from workers in the same employment as themselveswho were on the opposite shift.   This objection applied with particular force to youngpersons.&quot;   The representatives -traced in some detail the effect of this insulation ofshift workers on their opportunities for (1) technical training, (2) general education and (3) social life, including activities connected with community- centres and the youth service.   A difficulty in all cases was the duplication of facilities which wouldbe entailed if a large number of workers went on to double day-shift working.   Themain problem was staff, but the.- position as regards premises was little better for alarge amount of part-time educational work was done in buildings occupied duringthe day by schools.   The possibility of technical education on a basis corresponding to double day-shift working was. not ruled out.   As regards social work, however, therewas in addition to a general objection to splitting the community by shift working,the special difficulty that the services of many valuable voluntary helpers in clubs andother youth organisations could only be obtained in the evenings.   When the CountyCollege scheme came into force, it would cover a large part of the Technical orVocational Training of persons under iS as well as continuing their general education.Many would, however, wish to supplement their County College work by some attendance at evening classes.   The raising of the minimum, age for shift working would not affectthe large number over 18 who continued their part time Technical Education to the&apos;age of 21 and over.  Those were a very important section as they provide the technical and Executive staffs of the future.   The raising of the minimum age would, however,help considerably the social and recreational work of clubs and youth centres.    Itwould mean that these organisations would not be impeded in their work among youngpersons in the critical period between the ages of 14 and 18.    The Ministry ofEducation representatives did not think that the educational objections to the doubleday-shift work would be much weakened if the system were associated with a fiverdayweek.   Under the five-day week system, workers would tend to look on the sixth dayas an additional day for rest, rather than a day that could be devoted to education.In any case it was preferable that educational and recreational activities should bespread throughout the week rather than concentrated at the weekend.   On the questionof. the frequency with which the worker should change shifts, the Ministry of Educationsaw no advantages from a general social point of view in. a relatively infrequentchangeover&quot; (say once a month) instead of a weekly changeover, but they thought a fairly long run of one shift might help in the organisation of evening classes.   Owingto difficulties caused by the war the Ministry were unable to produce up-to-date figuresof the number of persons attending evening classes.   It was stated, however, that in1938 there were in the .17-118 age group 112,000 persons doing serious technical or commercial  training,   normally  involving  classes,   three  evenings  a   week.     Thecorresponding numbers for the 18-21 age group were 150,000.    The geographical distribution of these students followed fairly closely on the general distribution of population.(2) Employers&apos; Organisations.THE CABLEMAKERS&apos;- ASSOCIATION. -(Mr. II. J. Hodges attended before the Committee on the 25th September, 1945.)The representative of the Association explained that the industry had had a greatdeal of experience in shift working over the last 24 years. In 1921* the Joint IndustrialCouncil for the Electrical Cable Making Industry made provision, in voluntarilynegotiated agreements -for the working of two and three-shift systems. It was estimatedthat of approximately 26,000 workers employed, of whom about half were females,60 per cent, had worked on shift systems in peacetime: the mien on three, shifts andthe women and young persons on. double day-shifts. There was little displacement oflabour in the industry, which was divided mainly between the manufacture of heavycables and: light cables. On the heavy cable side/where men were mainly-* employed,women arid young: persons would only. be employed on shifts as arid when occasiondemanded. There .were, ho\vever; fashions in the types of the various cables beingmanufactured, and.as the demand for these did not fall off simultaneously the women and young persons were switched from the manufacture of one type of cable to anotheras the need arose.   On the lighter cable side, where women were mostly&apos;employed,
double day-shift working was in operation almost continuously.. The normal methodof working double day-shifts was from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Saturday inclusive,and 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive, with a half-hour meal-break, and inmany factories tea was taken round to the workers at their benches both morning and afternoon. As regards any change in the hours allowed, they felt that, an 11 p.m.finish would give greater flexibility to the system, but they did not press for tfliis.Among the advantages found in shift working were the following: (1) From the employers&apos; point of view: (a) Efficiency was greater on. shift work.(b) The system was beneficial where it was difficult to replace machinery and any extension of floor space was impracticable.(2) From the workers&apos; point of view: There was a shorter working week and(a) Women workers found more time for their domestic duties and recreation.(b) Wages were paid for a normal 47-hour week. Overtime was paid for hours worked outside the normal working day. If the day workers were employed from.30 a.m. to 5 p.m., a shift worker was paid an enhanced wage from 6 a.m. to7.30 a.m. and in the evening from 51 p.ni. to 10 p.m.&apos; In the light of their experience of shift working they put fonward certain proposalsfor amendments to the present arrangements whereby shifts could be worked. they proposed that the ballot should be abolished and that the Factory Inspector should hold the right to issue a permit to allow shift working, providing that he was satisfiedthat the proposal met with the approval of the workers and that they would be adequately safeguarded. Further, they advocated that the present arrangement ofthe workers, alternating shifts week by week might be modified to meet the need ofthe individual who wished to attend educational or recreative classes once a week.At present any worker employed on shifts could only attend such classes when hewas on the morning shift. It might be possible, for permission to be given for himto arrange to do the morning shift each week on that particular day. As regardshealth, the Association had no reason to believe that shift working had undesirableeffects cn the health of the workers. A medical officer in the industry consideredthat where shift work was blamed for effect on health in pre-war days he consideredthat outside and transport difficulties were mainly responsible.-    -----   THE COTTON  SPINNERS&apos;   AND  MANUFACTURERS&apos;  ASSOCIATION(Mr.&apos; G. B. Fielding attended before the Committee on the 30th October, 1945.)The representative of the Association stressed, that although they did not anticipate any sudden or widespread demand in the near-future, from an economic standpointthe need for shift working was of major importance. Owing to war-time concentra-tion, of about 500,000 looms in place, pre-war, only about half were now running.The great majority of these looms were of the Lancashire type and the remainder were automatic looms. The future programme, as far as double day-shift working. was concerned, depended on an, increase in the supply of labour to the industry. Inorder to attract more labour, and increase production at the same time, the industryenvisaged that improved -working conditions, reduced costs and good wages were required.   To carry out this programme three main objects were considered essential: (a) Respaeing   of  machinery and   the  introduction of   special  preparatorymachinery.(b) The extension of More-Looms working.(c) The installation! Of more automatic looms.  .Re-spacing of machinery would involve loss of productive capacity and highercosts,, whilst: repairs, renewals, better working conditions and the introduction of; special preparatory machinery would mean, substantial expenditure. Ah extensionof More-Loom working and of double day-shifts would be two methods of maintainingoutput to meet the immediate demand for cloth and also to reduce costs per unit.As regards the long term position, replacement of present looms by automatic loomscould only take place gradually. An early large-scale introduction of them wouldbe impracticable, mainly because of the limited output capacity of the machine makers,but in addition the vast capital expenditure involved had to be considered. It wasnot possible to state categorically-how far weaving by the automatic looms showed^ah Overall saving in cost per unit of cloth; it depended on a number of factors, suchjas&quot; the type of cloth to be manufactured. It was, however, asserted that to makeautomatic-looms a commercial competitive proposition they must work on at least^a two shift&apos;system; -In addition to the high cost of these looms,: as compared withthe.-Lancashire looms, it. was pointed out that they, occupied more space, which&apos; meant&apos; fewer looms per shed-with,proportionately higher. spread: of overheads. . Oh-the other-hand the labour cost was&apos; relatively low. in. comparison with, the high, property -pbrtion of total productive cost attributable to depreciation, interest and other capital
THE FEDERATION OF MASTER COTTON SPINNERS&apos;  ASSOCIATIONS LTD.   &apos;(Mr, J. Sliepherd appeared before the Committee on 30th October, 1945.) &apos;-.&apos;.&apos;.&quot;.&apos;&quot;jThe representative of the Federation said that -tiivi demand from the spinning sectionof the industry for double day-shift&apos; working was not likely to be as urgent&apos;as thedemand from the Manufacturing&apos;side. This difference arose from the greater1 probableexpenditure on the&apos;manufacturing side in conversion to automatic looms than the prospective&quot; expenditure on new spinning plant and machinery: New automatic loomsat post-war prices might require double shift working on that&apos; side&apos;of the industry inorder to cover the capital charges-involved, but these was&apos;hot any prospect of that position arising for some time in the spinning section. From an economic standpoint,the insatiable -demand for cotton - goods throughout the worldv demonstrated the needfor:whatever system of working,&quot;would, yield the greatest immediate. supply of-such goods. Shift working- could not&quot; provide-the immediate answer because of the serious/labour; shortage in the industry: It was estimated-that the ;mills which had remainedopen throughout the war, were under-staffed to.the extent of 30 per cent., and thatto meet that deficiency: and. to. staff, the mills re-opening &quot;under the scheme for de-concentration :of . the industry,-&apos; 40,000 - operatives were required. The long-term policy, depended, to a large extent on-labour supply,:for until labour became more-plentiful.; it; was not possible to&quot;:judge&apos; accurately - whether the industry would be-able,- as before the war,: to meet both home and overseas &quot;demand on the vbasis of-single shift working. The cotton industry was : essentially an - exporting industry,and- dn order to continue to ; serve that vital function in the post-war&apos; world,&quot; costs-of: production would have-to be .such.as. to/enable- this-country-:to. compete.in -world-markets. -In:order to-;sell-.,goods-;at? competitive-prici3S;.more;,.contmuous.rfunning ofmachinery&apos;-would be necessary to offset the increased capital charges in- the,case, ofnew mills or newly-equipped mills. Double day-shift working might proye the meansof meeting these increased costs. The-desire for legislation, /whefeby: shift workingcould be adopted without delay was stressed. &quot;&apos;The&apos; Association advocated that the-jballbt system.be abolished &quot;and that freedom.-be given.&apos; tpithe enlployef to institute&apos;shift iworkmg.where .he;. found - that supply /and demand, together; with an adequatejsnpply. of rlabour,-.indicated fiiatasubstantial economic ^advantage&apos; would result. - It;was/argued that providing the -local Trade Unions1 and the workers at-the mill were.satisfied - with the proposal, &apos;such:a system, wouldrbe;workable without the formalities/necessarys;under.. the.- Employment of Women&quot; and Young ;(Persohs Act, 1936.

Secondly, shift workingmight be necessary to ensure quick&quot; delivery of special orders and to obtain&quot; the-advantage, of a: bigger-turnover.1 on &quot;existing; plant. As regards changes in.the existing-jaw,&quot;the Association pressed: for freedom from the ballot. /They felt that followingdiscussion with the Trades Union, as normally took place when, changes - in organisationrwere.-proposed, the employer, should-be. free, to institute double day-shift working&quot;where he considered it. necessary to obtain the best utilisation of labour force and cbnomical efficiency of the plant. .

With regard to hours of employment,6 a.m. to &quot;2 p.&apos;m. arid 2 p.m. to.10 p.m. were considered ,&apos;normal working hours &quot;forshifts, but the Association favoured the elasticity which would result if the finishingtime.was&apos;changed from to pjn. to 11 p.m.
THE ASSOCIATION OF JUTE SPINNERS&apos; AND MANUFACTURERS.;.(Mr. D. A. Anderson, Captain W. G. Don and My. H. Giles Walker attended beforethe Committee on 25th September, 1945.)The representatives of the Association explained that the major problem facing the Industry today -was bow to compete, successfully with foreign competition in Indiaand on the continent (where jute was again likely to become an important industry)where low wages were paid. To meet this competition, modernisation of machinery in this country was considered to be of -primary importance. Only in this way would it be possible for the high quality goods, considered desirable in this country,to toe produced at competitive prices. In 1939 56 per cent, of total output was&apos;produced on old type machines and 44 per cent, on automatic machines which came in after 1930. The latest development in machinery was still in the experimental stage.It was pointed out, however, that on the basis of single shift working, modernisation of the old type of machine, which produced the 56 per cent, of output in pre-wardays, would cost somewhere in the region of  5 million. That figure would includethe cost of erection of new buildings to house the new machinery, as there were fewbuildings in the trade which could be adapted to suit modern conditions. If,however, double day-shifts were worked with working hours of 88 as against 4-8 aweek, less machinery -would be required and it was estimated that the total cost ofinstalling new plant would be about halved. A further point of importance connectedwith the modernisation of machinery was that the Association was emphatically ofthe opinion that new machinery produced a better quality product. Yarn spun onthe. modern slip-draft machines was more level and stronger and in every way con-sidered to be superior. In addition it was stressed that interest and depreciation!charges of new machinery would be an additional heavy burden and it was doubtfulwhether these charges could be met on the basis of single shift working. The Asso-ciation thought that the Jute Industry in Britain could only thrive if it -producedhigh quality goods and for such production skilled workers would be required.Favourable wages must toe paid to those operatives and in order to do that theremust be high production per man per hour. This, it was considered, could only beachieved by installing modern machinery and working, a double day-shift system,:In the past where new machinery had been installed it.had been the normal practice to employ the men on day and night shifts, and the industry had oniy had experienceof double day-shift working in-the firm of Don Bros., Buist, and Co., Ltd., cf Forfar.Don Bros, had been working a double day-shift system since 1941. They had workeda split shift system between the hours of 6 a.m. and to p.m.-Shift I, working from6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Shift II from 10 a.m. to 2 p,rn.and 6 p.m. to. 10 ,p.m. The shifts alternated weekly. This system could, of course,only work satisfactorily -where there were no transport difficulties. In an area wherethe workers had to (travel some distance to work such a system was clearly, unwork-able. In Forfar, however, it proved very successful and was well liked by theworkers. When the question arose of transferring a handful of -workers from oneinill to the mill where that system was in operation, the main; thing that decidedthose workers in favour of the transfer was the split shift system. From experience in that particular mill it was estimated. that absenteeism was never higher than 10 percent., averaging between 5 per cent, and 7 -per cent. As regards shift working,which they considered on an economic basis would become necessary on a wider scale in future, they did not necessarily propose working the split shift system already described, and they were in favour of the period of employment being extended to11 -D-.ni. As regards working hours, a 49 hour week was considered to be the ultimategoal, although Mr. Walker was of the opinion that it would not be an economic proposi-tion in the near future. He considered that at present an 86 hour week for machinery was about the&apos; lowest possible. The 11 p.m. finish would give a degree of flexibilityto meet all the different methods that might be employed in connection with the intrq-duotion of shift working: It was felt that the advantages of shift working from thesocial aspect outweighed the. disadvantages. In the JuteT Industry several membersof the same family frequently worked in the same establishments; [ it would be easier to arrange home duties and shopping facilities; with shift work in operation, when,one member would be at&apos;home wvhile the other was at work. In this connection ithad to be remembered that in the past probably 70 per cent, of the total labour forcein the Jute Industry were women.     &apos;. &apos;&quot;. .    .&apos;-      .7    &quot;.&quot;.&apos;-&quot;-&quot; :    &quot;   THE&apos; &quot;NATIONAL EMPLOYERS&apos;  ASSOCIATION OF RAYON YARN PRODUCERS:     .       .   &apos;(Mr. C. Bqnard, Mr. H. L. Bingham, Mr. H. James and Mr.&apos; W. D. Hendry attendedbefore &apos;&apos;;      ...     1The representatives of. the Association: /said . that, they, considered that, the /(jevelpp;ment of-&apos; shift working was-the only &quot;means of reconciling workers&apos; legitimate demands for - a higher standard of living- with the economic problems now. facing industry;
Basically the only means of bringing about an increase in the standard of living was by increasing the productivity rate per worker but.it had to.be home in mind that increased productivity had to be combined with an. inevitable: reduction in the totalworking hours, of industry, due to longer holidays, the raising of the school leaving age and&apos;&apos; young workers&apos; having time off for educational classes, etc. The solutionappeared to. lie in the installation of new labour saving machinery .combined jvithdouble day-shift :working, for, only by working shifts could the, expensive new plant!become, an economic proposition, i.e.,, shift working would approximately halve the.amount .-of machinery required. It was pointed out in this Connection that the economy of. shift working depended mainly on . the ratio of the capital cost ofmachinery to the cost of the product particularly to &quot;labour costs:. Shift work involved a reduction in the number of hours worked toy the individual worker,&apos;but in the rayon,industry in particular a special wage allowance was made for shift &quot;work and.this&apos;coupled with the fact that meal breaks were paid for on shift work and &quot;not on daywork meant that in fact the labour, cost per unit of production was increased whenthe, double ,day-shift system, was in operation. The increase was estimated to foe.somewhere in the region of 10 per&apos; cent. ;To offset this increase in labour costs the manufacturer, would have to save on other items. of. expenditure and. such savingcould only be ,. made in - reduced amortization and interest charges on. the machinery..The increase in/labour cost attributable to shift working would of itself increase &quot;thecost of the product by 10 per cent, and it therefore followed that shift working was.not an economic-proposition unless that 10 per cent.; could be written off by savingmore than that amount on interest and amortization charges. (It \vas the experience,of the Ass that the economic life of a machine was determined by obsolescencerather than wearing; out through use, so. that regardless of the number of hours workedcapital expenditure..had to be written off in the same number of years.) It therefore;followed that only when the capital. value of the plant was-high would shift workingbe an economic advantage. . In their own&apos; industry the: Association, had found that onthis basis saving on the overall cost of the&apos;product had averaged between 5 per cent.-ro per; cent., and in exceptional cases where the value of the capital equipment was.very high as. much as 30 per cent. There were other factors which favoured shift working. Some processes, for technical reasons, had to be carried on continuously and while ancillary processes often worked by women need not follow suit, it was, in certaincircumstances more convenient, and indeed more desirable on grounds of quality, forthem to be carried on for. 16 rather than 8 hours a day. ,Again in some Departmentsexperience showed, that the quality of the product was poor when the machines were first started up and that it was therefore advantageous to run the machines, as longas possible. Thirdly, shift working afforded a convenient method of obtaining addi7tional output when the machines were already fully occupied on ordinary&apos; day work.(That reason would only hold good where the demand for the product was insufficient to justify the installation of, additional plant.) Another factor of importance in con-sidering the short term position only was the enormous accumulated., demand&quot; for&apos;products today. . On-the assumption that the supply of labour would tefnporarily over-take the availability of new plant shift, working seemed to be. the only method of atleast partly meeting, this demand. In this connection- several firms.had pointed outthat with the&apos; present shortage of plant the smooth absorption of workers beingdemobilised would be :greatly. eased by shift working.        .-.&apos;-. .-. In the experience of the Association shift working had always operated smoothlybut they argued that the present method of obtaining the workers&apos; -views by secretballot was unreal and should be replaced by fuller consultation of the. workpeople.They considered that the employer alone was in the position to know whether or notshift working was economically desirable and that, the decision whether or- not it was put into operation should not be left to,the workers&apos; vote; The rayon industry was highly organised and it was considered that the employer having decided that; doubleday-shift working was- necessary, the matter should be explained fully to -the workers&apos;,representatives who could be relied upon to speak for the workers concerned. Theproblem of non-Union members would be ,met. either by . themselves . individually or through, domestic arrangements inside the factory, such as Works Councils, which would include non-organised labour. - In their opinion there was no ^danger that the workers&apos;representatives having agreed with the proposals and: shift working-having ,-been putinto operation that the workers would then&quot; sabotage, the -scheme-although it wasagreed that this depended on there being a high degree of confidence between imanage-ment and workers which was only -possible where there was strong negotiating machineryas.in the rayon industry. .   ... .,&quot;.;.,&quot;   .&apos;    &apos;.-,&apos;The Association thought that ideally 18 should be the.minimum age for shift.workingbut! that this would not be a. practicable, proposition, . The present industrial lifeofa:,girl was on an average eight;years, of which, for-two. from 14-16.she was excludedfrom shift work. . When the school leaving age was raised&apos; to 16, although it. wouldseem to follow that the i6-i;8s would then do the jobs now done by the 14-16S, if a
-    179girl were excluded from shift work until she was 18, that would be one third of herindustrial life on day work instead of one quarter as at present. Because of the warthe Association had had little experience of dealing with recreational problems that gowith shift working but they thought it would be a matter of readjustment by theauthorities and organisations concerned.THE NATIONAL HOSIERY  MANUFACTURERS&apos;   FEDERATION.(Mr. 71. Kennewell appeared before the Committee on 25th September, 1945.)The representative of the Federation said that, owing to the large number of smallunits of production (out of 63S member firms, 266 employed 20 workers or less, and only 64 employed 200 or more), and lack of uniformity of systems of working, it was difficult to gauge how widely double day-shift working was used throughout theindustry. In Scotland it had never been used and was not expected, to be requiredin the future, but in Southern England and the Midlands, the other main areas wherethe Industry was situated, lack of uniformity, Union membership and cohesion, tended to make, employers work systems according to their own individual preferences. Itwas clear, however, that shift working had never been widely used and that in thefuture, as in the past, it would be required only to meet bottlenecks in specific depart-ments; or to meet seasonal demands. Although such a system was only likely to beused periodically the Federation saw that the following advantages would accrue whereit was used.Plant could be run to capacity with reduced costs and capital outlay and higherproduction could be obtained from the same amount of floor space. Less new machinery would be required immediately, and, as the machinery would be workedfor longer hours, more frequent replacements by up-to-date plant would be possible.It was suggested that shift working would reduce the amount of faulty work becausefaults resulted from machines being stiff after standing all night. The saving in fuelwhich resulted from working over the two-shift period was also mentioned.As regards export,. for which goods generally conformed to standard patterns, shift working would enable longer runs to be made, with the consequent reduction of costs,although in, the main there would be little economy, as, of the 7 per cent, of total production normally exported in peacetime, 80 per cent, was of high quality goods.This quality was obtained by higher labour content.rather than toy greater use of the&apos; machines. The main reason for the Federation giving evidence was that they would. like greater freedom in initiating shift working as, and when, it was required. they proposed that permission to work shifts might be given to the Industry as a whole,instead of to individual factories, with the safeguard that the individual occupier should notify the Factory Inspector before starting, or when finishing, work on a shift system.This, coupled with the limitation of hours, ages and classes of persons, together with suitable Canteen and transport facilities, was thought to be adequate safeguard in place of the present arrangements for consultation with the workpeople. It was judgedthat adequate, consultation would be difficult to organise where Union membership onlyamounted to approximately one third of the total labour force.&apos; As regards social consequences, the Federation stressed the advantage of a five-day. week in alternate weeks, a free morning or afternoon, and providing that good canteenand transport facilities were available, the alleviation of the present shopping and meal-: time difficulties.. . .Two objections to the scheme were seen *ay the Federation.   In certain sections ofthe Industry operatives objected to two persons working on one machine on alternate&apos; shifts as.these machines were fitted to the operative. That Objection applied particularly-to making-up machines, linking and sewing.   Secondly, individual manufacturers whowere not working shifts would object to undue competition from those who worked a, double day-shift system as part of the normal course of working.(3) Trades Union  Congress General  Council  and   Scottish  Trades  Union   congress general Council. ,&apos;Sir Mark Hodgson, Mr. Alfred Roberts, Mr. W. P. McGuinness, Mr. George Woodcockand Mr. E. Fletcher appeared before the Committee on 28th March, 1946.)The T.U.C. representatives stated that they had always opposed shift working hitherto,except in industries where the nature of the processes made work outside normal working hours inevitable.    Their opposition had&quot; been mainly on the grounds of the social- disadvantages to the workers which shift work entailed.   In the first place a heavy- strain was imposed on the housewife with different members of the family coming and: going at different times.   This was especially the case where, as in the textile trades in particular, the housewife herself went out,to work. Again the shift worker was at&apos;: the factory at different times from the majority of his fellow workers, which restricted53144 1 A ?
his chances of-making or meeting friends-and--also prevented his making Use, at anyrate in, alternate&apos; weeks, of recreational; social and educational facilities;. Transportproblems also&apos; had&apos; tb&apos;be considered, for when as factory- worked! the;- double, day-shift system, the occupier tended to employ a- larger labour force, drawn from, a&apos; wider area,which meant travelling further distances at unusually early orlate:hours-when workmanfstickets were often not available. In addition to these fundamental drawbacks, theT.U.C. had objected in the past to the manner in which the shift system was applied the failure to maintain the weekly wage,, inadequate: consultation of the workpeopleand the tendency of the-occupier, to use the system as an alternative to overtime.On the economic side the T.U.G. recognised to-day that the principal stimulus tothe extended use of the&apos; double day-shift system- would, arise - from, the need in manymanufacturing, industries for extensive re-equipment with: new types of. machines ata heavy capital cost. In such- industries the need for extended shift work, was basedon: the1 necessity for working: such new-, machinery over&apos; a. maximum- economic period.It would be argued that shift work by permitting the; spreading of-overhead costs; overat. larger output would&apos; enable production to be carried on: at. a lowers cost pen unit, of.output and. would also enable saving, to be made on, storage requirements and bulkhandling; etc. Further, the average productivity of the industry concerned&apos; would beraised, by permitting-the concentration of-workers in. the more-efficient establishments.Lastly,: shift-working would- facilitate the application, of scientific and; technical improve-Reinforcements by providing a guarantee: that the new equipment would be fully utilised.. Therewere, however, other factors which had to be borne in mind. The T.U.C. had to keepin mind the total welfare of the worker and to view, production as it affected theworkeris; standard of work, life and welfare. Before- the war. the introduction of: shift working- reduced, working hours to an average: of approximately 41J hours a week andan extension of shift work should therefore facilitate the recognition&apos; of the T.U.C.&apos;claim for a shorter working week. Previously one of their objections; to shift workinghad, been that wages were-not ger.e.-ally maintained, but the economies,, which shiftwork on up-to-date machinery should&apos; bring about, should permit higher wages to bepaid to workers without increasing the cost of the finished article. Finally there wastrie&quot;; argument that there was to-day an overwhelming need for a large output of goods. at a&apos;.,low cost and it Was dbub&apos;tful - whether: the demand for these goods could- be met without-the installation of new machinery combined&apos; with double day-shift work:&apos;&quot;. In- the face of these requirements which had to be: set. off against the disadvantages of the system,; the T.U.G. considered that a measure of shift working, must be accepted.Their acceptance of an extension- of shift working was-,, however, conditional on there being some measure&apos; of guarantee that the potential advantages to the worker, referredto above;, would in fact materialise. In particular they would oppose any extension ofshift work should&apos;unemployment develop to any degree, not so much because shift working would then- in fact be undesirable, but because the workers would argue that-with shift work production was speeded up and as. a result more people would becomeunemployed&apos;. It was difficult to break down such an attitude of mind on the partof the workers.- -Secondly, there must be some assurance that the workers would getsome share of the profits incurred by shift work. This fell within the sphere ofindustrial negotiation, but it was also within the. power of the Government to furthersuch a condition, by price control and taxation policy. Finally the T.U.C. emphasised that whatever. social or legal improvements were made for the welfare of the workers,the personal disadvantages could never be entirely eliminated and they therefore main-tained their right to reconsider their attitude in the light of changed circumstances ofproduction or in-the national economy at&quot; large..In so far as they were now prepared to support an extension of shift work theT.U.C. proposed several amendments to trie.law as it now stood and also put forward proposals which, if not necessarily embodied in the law, they thought should be strongly recommended. In the first place they held that the maximum weekly hours,should be reduced to 46 a week inclusive of meal-breaks. ,The two shifts should fall within a period of 16 hours on any working day and Saturday work should be abolished.In support of-the latter proposal it was argued that many employers, alreadyacknow-ledged that Saturday morning work was uneconomical on account of the tremendousamount-of absenteeism which took place on that day. A further point was of course that two whole days, off each week would to some extent off-set the disadvantagesinherent in the double day-shift system. In addition, in view of the fact that a40- or 41-hour week oh shift Work was, before the war, considered equivalent to a 47- or48-hour day week they thought that provision should be made for a further reviewof total permitted hours of shift workers when a more general reduction in the hoursoidajr workers occurred.- Further they saw no reason why.the employment of youngp&apos;ers6hs under 18 on shift work should not-be altogether prohibited. The school leaving&quot;age was shortly, to be raised to 16 and it was particularly important that youngpefsbnS should have every opportunity in the years immediately following leaving schoolbf cbntinuirig theif educatibri oh a part-time basis.   It was also desirable that young
persons should not be too. much restricted as regards their leisure time. In industries where young,persons..were closely associated in their work with adult workers, it was thought that the small amount: of re-organisation which would be necessary to ensurecontinuity of their work, was justified in the light of the arguments given above. &apos;The T.U.C. was opposed to the proposal that in substitution of a ballot ariauthorisation should be granted if the&apos;employer and the trade.union representatives had reached agreement. It would not, in the opinion of the T.U.C., be possible to discover for the purpose suitable legal terms to define a bona fide trade union organisation much less the appropriate trade union in a particular case. Such anarrangement would therefore mean that in those cases in which there was dispute asto the organisation which had the legal right to come to an agreement with the employer on behalf of the workpeople concerned the ultimate decision would rest with some person or authority other than the workpeople or the trade unions themselves.In those circumstances there was a danger that some trade unions would be legallyhandicapped in their attempts to secure adequate recognition and to pursue their normalactivities..The T.U.C. did not, however, consider that the ballot was the ideal arrangement and in their opinion it was only second best- to normal collective agreements, but it did meet, especially,t the needs of workpeople in unorganised Undertakings and badlyorganised industries. They thought that the ballot on the introduction of the shift system was inadequate for securing the continuing approval of the system by theworkers affected; they proposed that the Minister should be enabled, on representationbeing made by the appropriate trade union; to direct in certain circumstances that anew ballot should be held.The T.TJ.C. proposed the setting up of Works Committees in order to secure thecontinuance of the conditions imposed by authorisation permitting shift working. Itwas, however, agreed that if neither employer nor the workers&apos; representatives wantedsuch a Committee if would not do to insist upon it and that this might be an obstaclein the way of -embodying such a provision in the future law. The T..U.C. suggestedthat in cases where no benefit could be shown to result from the introduction of shift-working in the way of reduction in costs, or where an application was required for temporary purposes, there should (be provision for the question to be referred to anycommon organisation established in the industry for production purposes or to theGovernment Departments concerned to determine whether any alternative method, of meeting the load could be found. They expressed the view that an employer shouldnot move workers at will from one department to another or take on additionalworkers to operate a shift system to meet a purely temporary situation. they believed that efficient industrial organisation would go a long way towards overcomingsuch temporary emergencies.The&apos;T.U.C. also asked that serious consideration be given to such points as themaintenance of the normal weekly wage and ensuring that when shift working was proposed, the v.-orkers themselves were made fully aware of all the facts in the case,i.e., economic reasons for installing the&apos; system, etc. The wages question could not,of course, be dealt with by legislation, but it was thought that they should be oneof the factors involved before any authorisation was granted. On the question of thesocial disadvantages of the system to the workers, which again could not be overcomemerely by legislation, the T.U.C. considered that the Ministry of Labour should assumed certain responsibility in encouraging, in all areas where shift work was extensivelyused, such educational and recreative. facilities as the shift worker required, andalso stimulate the development of such services as (public meals and domestic assistance,etc. - &apos;--v&apos;&quot;&quot; &apos; &apos;: -&apos;;...&apos;--.   ;V:;;. &apos; .&apos;- ,:(4) General.the industrial health research board.(Dr. S. Wyatt and Miss N. Davis attended before the Committee on 31st July, 1945.)The representatives of the Board explained that statistical evidence submitted on output, absenteeism and other matters was based&quot; on figures. obtained for variouspurposes not directly concerned with the work of the Committee and was not theresult of a specialised investigation. Its value as a basis for general conclusionsabout the double day-shift system was therefore limited. On the question of hourlyoutput the double day-shift system was seen to compare favourably with both the twoshift system and with the single day shift, showing an average rise in hourly output;of 8 per cent, and 3 per cent, respectively. A direct comparison with tne 3 shift system .was not possible but it seemed probable that the relative output on the^inorning and afternoon shifts would not differ materially from that on the.double day-.shift system. Absence figures: relating to.a group&quot; of workers who changed from singleshift working to double day-shift working showed that over a 12 weeks period, there
was no marked difference in the average amount of time lost on those two systems of working. The immediate effect of the change however was a decrease in totalabsence from 15.2 per cent, to 8.4 per cent, which it was considered was probably due to the effects of the shorter hours of work and to a revival of interest inducedby the change from an established routine. Figures of absenteeism oh the 3. shift system showed that absence was appreciably higher on the morning than on the afternoon shift and that the rate of absence for the night shift was usually somewherebetween the two. In comparing absence rates in a group of workers who changedfrom a 3 shift system to a 2 shift system absence on the morning arid afternoonshifts of the 3 shift system was substantially less than on the 2 shift system, theimmediate effect of the change being an increase in absenteeism from 18.5 per cent,to 26.3 per cent. Some figures were also available showing workers&apos; preference for different-shifts. Comparing married and .single&quot; women the figures showed that the morning shift was relatively more papular among married women and the the night shift among single women.From the standpoint of health and happiness the Board considered that ordinaryday work was the. most suitable but if economic necessity demanded greater outputthere was no doubt that the double day-shift system was a better way of achieving thisobject than by working overtime on top of ordinary day work. When it was proposed -to institute shift working they thought that it was important that, the workers should be told fully why such a change was necessary. Workers, especially women,were conservative in their methods of working, but being told the reasons for thechange would probably go a long way towards making them satisfied with theproposals. This conservatism had been shown up in an investigation of frequency of changeover of shifts when something like 70 per cent, preferred the system towhich they were accustomed. ! On the question of the frequency of the changeover ofshifts an &quot;advantage of a weekly changeover was &quot;that the workers had to put up with the disadvantage of early rising or evening work for a short period at a time.It had been found that many workers felt they could put up with any disadvantagesproviding they were for a limited period only. It was not possible to correlate anysickness figures with the question of the changeover apart from the fact that it -tookmen from. 3-5 days to accustom themselves to nightwork and it was felt that night-work probably did have a long term influence on health. There.was however evidence on.the absenteeism side, that on a 2 shift system with a fortnightly changeoverabsenteeism was higher on. the second week of the nigbtshift; and in the: first week of the day shift. On the double day-shift system figures showed that generally speakingabsenteeism was higher on the morning than on the afternoon shift. Among other advantages of the weekly changeover was of course the long weekend in alternateweeks. It was felt that some elasticity in the changeover of shifts was desirable.Women workers, especially those who were married, preferred -permanency in their arrangements and would probably prefer to remain permanently on one shift or theother. &apos; &apos;;: .\[-y- ,On the question of hours consideration was given to the question of starting at a.m. and finishing at 11 p.m. It was felt that 7 a.m. would help the ever presentbreakfast problem and that when workers had to work during the evening, providingtransport was arranged for them, they did not mind going on until 11 p.m. Thequestion of whether a 40 minute break for the main meal was preferable to a 30minute break with a 10 rniiiute interval in the middle of the shift was felt to toeone to be examined by individual employers. From the social aspect it was thoughtthat Saturday morning work was undesirable, but where the work was mainlyautomatic and output depended on the number of hours worked, work on Saturday morning might be economically desirable.The Board concluded by emphasising that they could not provide conclusive evidence on the relative merits of the double -day-shift system and of other systems ofworking.THE YOUNG WOMEN&apos;S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.(Miss M. Curwen,. C.B.E., and Miss F. Seager appeared before the Committee on12th February, 1946.)The: evidence given by the representatives of the Association was based primarily,though not exclusively, on the Association^ wartime experience. The representativessaid that the double day-shift system had been found to be extremely popular withwomen war workers living in hostels, and suggested that&apos; the system was advantageousfrom the point of view of the health of the workers, provided that they lived in hostelswhich were -well organised, and where meals were provided at appropriate times.They pointed out, however, that if a double shift system was worked it was essentialthat- adequate recreational facilities should be organised in the mornings for workers on the late shift and if that were hot done there was serious risk of absenteeism^
It was desirable that flexibility should be allowed in the arrangement oi turns to-suit the convenience of individual workers. As regards the problems raised by; working a double day-shift in peace-time for workers not living in hostels, therepresentatives of the Association mentioned the difficulty which was experienced in.gettmg an adequate number of suitable workers to help with morning club activities.They said that they thought that much could be done toy: education and discussion at: clubs to foster a proper appreciation of the economic need for a doable day-shift system. ,B.    written evidence only ( .(1) International&apos; Labour office the International Labour Office submitted a report on the Double Day Shift system in industrial undertakings in various countries and in particular in Canada, France,Switzerland and the United States of America. They stated that they were unableto jproyide a comprehensive survey and pointed out that the labour statistics of many countries, however, detailed in other respects, rarely give much data on this subject.They observed that the various countries had so far paid comparatively little attentionto the possibility of organising industry on a two shift basis. Legislators, industry,labour and public opinion had up till now generally focussed their attention on prob-lems connected with night work and a good deal of the I.L.O. Report was devotedto this matter. There could be little doubt that everywhere night work was consideredundesirable and efforts had been made for many years to eliminate it in all activitieswhere it was not required for technical reasons. Double day-shift working hadusually been considered only so far as it had a bearing on night work legislation orpractice. It was -pointed out that the International Conventions&apos; on night work forwomen and young persons purposely defined night work in such a way as not tointerfere with double day-shift working in industry.Nevertheless, it was being recognised in various countries that double day-shiftarrangements, while causing less hardship than night work, resulted in not incon-siderable inconvenience- for the workers concerned. Therefore, for example, theCanadian Province of Ontario made the employment of women on double day-shiftsdependent on a previous permission by the authorities. In Switzerland such permitwas required for the employment - of workers without distinction of sex or age. Inthe United States, of America wage bonuses (&quot; shift differentials &quot;) were frequentlygranted for work performed between, specified evening (usually after 6 p.m.) andmorning hours, or for work performed during the second shift.(2) Official Sources- : MINISTRY OF FUEL AND power the Ministry of Fuel and Power was asked to what extent electric power or gaswas or was likely to be available to employers at cheaper rates in the event of theirworking the double day-shift system; and also for its general observations on theeffect as regards fuel economy of the adoption of this system in industry.In reply to the first question, the Ministry stated as regards electric power that,on the assumption that the inroduction of shift working did not result in an increaseof maximum demand, there would be a substantial improvement in the load factorand consequently in the average price payable under a two-part tariff. As regardsgas, no considerable saving was to be anticipated -because gas could, of course, bestored&quot; in large quantities and there was nothing really corresponding to ,the loadfactor in electric power productioa. In reply to the second part of the enquiry, theMinistry said that if increased shift working effected a reduction in the number of.units of production, the system would be likely to reduce total maximum demand from any individual industry. If, however, there was no reduction in the numberof factories but production was merely spread over longer hours, there was likely tobe increased consumption of fuel. Radiation and transmission losses would increase and during the winter months space heating of the factory would increase as would the lighting load. In addition, there would be an increase in the amount of fuelrequired for canteen and domestic cooking.MINISTRY OF SUPPLY       ....... -.Tihe Ministry of Supply said that they had toad little experience of double day-shift working since the Royal Ordnance Factories (Filling and Explosive) had been mainlyworking three shift systems, and the Engineering Ordnance Factories had for themost part been on day and night shift systems. They were able to supply statisticaldata as to absenteeism but this was limited by their experience being based on threeshift or day and night shift working.
%Absence figures for both men and women working three shifts tended to show ^-hat absence was highest for morning shift and lowest ori the afternoon shift with,-the figure for the night shift falling somewhere between the two.   On day and nightshifts there was remarkably little difference in the absence figures for the two shifts.They emphasised, however, that their experience ,of double day-shift working., had&quot;been too limited to allow any definite conclusions to be drawn from the evidence submitted.MINISTRY OF transport the Ministry of Transport stated that their main interest in double day-shift work-ing lay in the possible effect that an extension of this system would, have&quot; on the peakload and on workmen&apos;s fares. With regard to the former, the. result of a survey;taken in Lancashire and Cheshire in December, 1940, was taken as an illustrationand showed the waste of plant involved in the morning and evening peaks of passenger-travel. Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 41 p.m. nearly half the number of vehicles^available were not required for service. The following points were also brought out:  ,-- &apos; -.&apos;..-&apos;   -:;.:&apos;-&apos;      &apos;&apos;.ns\i.! (a) In the largest towns there was no.mid-day peak.(6) In the. smaller towns the mid-day peak was there but was smaller thaneither the morning or evening rush. .,;       (c) The evening peak was usually higher than was the morning because closing hours of works and offices often coincided. --With regard. to workmen&apos;s fares, it was pointed out that the obligation to issueworkmen&apos;s tickets was limited to specified hours and although this was modified in.many cases voluntarily to.meet the need of shift wofkers,. there would be real difBcul-.ties in the way of extending this should there be a great development of shift working.   - .....The Ministry put forward memoranda from three undertakings developing the&quot; points made above: a, (1) The Public Transport Association Incorporated. The Association thought thatit was important that local transport, operators should be consulted as soon as changesin. industrial working hours were contemplated and that if road transport services-were to be provided economically for the travelling public, working hours even on&quot;shifts should be staggered. Thirdly,. the Association-pressed for an early removal&apos; of the obligation to&apos; provide special workmen&apos;s tickets.(2) The Railway Companies. While it was considered that an extension of doubleday-shift /working would to a large extent even out load peaks on the railways, ithad to be emphasised that the effects of. shift working on railway problems would varyenormously according to different localities.. Assuming that double day-shift working would mean spreading work over a greater number of hours rather thanincreasing the capacity of manufacturing industries, the scheme should be advan-tageous in areas where there was density of travel with frequent train services. If,however, the extension of shift working involved an increase in the number of. workers employed in industry, it was probable that a third peak would develop inthe early afternoon. In this connection it was suggested that staggered hours ondouble day-shifts might be necessary:. If facilities for the issue of workmen&apos;s tickets were to continue under such a scheme,both railways and employers would be involved in an enormous amount of additional work. . The question as to who were to be entitled to wqrkmen&apos;s tickets would come: up for review, and with it the question of the appropriateness under present-dayconditions of continuing to make the distinction on which the system of war-timefares were based. ......: (3) London Passenger Transport Board. The Board pointed out that the per-centage of occupied population in the - Greater London area employed in manufacturing industry was probably considerably smaller than in typical&apos; industrial areas in the. provinces, and it therefore followed that in London the proportion- of traffic affectedby wider use of the double day-shift system would also be smaller.While much would-depend upon the actual incidence in different areas of the double-shift system, and upon the extent to which it became general in manufacturing industry,it seemed broadly speaking that the system, if widejy adopted, would confer benefits,v .\ (a) by easing, in some measure, the workmen&apos;s peak load on the fail and road-- services between 7.30 and 8 in the morning; &apos; ......!.. - (b) by easing, slightly, the ordinary, evening business peak between 5 and 7 pin.;&quot;(e) by easing, materially, the existing, peak, concentrations . on&apos; the road services&quot;in the outer industrial.areas; &apos;-i&apos;
(d) by securing a more effective use of vehicles and staff,. particularly in the,case of the-local suburban group of industrial travel. &apos;&apos;,&apos;-.-.&apos;-.,&apos; VThe tendency would &quot;be for travel to be a little more comfortable without, so far;as could be foreseen, economic disadvantage to the Board. Sporadic double-shiftingmight, however, have an adverse reaction of the Board&apos;s operations. On the otherhand, the proposal would bring to a head the question of the continuance of the presentsystem of workmen&apos;s fares; and the additional number of early and late turns of dutyamong transferred staff which increased double-shifting in industry would call for, might give rise to difficulties with the staff. In conclusion the. Board emphasised that the closest consultation between industry and transport was essential if double-shift workingwas to succeed.(3) Employers&apos; Organisations.BRITISH EMPLOYERS&apos; CONFEDERATION.The Confederation said that in response to an invitation from the Committee, to,give evidence the Confederation had arranged that evidence should be submitted by the-Employors&apos; Organisations, in the different industries and that the Confederation wouldthereafter consider how fax that evidence could usefully be supplemented. :The Confederation had had an opportunity. of reviewing the position in the light of&quot;the Evidence which those Organisations had, submitted to the Committee and saidthat, having regard to the detailed and comprehensive nature of that Evidence andthe fact that the Confederation^ views on this subject were already on&quot; record in?the Report of the 1935 Departmental Committee which had previously examined thematter, the Confederation felt that there was little it could usefully add to the informa-tion which was already before the Committee.    ,As the Committee was aware, the Confederation, in its evidence before the 1935.Departmental Committee, put forward various proposals designed to facilitate a wideradoption of the double day-shift system and some of those proposals had beenaccepted by that Committee and were subsequently given effect to in the 1936 Act.The 1935 Committee, however, did not see its way to recommend the adoption of thetwo main proposals which were put forward.by the Confederation, namely, that thelatest finishing hour for the second shift should be extended from to p.m. to it p.mand that the requirement under which the introduction of the system is made, dependentupon a ballot of the workpeople should be abolished.On the first proposal, the Confederation pointed out that an extension of the latestfinishing time by one hour would afford much greater flexibility in the arranging of theshifts; and they referred to the provision for an 11 p.m. finish in the InternationalLabour Convention; and said that other countries had taken full advantage of thatfacility.On the second- proposal, the Confederation expressed the view that the requirements for a compulsory ballot constituted one of the main.factors militating against the wideradoption of the system and pointed out that there was no other country in the worldwhere the workers were given an overriding right to determine whether or hot a doubleday-shift system of working should be instituted, or where the working of such a system was not provided for as a normal and integral part of the Factory legislation of thecountry..... . , . - - - ..The Confederation&quot;did not feel it necessary to reiterate all the arguments which.itput forward in support of that\proposal before&apos; the T935 Committee beyond saying thatthose arguments had since been reinforced by the Evidence submitted before&quot; the g.c.m.g.-mittee by the. individual Employers&apos; Organisations, and that the views which the confederation-expressed in 1935 as to the undesirability of this; country being&apos;.placed at a disadvantage with its foreign competitors on an important matter of this kindapplied with far greater force today when the most urgent problem before the country was an expansion of its production and exportstrade. &apos;.-The Confederation was convinced that its, proposals for abolishing the ballot,: coupled with an extension of the latest finishing hour to 11. p.m., would go fat to-remove the obstacles Which have hitherto prevented a wider, adoption of the.double -day-shift system and trusted that the Committee, with the&apos;.fuller information now before;it,-.wouldbe able to see its:Way to endorse those proposals.   . . &apos; .&quot;. ,--.-;.:v-       ni. .&apos;--&quot;.;; THE ALLIEp&apos;- ASSOCIATION. OF -BLEACHERS, DYERS,  PRINTERS, AND FINISHERS.- ij. The Association, stated that owing- to &quot;technical considerations which made-fixedhours&quot; impossible; and overtime provision,-essential in the &quot;industry, shift;&apos;Working wtanot unusual,, but was usually confined to: day. and night working.-&quot;&apos;- Three-shift workingWas quite exceptional.   The industry: recognised that the&apos;installation of further  pstiy
plant; etc., might be necessary in the future to maintain a level of production coats &apos;necessary for the building up of a large export trade and shift working by protectedpersons might be desirable in this connection. &apos;   &quot;GLASS MANUFACTURERS&apos; FEDERATION.The. Federation stated that they represented practically all the firms in the UnitedKingdom making glass (other than plate and sheet glass) &quot; from raw materials. 1 Theyurged strongly that double day-shift working should be extended to include male youngpersons aged 15 years or over. The statement was concerned with the melting of glass!from raw materials, a continuous process which had to be carried on by day and night.For technical reasons the glass had to be worked as soon as it was ready, and glassworkers had to be available at all times to undertake the necessary operations. Glass-makers, particularly in pressing and blowing glass, worked in teams, and it was important that the male young persons should be available all the time that adultskilled workers were employed. In addition, it was stressed that teamwork with skilled men enabled the boys to acquire the training necessary for them to become. skilledglass-makers themselves. It was also preferable that they should be taken on for.,training at the earliest age possible, especially as much of the work was suitable forboys rather than men. - If the glass industry were not allowed to employ those boyson shift work during the. day, it was probable that a large number of boys keen toenter the glass industry would/not do so. While thes school leaving age remained at 14they would have to find alternative employment for two years and then, providing that they-still wanted to train as glass workers, enter the industry at the bottom of theladder at the age of 16. The Federation asked that flexibiliy in hours of employment should. be considered, especially to assist the industry- in fitting in young persons&apos;attendance at County CoDeges within the framework of the shift system. In conclu-sipn, they made it. clear.that nothing in their statement wasto be taken as affectingthe position regarding the operating of emergency authorisations, the need for whichwould remain as long as the present shortage of labour continued.THE INSTITUTION OF BRITISH LAUNDERERS LTD./The Institution stated that double day-shift&apos;working in the Laundry Industry was mainly confined-&apos;.to emergencies,; as in ordinary times sufficient plant, machinery andspace were available for single shift working to be adopted as the normal procedure.It was thought, however; that the procedure laid down under the 1936 Act had toacertain extent militated against wider use of the system in the industry, and theInstitution considered that it.would be helpful if the procedure was simplified and the ballot abolished. . -If these modifications were made, more laundries might be willing to work thetwo-shift system, provided, of course, the necessary labour was available.(4) Individual Firms and Employers.MR. A. HAIGH. &quot;Mr. Alfred Haigh, Managing Director of Brittains Limited, Cheddleton, near Leek,Staffs, said that he had had experience of shift working in his factory a. paper mill.He made the point that shift working was usual in paper mills and that double day-shift working was desirable to cover temporary emergencies such as arise in connectionwith the development of a new product, and the fluctuations in demand, occasioned bythe export market, thus helping to avoid the capital expense of plant which might otherwise be frequently idle.MESSRS. FREDERICK MARSDEN LIMITED.: Mr. Marsden wrote putting certain suggestions before the Committee, He had runa double day-shift system at his mill-for some years between the wars, and proposedthat a representative Works Committee should be set up in every factory operatingthe double day-shift system to settle such matters as meal breaks, and the frequency of the changeover of shifts, etc. He also considered it desirable in order to facilitatelocal transport arrangements for the workers, that all works in any locality engaged on the double day-shift system should work the same hours; and proposed that allworks operating the system should be required to provide reasonable canteen-facilities.Lastly, he considered that ail Government Departments should be instructed notto dis-courage double day-shift working, which-in-his; opinion washecessary in the textile trade.if automatic looms were to (be run economically and our export trade developedsatisfactorily.
I - MESSRS. ROLAMATIC LTD., BIDEFORD, NORTH DEVON.. The Company proposed that the present limitation on double day-shift working andthe hoilrs 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. should be removed and greater elasticity in starting andfinishing times be permitted. The alternative hours of 8 a.m. to iz midnight were suggested as being more acceptable to the workers. In the first place it was consideredthat absenteeism was likely to be much less on a morning shift which began at 8 a.m.as workers would be able to get a normal quota of sleep and rest without beingdeprived of evening recreation. Secondly, the later, start would -enable workers to havea proper breakfast.before going to;work and to have other meals at reasonable hours..In addition under the present system the company whose works were situated in a country district where public transport services began late and finished early had toarrange for the workers&apos; transport when those services were not available. It wouldbe much simpler to arrange for works transport to take the workers home at the endof a late evening shift than to collect them at various points in the very early morning.;;;.;,&apos; .  MR. F. W. SPENCER, -&apos;-&quot;&apos;Mr. Spencer considered1 that a double day-shift system in the Drop Forging industry would benefit the health of the workpeople, but mentioned some difficulties experiencedwhen the system was practised in a particular factory for a short period in 1943 inconnection with travelling and wages.THE WELSH TINPLATE AND METAL STAMPING COMPANY.The Managing Director wrote that the advantages of double day-shift working werethe additional production per square foot area of the available space, and, above all,the fact that the double day-shift system lent itself to maximum mechanisation formaximum production. There was a tendency in the tin-plate and metal stampingindustry, as in others, for more expensive plant to be used and this made efficient use of plant -i ery important. Owing to technical considerations some processes in theindustry had to be carried on both day and night and it would be convenient if certainancillary processes, which were normally women&apos;s work, could be put on a 2-shift basisbecause although these processes were not of a continuous nature, carrying them on for16 hours instead of 8 hours a day would mean, among other things a reduction ofthe space used for working stocks,. It was stated that in America plant similar to that used by the firm had been found to occupy only a fraction of the area required by theCompany, and only employed 50-60 per cent, of the personnel required in England. &apos;The whole advantage was found to arise from the extensive application of double day-shift working. In addition, it was stressed that double day-shifts facilitated production by the conveyor or chain system.(5) General. ,THE MUNICIPAL PASSENGER TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION INCORPORATED.The Association considered that the effect of an extension of shift working on transport would vary according to the locality and stressed the importance of consul-tation with the local &quot;transport operator when any extension of shift working was proposed. They thought that a degree of staggering would be desirable, even on shiftwork; this again should be decided in consultation with the local transport operator.Such consultation would lead to a more economical use of a town&apos;s vehicles therewould be less waiting and over-crowding and improved arrangement of duties for transport workers.The Association also raised the question of workmen&apos;s fares. It was considered thatthis concession was no longer justifiable on the grounds upon which it was introduced;although some Local Authority Transport Committees would probably continue to allowworkmen&apos;s special rates even if they were not under any oBligation to do so. It was anticipated that transport operators would oppose vigorously any extension of workmen&apos;sfares to mid-day travel, and a demand for such an extension might of course beexpected to arise from the wider adoption of shift working.THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF GIRLS&apos; CLUBS AND MIXED CLUBS.The Association submitted a Memorandum of evidence collected from organisations and Leaders in different parts of the country, mainly in the principal industrial areas.On most of the questions opinion was divided, but it was possible to give a generalpicture, of the Associations feelings as a whole,.As. regards the social consequences which wider use of the double day-shift system. would-bring about, it was generally felt that the system would be hard on thehousewife, with different members of the family coming and going.at different times:

A point madeby several organisers was that leisure time activities would be affected; some thought the workers would have more time for outdoor sports. From the health point of view the Association stressed the importance of adequate transport facilities and; there was general agreement on the need for proper canteen facilities in the works. It was thought that the late shift would not have an adverse effect on health providing thattransport was improved and that the system did not continue over a period of years.On the early shift, it was considered that if the young persons&apos; health was not to suffer they would have to adjust their sleeping times.The Association stressed that double day-shift working would have serious effects on evening club work, although where it has been possible in their experience to keepthe clubs open during the day for shift workers, they had proved very popular. Therewere, however, many obstacles in the way of clubs being available at the times whenshift workers required them. Most of the premises used for the clubs were in useduring the day as schools, etc. The scheme would not be workable for clubs manned by voluntary staff.   Many more whole-time leaders and helpers would be required.
ANNEX ii report of Committee on Double Day-Shift WorkingDraft of suggested Government Statement at Time of Publication of Report&apos;The Government have given most earnest consideration to this Report. They-are convinced that, as the Report indicates, double day-shift working in industry will have to be much more widespread in this country if, under modern conditions governing efficient production and trade development, we are to maintain and improve our standard of living without widespread increases in the working hours of individuals which would otherwise be necessary to obtain sufficientproduction for that purpose. Indeed, an extension of this shift system wouldnot merely obviate increases in working hours but would, as the Committee pointout, make possible a more general reduction in working hours for the individualoperative than would otherwise be practicable. Incidentally, a more widespreaduse of it may well help, especially in the winter, to obviate night work for thepurpose of spreading the load on electrical stations.The Government also agree with the Committee that the wider adoption ofthe system which is desirable on economic grounds will depend on the workersbeing convinced that its social inconveniences to themselves can and will be offsetas far as possible by compensating benefits. The social disadvantages tend to diminish when a more substantial proportion of the community in any particular area works on this system; and the Government endorses the view of the Committeethat every effort should be made to adjust social and educational services to meetthe changed habits of the working population.It also becomes necessary to consider how the Factory Acts should be modified so that, while providing for all due safeguards for the health and welfare of the workpeople, they do not hamper the planning of industrial production on a two-shift basis or the progressive recognition of shift working as one of thenormal arrangements of working hours. At present, except for certain industries,shift working by employees other than adult men is treated in the Acts as some-thing so extraordinary that it is prohibited unless specially authorised by theMinistry of Labour for the particular factory. This is, on the face of it,inconsistent with the idea of a widespread use of the system; and the Governmentare not satisfied that there are sufficient reasons why the matter should not, sofar as the Factory Acts are concerned, be dealt with on the same lines as doubleday-shift working in the industries referred to above, namely, that special per-mission to adopt it is not legally required but that the firm must notify theFactory Inspector beforehand that the Minister can impose special conditions for protecting the health and welfare of women and young persons employed onthe system, over and above the limitations and conditions imposed by the Actitself. In practice, with the progressive organisation of industry and with full employment, a double day-shift system can hardly be adopted or continued unlessthe general run of the workpeople concerned in the factory are willing to work it;and it is not clear that it is necessary, nowadays, to keep the present extraordinarylegal obstacles to shift working. The Government propose to consult the national joint Advisory Council for Industry on this point and also as regards the morning and evening time limits within which shift working should be madelegal. The latter point is of considerable importance since the advantages to industry and to the nation of double day-shift working would be greatlydiminished if it entailed a disproportionate reduction of the hours for whichplant can be worked.
