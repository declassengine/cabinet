11 Ifl 186(THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)&apos;SECRETCP. (U7)  18113th June,  19U7.COPY NO.3)CABINETELECTRICITY SUPPLY NATIONALISATION bill memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Fuel and power in accordance with the conclusions reached by the Cabineton the 11th March, 1947,  (0.11.(1+7) 27th Conclusions, Minute 4),I announced during the Committee Stage of the Electricity bill that a global sum of  5 millions would be made available to localauthorities whose electricity undertakings were acquired underthe Electricity Bill as compensation for the severance of the  .electricity undertaking from the remainder of the local -authorityorganisation.      In the course of . ray statement I emphasised thatwhile the Government regarded the. loss of contributions fromelectricity undertakings towards central establishment charges asthe most substantial part of the claim which local authorities had made for additional compensation, that item alone would not,in the Government&apos;s view,  justify the payment of  5 millions which,accordingly should be taken to cover all other related items.2. During the debate which followed and on other subsequentoccasions outside Parliament, the  5 millions has been challengedon behalf&apos;of local authorities as being quite inadequate to cover the losses which they will suffer.      The criticisms which havebeen advanced by Associations representing;local authorities(e.g.  the Association of Municipal Corporations and theIncorporated Municipal Electrical Association) have centred mainly on the contentions;-that while  1 million per annum may be a fair estimateof the total annual central establishment charges,made by electricity undertakings of local authorities,a large proportion of these charges (being in respectof salaries) will continue for a much longer period than five years;that even assuming  5 millions is a generous allowance to cover central establishment charges,  practically,nothing is left to cover other items in respect ofwhich local authorities will suffer loss - particularlyincome tax set-off which is substantial and debtmanagement charges which will remain a liability formany years. ( \The first of these criticisms I consider to beunjustified.      Many overhead expenses comprised in establishmentcharges can probably be eliminated speedily and even assuming thatothers could not be extinguished within less than,  say,  ten years,it does not seem that an average period of five years is unreasonable.(a)003.-1-
18?4* There is,  I believe,, more justification for the second,criticism.      The balance of the  5 millions remaining afterprovision has been made for central establishment charges cannotbe considerable and is certainly likely to be small in relation tothe relief of rates arising out of income tax set-off.      The&apos;circumstances determining the degree of benefit from income taxset-off vary so widely from authority to authority and from.yearto. year that it is difficult to form any reliable estimate of theprobably sums involved, but sample tests taken in the Ministry and outside it suggest that the average sum is&quot; not less than  1 million per annum.      On this basis it becomes of equal importance to centralestablishment charges in the eyes of the authorities.      The effecton individual authorities is illustrated, by the following examplesamong those brought to my notice:-Local Authority X^ar Tax set-off     Equivalent rate  d.  in  Bolt on 191+5/6 10,395 2-1-Ealing &quot; 13,397 2.&apos;High Wycombe                 &quot; 18,931). 14:Leyton Average 10 years 8,500 3Liverpool                    1945/6 84,100 3Rochdale                     1944/5 7,500 3iSheffield Average 10 years 31,000 2f5* During the discussions between the Ministry and the twoAssociations it became apparent that though local authoritiesrecognise reluctantly that additional compensation should not begiven in respect of direct contributions from trading undertakings to the rate fund,  they hold the view very strongly that adequatecompensation should be forthcoming for income tax set-off.      Theydraw a distinction between rate contributions and tax set-off on two points;    firstly,  that the sums involved in tax set-off are much larger and nore widely spread,  and secondly,  that tax set-offis an automatic benefit under the law and not a reflection ofdeliberate local policy as is rate relief.      They stress, moreover,that some local authorities have enjoyed that advantage since 1911and that as a result of long and expensive litigation they succeeded in obtaining an unrestricted right of set-off for all localauthorities under the Finance (No.   2) Act,  1945.6. The two Associations have urged most strongly that theelectricity debt management expenses are directly related to. thenet debt of the undertaking and are not in any way connected withestablishment charges or severance.      These expenses, which includeactual disbursements,  such as stamp duty,  amount to appreciablesums annually - (in the case of Liverpool to  4,500) - andconstitute a liability which will not be discharged finally for anumber of years.      In these circumstances local authorities contend that the liability for debt management should be taken over by thenew central authority with the net debt.      This claim should,I recommend, be admitted whatever may be decided in regard to the global sum - its rejection would rankle with local authorities for years.7. On the question of an increase in the global sum,  itemerged from the discussions referred to above that if  10 millionscould be made available,  the Associations felt that they couldensure its acceptance by local authorities to cover all losses withthe exception of the direct expenses of debt management.      so strong,  however,  are their feelings on the inadequacy of  5 millionsthat I am convinced that unless some worthwhile concession is madeto municipal authorities (whose.assets the new British Electricity   ^
Authority is in any case acquiring on very advantageous terms),there is likely to be serious trouble during the Report Stage and indeed as was the case during the Report Stage of the transport bill,  strong pressure will be exerted on the Minister to withdraw the Clause for reconsideration.8. On the other hand the sum for which they ask is only fiveper cent,  of the figure for which local authority electricity undertakings are &quot;being acquired and an even smaller percentageof their value.      The effect of granting an addition of  5 millions to the global sum would merely increase the interest chargespayable &quot;by the British Electricity Authority by  125,000 per annum,a trifling sum in relation to the annual expenditure and revenue of the new authority.      In these circumstances I feel &quot;bound tobring the matter to the notice of my colleagues and recommend thelocal authorities&apos;  case for sympathetic consideration.E.S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1.13th June,  19U7.
