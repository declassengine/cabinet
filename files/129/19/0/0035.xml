(57) 18523rd June, 1947CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 1st May (CM. (47) 42ndConclusions, Minute 6), the Minister of Supply on 13th May, gave the president and Chairman of the Iron and Steel Federation (Mr. Ellis Hunter and Sir AndrewDuncan respectively,) a general indication of the scope and nature of the Govern-ment proposals for public ownership in the iron and steel industry. They sub-sequently sought an interview with the Prime Minister, who saw them on21st May. The Prime Minister asked the Socialisation of Industries Committeeto advise the Cabinet on the issues raised by the -representatives of the federation in their discussion with him.2. The essence of the representations made to the Prime Minister was thatthe Government should explore the possibility of formulating a scheme as analternative to immediate and comprehensive public ownership which would secure the broad objectives of Government policy, but at the same time -retain the benefits accruing from the willing co-operation of the industry. Such ascheme would&apos;envisage the assumption by the Government of permanent statutory control over &quot;the industry and, where necessary, a measure of Government financialparticipation or even of full ownership of individual concerns.3. At a meeting on 18th June the Socialisation of Industries committee considered a paper by the Minister of Supply on this subject (S.I. (M) (47) 25)which is appended to this memorandum. In that paper the Minister recommendedthat the drafting of legislation to give effect to the comprehensive scheme approved by the Cabinet should proceed, but that confidential discussions shouldbe pursued with the Iron and Steel Federation as to the possibility of analternative scheme, which would have to go much further than the tentativeproposals suggested by the Federation, but which would avoid a sustained andbitter controversy with the iron and steel industry,4. The Socialisation of Industries Committee are still convinced that the comprehensive scheme put forward by the Minister of Supply and approved bythe Cabinet on 28th April is soundly conceived, though not free from difficulties.Nevertheless, the Committee feel that, provided there is no interruption in the drafting of the legislation to give effect to the full scheme as approved by theCabinet, nothing would be lost, by arranging for discussions with the federation in order to ascertain how far the industry could be brought to meet the Govern-ment standpoint. In arriving at this conclusion the Committee have been influenced by the following considerations : (a) Under threat of a scheme of immediate public ownership the Federationhas moved a considerable distance from the intransigent attitudepreviously taken up, and any outright rejection of the Federation^overtures would play into the hands of the Opposition, since it would[33793] B
. be said that the Government had brushed aside any suggestion of discussions on possible alternative arrangements with the industry&apos;s&apos;    representatives. ,(b) If large sections of the industry were transferred immediately to public ownership, the process of transfer (particularly if carried throughin an atmosphere of bitter controversy) would absorb much time andenergy; and there is the risk that current steel output would be lostat a critical time and vital modernisation schemes delayed,(c) It might be possible to secure arrangements which, while hot going tothe lengths of immediate and comprehensive public ownership, woukL.nevertheless go a, substantial way towards fulfilling the policy,objectives and political commitments of the Government, and which,       would in effect constitute a first step on the road to full public ownership.5.   Accordingly the Socialisation of Industries Committee recommend tothe Cabinet that: (1) The drafting of legislation to give effect to the comprehensive scheme approved by the Cabinet should continue to be pressed forward.(2) A Minister or Ministers should be deputed by the Prime Minister tohave confidential discussions with the Federation representatives, inorder to give the latter an opportunity Of developing their ideas asto a possible alternative scheme: &apos;6. The Minister or Ministers deputed to undertake these discussions shouldnot be given specific and detailed instructions.&apos; In particular the summary ofa possible alternative scheme given in paragraph 8 of the Minister of Supply&apos;s paper (S.I. (M) (47) 25) should be regarded as illustrative only. The ministers concerned should, however, be guided by the knowledge that any alternative scheme, to be acceptable to the Government, would have to satisfy the followingessential conditions: (i) Effective power over the industry must pass, and must be seen to pass,from the Federation to the Government. There must be an end ofthe present state of affairs under which the Federation exercises widegeneral powers independently of the State,(ii) The responsible Minister must be able, without the necessity of further legislation, to transfer to public ownership any undertakings withinthe industry where this is necessary in the public interest.(iii) The Government should, at an early stage, assume total Or partial owner-ship of some substantial assets in the industry, e.g., over the SouthWales scheme. (Indeed, this might possibly be extended to provide that the Government should as far as practicable finance and own all new major development schemes.)(iv) It should be made clear in the discussions that the Government&apos;s policyremained one of.bringing appropriate sections of the industry underfull public ownership., The discussions must be based on a recognitionof that fact and on the understanding that what was in question wasthe timing and the stages at which that objective could be achieved.7. The Socialisation of Industries Committee agreed that if the; cabinet approved the procedure outlined above, the Minister of Supply should explainconfidentially to representatives of the T.U.C. that the Federation have asked the Government for an opportunity of putting forward alternative proposals forthe Government^ consideration, and that it was proposed to agree that they shouldbe given such an opportunity.-   H.

APPENDIX[S.I. (M) (47) 25][5th June, 1947]CABINETCommittee on Socialisation of IndustriesPUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum by the Minister of supply.-introduction. In accordance with the authority given by the Cabinet on 1st May, I gave the President and Chairman of the Iron and Steel Federation (Mr; Ellis Hunterand Sir Andrew Duncan) on 13th May a general indication of the scope and nature of the Government proposals for public ownership in the iron and steelindustry. They subsequently asked for an interview with the Prime Minister,who, together with the Lord President and myself, saw them on 21st May. ThePrime Minister has&quot; asked me to report to the Committee on that discussion sothat the Committee can advise the Cabinet on the issues raised by the Federationrepresentatives.2. A verbatim report was taken of the discussion with the Prime Minister,but this is too lengthy a document for circulation. I give in Appendix I a selection of passages from it which show the substance of the representations made.  These can be summarised as follows :-(a) A scheme as far-reaching as that now proposed by the Government would inevitably give rise to great controversy and a consequent diversion ofthe industry&apos;s energies from concentration on the immediate tasks inhand. The result would be a most unfortunate set-back in the modernisation of the steel industry and in the maintenance of full production at a very critical time.(b) The Government scheme would leave untouched certain sections of theindustry (e.g*, the iron foundries and drop forgers) which were particularly in need of modernisation and supervision, and would not therefore achieve the declared objective of the effective reorganisa-tion of the iron and steel industry. At the same time acquisition of selected companies, with all their varied interests in and beyond thefinishing sections of the iron and steel industry, would carry public ownership a long way beyond the Government^ declared intention ofnationalising sections of that industry, or, in so far as their extraneousinterests were detached from the State-owned industry, Would breakacross the valuable degree of integration achieved in recent years between the steel industry and the general engineering industry.(c) There would be no single body controlling the whole industry, since theauthority responsible for the State-owned companies could hardly be* given powers over the companies left in private ownership.(cT) The industry fully accepted the need for complete and effective Govern-ment policy control, and, where necessary, a measure of government financial participation or even of full ownership. It should be possiblefor Government to achieve on these lines a satisfactory alternative scheme which would in essence secure the broad objective of Govern-[33793] c
ment policy, and at the same time retain the benefits accruing fromthe willing co-operation of the industry. Under such a scheme theIron and Steel Board wodid be given statutory control (includingpowers of direction) over the industry and would be given the ri^ht(subjectto the concurrence of the Minister) either to insist on financialparticipation in, or even compulsorily to acquire, iron and steel com-i panies where necessary.  (It appears doubtful whether theKlderatibncontemplate the use of powers of cbmpulsory acquisition,except where necessary to facilitate new development.)3. The Prime Minister undertook that the representations made on behalfof the Federation would be considered,and that he would then have a further discussion with Mr. Ellis Hunter arid Sir Andrew Duncan.II. Comments on the Federation^ Representations4. There is no doubt that legislation providing for a comprehensive public ownership scheme on the lines approved by the Cabinet will give rise to moresustained and bitter opposition than any socialisation measure hitherto intro-duced. This will be a frontal assault on a citadel of industrial power: and theopposition will be the more bitter in that the industry has been led by Sir AndrewDuncan to expect that any government scheme would fall substantially short of complete ownership. A period of controversy, uncertainty and administrativereadjustment undoubtedly involves the risk of a serious slowing up of essentialmodernisation schemes (or everi perhaps-bringing some of them, e.^., the newSouth Wales plan, to a standstill) and of losses in current steel production, especi-ally in cases where production is being riiairitairied bylabnqrriial measures, takenby steel-producing companies under pressure from the Federation It is imposrsibie to quantify what may be involved, but We must face the fact; that there issubstance in the warning given by Mr. Ellis Hunter and Sir Andrew Duncan aridthat the effect on the national economy may be serious. In this connection theCommittee may be interested to read a personal letter on this subject which I received from the Chairman of the Iron and Steel Board (Sir Arehibal4 Forbes),This is given as Appendix II.5. The Federation^ criticisms of the Government scheme (i.e., those at (b)arid (c) iri paragraph 2 above) have some substance. Our proposal to acquireselected companies lock stock and barrel will involve public ownership of assets and interests lying outside the central core of the.iron and steel industry andtherefore goes beyond the proposals as tentatively indicated to Parliament lastyear: But this is an inevitable consequence of the procedure which we propose;in practice the difficulties should be mitigated to.a limited extent by the &quot; hivingoff &quot; of extraneous assets and interests.It is the case also that under the Government scheme unified control of theindustry as exercised by the present Iron and Steel Board will not be maintained.The new Board would own the central core of the industry, while other sectionsleft in private ownership would be subject only to such general Governmentalsupervision as may be exercised over industry generally. This division will giverise to some :difficulties, but they, should not be-serious.     -  *      ;III. Thei Issue Involved6. I am clear that it is not possible to make mirior modifications in ourscheme which would meet the Federation&apos;s representations. The issue is thereforewhether (a) we are to tell the.Federation that Government, reject their argumentsand will proceed with the approved scheme; or (b) we should explore the possibilityof some alternative arrangements, falling short of immediate and comprehensivepublic ownership;. which would give us most of.1( our objectives and which theindustry could be brought to accept or which, ,^ould reduce ^the field of controversy.Ariy discussipiis.with the Federation asto (b) would, of :couree, j^ave to be onthe basis that the, preparation of a Bill giving effect to, the scheme already approved by the Cabinet was, being pursued) but that the Government was,nevertheless, prepared to enter upon confidential discussions: with the federation to see whether any alternative scheme could be worked out which would be acceptable to. Government and at the same time less open to; object ion on thepart of the Federation and. the industry.7; I have given this question a great deal of thought. Sir Andrew Duncanwas deliberately vague in nis references to the alternative arrangements which
he envisaged; and in so far as he referred to the Federation^ acceptance of the -principle of public control Over the industry he was probably thinking of anarrangement not very dissimilar from pre-war (I.D.A.C.) lines under whichessential power would remain in Steel House. &apos; ,   .i; Clearlywe could not contemplate a compromise on such a basis. any alternative scheme would, in my judgment, have to satisfy three essentialconditions:-! &apos;   (a) Effective power over the industry must pass, and must be seen to pass,. from,the Federation to Government. ?&quot; ;;&apos;    (&amp;) The responsible Minister must be able, without further reference toParliament, to transfer to public ownership any companies within: the industry where this is necessary in the public interest.(c) Government should at an early stage assume a total Or partial ownership of some substantial assets in the industry, e.gT, over the g. Wales, scheme.      ...      . &apos;     &apos;&apos;: 8.   I set out below a summary of an alternative scheme (which, of course,would still involve legislation) designed to fulfil these conditions :^-(a) The Minister of Supply would be given permanent statutory powers ofcontrol over all sections of the iron and steel industry.;     (&amp;) These powers would constitute a permanent continuation of the emer-gency powers, mainly under Defence Regulation 55, at present vested1 - ,   in the Minister.   They would include the power to regulate or* i prohibit the production, treatment; distribution, disposal, acquisition,use or consumption, &amp;c;, of any iron and steel products; to controls . ,i  &quot;    the prices of all such products; to require information to be furnished:;; ^y;;;and to give&apos; directions as to the manner in which iron and steel-    undertakings should be carried on.(c) The powers would be exercised on behalf of the Minister by a new statutory Iron and Steel Board charged with the responsibility of,   ensuring the continuous development of the industry towards greater efficiency and the optimum size required by overall national needs.(d) All capital developments within the industry (He:, defined as all schemeslist&apos; .     costing above a certain sum) wOuld have to be referred to the board for approval.(e) AH proposals to raise new capital (beyond a definite limit), to amalgamate: :   &quot;     companies or to dispose of substantial fixed assets would be subject to approval by the Board. ..        ,(/) The Minister would be given the power to appoint directors fo the boards of iron and steel companies where, after consultation with the, Board,- &apos; he was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in theinterests of main-iteming,production, securing the execution of apprpyed development, schemes, or facilitating compliance with instructions given by the&apos; Board. .      :.;.:(.;.   ,X&apos; .V.&apos;;-v:;,v-:&apos;   (g) The Board would have authority to engage either directly or throughagents or subsidiaries in the import or production of iron ore, pig-ironand any iron and steel products, tp promote companies for this purpose and to buy or sell fixed assets with the approval of the^ Minister.(A) In pursuance of the foregoing authority the Board would take over from&apos;. ;   *,   fine Federation the British Iron and Steel Corporation and the other,  i.  executive agencies which at present operate as agents for the.ministry in the import oi scrap and steel and in disposing of surplus iron or steel materials.  The Board, would also take over from the FederationV  1     all the internal executive,functions which Steel House at present carryout vis-a-vis the industry in the sphereiof Government control (togetherwith&apos;;- the necessary machinery of advisory committees, j&amp;c, through which consultation with the industry is maintained). All directions tpthe industry would flow directly from - the Board, all statistical information would be furnished direct to it.  It would have to be partof the agreement with the. Federation that they would facilitate: thetransfer to the -Board, of the expert personnel comprising the produce;      tion planning sections; the costings and prices section^ and the. statistical service of the Federation. -M.,   (i) The Minister, pn, the recommendation of the Board, would have the powercompulsorily to acquire in whole or in part the securities of any-    [33793] : . - c 2
tw rUMmgod; and in so far as he referred to the Federation^ acceptance of the &quot;principle of public control over the industry he was probably thinking of anrangecoent not very dissimilar from pre-war (I.D.A.C.) lines under whichmmtial power would remain in Steel House.Clearly we could not contemplate a compromise on such a basis. any alternative&quot; scheme would, in my judgment, have to satisfy three essentialconditions: (a) Effective power over the industry must pass, and must be seen to pass,from the Federation to Government.(6) The responsible Minister must be able, without further reference toParliament, to transfer to public ownership any companies withinthe industry where this is necessary in the public interest,(c) Government should at an early stage assume a total or partial ownership of some substantial assets in the industry, e.g., over the S. Walesscheme.8.   I set out below a summary of an alternative scheme (which, of course,would still involve legislation) designed to fulfil these conditions :-(a) The Minister of Supply would be given permanent statutory powers ofcontrol over all sections of the iron and steel industry.(6) These powers would constitute a permanent continuation of the emer-gency powers, mainly under Defence Regulation 55, at present vested in the Minister. They would! include the power to regulate orprohibit the production, treatment, distribution, disposal, acquisition,use or consumption, i&amp;c, of any iron and steel products; to control the prices of all such products; to require information to be furnished;;and to give directions as to the manner in Which iron and steelundertakings should be carried on.(c) The powers would be exercised1 on behalf of the Minister by a new statutory Iron and Steel Board charged with the responsibility of ensuring the continuous development of the industry towards greater efficiency and the optimum size required by overall national needs.(d) All capital developments within the industry (i.e., defined as all schemescosting above a certain sum) would have to be referred to the board for approval.(e) All proposals to raise new capital (beyond a definite limit), to amalgamatecompanies or to dispose of substantial fixed assets would be subject to approval by the Board.(/) The Minister would be given the power to appoint directors to the boards of iron and steel companies where, after consultation with the Board,he was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in the interests of main-taining production, securing the execution of approved development schemes, or facilitating compliance with instructions given by theBoard.(g) The Board would have authority to engage either directly or throughagents or subsidiaries in the import or production of iron ore, pig-ironand any iron and steel products, to promote companies for this purpose and to buy or sell fixed assets with the approval of the. Minister.(h) In pursuance of the foregoing authority the Board would take over fromthe Federation the British Iron and Steel Corporation and the otherexecutive agencies which at present operate as agents for the. ministry in the import of scrap and steel and in disposing of surplus iron or steel materials. The Board, would also take over from the Federationall the internal executive functions which Steel House at present carryout vis-a-vis the industry in the sphere of Government control (togetherwith the necessary machinery of advisory committees, j&amp;e., through which consultation with the industry is maintained). All directions tothe industry would flow directly, from the Board, all statistical information would be furnished direct to it. It would have to he partof the agreement with the Federation that they would facilitate thetransfer to the Board of the expert personnel comprising the produc-tion planning sections, the costings and prices section, and the statistical service of the Federation.(i) The Minister, on the recommendation of the Board, would have the powercompulsorily to acquire in whole or in part the securities of any[33793] c 2
company within the industry in circumstances when he considered itnecessary to do so in order to secure :- 1      .(1) the efficient execution of any modernisation and development schemes which the Board considered to be in the national interest, having regard to social, economic, and strategic considerations;(2) the liquidation, amalgamation or expansion of companies engaged- in iron and steel production;(3), the production of iron and steel products in types, quantities.or at prices best calculated to serve the national interest;(4) ready compliance with any instructions issued from time to time bythe Board.(j) Any securities compulsorily acquired would be taken over at a price to beagreed, or failing agreement, on a basis to be determined by arbitrationas being a fair price between a willing buyer and a willing seller at a specified date, due regard being made to any market quotations of the securities at that date.(k) Inasmuch as the Board would in any event be directly engaged in trading operations and might be operating substantial steel interests, special arrangements would have tobe made for its financing. These wouldhave to be worked out with the Treasury.(I) The scheme should also provide for the possibility of Government financingand ownership (either in whole or in part) of any substantial self-contained new development schemes. In order to secure some degreeof public ownership from the start, the possibility should be explored^of the Government financing and either owning wholly or obtaining a majority equity interest in the new S. Wales scheme, on the basis that the new Steel Company would operate the scheme as its agents.IY.^conclusion.   The question of whether we should pursue with the Federation thediscussion of a possible alternative scheme on the lines proposed must depend on,our judgment as to (i) the intrinsic merits or demerits of the scheme as set out in paragraph 8above;(ii) the effect, at a critical time, on Government relations with industry in-  general of a period of acute controversy over steel;(iii) the risk of a setback at such a time in current steel production, and inthe execution of the modernisation schemes, involving the danger ,ofunemployment through steel shortages; &apos;(iv) the tactical advantage of our avoiding the criticism that we chose to go ahead with our scheme without even agreeing to discuss the pos-sibility of alternative arrangements.10. A revised scheme oh the lines summarised in paragraph 8 would go con-siderably further than Sir Andrew Duncan&apos;s tentative proposals, even though,inasmuch as they contemplate some degree of public ownership, the latter go further than anything that we have yet heard from the industry itself. I amby no means sure that the Federation could be brought to accept such a revised scheme. But in my view we ought not to consider less. If, on the other hand,we could secure the full implementation of such a scheme, it would, I think, goa long way towards fulfilling the policy objectives which have governed our case for public ownership. There would be a manifest, effective and far-reachingtransfer of power from the Federation to Government: we should avoid theprospect of a setback in current steel production and in the execution of the modernisation schemes which otherwise, I fear, would be involved if the fullscheme is carried out, and which would come when our economic problems arelikely to be at their most difficult. My judgment is, therefore, that it will be right not to reject outright the idea of an alternative scheme, but to be preparedto consider arrangements On the lines summarised in paragraph 8 above in lieu of the approved scheme.11. I therefore propose that the Committee should recommend to theCabinet :-(a) that drafting of the legislation to give effect to the scheme at present approved by the Cabinet should proceed; but that
(b) confidential discussions should be pursued with the Federation as to thepossibility of an alternative scheme on the lines summarised in para-graph 8 above, with a view to a further report to the Cabinet as soonas possible on the possible outcome of such discussions.12. In the foregoing paragraphs I have referred only to two possible courses, both of which would envisage legislation next session. I have done so on the assumption that some early action on iron and steel must be regarded as essential and that the third possibility namely, to defer legislation until theeconomic situation has improved but in the meantime to keep our hands free is not open to us.&apos;.&quot;  &apos; J. W.Ministry of Supply,3rd June, 1947APPENDIX IExtracts from Verbatim Report of Discussion with the Prime minister on 21st May, 1947All Statements are by Sir Andrew Duncan unless otherwise stated1. SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : As we understood it from the Minister ofSupply, last August the Government was; thinking on the lines of securing whatwas called then effective Government policy control,&quot; either by participation insome of the principal companies or by a combination of the Control Board andsome participation in some of the companies, and we believed it might be possibleto work out a scheme that would be workable and at the same time would carrysome measure, of enthusiasm and certainly co-operation. The proposal that isbeing thought of now is one that seems to us to cut across all these possibilities,and does not in fact give what in the debate and! in the resolution you weresetting out to do, viz., an opportunity,,of organising the efficiency of the whole range of the iron and steel industry by participating in public ownership incertain appropriate sections of the industry. The proposal now is to take overall the securities of a selected number of firms I assume they will be the largefirms-irrespective of whether these firms operate not only in iron and steel but other divisions of industry as well. Perhaps I might take the case of DormanLong just as an example, of which Mr. Ellis Hunter is at present Chairman.There is a firm With four works&apos;in South Africa. They are engaged in manyforms of engineering, but principally constructional engineering and in bridge-building, and they have contracts at the present time for bridges in Egypt, andfor a power station in South Africa, and for the reconstruction of the .Harbour. The four works in South Africa have been built up over a long periodof years, and they have also works in Buenos Aires. That is really only oneinstance of many undertakings that would be in the selected list which have probably almost as many activities in branches of engineering as they have in steel, and this therefore would not be public ownership of appropriate sectionsof the steel industry, but it would be public ownership of a number of firms ifthey were engaged in far more than iron and steel. Neither would it be a step towards&apos;the efficient organisation of the industry because you would be taking over such sections of the industry as were covered in part by these firms whichhave well-organised sections, for which we have an industry plan which the steel Board has worked out excellently.I think as far as1 profits (? progress) are concerned, 66 per cent, of thescheme of the Ministry of Supply in the industry plan has already been approved,and much of it is well under way, and that is very remarkable progress, but itWould do something worse than cutting across that, it would have the effect, inmy judgment and! think you would probably agree, of taking us into the realmof controversy in a very much wider field of iron and steel without doing anything to effect the proper organisation of the iron and steel industry, because therewould be many sections of the iron and steel industry, such as iron and steelcastings, which are the least organised. Some are not in our ^Federation; someof them would come in but we would not take them in until certain things had
been done.   Nobody can pretend that these large sections of the industry are well-organised, and nothing in these proposals would be affecting them.The proposal put to you shortly, Prime Minister, is this:. Do let us see whether it is not possible to satisfy the primary objective of effective government policy control by a method that would harness enthusiasm in this industry, whichbelieves fundamentally in national planning. We make no quarrel about thatat all, we believe in that . . . .PRIME MINISTER: Everybody does now., SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: We have practised it already. We go a stepfurther than to believe in it; we have practised it in the past&quot;and are ready to practise it to the full now, and it may well be, and I can conceive it would possibly be, that you would have to give the Board powers to acquire or toparticipate in shareholdings in cases where they felt it was necessary in orderto facilitate and effect the best ultimate organisation, but there would be a majorevolution about that which would carry its own conviction as the necessities arose,and in any case we should regard it as necessary for you to have legislationbecause the powers under which the Steel Board operates now are of a temporarycharacter, and we always have accepted the view that if you are going to havea Steel Board it should be a permanent control board and its powers should bethorough. We do not make reservations there: the powers of the Board shouldbe thorough; it should be an effective policy control, and therefore you wouldrequire to have legislation. in any event, and this would be just a variation ofother patterns of operation. I hope you will believe me, Prime Minister, when, I say we are eschewing politics altogether in this matter.PRIME MINISTER : Quite.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Because we do take the view in steel that industryolanning, industry organisation, is fundamental for this country if it is going;o retain its position as one of the leading exporting countries of the world. Wejelieve there is a tremendous amount to be gained, and we have experienced whatis to be gained from the leading people in the industry viewing not only theirown affairs but viewing the relationship of their company to the whole industryand trying to plan on the basis of an industry. We have been doing that all along. When I say &quot;all along &quot; I mean since I have been connected with steel,ever since 1934^-35, and had there been no war I think it would have been foundwe had put ourselves into first-class condition. We do not go back to the con-troversies of the thirties, when, whatever the reason may have been, all industry had got into the dumps, and certainly steel had suffered dreadfully in the latetwenties and early thirties, but since the 1932-33 period it has been the definiteaim of the iron &quot;and steel industry to adapt itself to public considerationsrecognising that it is not only at the base of peace operations, but it is at the base of war operations, and I venture to say, and I think all the Ministers would agree with me, that it was fortunate that in war we had organised as we hadorganised before the war, and made it possible to do things that were not done inthe last war without tremendous struggles, and were not as well done in the firstwar as they were in the last war. There it is. We are not asking you to meet us to-day in any provocative spirit at all. We are genuinely striving to see whether there is not enough common ground to enable this industry to rally itsenthusiasm and all its capacity to a real effort in getting a fundamental industryinto the highest state of efficiency and organisation, and for that we accept fully .the need for effective Government policy control over it. We believe that in so faras questions of ownership arise they do hot arise in the abstract, in our judgment,and when you merely treat them in the abstract, in this way, in our judgmentyou get into all sorts of controversy at a period when, after all, Prime Minister,&quot;you yourself and other leading Ministers have been calling for united effort, andwe are here to give united effort, and we are anxious therefore that you should consider this matter from that point of view, and if questions of ownership arise in course of time, as they may well arise, it may well be that there will becircumstances where, as the Minister of Supply said to us, there is a philosophicdoubt as to whether it is right and proper to knock people about without being prepared to stand the financial racket, and there may be, in the evolution of theplan, occasions when the Board or the Minister thought the only right and properthing to do was to take a participation or even an acquisition of property, but fin those cases the circumstances would be known and would carry their ownconviction, and it then would be clear to everybody that the thing was being done from the point of view of efficiency and not from the point of view of some doubt. ....
2112. SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: If you are doing the right thing you will bb&apos;doing something which will evoke popular enthusiasm, and the sooner it can bedone the better, but if you are doing something which is going to stir up con^troversy over a wide field this is a bad time to do it .... to introduce into thiscountry to-day, Prime Minister, the controversy that would be raised at a timewhen we are wanting 100 per cent, co-operation everywhere, and to widen the controversy, as would be done, I think would be a dreadful set-back for thecountry . ; . *. I think I ought to say, to supplement what I have said in answer to your question-and the Minister of Supply will confirm this-y-that in spite ofthe uncertainty during the last ten months we have not failed in any respect to push on with our plan.LORD PRESIDENT : Since your report last year?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: Yes, we have pushed on, we have not allowedany question of what would happen to impede us from forging ahead, and wehave done it for this reason, that we believe, whatever happens in this country,it is in the interests of the country that you should have an efficient steel industry,and therefore we have pushed ahead. So I would say, in answer to your question,that I would rather take time to see whether it was not possible to find a basis for full co-operation than speedily to enunciate a policy which would be boundof itself, apart altogether from people&apos;s desires to be controversial and to quarrel,to raise issues which would be unsettling. Take, for instance, the question of taking over these companies. The Minister of Supply, of course, did say thatthe question of disentangling would be considered at a later date, but you cannot start disentangling without, the possibility of breaking, and without having roused considerable bitterness of feeling before you have done, and you cannot do it without doing something which is even worse, Prime Minister,and that is this: As we understand integration, not only within the steelindustry, but integration between the steel industry and the engineering industry,that has been one of the tremendous advantages this country has had over thelast ten or fifteen years ....Mb. ELLIS HUNTER: Particularly on the export side.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Particularly on the export side-1 was goingto give Dorman Long as an example. That has been a tremendous advantage.It is what the Americans do. It is the right movement. It is a moVeinent soas to eliminate intermediate costs. It is a movement which gives control ofraw material, and quality from the foundation, and the advantages therefor of having an interwoven industry, wider even than steel, are so great that todo anything to impede that, as this would do, would in my judgment be for thecountry a serious handicap to our export trade. Jmt even in regard to our home trade it would be bad ....3. PRIME MINISTER : Your view, as I understand it, would be that you would set up some method of control, but actual public ownership would be confined to particularly difficult units which would not otherwise get into line,is that it? . &apos;- , . .&quot;   . ; &apos;SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Yes, and I think also there might be occasions when on policy the Government might want a certain side of the industry cateredfor; that would be within the ordinary commercial enterprise, and that one mightwant to associate with them, and it is perfectly proper they should take a holding in it, but there may Well be cases-1 should hope there would not, but there might well be cases :where the Board would feel the right way to do certainthings Was a different Way from that which was proposed, and where they would feel it was necessary for them to have control. If you have a good Board, I say that is all part and parcel of the ordinary evolution of this industrial organisation ; . . .4. PRIME MINISTER : The general view of the Government, on the otherhand, has been and this was confirmed in the debate in the House that, so to speak, the solid core of the industry should be brought into public ownership,and that the things not directly in the solid core should be hived off. -   &apos;SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: Well, Prime Minister, you say that arose on the debate. Surely that is a new thought, imported into this, and for this reason :You did say in your Resolution, if you remember, last May, which you submittedQ to the House, that this was for the purpose of the efficient organisation of the&quot;;&apos;! industry. , To take sections.like this is not. effecting the efficient organisation ofthe industry at all, it is disturbing it rather than effecting if. . ... it might bea step&apos; towards making the firms you. take over more efficient, but you could not say it was being done with a view to the efficient organisation of the industry andthat is what you said in your Resolution.

2. SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: If you are doing the right thing you will be doing something which will evoke popular enthusiasm, and the sooner it can bedone the better, but if you are doing something which is going to stir up con-troversy over a wide field this is a bad time to do it. . . . . to introduce into thiscountry to-day, Prime Minister, the controversy that would be raised at a timewhen we are wanting 100 per cent, co-operation everywhere, and to widen the controversy, as would be done, I think would be a dreadful set-back for thecountry . : .&quot;. I think I ought to say, to supplement what I have said in answer to your question and the Minister of Supply will confirm this-that in spite ofthe uncertainty during the last ten months we have not failed in any respect to push on with our plan.LORD PRESIDENT : Since your report last yearlSIR ANDREW DUNCAN: Yes, we have pushed on, we have not allowedany question of What would happen to impede us from forging ahead, and wehave done it for this reason, that we believe, whatever happens in this country,it is in the interests of the country that you should have an efficient steel industry,and therefore we have pushed ahead. So I would say, in answer to your question,that I would rather take time to see whether it was not possible to find a basis for full co-operation than speedily to enunciate a policy which would be boundof itself, apart altogether from people&apos;s desires to be controversial and to quarrel,to raise issues which would be unsettling. Take, for instance, the question of taking over these companies. The Minister of Supply, of course, did say thatthe question of disentangling would be considered at a later date, but you cannot start disentangling without the possibility of breaking, and without having roused considerable bitterness of feeling before you have done, and you cannot do it without doing something which is even worse, Prime Minister,and that is this:, As we understand integration, not only within the steelindustry, but integration between the steel industry and the engineering industry,that has been one of the tremendous advantages this country has had over thelast ten or fifteen years ....Mr. ELLIS HUNTER: Particularly on the export side.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Particularly on the export side-1 was goingto give Dorman Long as an example. That has been a tremendous advantage.It is what the Americans do. It is the right movement. It is a movement soas to eliminate intermediate costs. It is a movement which gives control ofraw material, and&apos; quality from the foundation, and the advantages therefor of having an interwoven industry, wider even than steel, are so great that todo anything to impede that, as this would do, would in my judgment be for thecountry a. serious handicap to our export trade, but even m regard to. our home trade it would be bad . ...3. PRIME MINISTER : Your view, as I understand it, would be that you would set up some method of control, but actual public ownership would be confined to particularly difficult units which would not otherwise get into line,is that it? . . : ,     -SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Yes, and I think also there might be occasions when on policy the Government might want a certain side of the industry cateredfor; that would be within the ordinary commercial enterprise, and that one mightWant to associate with them:, and it is perfectly proper they should take a holding in it, but there may well be cases-1 should hope there would not, but there might well be cases-where the Board would feel the right way to do certainthings was a different Way from that which was proposed/and where they wotildfeel it was necessary for them to have control. If you have a good Board, I say that is all part and parcel of the ordinary evolution of this industrial organisation ....4. PRIME MINISTER : The general view of the Government, on the otherhand, has been and this was confirmed in the debate in the House-that, so to speak, the solid core of the industry should be brought into public ownership,and that the things not directly in the solid core should be hived off.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: Well, Prime Minister, you say that arose on the debate. Surely that is a new thought imported into this, and for this reason:You did say; in your Resolution, if you remember, last May, which you submittedto the House, that this was for the purpose of the efficient organisation of theindustry.. To take sections.like this is not. effecting the efficient organisation ofthe industry at all, it is disturbing it rather than effecting it. . . . it might bea step towards making the firms you.take over more efficient, but you could not say it was being done with a view to the efficient organisation of the industry andthat is what you said in your Resolution. You did not say &quot; the efficient organisa-
tion of the appropriate sections of the industry.&quot; You said, &quot; with a view to itsefficient organisation,&quot; meaning &quot; the efficient organisation of the industry.&quot;This is cutting right across that.LORD PRESIDENT : Will you tell us how ?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: It is completely segregating under one super-vision and oversight the iron castings, steel castings, certain rolling sections ofthe industry, and drop forgings. I have never said it before, but I.ought to tellyou that a certain Minister told us eighteen months ago that drop forgings wouldnot be in the national organisation. Drop forgings had been members of ours,but they dropped out, but they do need organising, as the Minister of supply would admit.LORD PRESIDENT : I have recollections of them when I was Minister ofSupply.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Quite, and I say to you quite frankly that I had always hoped we should see the drop forgings and the castings organised.....5. I suggest you cannot very decently make a Steel Board the holdingauthority for the assets of certain firms and at the same time give them the supervisory authority over every other firm. I think that would be somethingquite foreign to our ideas of fair play in this country, and therefore you would at once have a division, and it would seem to me to be equally impossible togive a supervisory board for the other sections&apos; rights of supervision over the holding company, over the Government&apos;s own properties.....6. If there were, in fact, developments which made it necessary on merit forthe Board to cause large sections to be taken over, then I think they should go intoa holding company quite apart from the Board.LORD PRESIDENT : And subject to the Board&apos;s regulations?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Subject to the Board&apos;s regulation, into a holding company. I believe you can do a first-class job, Prime Minister, if I may say so,with a strong Steel Board.MINISTER OF SUPPLY : I wonder if I might ask this question ? DoesSir Andrew suggest that instead of buying the stocks and shares of certaincompanies now there should be statutory power to acquire them as and when required ?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : I would rather put it the other way round,though it comes to the same thing, that the Board should be given, amongst its powers, the power ....MINISTER OF SUPPLY : Of compulsory acquisition ?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN :.....of compulsory acquisition.MINISTER OF SUPPLY : Of the securities of any particular company ?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Yes. minister OF SUPPLY : What I want to ask you is this: If that is thesuggestion, is it not open to the objection that every company in the whole range of the iron and steel industry is under threat for an indefinite period?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : No, I do not think so. Honestly, I do not thinkthat is true. If there is good faith in the matter I do not think that would beso at all, because the Board would be given power to do that wherever they havedeemed it to be right and necessary to facilitate the proper development of theindustry, and I should not be at all surprised if the acquisition, say, over thenext ten years would be even more on the fringes than it would be at the centre,because at the centre you can get all the power you want they would have powers to control price; they would have powers to do all the things you have powers to do now. The powers are really quite unlimited now if you exercisethem.LORD PRESIDENT : The powers of direction ?. SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Yes.MINISTER OF SUPPLY : They are a hang-over from war-time.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: I do not mind these powers being laid down.I think&apos; if we are accepting the principle of effective Government policy control,and that is the principle we are accepting, we must also accept that the Boardmust be vested with the proper powers to effect Government policy control. ...7.   I believe there might well be occasions on which the finance of the new development would be a proper thing for the Government to participate in.MINISTER OF SUPPLY: Or control wholly ?
SIR ANDREW. BUNG AN: I think, myself it is advisable it should be so,;but if I admit participation on principle I would have to admit the whole, andI do, but I prefer participation for this reason, that it is a far better combinationbetween those who are working and the Government which is in power; you keepthe spirit of the thing far better.PRIME MINISTER : Do you not run the danger of a clash of interest?.     SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : I do not think so, when the Board have got fullpower, but if there is a clash of interests which cannot be reconciled the steel board would be the authority to determine it, and if there was any way todetermine it you would determine it by taking over .....       .. :.- ; .8. LORD PRESIDENT: . . . . In any case, even under what you were contemplating, the Board would have to have powers Of direction as to require-ment of physical alterations in plant, and maybe a closing down here and a development somewhere else; a requirement that there must be capital expendi-ture for this, that and the other. There may be a requirement of a severance insome cases. When you get to these real physical disturbances, if the ownershipremains where it is there has got to be argument and discussion, and negotiationnationally; people must be heard if they are to be knocked about in that way.It all takes time. Questions of compensation for disturbance or severance, orwhatever it may be, or guarantee of capital if it is new-capital expenditure, may arise, and the point therefore for consideration is whether the process of getting the thing straight will be longer, and whether there would be more friction about it, more elements of wasteful compensation which the industry or somebody has got to carry in the end if ownership remains where it is, and whether this couldnot be done more sweetly, more swiftly and more systematically, and done in amore business-like way, if the ownership were vested in some public authoritywhereupon, of course, they have not got: to bother about these things, exceptin so far as income and expenditure arise, than if this belonged to so-and-so and this belonged to such-and-such a firm. They could go ahead. That seems tous to be the advantage of a scheme of Government ownership or some form ofpublic authority ownership of the stocks which gives you that physical freedomof action without too much meticulous, long-drawn-out discussions about it whichare bound to arise to some extent if you are dealing with another roan of property.This is swifter, cleaner and more likely to be efficient. That is our point of viewup to how.  We are here for the purpose of listening to each other anyway:SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : I would say two things in answer to that, lord president. The first is that the very fact that we were able to produce an industryplan, which did evolve, without any compensation at all.....:       ;  ,  ,Mr. ELLIS HUNTER : Mark that. 1 . - L - . -SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: . . . . without any compensation at all wehave-not allowed a penny for compensation, we are not asking for compensation;we have been enabled within the industry plan to make the very kind of adjust-ments you are talking about, of a very major kind: the concentration, for.instance, in rollers; the concentration in billet-making, the elimination of certainfirms from certain sections in order to get economic rolling; putting down a newbeam mill at Dorman Long&apos;s, which is introducing a new type of product intothis country but at the same time displacing a great many other rival products.They said, &quot; This is the right development for this industry.&quot; We have actuallyalready on a very major scale mastered these thmgs by something that is hot athing universally acceded to by private employers, viz., a recognition of the factthat their industry must be progressive and efficient, and it is on that principle,as an industry, that We have done it, and that the economy of any one firm in theend cannot be sound unless it is a unit in an efficient: industry. That is the basisupon which we are proceeding. That is the first answer: The second answer is this : I am not at all sure-1 do not know what the Minister of Supply would say about this--that this common ownership-let us take the Royal OrdnanceFactories, and here I am not talking about war-time, I am talking before thewar I am not at all sure that this public ownership, which vests in somebody theright to give an order to have things done, always leads, to the wise thing being done. . I think that three of us would say certainly it had not been well done before the war, either in the location of many of the Royal Ordnance Factories,or in the build-up of the Royal Ordnance Factories9,   And the Board would not be wasting its time at all if in the end, withouttoo much delay,, it was found that genuine discussion was not really being engagedin; and no help was forthcoming,, then the Board-would have power to exercise[33793]&apos; -       &apos; :&apos; - &apos;   - D
its authority even to the point of acquisition, and I should think that is a properthing. If you once accept the principle of effective Government policy control youare driven to that.LORD PRESIDENT : You must give it sanctions?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : You must have sanctions . . . . I must concede,that the Board should have powers of ultimate sanctions of that kind, but theamount of co-operation, the amount of advantage you would get by a co-operatingindustry, a collectively co-operating industry, the amount of advantage you would get to the public cause, would be so great as far to outweigh any slight disadvan-tage there might be occasionally if you had had to take four months to arriveat something when three months should have done. ....10. Assume a case arose such as the South Wales situation, in Which it wasnecessary, in order to get the proper development, to buy out other firms thanwithin my membership, I would say that the State should own the new; theyshould pay out the old and they should own the new, but in point of fact weJhave followed a different principle altogether in conversation. We have said,&quot; No, you are members of an industry which has a duty to be not only progressivebut up-to-date and efficient. We will give you the opportunity. Your place isnot worth dabbling with; we will give you the opportunity of holding on your craftin the new combine; instead of spending money on your place as you want todo, if you care, to come into the new company you can and follow your craft.&quot;That has worked excellently, and that is the right spirit, because in-my judgmenta man has no right to hang on in the industry if the only way he can makea living is by maintaining conditions which are no longer regarded as properfor the manufacture of goods.11. LORD PRESIDENT : lam asking the question if they will be moresticky in carrying out the request of the public Board than in carrying out yourrequests ? In that event the case for the Ministry of Supply acquisition is rather different.SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: They will not be more sticky, because they willhave the Federation there guiding and controlling, and-indeed it can be madeeasy for the Board. ...12. MINISTER OF SUPPLY: Would you not agree, Sir Andrew, thatone very well-tried method of getting the advantages of special individual enter-prise and at the same time common policy control has been the device of the holding company, such asi Unilever or I.C.I., and you do get there, I believe,a number of companies functioning in much the same way as they have tradi-tionally functioned with their own specialities, with an overriding policy controlimposed upon the common ownership?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : Let me say this, in fairness to the point youmake, that I am not ruling out that ini the evolution-because these are allevolutions in a period of about twenty years, with your Steel Board, you mighthave at least five regional companies. I am not ruling that out at all, indeedthat is all in my mind. I believe that at the moment we have achieved somuch voluntarily that the State can pick up from there-when I talk about theState I am talking about the Government of the day&apos; they can pick up from there, and add to it and develop it, and I should not at all wonder if in the courseof anything between ten, and twenty years-because, after all, following thisfive-year plan there will have to be another plan. This industry is so progressiveand making such strides that it cannot stop. When we have spent  158 millionwe have to have another industry plan, and many of our firms have already planned for fifteen years ahead, and I believe that in close co-operation withthe Steel Board and a policy of direction there could be an evolution, and itwould be a perfectly peaceful and a much more effective evolution than anystep taken now could be, at a time when, as I say, the country is going through a very difficult period, and you do need all the enthusiasm and help andco-operation of everybody concerned.        * ,13. MINISTER OF SUPPLY: What degree of public ownership do youregard as compatible with what you have in mind?SIR ANDREW DUNCAN : I would myself leave that to the Board. give them full powers. You satisfy, if I may say so, all the necessary cannons by giving the Board full powers, and I would leave it to the Board.14. SIR ANDREW DUNCAN: They would have to satisfy the ministers for the time being.  You cannot remove ministerial authority.  They would have
to satisfy the Ministers that what they were doing was the right and properthing to do. .MINISTER OF SUPPLY : And without more ado, without further powers,compulsory acquisition could take place?- .SIR ANDREW DTJNCAN: Yes, in the interests of development. ;&quot;MINISTER OF SUPPLY: Would it not be said that that was a threat to any company, that any company could be bought up?Mr. ELLIS HUNTER : The best schoolmaster, you know, does not use the cane.APPENDIX IIIron and Steel BoardChairman&apos;s Office,i South-West Wing,Bush House,Strand,- London, W.C. 2,March, 1947(Personal and Confidential)My dear Minister, \This Board has how entered Upon the sixth month of its existence since itwas set up by you. The experience gained, though short, has been intensive and does, I hope, enable me to speak with some degree of confidence on some of theproblems connected with the industry.I think it is fair to say that the first impression one has gained is the out-standing manner in which all concerned in the industry managements and work-people alike-have sought to achieve maximum production under difficult circum-stances. The long record of good relations between both sides almostunparalleled in industrial history-has and does contribute greatly to this stateof affairs. It is, I think, clear that but for the unfortunate curtailment ofsupplies Of solid fuel and electric power, this year would have resulted in anall time record production of steel ic this country.At the same time very considerable progress has been made with schemes for development and modernisation of the steel industry. A number of these, asincluded in broad outline under the over-all plan of the British Iron and steel federation, are under construction now. Others have been worked out in fulldetail and submitted to the Board. We have satisfied ourselves by first handenquiry that the remainder are in various stages of detailed planning and that work upon them is being pressed forward. I am sure you would agree that it is greatly to the credit of the industry and a tribute to the courage and publicspirit of those concerned in it that they should be prepared to enter into the immense commitments involved in these schemes despite the economic and politicaluncertainty of the future.Under the encouragement of the Board and aegis of the Joint Iron Council a start has also been made with plans for the modernisation and development of theiron industry-the iron foundries (embracing about 2,000 separate units) and themanufacture of foundry pig iron.The Board is also in close touch with the steel castings and iron oreindustries. :Other major problems coming within its jurisdiction are also engaging theattention of the Board the review and control of the price structure in allthese industries, the justification for subsidising -marginal or uneconomicproduction and the availability and import of raw materials and finished orsemi-finished steel.The wisdom of your decision to bring the iron ore, iron foundry and foundrypig iron industries within the scope of the Board&apos;s duties has been welldemonstrated. Much as this widens the field it is clear that these industries and the steel industry proper are so inter-related as to make any division unrealand unworkable. The same applies to any subdivision within the steel sectionitself particularly in these days of integrated plants.I believe that the Board has made fair progress in all these matters in acomparatively short time and so far as I am competent to judge has succeeded in
gaining the confidence of ail concerned (Trade Associations, Trade Unions andManagements) in the various parts of the wide field which it has to&apos; cover. Ithas certainly had the great advantage, of their complete co-operation.In short the Board as your chosen instrument does seem tome to, be performingthe function you intended and in so doing has established the, means whereby theState has effective control over the Iron and Steel Industry without any dislocation-tion of the existing machinery and with the minimum of executive delay. Throughthe Defence Regulations and the Board the Government control the Industry at every material point: in the quantity, quality and price of imported rawmaterials; in the price of domestic raw materials; in the nature, destination and price of finished products at every stage and in the nature, location, extent and timing of replacement and expansion of productive capacity.I find it difficult to apprehend what practical, as distinct from political,advantage would be gained, at least in the short term, by a transfer of ownershipin one form or another. And the short term is the critical period. The Govern-menfs assessment of the economic position of the country at the present timeand over the next few years has now been published. It discloses a situation ofthe utmost gravity and calls for the maximum productive effort with the greatesteconomy in manpower.I think I should be failing in my duty if I did not represent to you that inmy opinion to introduce plans at this juncture for public ownership, in whateverdegree, of the iron and steel industry might well amount to a negation of the objective set out in the Economic White Paper. Here we have a basic industryin the national economy where every effort is being made to maintain and increase production, where schemes to achieve maximum efficiency and conservation of manpower are in, course of construction or under consideration at varying stages,where excellent relations subsist between the two sides in the industry with, asI imagine, no pressure for a change, ia ownership from, the principal Trade unions concerned, and where effective supervision by the State is already operatingsuccessfully. It would be hard; to-conceive of a situation in which less could be gained or more might be lost: by introducing a. radical change at, this stage;- I do not; of course, know what scheme or method of securing public owner-.ship, may be contemplated; but whatever its form it, must raise many questionsof. partition, allocation and organisation which quite outside any controversyOn principle will call for the whole attention, of the leaders and managements inthe industry who are now, and for some time ought in. the. national interest tocontinue to be wholly devoted to the problems of production.,, modernisation anddevelopment. ,: Bearing in mind the complex nature of this industry which is not- devoted tothe manufacture! of a single product there could not fail to be some uncertainty and confusion resulting in a serious slowing down of the whole working of theindustry and particularly in the carrying out of rehabilitation and expansion schemes. ,I realise that the Government are under a, pledge to. introduce legislationdesigned to secure, some degree of public ownership. But, I wonder whether theprogramme could not. be reviewed in. light, of the problems with, which: the countryis faced now andi in the next two. or three critical years?: I would ask you toconsider whether the introduction of such legislation at this crucial period inthe economic life ol the- country might net be a grave national ^disservice. I am not seeking in this context: to argue the merits or demerits of public ownership of this: industry in the long term., I am merely submitting that this is no timeto divert energy from the paramount task of obtaining maximum productionnor tovrisk jeopardising the-existing progress towards full production- efficiency.To such extent as the control of the industry now rests upon a measure ofgood will you might think it politically wise to. invest the Board, with wider andmore, precise powers?-and this might commend itself as. a logical compromise.But, to go further at this, stage does,, I: suggest,, involve an undue gamble from the standpoint that really matters the well, being of the country.If you or your colleagues should desire I shall, of course, be happy to discussthe matter more fully and to elaborate the reasons which lead me to the conclusionhere set out.    &apos;   &apos;   &apos; . - ,:,       , Yours sincerely,     .... (Signed)      . A. F. FORBES.Right Hon. John Wilmot, M.P.,Ministry of Supply.
