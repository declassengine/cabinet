(47) 158 ^22ND MY.  1947   &apos;CABINETINDIAN policy memorandum &quot;by the Prime Minister -The India and Burma Committee has had a series of discussions, first with Lord Ismay (Chief Adviser to theViceroy) and later with the Viceroy himself.2, Lord Mountbatten&apos;s instructions were to do his y &apos;utmost to secure general acceptance of the Cabinet Mission&apos;splan.-     If this proved impossible he was to report by the1st October on the-steps which he considered should he taken for the handing over of power in dune, 1948..3. Since his arrival In India &quot;Lord Mountbatten has    h--had a prolonged series of conversations with the leaders of congress and of the Muslim League and has also conferred with representatives of the Sikhs. -   His conversationshave convinced him that there is no prospect of acceptanceof the Cabinet Mission&apos;s plan or of a Union of India on anyother basis.     He is also convinced that a very early,announcement of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentVs intentions as tothe manner in which power will be transferred in 1948 isessential if widespread and uncontrollable communaldisturbances, especially in the North-West Frontier Provinceand the Punjab),  are to be avoided.    - The India and BurmaCommittee are fully satisfied that this diagnosis.. is correctand-that further initiative on our part is essential.4. The Viceroy has convened for 2nd June a smallConference consisting of leaders of the Congress, the muslim league and the Sikhs at which he will make a final effort toget a compromise on. the basis of the Cabinet Mission&apos;s plan.If,  as he expects, he fails to do so,  he proposes to lay before the Conference the text of a Statement by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      He will inform the Conference that he isprepared to consider any modifications of it which theConference may,agree to propose to him within a short butstated period.      The proposed text of this announcement, as approved by the India and Burma Committee&apos;in consultationwith the Viceroy,  is contained in the annex to this memorandum.5. The Statement announces:-.        \ .   ,(i)    that the attempt to secure a Union of the wholeof India on the basis of the Cabinet Mission&apos;sproposals must now be abandoned;(ii)    that arrangements must therefore be made wherebypower can be transferred &quot;to more than one authority;
(iii)    a procedure whereby the different parts of Indiacan choose through elected representativeswhether their future constitutions shall be framed by the existing Constituent Assemblyor in a new Constituent Assembly composed ofrepresentatives of those areas that holdaloof from the main body;(iv)    provisions for setting up such new ConstituentAssembly for the areas that opt for separationaction.6. The main purpose of the procedure proposed is tothrust upon Indians the responsibility of deciding whetheror not India shall be divided and in what way.      The elaboratenature of the procedure is unfortunately made unavoidable.bythe complex conditions existing in India,  if a reasonablyequitable expression of Indian opinion in the areas inquestion is to be obtained.      The probable result will be---that in the North-West Sind, Western Punjab,  and possibly also the North.-West Frontier Province will stand out fromthe existing Constituent Assembly.&apos;     In the North-East thereis some possibility of Bengal remaining united, but if this does not happen Eastern- Bengal,  and the one predominantlyMuslim district of Assam are likely also to stand out.7. The Viceroy in his conversations with the party leaders has revealed to them the main outlines of his proposals and is satisfied that they will be accepted by congress.      Mr.  Jinnah acquiesced in them in private conversation although in a subsequent public statement hehas protested against any proposal to partition Bengal andthe Punjab.      The Viceroy thinks, however, that the muslim league is likely to co-operate in working the procedure proposed. . -8. The India and Burma Committee are satisfied that   &quot;these proposals&apos; are the best available in the circumstances and recommend that the Viceroy be authorised to proceed accordingly.C.R.A.10, Downing Street,S.W.1.22nd May,  1947.
ANNEX draft ANNOUNCEMENT   -I.    introduction .     On February 20th., 1947? His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their intention of transferring power in British India to indian hands &quot;by June,  19^-8.     His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped that it would he possible for the major parties toco-operate in &apos;the working-out of the Cabinet Mission&apos;s plan of May i6th,  19u7, and evolve for India a constitutionacceptable to all concerned.     This hope has not been fulfilled.2.     The majority of the representatives of the Provinces ofMadras, Bombay, the United Provinces, Bihar, Central provinces and Berar, Assam, Orissa and the North-West Frontier Province,and the representatives of Delhi, Agmer-Merwara and Coorghave already made progress in the task of evolving a newConstitution.      On the other hand,, the Muslim League Party,including in it a majority of the representatives of Bengal,the Punjab and Sind, as also the representative of BritishBaluchistan, has decided not to participate in the ConstituentAssembly.3...     It has always been the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government .that power should be transferred in accordance with .the wishes of the Indian people themselves.     This task would have been greatly facilitated if there had been agreement among theIndian political parties.      In the absence of such anagreement, the task of devising a method by which the wishes of the Indian people can be ascertained has devolved onHis Majesty&apos;s Government.     After full consultation with political leaders in India, His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided to adopt for thi.s purpose the plan set out below.&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear that they haveno intention of attempting to frame any ultimate Constitution
for India;    this is a matter for the Indians themselves.Nor is there anything in this plan to preclude negotiations between communities for. an united India.&apos;II.    THE ISSUES TO BE DECIDEDh.      It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to interrupt the work of the existing Constituent   Assembly.How that provision is made for certain Provinces specifiedbelow, His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that, as a consequenceof this announcement, the Muslim League representatives ofthose Provinces a majority of whose representatives are alreadyparticipating In it will now take their due share in itslabours.     At the same time,  it is clear that any Constitutionframed by this Assembly cannot apply to those parts of thecountry which are unwilling&apos; to accept it.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are satisfied that the procedure outlined belowembodies the best practical method of, ascertaining the wishes of the people of such areas on the issue whether their constitution is&apos;to be framed:-(a) in.the existing Constituent Assembly;    or(b) in a new and separate Constituent Assembly consistingof the representatives of those areas which decide.   . not to participate in the existing ConstituentAssembly,When this has been done, it will be possible to determine theauthority or authorities to whom power should be transferred.III.    BENGAL ^ND THE PUNJAB5.     The Provincial Legislative Assemblies of Bengal and the punjab (excluding the European members)will therefore each beasked to meet in two parts, one representing the Muslimmajority districts and the other the rest of the Province.
for India;    this is a matter for the Indians themselves.Nor is there anything in this plan to preclude negotiations&quot;between communities for an united India.II.    THE ISSUES TO BE DECIDEDk-      It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to interrupt the work of the existing Constituent   Assembly.Now that provision is made for certain Provinces specifiedbelow, His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that, as a consequenceof this announcement, the Muslim League representatives ofthose Provinces a majority of whose representatives are alreadyparticipating in it will now take their due share in itslabours.     At the same time,  it Is clear that any Constitutionframed by this Assembly cannot apply to those parts of thecountry which are unwilling to accept it.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are satisfied that the procedure outlined belowembodies the best practical method of, ascertaining the wishes of the people of such areas on the issue Whether their constitution is to be framedt-(a) in the existing Constituent Assembly;    or(b) in,a new and separate Constituent Assembly consistingof the representatives of those areas which decidenot to participate in the existing ConstituentAssembly.When this has been done, it will be possible to determine theauthority or authorities to whom power should be transferred.III.    BENGAL .aND THE PUNJAB5.     The Provincial Legislative Assemblies of Bengal and the punjab (excluding the European members) will therefore each beasked to meet in two parts, one representing the Muslimmajority districts and the other the rest of the Province.
For the purpose of determining the population of districts,  the19h1  census figures will he taken as authoritative.     The Muslimmajority districts in these two Provinces are set out in theAppendix to this Announcement.6.     The members of the two parts of each Legislative Assemblysitting separately will he empowered to vote whether or not theProvince should he partitioned.      If a simple majority of either part decides in favour of partitition, division willtake place and arrangements will he made accordingly.7.      Before such a vote takes place, however,  it is desirablethat the. representatives of each Province should clearly knp-wwhich Constituent Assembly the Province as a whole would join,if they decided to remain united.      Therefore,  if there is ademand for it by any member of the Legislative Assembly,  a preliminary joint meeting of all members of each Legislative -Assembly ( other than Europeans) will be held at which adecision on this issue will be taken.8.      In the event of partition being decided upon, each part,of the Legislative Assembly will,  on behalf of the areas they-represent, decide which of. the alternatives in paragraph kabove to adopt.9.     For.the immediate purpose of deciding on the issue of partition,  the members of the Legislative assemblies of Bengaland the Punjab will sit in two parts according to Muslimmajority districts (as laid down in the Appendix) and non-Muslim majority districts..     This is only a preliminary step ofa purely temporary nature as it is evident that for thepurposes of a definitive partition of these Provinces a detailed investigation of boundary questions will be neededjand, as soon as a decision involving partition has been taken for either Province,  a Boundary Commission will be set up bythe Governor-General,  the membership and terms of reference of
which will he settled, in consultation with those&apos;concerned.It will he instructed to demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of the Punjab on the basis of ascertaining thecontiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims.      Itwill also be instructed to take into account other factors.Similar instructions will be given to the Bengal boundary commission.     Until the report of a Boundary Commission hasbeen put into effect, the provisional boundaries indicated inthe Appendix will be used.IV.    SINE10. The Legislative Assembly of Sind (excluding the european members) will at a special&apos; meeting also take its own decision;on the alternatives in paragraph k above.V._NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE11.      The position of the Norths/Vest Frontier Province isexceptional..    Two of the three representatives of thisProvince are already participating in the existing ConstituentAssembly.     But it is clear, in view of its geographicalsituation,  and other considerations, that if the whole or anypart of the Punjab decides not to join the existing ConstituentAssembly, it will be necessary to give the North-West frontier province an opportunity to reconsider its position.Accordingly, in such an event^, a referendum will be made tothe electors of the present Legislative Assembly in the North-West Frontier Province to choose which of the alternativesmentioned in paragraph 1+ above they wish to adopt.     the referendum will be held under the aegis of the Governor-General and in consultation with the Provincial Government.
VI.    BRITISH BALUCHISTAN12.     British Baluchistan has elected a member but he had not taken his seat in the existing Constituent Assembly.      In view,of its geographical situation,  this Province will also begiven an opportunity to reconsider its position and to choosewhich of the alternatives in paragraph k above to adopt.His Excellency the Governor-General is examining how this canmost appropriately be done.VII.    ASSAM13*     Though Assam Is predominantly a non-Muslim Province,  thedistrict of Sylhet which is contiguous to Bengal ispredominantly Muslim.       There has been a.demand that,  in theevent of the partition of Bengal, Sylhet should be amalgamatedwith the Muslim part of Bengal.     Accordingly,  if it is decidedthat Bengal should be partitioned, a referendum will be heldin Sylhet district, under the aegis of the Governor-Generaland in consultation with the Assam Provincial Government,to decide whether the district of Sylhet should continue toform part of the Assam Province or should be amalgamated withthe new Province of Eastern Bengal,  if that Province agrees.If the referendum results in favour of amalgamation withEastern Bengal, a Boundary Commission with terms of referencesimilar to those for the Punjab and Bengal will be set up todemarcate the Muslim majority areas of Sylhet district andcontiguous Muslim majority areas of adjoining districts,which will then be transferred to Eastern Bengal.     The restof the Assam Province will in any case continue to participate in the proceedings of the existing Constituent Assembly.VIII.    REPRESENTATION IN CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLIESIk.     If it is decided that Bengal and the Punjab should bepartitioned, it will be necessary to hold fresh elections to. -V-

Similarelections will also have to be held for Sylhet in the event ofits being decided that this district should form&apos; part of EastBengal.      The number of representatives to which each area would be entitled is as follows&quot;-Province	General	Muslims	Sikhs	TotalSylhet District	1	2	mi	3West Bengal	15	k	Nil	19East Bengal	12	29	Nil	West Punjab	3	1 2	2	17East Punjab	6      &apos;	k	2	1215.
