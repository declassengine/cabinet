Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1947__;___m____,__&quot; _-SECRET Copy No.     31-CP. (47) 1692nd June, 1947CABINET\   190PLANNING FOPv EXPANSIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIN the OhanceUor&apos;s memorandum on the Import Programme 1947-48(CP. (47) 167) brief reference is made in paragraph 33 to the importance ofmaking every effort to create new sourcesi of supply. This is a vital point. our economic recovery is being strangled by shortages of raw materials, fuel and food.These shortages are dragging on far longer and more dangerously than we expected. They underlie many of our other troubles. Por example, our dollarshortage is largely due to the continued inability of non-dollar countries to sendus the supplies: they should. Many of our man-power difficulties1 are due,tofailures in supply of materials or fuel or plant. All our planning will be broughtto nought and economic crises will recur unless we can recreate the ample flow of supplies of commodities which is the life-blood of our economy.2. From time to time since&apos; the war, efforts have been made in this direction.A number of Ministers; have been working in their various fields with some success.In the case of cereals, the 1946 World Food Supplies Committee, under the PrimeMinister5 s Chairmanship, was instrumental in securing effective world-widemeasures to conserve the use and to expand the output of food grains beyondanything thought possible in so short a time. For example, the sown wheatacreage in the United States, which was thought incapable of expansion, has been forced up from an estimated 69 million acres in the spring of last year to an estimated 76 million acres now. Largely as a result of this expanded acreagethe 1947 American wheat crop promises to reach the remarkably high total of1,250 million bushels,, and this, together with the promising Russian crop, istransforming the world cereals outlook. There is good reason to hope that worldfamine has been averted. Moreover as coarse grains are no longer having to be diverted so largely for human food we are now able to resume the rebuilding ofour livestock, and to see more bacon and eggs on the horizon. We are also ableto look forward to ending the strain of famine prices on our balance of payments.Without the intense world-wide pressure exerted, by His Majesty&apos;s government through so many channels this result would not have been possible. In particular,the Foreign Secretary&apos;s appeal to the United Nations London Assembly, the.Conference of European Ministers of Food and Agriculture convened in london in April 1946, the creation at the instance of the Foreign Secretary ofLord Killearn&apos;s special organisation in South-East Asia, and the influence exertedthrough all our diplomatic posts, got the world grain problem put high on theagenda where it most mattered.II3. This is a most heartening example. Would it not be well to examine in turn the other essential commodities which are in acutely short supply andto make an extra effort now to assist the Ministers concerned by putting behind them the whole force and authority and drive of the Government ?4. I will not attempt to deal here with fuel, since the Prime Minister&apos;sFuel Committee already exists to achieve these purposes in respect of fuel supplies.[33706]
5. I suggest that a similar governmental effort should be made in respectof steel, timber, oilseeds and fats and such other materials and commodities as are likely to form bottlenecks in our recovery or to involve us in unnecessarilyhigh expenditure of foreign exchange. Looking at the matter from another angle,we should survey the areas of the world which are lagging in their contributionto supplies of food and materials, such as Russia and her satellites, Indonesia,China and South-East Asia generally and the Argentine. We might also furtherextend and accelerate the measures already being taken to stimulate suitableproduction in the colonial empire.6. In the case of foreign territories, no United Kingdom GovernmentDepartment has, of course, any actual responsibility or formal voice in the amountof production. We can, however, as in the case of wheat and rice, interveneeffectively in various indirect ways if we chose to do so. For this purpose we need first-hand information from experts on production farmers, scientists,and engineers, for example -as distinct from the expert buyers whose contactsare mainly with middle-men and Governments. Overseas producers, like our own,are handicapped by being unable to satisfy particular needs of machinery andequipment, transport, technical advice and in some cases no doubt encourage-ment and incentives. The right types of expert, given strong diplomatic and publicity backing, could be put into the field as effective teams at all points wherea big influence could be exerted. Necessary equipment and supplies could beadvantageously promised even at some sacrifice to ourselves in return for vitally-needed imports to this country. In this connexion I welcome the mission to moscow by the Secretary of Overseas Trade and a party of officials, which show show much can be done in a short time to begin to clear away difficulties even where they are greatest. We shall never get the stuff. without going after itin a big way and with the will to win.7. We are in danger of making the worst of both planning and laissez-faireworlds if we leave the expansion of overseas supplies too much to the self-interestof producers who have little incentive in present conditions and are up againstheavy; odds. The Minister of Food has been developing, in such examples as theCanadian Wheat Contract and in the Tanganyika groundnut scheme, the type ofplanned attack which might well be more widely adopted. Indonesia, for instance,could undoubtedly supply us with hundreds of thousands of tons of some of the commodities we most need during the next few years if the Foreign Secretarycould bring the Dutch to cease their virtual blockade on Indonesian exports andif the Minister of Food could send people in to talk business with those who arein a position to deliver the goods, including sugar, rice, copra and other products.Ill8. There are great opportunities which we should use of whipping upproduction of vital materials and food-stuffs overseas through world-wide propa-ganda and through United Nations agencies. Of all the innumerableinternational conferences and meetings hardly any seem to be wholly or evenprincipally concerned with this vital job of planning more supplies.9. If we can step up world production of food-stuffs and materials, and get on top of our fuel difficulties the whole outlook for the future will be changed.Productivity can then be much increased. There will be more elbow-room, lessfrustration and less need for detailed controls. The incentive for productiveeffort will be improved. World political stresses will be eased. Trade andfinancial agreements will be assisted. The appalling prices we have to pay forour imports will fall. There is no other direction in which the reward of effort,now and on a governmental scale, can be so great.IV10.   I therefore ask my colleagues to agree : \ (a) to impress on their Departments that the highest priority should be givento all measures capable of expanding supplies of vital and scarce rawmaterials, fuels and food-stuffs by unorthodox as well as orthodoxmethods and overseas as well as at home;(&amp;) that the Ministers immediately responsible should carry out searchingreviews of &quot;danger list&quot; commodities starting with timber and
I101timber products, steel, oilseeds and fats, and (after consultation withother interested Ministers and myself) should report in each case tothe Lord Presidents Committee, or where necessary to the Cabinet,on the world statistical position and prospects of the commodity, the steps taken or proposed to bring about expansion and the steps whichhave been proposed but ruled out on various grounds;(c) that the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, Dominions, colonies and India should be invited to arrange at the appropriate stages forthe urgency of expanding supplies of scarce commodities both ingeneral and in particular to be brought at a high level to the attentionof the Governments with whom they deal;(d) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be inyited toarrange for British representatives on United Nations and other bodies to expound this theme on every suitable occasion and to press for methods of expanding supplies of vital commodities to be placedon the agenda of all international bodies which may be in a positionto assist either by action or by giving a lead to world public opinion;and(e) that I should arrange, through the Overseas Information Services Com-mittee, for suitable publicity to be put out on this theme on themaximum practicable scale.H. M.Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council, S.W. 1,2nd June, 1947.
