ciRcui.ATED.....^J.(a........At..3.r.e.^.123THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET iiCOPY NO.   ^1C.P.(47) 1722nd June, 1947.CABINETTEXTILE EXPORTS AND THE CLOTHING ration memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Cabinet agreed on 16th December, 1946,(CM. (46) 106th Conclusions, Minute 2) that the clothes rationfor the period 1st March to 31st August, 1947, should be 32coupons,  sheets being brought within the rationing system, andthat, in consequence partly of the increased clothes ration andpartly of the short-fall in production, the quarterly allocation of cotton goods for export should be reduced from 26,245 tons     ^to 15,000 tons.2. This decision was duly put into effect in the planning of textile production, but since that date two new factors have appeared:-(i) The fuel crisis caused a heavy loss of production intextiles, estimated in March as equivalent to about two months&apos; output in the cotton and wool industries.I therefore announced on 3rd April that the issueof 32 coupons would have to last until the end ofOctober, i.e. eight months at the rate of 4 couponsa month.      In fact, the total loss of production now appears likely to be slightly less, between four and six weeks&apos; output, but having regard to the overallsupply position I do not propose to make any furtherChange in the present coupon period.(ii) The balance of payments position has gravelydeteriorated and we are faced with the plain necessityof increasing our exports (especially to hard currencymarkets), largely,  and quickly.     I have thereforereviewed the possibility of making a substantial increase in textile exports at the expense of the homeration as proposed in the Treasury memorandumcontained in CP. (47) 16.7*.... &quot;V. / *.3* Current exports of textiles do not yet reflect thedecision taken in December to cut cotton and also to some extentrayon exports in favour of the home market.      If that decision were not altered, textile exports would probably fall from thepresent rate of about  210 m.  per year to little over  175 m.by the end of this year, while supplies for the home market wouldby the same date be equivalent to about 5 coupons a month.      If,however, our payments position is such, as I think it Is, thatwe must make a,special effort to increase textile exports to therate of  250 m. per year, a decision to this effect must be taken at once.      The Cotton and Wool Controls will shortly be putting in new programmes of production for the corning autumn, and they must
il liltknow how much should he produced for export.     Even if the allocations for export are increased at once the full effect in terms of export deliveries will not be felt until the first half of next year.4- In increasing textile exports to  250 m.  per.year. Ishould concentrate the increase as far as possible on exportsof the most fully manufactured and valuable goods.     This means that exports of yarns would in general be kept down to theirpresent low level, while exports of fully manufactured clothingwould be raised to the maximum extent.      Unfortunately the degree to which the increased value can be achieved by exporting thesame quantity of more valuable goods is very limited, and a verylarge part of the increase must he found from increased quantitiesof our staple exports of cotton and wool cloth.5* The effect on the clothes ration will he to keep therate doen to h- coupons a month during most of next year.     Thiswas the usual rate during the war (although sheets were not thenincluded in the ration, because there were none);    for a timeimmediately after the war it fell to 3 a month, and later rose to between h and 5.     Taking account of all the supplements(issued principally to children and industrial workers), thevolume of supplies will be about two-thirds the rate beforethe war.      Supplies of all types of household textiles made ofcotton will also remain at a low level, except for sheets, whereI propose to secure the maximum production possible and to curtail exports.     This continuation of the war-time rate of clothing ration will undoubtedly be felt to b.e a real hardship,especially since before the fuel crisis I encouraged hopes ofimprovement, but in our present circumstances I see no alternative.6. Apart from the effect on consumers, the diversion of cloth from the home market to export will deprive the clothingindustry of some of its raw material.      The effect on employmentcannot be measured at all accurately, but it may involve thestanding-off of some 25-30,000 workers in the tailoring sectionor the equivalent in short-time working, and smaller numbers in the other sections.      This will lead to protests from bothsides of the industry, who in the past have consistently made representations that exports of cloth should be reduced in orderto maintain full employment in clothing factories.      It must also he recognised that the effect on clothing supplies will be feltparticularly heavily in men&apos;s wear, where there are alreadypronounced shortages.7. All the above rests on the assumption that productionof textiles during the coming twelve months will be at a ratenot substantially above last autumn and winter before the fuelcrisis.      I greatly hope that the return of labour, and thebeginning of modernisation of machinery and technique, coupled with adequate fuel supplies, will ensure a steady increase.But we have had so many disappointments, and there are so manyuncertain factors, that I do not think it wise to plan on thisoasis.      If it is realised, I should propose to divide it between   -home and export, with some preference for the home market.8. I have also made-no allowance for Increased imports.We are now importing yarn and cloth from several soft-currencycountries, but the quantities so far are insignificant.   ^ We are trying to get more sizable quantities from Germany, and if theseare realised they may begin to make some difference by the end ofthis year.      But here again it would he rash to count on much until we actually have the goods, dollar purchase of cotton may be involved.
9* The Treasury memorandum rightly emphasises the importanceof steering as much as possible of our exports, and especially of the suggested increase in textile exports, to hard-currencymarkets.     We have already taken some steps in this direction inthe case of cotton exports, and we are now doing similarly inwool.     .We shall extend the policy to the whole range of ourtextile and clothing exports as far as is practicable, and themeans of doing so will be discussed at the official level &quot;by the guidance of Exports Committee.      It must be recognised, however,that textiles have always catered for world-wide markets, of aninfinity of types suited to every different country, most of whichhave claims of one sort or another for the maintenance of supplies;,diversion to hard-currency markets is, therefore, a matter foremphasis, rather than for precipitate rupture of valuable long-termconnections with other customers. -    I am sure we can rely on the textile industries, through the appropriate Controls and organisations, to implement our policy to the utmost that types of production and the demands of the hard-currency markets permit.10. If this policy is agreed I shall have to give immediate effect to it in planning production for the next period.     It will&quot;be a reversal of the decision last December, and unless it is^explained the trade and the public will be at a loss to understandour action, and may learn of it piecemeal by distorted rumourswhich would have the worst effect.      I feel therefore that theannouncement of this change of policy should be included in ageneral statement about the balance of payments, and the measures necessary to deal with it, which I assume will be made at an earlydate.it.     Decision required.      I seek the approval of my colleagues forthe policy outlined above - i.e. for steps to be taken immediately to raise textile exports to the level of  250 m. per year,  and foran announcement to be made accordingly that on present indicationsthe clothing ration for the next ration period will not exceed4 coupons a month, unless there is a substantial rise in textileproduction.R.
