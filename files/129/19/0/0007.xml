Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1947 y       Sye,-*MG.P. (47) 15716th May, 1947CABINETTHE FLOODS OF MARCH-APRIL, 1947Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the attached detailed survey of the causes and course of the recent floodsand the action taken or contemplated has been prepared in response to a personalminute from the Prime Minister from which the following is an extract: &quot;It is essential that all possible steps should be taken to ensure thatthere is no recurrence of widespread flooding next year, and I hope you will do everything you can to see that effective measures are pressed oh urgently.I should be glad if you would submit a paper to the Cabinet on long-term policy as soon as this can be formulated and if you would keep me informed of developments.&quot;2. The recent floods were altogether phenomenal. No floods of this size orextent have previously been recorded on our main river systems in England. Theywere caused by exceptional rainfall, the rapid melting of an exceptional accumu-lation of snow, the frozen nature of the ground and other natural causes over which man has no control. Some 690,000 acres, greater than the farming area in the whole county of Kent, were at one time or another under flood waters.Of this area some 325,000 acres were arable land. Less than 30,000 acres are still under water and practically all the land that has been cleared will carry a cropthis year. I am calling for detailed reports from Catchment Boards, which willbe discussed with each Board individually; but my Department already has a sufficiently detailed picture of the course of the floods in the different CatchmentAreas and the action taken to enable it to reach general conclusions as to future policy.   -3. The emergency action taken to prevent breaches in embankments, to limit the damage caused by the flood waters and the extent of the flooding andto pump the water off the flooded land has been on a scale that has matched theneed. I have received magnificent co-operation from my colleagues and officersin their Departments, both in London and in the Regions. These efforts havesaved for the production of food this year tens of thousands of acres of valuablefarm land. Drainage authorities, with the assistance provided by the CentralGovernment, have in general proved equal to the task of dealing with an unprecedented flood. In fact, it can be claimed that the limitation of the damage and the promptness with which action was taken represents a triumph of engineering skill and resourcefulness.4. Natural watercourses such as the Thames are expected to overflow theirbanks following heavy rainfall. The problem of the engineer is to devise measuresto protect urban areas and other key points and to limit periodic flooding to areasof lesser economic value. Long-term improvement schemes with these ends inview are in hand or are contemplated in many areas. I propose to discuss withthe Board concerned arrangements for pressing forward with such works, butit must inevitably be some time before such major schemes can be carried through to completion.5.   Long-term improvement schemes are also in hand or contemplated inmany fen areas, and here again I propose to discuss with the Boards concernedr33635] BSECRET Copy No,   81
methods of expediting them. Revised financial arrangements within the frame-work of the Land Drainage Act, 1930, may ultimately prove to be necessary.6. In Internal Drainage Districts in the Fens many hundreds of large and small permanent pumps have been installed in recent years. These installationsmust be pressed on, and those schemes that are in progress completed, so far aspossible, before next winter. There have been delays in delivery; and to complywith the Prime Ministers request, I shall require priority in the supply of equipment for permanent pumping stations in the fens. The shortage is mainly of pipes and the demand is small in relation to manufacturing capacity.7. The most urgent task is to effect permanent repairs before next winterto embankments in the fen areas that have been breached, and to reinstate by then embankments that have been damaged or weakened during the floods. Itis a task of great magnitude. There are many miles of such embankments, andall weak spots must be effectively dealt with if a recurrence of floods in the fensis to be avoided. In accordance with the Prime Ministers request it is necessaryfor Me to ask that all Departments should continue to, place their resources readilyat my disposal and afford all the necessary priorities for the supply of men,materials and equipment to enable this essential work to be pressed forwardwithout delay and completed before next winter. The ready co-operation already given encourages me to hope that my colleagues will gladly give this furthermeasure of assistance in the interests of home food production. Discussions with individual Boards which are now proceeding will disclose the nature and extentof their needs, but the main requirement will be of earth-moving equipment andin connexion with materials prompt delivery of the relatively small quantitiesrequired. I shall also require help in pressing forward long-term flood preventionmeasures, including facilities for adequate supplies of steel sheet piling. I wouldalso ask that materials, and particularly steel, used during the recent emergency,or required for urgent rehabilitation works during the coming months, shouldbe carried on a special allocation. Issues have so far been made out of myDepartment^ allocation for general agricultural purposes, which is now nearingexhaustion and will be unable to meet the demands of the coming months.8. The memorandum sets out the special financial provisions made inconnexion with the emergency and works of rehabilitation and makes certain proposals for dealing with cases of special difficulty not covered by the announce-ments already made. I have included these matters to complete the record; butI do not,ask for any decision from the Cabinet on these detailed financial points,which will be the subject of departmental discussion with the Treasury.9. I propose to proceed with the introduction of the River Boards Bill next session as already agreed by the Future Legislation Committee. Instructions forthe preparation of a final draft of the Bill have been sent to parliamentary counsel. I do not consider that the floods have shown any need for urgentamendment of Land Drainage legislation. The administrative structure has, ingeneral, stood up well to tihe test imposed on it. A sub-Committee of the central advisory Water Committee was, however, set up on 21st February last to formulate proposals for the amendment of Land Drainage legislation. It hasalready held three meetings and has called for evidence on the main points ofprinciple from the Associations concerned. I would propose that this Sub-Committee should proceed with its deliberations in the normal way, taking intoaccount, of course, the lessons to be learnt from the floods. The work of theSub-Committee will necessarily take some time to complete as, apart from themain points of principle, there, are a host of detailed points calling for considera-tion. I am hopeful, however, that the Committee may report in time to enablelegislation to be prepared and introduced in the fourth or fifth session of thepresent Parliament.10. I would conclude by recording again my thanks to my colleagues andthe officers of their Departments for the magnificent help given during the recentflood emergency.T.

APPENDIX ;    &apos;    &apos; &apos;   .THE FLOODS OF MARCH-APRIL 1947I. introductory. The following is a summary for the information of my colleagues of the causes and course of the recent floods and the action taken or contemplated. Iam also able to give some preliminary indication of the magnitude and urgency of the work that will be necessary to restore the embankments of our fenlandriver systems that have been damaged or weakened by the floods in time to enablethem to hold a normal major flood if one should occur next winter. Specialpriorities in men, materials and equipment will be required if this work is to be pressed on, as it must, with the necessary speed.II. Magnitude of the FloodingThe Thames2. The floods of March 1947 exceeded in magnitude and extensiveness anypreviously recorded. As an example, the flood on the Thames was comparable with the great flood of 1894 and the daily flow of water amounted to 13,600 million gallons compared with a flow of 11,119 million gallons in 1915, which was thehighest previously recorded in this century.The Severn3. On the Severn, the flood at Worcester was the highest recorded for177 years, and at Gloucester the flood exceeded by 6 inches the previous highestrecorded flood of 1862.The Great Ouse4. As an indication of the magnitude of the flood waters in the fens, theGreat Ouse flood protection scheme propounded by Sir Murdoch Macdonaldin 1940, after an extensive engineering investigation, taking into account similar-previous investigations, was based on the assumption that the maximum flood flowwhich would have to be dealt with at Earith, where the highland water fromBedford and Huntingdon enters the Fens, was 7,700 cusecs. In 1947, therecording apparatus at Earith went out of action at a time when it was alreadyrecording a flow in excess of 10,000 cusecs.The Trent5. On the Trent, the flood level of the river at Nottingham was the highestrecorded since 1875 and, in the lower reaches below Nottingham, the flood watercoming down from the upper reaches coincided with exceptionally high tidescoming up the river, causing a prolongation of the maximum river levels in theembanked areas. Although the River Trent is tidal at Gainsborough, the effectof high tides and of flood water coming down the river was that for three or four days during the spring tides there was only a few inches difference between highand low river levels instead of several feet.The Yorkshire Ouse6. The levelof the River Ouse at York was higher than at any time since 1831,and here also the difficulties were aggravated by the equinoctial spring tide which,on 24th March, rose 4 ft. 3 in. higher than predicted. The level of the tide alonewas in fact only a few inches short of the previous record figures and the com-bination of high tides and exceptional fresh-water floods created conditionswithout precedent.The Welland7. On the River Welland, the 1947 flood level at Spalding was 6 inches higherthan in 1880, which is the highest previously recorded flood.The Lee8. On the River Lee at the recording office at Stamford Hill, where recordshave been kept for nearly 100 years, the 1947 level was 4 inches higher than any previous recording. &quot;[33635] b 2
9. In these circumstances it is clear that the floods of 1947 were altogetherphenomenal; and, so far from suggesting that breaches in embankments, &amp;c, canbe attributed to negligence on the part of the Government or drainage authoritiesin carrying out long-term works or taking necessary precautions, it can, in fact,be claimed that the limitation of the damage and the promptness with whichaction was taken represent a triumph of engineering skill and resourcefulness.III. Main Causes of the FloodsRainfall10. The primary cause of the floods is not far to seek. The average rainfallin the whole country during 1946 amounted to 41-87 inches, which is close on20 per cent, above the 35-year average of 35 - 23 inches. In the first three monthsof 1947 the average rainfall for the whole country amounted to 12-21 inches,which is nearly 50 per cent, higher than the 35-year average of 8-23 inches. Inthe month of March 1947, in which the floods occurred, the average rainfall forthe whole country amounted to 6-78 inches, which was immensely in excess ofthe 35-year average for March of 2-67 inches.Snowfall; frozen and waterlogged land and gales11. The main thaw started in the south on 9th March and the river systems of England had to carry the accumulation of some 8 weeks of snowfall, with the exceptionally heavy rainfall of the month. Owing to the frozen and waterloggednature of the ground, the soil was unable to absorb any appreciable proportionof the melting snow and rain which ran straight off the land into the rivers.The problem was aggravated on many days in the month and particularly duringthe night of Sunday, 16th March, by exceptionally heavy gales which atMildenhall, in the Ouse Fens, reached a velocity of 98 m.p.h.Effect of war-time drainage works12. It has been suggested that the effect of the drainage works carried out during the war on the upland watercourses and farm ditches has been to accelerate the run-off of water into the lower river systems which have hot beenwidened or deepened to take the greater run-off, and that greater flooding hasthereby been caused. It is probable, however, that better drainage in the uplandareas is of benefit to the river systems in time of flood, as well-drained landtends to absorb rainfall better than land that is waterlogged. But this argumenthas, in any case, no relevance to the conditions of March 1947, when, owing tothe frozen ground conditions, there would have been a phenomenal run-off ofmelting snow and rainwater Whatever had been the conditions of the farm ditchesand the upland water courses.Alleged delay over long-term improvements13. It has also been suggested that flooding would have been averted inmany areas had there not been delay and negligence in pressing on with long-termimprovement works. It&quot; is not contended that more might not have been done insome areas. But it is relevant to point to the fact that the Government of theday did not, owing to the economy campaign, make grants available to CatchmentBoards until 1934, four years after the passage of the Land Drainage Act, 1930;and to the effect of the years of war and the subsequent shortage of labour and materials in slowing down long-term improvement works,, including in particular,major works for the relief of flooding in the South Level system of the GreatOuse and on the Rivers Lee, Welland and Don, to which reference is made inparagraph 44 below.Effect of works done14. There is no doubt, generally, that the operations of the CatchmentBoards under the Land Drainage Act, 1930, have greatly limited the floodingthat would otherwise have occurred. During the past 20 years schemes for raisingand reinforcing embankments in the Great Ouse Catchment Area have been continuously in hand and in the South Level system alone, expenditure on such schemes has amounted to  671,000. Extensive as the flooding was in the SouthLevel, there is no doubt that without these works, virtually the Whole of thearea would have gone under water in the recent floods. Several hundreds ofschemes for the installation of permanent pumping stations both small and largehave  been   carried  out  both  before  and   during  the  war  which  have
materially (helped to evacuate the flood waters. Striking examples arethe Station at Keadby in the Trent Catchment Area opened in 1941, and the black Sluice Pumping Station at Boston, which was only opened in December1946. These two stations together have operated to keep dry some150,000 acres of valuable farm land. Extensive works have been carriedout by the River Nene Catchment Board to alleviate flooding atNorthampton and it is significant that although the 1947 flood flow atNorthampton amounted to 6,000 cusecs* as compared with a flow of 2,500 cusecsduring the flood of 1939, the level of the river in 1947 was no higher than inthe earlier year. Many other examples of the effectiveness of long-term improve-ment works could be quoted.IY. Reports and InquiriesDetailed discussions with individual Boards15. There has been a certain amount of pressure in some quarters for the holding of formal public inquiries into the circumstances attending the floodsand the action taken by the different Catchment Boards, but there is so much workto be done both now and over the next six months by Catchment Boards and their staffs that I am reluctant to divert their energies unnecessarily from these urgent and important tasks. Nevertheless, I am calling for detailed reports from allBoards where exceptional flooding has occurred to indicate the causes of theflooding, the measures taken to deal with it and their effectiveness, any defectsin the drainage system or administrative machinery brought to light by thefloods, and the short- and long-term measures necessary to prevent a recurrence,with an indication of the cost of such measures and the materials and labour required for their execution. These. reports will be considered with the reportsof my own officers and&apos; will, where necessary, be discussed in detail individuallywith the Catchment Boards concerned. The intention is to prepare urgentlyshort-term schemes of repair and rehabilitation for completion by next winter,to table the requirements of labour, materials and equipment that will be needed to carry them out and ensure that these resources are available; and to deviselong-term measures to rectify major defects in drainage systems that have beenbrought to light by the floods.16. In due course, following discussions with the individual Boards, I shallbe in a position, if desired, to present a fuller and more detailed report to theCabinet. I hope also to prepare a full historical record of the floods and possibly to arrange for its publication as a matter of general public interest.Possible need for public inquiry in one or two cases17. Whilst the general picture, taking the country as a whole, has been oneof the most inspiring energy and resourcefulness on the part of the CatchmentBoards and their staffs, it may be that in one or two individual cases investiga-tions and discussions with the Boards concerned will disclose the need for some further formal inquiry. For the time being, however, I intend to resist pressure for a public inquiry either generally or in any particular case, until matters canbe seen in better perspective. This was the line taken in^ my answer toMrs. Manning in the House of Commons on Monday, 21st April, and in myanswer to the Debate in the House on Thursday, 24th April. In fact, I think may fairly claim that the lack of any effective criticism on the occasion of thatDebate is some measure of the extent to which action to deal with the floods,greater than have been experienced for a century, matched the need4Y. Course and Extent of the Floods18. As indicated above,&apos; flooding began with the thaw in the south on 9th March. But although there was heavy flooding from such southern riversystems as the Medway, the Sussex Rother, and the Bristol Avon, it was not ofsuch an exceptional character as to give rise to comment in the light of subsequentflooding in other river systems. The flooding thereafter spread northward withthe thaw to central England and East Anglia. The river systems on whichabnormal flooding occurred during the last three weeks of March and the early part of April, and which are the mam subject of this report, are the Wye, the severn, the Thames, the Lee, the Trent, the Yorkshire Ouse, the Hull and thefour Fenland river systems the Great Ouse, the Nene, the Welland and theWitham and Steeping Rivers.   The Catchment Areas of these rivers cover the* Cusecs ^ cubic feet per second.
greater part of central and eastern England and the maximum area under floodwater from the overflowing of the river banks, the breach of embankments or atemporary failure to discharge waters from internal drainage systems into high-level watercourses amounted to some 690,000 acres.YL-Different Categories of Flooding19. In studying the causes and course of the floods and the remedial action taken it is necessary to differentiate between three main types of flooding. a distinction must be drawn between natural rivers, the artificially embanked riversflowing through the Fens and the internal drains in the Fens discharging throughpumping stations.Natural Watercourses20. In the case of natural rivers, the capacity of the actual river channel isseldom more than a quarter to one-third of normal peak flood flows. Provision ismade by nature for excess waters to pass through the river valley. Riparian landliable to flooding is not or should not be developed for commercial, domestic or industrial purposes; and when in agricultural use, the land is reserved for grazing.In floods of exceptional magniture, however, such as were experienced in 1947,river levels have risen to such a height as temporarily to inundate built-up areasadjacent to the normal flood path of the river and arable land normally free fromflooding. When the discharge of water from the uplands abates, the watersgravitate naturally off the flooded land back into the river channels. The excessof flood discharges in natural river systems over the normal capacity of the riveris so immense that no reasonably practicable scheme of works to avoid flooding atall times could be devised or even contemplated. The Chairman of the RiverThames Conservancy, in a recent statement, estimated that it might cost at least 50,000,000 to attempt to alter the main channels of the River Thames system to contain floods entirely within the river channels. The most that can be effected by engineering works in such natural rivers is to carry out improvement schemes,which are inevitably costly, to avert flooding at key points, leaving land of lesseconomic value to flood when there is an abnormal rise in the river levels.Effect of Mining Subsidence and Unwise Development21. In some areas adjoining natural water courses the problem of floodinghas been seriously aggravated by mining subsidence; and in others by industrialor domestic development in the past century, which has restricted the naturalchannel of the river, preventing improvement works, and has increased the run-offin times of flood from the adjacent built-up areas. In other areas, bad planning in earlier years has led to development on land that forms the natural flood pathof river systems. It is difficult to undo the mistakes of the past but good planning should avoid any similar mistakes being made in the future. Aerial photographicsurveys taken by the Air Ministry at the request of my Department and theMinistry of Town and Country Planning during the present abnormal floods will serve to indicate areas on which development should not take place.Fen Rivers22. It is principally in the Fen areas that engineering works have been devised to avoid the flooding of very valuable agricultural land. In the Fenrivers, water from the uplands has to be conveyed across the Fens in embankedchannels. As an example, the Great Ouse and its tributaries drain some 2 million acres, and the waters from the highlands have to be passed through the low-lyingFen areas, which themselves cover some 350,000 acres on their way to the sea atKing&apos;s Lynn, the banks of these rivers being raised high above the level of the surrounding land. The banks should be of sufficient height and strength to contain the maximum river flows that can be expected and protect from inunda-tion the surrounding agricultural land which is of high economic value. As &amp;relief measure in time of floods, certain areas are deliberately reserved as wash-lands to act as flood relief reservoirs. The Fen embankments are frequentlylocated in areas where the underlying soil is peat, which is subject to continuousshrinkage, which may cause the banks to settle by anything up to 6 inches perannum. The banks need, therefore, to be continuously raised and reinforced toensure their efficacy. Towns and villages in the Fens are built on higher land,but the land below the level of the embanked rivers is intensively cultivated.It is served by its own complicated network of internal drains leading to pumping
stations at which the internal fen water is pumped,into the main embanked riverchannels carrying highland water through the Fens. A breach in the embank.-&apos;ments in the Fens therefore represents a failure of a man-made engineering work;and causes widespread, inundation often to a considerable depth which does not wholly gravitate naturally back into the main river when the water level subsides though it may in part through the breach, before it is sealed. Flood: water inthe Fens caused by the breach or over-topping of main river embankments needs to be pumped back, which is a long and laborious process.Overcharging of Internal Fen Drainage Systems23. Apart from the flooding caused by rises in the level of natural watercourses or breaches in Fen embankments, there is a third type of flooding whichneeds to be distinguished and which occurs when the volume of water from internal fen drains to be discharged is temporarily beyond the capacity of thepumping station to handle, or the volume of highland water passing down themain river is at such a level as to impede the discharge of water from the pumpingstation. These factors may cause flooding or waterlogging which is of shortduration relative to that caused in internal drainage systems by breaches in theembankments of the main river systems which pass through them. Considerableflooding of this nature did, however, occur during March, and there was furtherflooding through the temporary blocking of internal drains by ice, which mustbe added to the general picture of the flood situation. In fact, the whole MiddleLevel System of the Great Ouse Catchment area covering some 116,000 acreswas threatened during the week-end of 15th-16th March by block ice floatingdown the main drain to the great pumping station at St. Germans, which wassmashed by gangs of prisoners with poles when it came up against the weedscreen.YII. Remedial Works on Natural Watercourses24. So far as the flooding from natural watercourses is concerned, myinvestigations will, in general, relate to the need and practicability of long-termworks for the protection of key points, and to measures for- limiting flooding tothose areas where it will cause least damage. I shall, for example, expect to learn from the Thames Conservancy of long-term projects to avert flooding atReading, Maidenhead and Windsor, and to ensure that there is no threat to theMetropolitan Water Board works at Hampton. The Lee Conservancy has a majorscheme of works incorporated in an Act of 1938 which, has been deferred owingto the war and since then, owing to the current shortage of labour and materials,to prevent flooding in the Edmonton and Tottenham districts This scheme is aprerequisite to improvement work in the upper reaches of the river, and would no doubt, if it had been carried out, have averted the damage which in factoccurred to the filter beds of the Metropolitan Water Board. The River SevernCatchment Board has, amongst other matters, long-term proposals for wideningthe river between Gloucester and Tewkesbury, which are partly dependent ona navigation scheme on this stretch of the river. The Trent Catchment Boardhas in preparation a scheme for avoidance of flooding in and around Nottingham,the details of which are at present the subject of technical investigation and thepreparation of models to decide the precise works that are necessary. All these schemes and others will be fully explored with the Catchment Boards concerned,with a view where possible to expediting the work. In general, however, theproblems of the natural watercourses do not call for emergency action to securethe river system against flooding before next winter.YIII. Remedial Works in Internal Drainage Districts25. The flooding of internal districts in the Fens can be remedied in general by the provision of more or better pumping equipment, and the position in each area will be fully explored with the Boards concerned with a view to hasteningthe provision of the necessary installations. In so far as the trouble has arisenthrough, the inability of the main river to take water pumped out of the internaldrains, the question of main river improvement works is raised and will be explored. .IX. Fenland Rivers: Action taken and Proposed26. It is in connexion with the flooding from main rivers in Fen areas,where the embankments have been breached or overtopped, that emergency work is necessary and that the demand for a formal inquiry is most likely to be pressed.,
Demands for ian inquiry are likely to be directed to (a) failure to press on withlong-term flood prevention measures; (&amp;) failure to take the necessary preparatoryaction before the onset of the floods; (c) failure to take action on the scale requiredwhile the floods were occurring; (d) the need for pressing on urgently with short-term action to reinstate embankments that were breached, and reinforce embank-ments that have been damaged or weakened by the floods.27. The remainder of this report deals with the action taken and proposedin these cases and relates to the Great Ouse, the Nene, the Welland, the Withamand Steeping Rivers and the lower reaches of the Trent and Yorkshire Ouse.It can be classified, under 5 headings : (a) preparation;(b) emergency action;(c) de-watering;(d) re-habilitation;(e) long-term improvement works.X -Fen FloodsA. Preparations28. Most drainage engineers had realised, while the snow was still on theground, that there would be at least a normal major flood; but they could not reasonably have been expected to predict in advance that there would be a floodof the magnitude which actually occurred. Flood organisations were, however,standing by. The Ministry itself made certain contacts to ensure that suppliesof sandbags, assistance by way of communications, prisoner labour, &amp;c, wouldbe available when the need arose.XL-Fen FloodsB. Emergency ActionInterdepartmental A rrangements29. In the middle of March, when it was clear that exceptional floods were on the way, officers of my Land Drainage Division went into the Fen areas to assess the need for help. On their return immediate arrangements were made to ensurethat help was given on the scale and with the degree of urgency required. Subse-quently, on 25th March, following a meeting convened by the Home Office, myDepartment called an urgent meeting of the Services and Supply Departments, tocodify and extend the arrangements already made. All requirements of men, jmaterials and equipment needed for dealing with the floods were tabled. It wasa long list, the items on which ranged from giant cranes to picks and shovels.The Department principally concerned with each item accepted responsibility forits supply on call and for co-ordinating further resources that might be availablein other Departments. Contact officers with night and day telephone numberswere nominated in each Department. Instructions were issued to Regions andCommands as to local co-operation. Following this meeting, a directive was givenby the Prime Minister on 27th March (CP. (47) 115) in the following terms : &quot; In the interests of food production, it is essential that there should beno delay in draining flooded farmlands.&quot; During the next month, allocating Departments should do all they canto meet all necessary demands for labour and equipment required for thispurpose even though this may mean giving such demands precedence oveother urgent demands.&quot;Full Co-operation between Departments30. I cannot speak too highly of the degree of co-operation given by mjcolleagues and the officers of their Departments in meeting our needs in the floode.1areas.; It was heartening not only to myself and my Department, but to thdrainage and local government authorities and the landowners, farmers and fanworkers affected by the flooding. The tales of helpfulness^ ingenuity and resourcefulness are legion. No effort was spared by anyone who had a contribution t(make and the highest praise and thanks have been received from all areas for whacan only be described as a magnificent effort of Government Organisation an(
co-operation. Quite apart, from the immense; psychological effect of, providingimmediate assistance, from Government resources qn this-scale, wherever it was needed, there is no doubt that the action taken very greatly reduced the incidence of the flooding and the loss and damage that, might, otherwise have been causedthereby.Financial Assistance31. I was able to make an early announcement &amp;m 24-th Maise-hi, whilst theflood waters were still rising, thiat all this assistance ir&amp;m Government resources would: be provided without any charge to thei,Catchment Boards concerned ansdthat, expenditure incurred by the C.*6c^^,Be*a&apos;^fctosa4v^ ;oftaWQp?s8s, $4 &amp;nature comparable with those: provided by the Government in other ajjeas, wouldbe fully met from Goveinmemt  rands.: This announcement, gave the CatchmentBoards, the necessary assurance which anahled them to put all their efforts into thework of stemming the flood waters without, thought of the cost, I was also ableto announce: increased Goverament grants, towards works of rehabilitation,., towhich I, refer in greater detail below, which had a similar reassuring effectDirect. Action by- Ministry Qrf Agrimltwe-. Dutch. Co-operatim32. The officers and engineers of my Department worked night and day toensure that action was- being taken in all areas oh the scale required and were inclose and constant touch, both personally and1 by telephone, with the drainageauthorities concerned. In certain areas special action was necessary.- Inparticular, a breach in the banks of the River Trent below Gainsborough hadflooded some 29s,0Q&amp; acres of rich agricultural land and reports were received that the work of closing the breach was not being pressed forward as energeticallyas the situation demanded. Accordingly, Ministry officials went to Gainsboroughon Thursday, 3rd April, and virtually assumed control of the Catchment Board&quot; operations on this breach wifeh a view to ensuring that all resources of men,materials and equipment necessary to close the breach without delay were broughtinto action. In the course of Good Friday and Easter Saturday, arrangements were made which have since secured the desired result of closing the breach andwhich included the bringing over from Holland of giant, eranes on floatingpontoons. In; this enterprise I have had a most encouraging degree of good willand helpfulness from the Dutch Government and in particular from Dr. JohannesRingers, former Minister of Public Works in the Netherlands Government.Voluntary Help33. It is noteworthy that at no time has it been necessary to consider theuse of emergency powers. Help has been given from all sources on request withoutdelay and without question and much further help has been given spontaneouslyby people who had a part to play without waiting to be asked. The spirit of mutual helpfulness in the flooded areas has been the spirit which inspiredDunkirk.XII-Fen FloodsC^-De-WateringMobilisation of Emergency Pumps34. Whilst the breaches in the Fen embankments were still occurring, :myDepartment was actively preparing for the nexfc stage--the clearance of water fromthe flooded Fen areas after the breaches had been sealed; and I was able to make an announcement on this matter also on 24th March. - Two Depots were establised for the assembly and despatch of emergency pumping equipment at aerodromes in War boys, Huntingdonshire, and at Snaith, Yorkshire, and. an engineer from my Department took charge of each of these Depots. Heavy, pumping equipmentwas supplied on a liberal scale, together with engineering staff and fitters to bring it into action on the flooded sites by the Admiralty, the N.F.S;, the PortsmouthCorporation, the Metropolitan Water Board and other authorities; More recently with the co-operation of the Dutch Government-17 pumps larger than anyavailable from stock in this country have been brought across the North Sea andare now in action. These pumps were surplus stock provided by the Allies forde-watering operations in the flooded areas of the Netherlands at the end of thewar. As an indication of the magnitude of the task of bringing these pumpsinto action, it may be mentioned that one of them, with its auxiliary equipment[33635] c
required twenty lorries to transport it, and its erection on the site adjacent tothe river bank in the flooded area has been a major engineering feat. Some 250large pumps of all types have been brought together and sent to the flooded areasthrough my Departments organisation, and again I cannot speak too highly ofthe magnificent co-operation I have received from my colleagues, and their officersin the other Departments.Effect oj pumping on clearance of&apos; water ..     &apos;&apos; &apos;&quot;&apos; 35. The areas subject to shallow inundation or waterlogging were speedilycleared with the assistance of these pumps; and in other areas where thepermanent pumping equipment had gone under water, the emergency pumps were able to lower the water levels and enable the main pumping stations to go into action again. Areas subject to deep inundation will, however, inevitably take some time to clear of flood water, however great the resources that have beenmobilized. In addition to these emergency pumping arrangements my Depart-ment received the highest degree of co-operation from engineering firms in night and day work to bring back into action permanent pumping stations damaged byflood waters. There is no doubt that this emergency pumping organisation has enabled tens of thousands of acres of land to be cleared rapidly of water and tocarry crops this season with the most valuable and important effect on our urgentfood production needs. Apart from this practical effect of saving land for foodproduction, there is no doubt that, as with the other forms of government assistance, the rapid mobilization of emergency pumping equipment has had animmensely heartening effect on the farmers whose lands have been flooded andhas assured them of the direct and practical concern, of the Government in theirmisfortunes. ,Financial Assistance towards pumping costs        i , .&apos; ,36. The Government is, of course, bearing the cost of the supply ofemergency pumping equipment which was given in, the national interest to save the maximum possible area of land for food production. I propose also that theGovernment should bear the running costs of; these emergency pumps,in so far asthey may have fallen on Catchment Boards or Internal Drainage Boards. Afurther financial point arises in this connexion. The fixed pumping equipmentmaintained by Internal Drainage Boards is normally only .called upon , to: dis-charge internal water. As a result of breaches in the main river embankmentsit is being called upon to carry out the much heavier task of pumping backflood water into the main rivers and very heavy expenditure is being incurred onthis work by Internal Drainage Boards, which is in many cases far beyond their financial resources. My Department is suggesting to Catchment Boards that theyshould reimburse Internal Drainage Boards for extra costs incurred by them inpumping back into the main river flood waters caused by breaches in the embank-ments; and it is proposed that this reimbursement, by Catchment Boards shouldbe regarded as part of the speciaJl emergency expenditure which is to rank for100 per cent, grant as indicated in paragraph 31 above.XIII.-Fen FloodsD. RehabilitationUrgent short-term works      ... f - I -     i!:37. I have mentioned in paragraph 15 above that the discussions myDepartment^ is holding with individual Catchment Boards will cover the short-term measures necessary to reinstate the breached embankments and to reinforcethose embankments which have been damaged or weakened as&apos;a1 result of the floods.In iny announcement of 24th March I stated that this rehabilitation work in thecase of Catchment Boards would rank for a grant 20 per cent, above the ratenormally paid to Catchment Boards for their schemes of works, with a maximumgrant of 90 per cent. It is imperative that the work necessary to prevent anyrecurrence of the flooding should be pressed forward energetically and that the banks should be reinstated by the end of the autumn so as to enable them to contendwith any normal major floods that may be experienced next winter. I am asking for detailed estimates of requirements for men, materials and equipment for thispurpose and information as to any shortages or delays in delivery that are likelyto hold up the execution of the works so that my Department can take all possible steps to overcome them.  It is not at present possible to indicate precisely what is
involved, but it can already be said that the magnitude of the works that will need to be carried out in the next six months is very much greater than is generallyrealised. My Department has already had a preliminary discussion with theRiver Welland Catchment Board, whose problems are likely to be less than thoseof many other areas, and of the Groat Ouse Catchment Area in particular.Nevertheless, the River Welland Catchment Board estimate that to safeguard:the area against a recurrence of flooding next, winter it,will be; necessary, to recon-struct some: 30 miles of river embankments at a cost of some  200,000. When therequirements of all Catomnent Boards have been assembled it will be clear thatthe need for urgent action and priorities in the supply of men, materials andlabour over the next. six months will be no less great than it has been in con-nection with the emergency works of recent weeks. The main work in connectionwith rehabilitation will consist of the transport and deposit of clay and otherembanking materials. The main requirement will; be for. spoil-moving equip-ment, such as excavators, bulldozers, scrapers and dumpers. Labour additional to the normal resources of Catchment Boards and their contractors of the Orderof up to 2,000 additional men will be required. Steel and: timber for short-termworks will be required, but the quantities. will not be large.;: More substantial quantities will.be required for long-term flood prevention works.Essential priorities38. / would there fore ask from the Cabinet that all Departments should beasked to continue to place their resources readily at my disposal and to afford allthe necessary priorities for the supply of men, materials and equipment to enablethe essential short-term work to be pressed forward without delay and&quot;completed before next winter, and to avoid undue delay in the execution of important long-term flood prevention works.Special allocation of materials39. Hitherto the supplies of materials particularly of steel obtained inconnection with the recent emergency have been carried on my own Department&apos;sallocation, which is now neariiig exhaustion; and in view of the Prime Minister&apos;sdirective referred to in para. 29 above, we have felt it proper to regard suppliesof sceel required in connection With the flood emergency as being outside theDepartment s normal allocation, The amount involved is only 600 tons. Ishould be glad therefore if it could be agreed that all materials, particularly steel,and also timber used in connection with the recent emergency action, or requiredin connection with the works of rehabilitation over the next six months, should becarried on a special allocation additional to the.normal allocation of my DeParf-ment. I shall also heed priority for equipment for permanent pumping stationswhich require to be installed before next winter. Amongst other materials requiredfor long-term works &quot;will be quantities of steel sheet piling. I understand thatsurplus War Office stocks of steel sheet piling which have been declared redundantin recent months were passed to the Ministry of Supply for disposal and are inthe process of exportation to sterling areas. My Department was not consulted before enquiries overseas were made and I understand that, as contracts havebeen signed, it is desirable that the export should be completed. I must therefore ask for a special allocation of new material to be made and I estimate thatrequirements during the next two years may be of the order of 12 to 15,000tons. It will be seen that requirements of materials apart from this demandare not in general large. The important issue is to ensure that there is no delay in their delivery, if so far as is humanly possible further flooding is to be avoided.&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos; &quot;Clearance of internal drains and farm ditches40. In addition to the rehabilitation Works mentioned above, many internaldrains and farm ditches on land covered by flood waters will have been chokedup by silt&apos; and will heed cleairing rapidly when the flood waters have subsided toenable the land to be brought back into production. I was able to announce inmy Statement on 24th March that the Government would give grants in respectof such restoration work at the rate of 75 per cent-as compareu with fhe normalrate of 50 per cent.-for the clearance of internal drains and farm ditches inthose areas which had been submerged as a result of breaches, in flood embank-mentsi&apos; My Department has mobilised all its resources of excavating and other equipment so as to enable this particular aspect of the work of rehabilitation tobe carried out urgently immediately it becomes possible to do so.[33635] D
Comparison between special rehabilitation grants to Catchment Boards and internal Drainage Boards41. There has been some comment that whereas my announcement of24th March provided for grants up to a rate of 90 per cent, towards works ofrehabilitation carried out by Catchment Boards, grants of 75 per cent, only havebeen offered for restoration&quot; works to Internal Drainage Boards whose resources are in many cases small. It is necessary to mention firstly that all Internal Drain-age Boards in normal circumstances under Section 15 of the Agriculture Act,1937, receive a flat rate of grant of 50 per cent, and the emergency grant repre-sents an increase of 25 per cent, over this figure. Grants under Section 55 of theLand Drainage Act, 1930, towards improvement works carried out by CatchmentBoards, however, vary according to the resources of&quot; the catchment area. In some areas, e.g., the Thames, no grant has so far been payable. In the Trent CatchmentArea the normal rate of grant is only 30 per cent. The highest rate of grant payable o,part from sea defence works which dc not enter into the question in this case is 75 per cent. The special grant for works of rehabilitation is tobe 20 per cent, above the normal rate, with a maximum of 90 per cent. There isno reason to suggest, therefore, that Catchment Boards are in general being treatedmore generously in the matter of emergency grants than Internal Drainage Boards.Apart from this, however, the expenditure on rehabilitation in respect of theirflood embankments in the Fens falling on Catchment Boards will be immeasurablygreater than the expenditure falling on Internal Drainage Boards. The proposalI have suggested in paragraph 36 above whereby Catchment Boards wouldreimburse Internal Drainage Boards for the cost of special pumping to clear floodwaters and would include it as part of their emergency expenditure, will assistfurther to ease the burden falling on Internal Drainage Boards. There are,however, a few special cases in which special assistance is required as set out in following paragraphs.North Level: breach in the Barrier Bank42. The North Level Internal Drainage Board falls within the CatchmentArea of the River Nene. It is protected to the north-west by the North LevelBarrier Bank in the neighbourhood of Crowland. Adjacent to the North LevelBarrier Bank are the Crowland and Cowbit Washes which act as a flood reliefreservoir for the River Welland. As a result of a law-suit in 1937 between theNorth Level Commissioners and the River Welland Catchment Board theresponsibility for the maintenance of the Barrier Bank was placed on the NorthLevel Commission. During the recent floods in the Welland, the Crowland andCowbit Washes were full and there was nevertheless grave danger of a breach inthe river embankment near Spalding. This danger was relieved by the occurrence of a breach in the North Level Barrier Bank which resulted in the flooding ofsome 15,000 acres of valuable agricultural land. The breach was temporarilysealed by the, placing of tanks, but high winds and water levels broke throughagain and caused further extensive flooding. The cost to the North Level Com-missioners of dealing with and disposing of the flood water and subsequently ofrebuilding the Barrier Bank will be very substantial and may prove not to be suchas could be met by the special emergency grant of 75 per cent, which I have proposed for Internal Drainage Boards generally. I am considering, therefore,whether it would be proper to treat the breaching of the North Level Barrier bank and the works of rehabilitation as a special issue and to make a grant at a higher rate than 75 per cent, available to the North Level Commissioners.A reas of deep and prolonged inundation43. Although most flooded areas will be cleared of water in time to enable a crop to be sown for harvesting this year, and farmers&apos; returns on late sowncrops will be safeguarded by the special acreage payments, there will be approxi-mately 40,000 acres, of which about half will be in the South Level system of theGreat Ouse Catchment area, which will remain under water until it is too latefor a crop to be sown. The farmers in some fens will have no returns from thesale of crops for 12 months. The problem of payment, of drainage rates in these areas needs to be settled. These rates, levied on owners and occupiers of land inthe drainage district, cover four principal items : loan charges on past works,administrative costs, the cost of current works including the works of rehabilitation-tion, and contributions levied by the Catchment Board. It will clearly beimpossible to demand the payment of drainage rates from owners and occupiers of land, many of whom are small men, which is under flood water.  In Holland,
when areas are inundated to this extent, it is the practice to declare a &quot;calamitypolder,&quot; and all liabilities of the area are met by the Government until the land isrestored. I would propose that in these few cases in the Fens, the CatchmentBoard should make a contribution to the Drainage Boards concerned of the amount of the rate to be levied for the next twelve-monthly period; and thatthis contribution should be included in the Catchment Boards&apos; accounts ofemergency expenditure ranking for 100 per cent, grant as indicated in para-graphs 31 and 36 above.XIY.-Fen FloodsE.--Long-Term Improvement Works44. It is noteworthy that in at least three of the areas where major floodinghas occurred works were in contemplation at the outbreak of the war or duringthe war years which if completed might have averted or alleviated the disaster.I refer to the flood protection scheme of the Great Ouse Catchment Board,estimated to cost some  3,500,000, which was designed to cut a new Channel to relieve the South Level system of the area, in which the main flooding hasoccurred; the River Lee Improvement Scheme, estimated to cost  2 million; andthe scheme of the River Welland Catchment Board, approved last year at a cost of close on  1 million, which included provision for a by-pass to increasethe capacity of the river and avoid the bottleneck at Spalding, whose completionmight have enabled the safe passage of the waters to the sea and averted the breach in the North Level Barrier Bank, together with other flooding that hastaken place in the Welland. Beyond this, the schemes of river improvement aroundNottingham in particular, which were being prepared by the Trent CatchmentBoard m the years before the war and whose progress has been necessarily deferred,might well have averted to some degree the recurrent flooding in certain partsof the river. The Yorkshire Ouse Catchment Area likewise have been proceedingsteadily with works to widen and improve the Channels of the River Don witha view to alleviating the recurrent flooding in the areas adjacent to the river.I propose to discuss these and other long-term improvement schemes with theCatchment Boards concerned and to take all steps open to me to ensure that theworks are pressed forward without undue delay. My colleagues will, however,appreciate that even if it were not for the delays caused by the war and thtcurrent shortage of labour and materials, long-term improvement schemes of this character must necessarily take some time to complete and cannot be hurried.Often the people affected by the flooding are liable to be impatient at what seemsto them to be an unnecessary delay in pressing on with remedial works; but itis essential that works of flood, prevention should be technically sound as thestrength of a river embankment lies in its weakest point, and detailed engineeringsurveys and calculations are necessary before effective works are put in hand.XY. LegislationRiver Boards45. My colleagues will be aware that it is hoped to introduce early next session a River Boards Bill giving effect to the recommendations made by theCentral Advisory Water Committee in 1943, and endorsed, in the White paper on a National Water Policy in 1944 and subsequently, that comprehensive bodiesto take over existing functions relating to land drainage, fisheries and pollutionshould be constituted. All parties, and all interests represented on the central advisory Water Committee are pressing for the introduction of this measure;and I do not think the recent floods, or any indications they may give of theneed for amendment of land drainage legislation will necessitate the re-casting ofthis Bill or call for its deferment.Land Drainage Legislation46. At its meeting on 21st February, the Central Advisory Water Com-mittee at my request appointed a sub-Committee to review land drainagelegislation and make proposals for its amendment. This sub-Committee hasalready met twice, and has sent out a questionnaire inviting evidence from the associations chiefly concerned on the main points of principle and policy involvedin the proposal to amend the Land Drainage Act. The sub-Committee will naturally take fully into account in its deliberations the lessons to be learntfrom the floods. I think it can already be said, however, that the floods havenot indicated the need for any radical alteration in land drainage administration
over and above proposals already noted for consideration in connexion withthe possible amendment of the Act. before the floods occurred. The constitutionalframework of Catchment Boards and Internal Drainage Boards provided forin the Land Drainage Act, 1930. passed into law by the first Labour Government,lhas stood up well to the test provided by the greatest floods ever recorded in ourhistory.. - .&apos; .      t    -.-hXYl. Conclusion47. I would therefore ask my colleagues in the course of the next six monthsf or the same degree of assistance in men, materials, equipment and prioritiesfor carrying through works of rehabilitation to prevent flooding next winter,as has been so readily accorded in the recent weeks of flood emergency and also for assistance in pressing forward with long-term flood prevention works;; andI would repeat again my sincere thanks both oh behalf of my Department, the drainage Authorities and the farming community for the magnificent degree ofco-operation that has been unstintingly afforded by all concerned.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S\W.\,. l$th May, 1947.   .
