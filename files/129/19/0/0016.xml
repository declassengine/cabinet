(47) 16629th May, 1947CABINETREPORT ON THE FOURTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC and social council memorandum by the Minister of state circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the FourthSession of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, which washeld from 28th February to 29th March, 1947.H. McN.Foreign Office, 29th May, 1947.annex report on the Fourth Session of the Economic and Social Council of theUnited NationsIntroductionThe Fourth Session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council washeld from) 28th February to 29th March, 1947, and was thus the longest Sessionyet held. The Agenda was very full, and this naturally resulted in some of thework being of a hurried nature. Despite this it was, however, the most successfulSession held so far and marked by a good degree of co-operation between Delega-tions, by a more business-like atmosphere than hitherto in the proceedings, andon the whole by a freedom from violent political clashes.2. His Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government in the United Kingdom were representedfrom 28th February to 8th March by the Minister of State, and from then untilthe end of the Council by the Parliamentary Undersecretary. .3. The Delegates to the Council were of high standing and includedMr. Walter Nash, Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. George Davidson,Deputy Minister of1 Welfare of Canada, and Dr. E. Van Kleffens, former Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. .4. It is satisfactory that the Council during its Fourth Session took threeimportant steps to improve its methods of business :--(a) By requiring the Secretary-General to submit to the Council a summaryreport of the financial implications of any proposal.(b) By the setting up of an Agenda Committee to review the provisionalAgenda each time before the Council meets.(c) By making orderly arrangements for  consideration of  the yearlyprogramme of meetings.5.   Among the main economic items considered by the Council were : -(a) Economic Commission for Europe. The Council formally set up theEconomic Commission for Europe, the first session of which has just been held.14099   [33690]
(b) Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The Council formallyset up the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and established its initial membership, geographical scope and terms ofreference.(c) International Shipping Conference-The Council approved the callingof a Shipping Conference late in 1947, and recommended that theConference take as the basis for discussion the draft Convention drawnup by the United Maritime Consultative Council, which is largelybased on a United Kingdom draft. On India&apos;s initiative, however,the Conference is also to consider the &quot; removal and prevention ofunfair restrictive practices by (private) shipping concerns.&quot; this extension goes beyond the original idea of the Conference and was opposed by the United Kingdom Delegation.6.   Among the social questions considered by the Council were : (a) International Bill of Human Rights. The preliminaries for the drafting of this Bill were decided and it was agreed that the final draft, as approved by the Council, should, if possible, go to the General assembly in 1948.(b) Freedom of Information: It was agreed that a Conference on Freedomof Information should be held early in 1948.(c) Social Commission. The United Kingdom Delegation found it necessaryto criticise the report of this Commission, mainly with a view to ensuring that the Commission should focus its attention on certain essential tasks and not range over too wide a field. The UnitedKingdom efforts met with a certain degree of success.(d) Status of Women Commission. The report of this Commission was themost unsatisfactory in both style and content of all the Commissions&apos;reports. The United Kingdom Delegation therefore circulated a draft memorandum drawing attention to the need for the Commission to concentrate on practical tasks of immediate importance. The UnitedKingdom views, though at first strongly opposed, later found a certaindegree of acceptance.7. During its previous Session the Council has debated at some length therights of the most important non-governmental organisations, including the WorldFederation of Trade Unions. The General Assembly had recommended inDecember that these organisations should have the right to propose items forthe Provisional Agenda of the Council, and the W.F.T.U. had tabled an itemrelating to the guarantee of the exercise and development of Trade Union rights.It was first necessary, however, for the Council to determine what amendments were needed in its Rules of Procedure in order to give effect to the general assembly&apos;s recommendations, and this question was solved by the setting up of an agenda Committee and by a provision for preliminary consultation between an organisation and the Secretary-General before an item is placed on the provisionalAgenda.8. The substance of the W.F.T.U. item was then discussed. The UnitedKingdom Delegate urged that since it was clearly related to freedom of associa-tion, it was within the competence of the International Labour Organisation towhich it should first be referred. The United States Delegation added a proposalfor simultaneous reference to the Human Rights Commission. Despite an attempt by the Soviet Delegate to secure postponement of consideration of the item untilthe next Council Session, the United Kingdom and United States proposals were finally agreed by the Council.
