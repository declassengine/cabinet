THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1947CSopy^No. 31CABINETEUROPEAN RECONSTRUCTION AND THE UNITED STATES OFFERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may care to see the annexed report on my recent conversations with the French Government. E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,.     23rd June, 1947,report  ARRIVED in Paris on the afternoon of 17th June and at once held ameeting with the Ambassador, my advisers and members of his staff. It wasdecided at that meeting that we should hand to the French the text of the note(Annex A) which had been prepared and approved in -London. -*Mr, Duff Cooper gave a dinner party for me in the evening, which was attended by M, Ramadier, M. Bidault, M. Monnet and a number of high officials of the Quai d&apos;Orsay and other French Departments, After the dinnerM. Ramadier, M. Bidault and myself had a useful informal discussion, as a resultof which we found We were in agreement on many points of substance. We bothrecognised the importance of the Marshall proposal and the urgency of takingthe initiative and of preparing a report at a very early date on the steps necessaryto achieve European reconstruction. We agreed that the initiative must be takenby the European Governments Outside the framework of the United Nations, sinceto remit the task of preparing the plan to the Economic Commission for Europecould only result in delay. We both recognised, however, that it was essential toavoid the impression of by-passing the United Nations and that some steps mustbe taken at the forthcoming meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe toobtain, if possible, the blessing of that body to the steps taken in advance of its meeting and its endorsement of the proposals for preparing a reply to the Marshalloffer. We both agreed that it would be necessary to set up a special steering-committee charged with the preparation of the plan and a series of ad hoccommittees to cover commodities of outstanding importance, such as coal, cereals and steel. It became clear in the course of the discussion that the french ministers, and in particular M. Ramadier, regarded it as essential, because ofthe internal political &quot;situation in France, that before any definite decisions were taken between us the Russians should be given the opportunity of joining in our deliberations. -At the meeting which took place at 11 a.m. on the morning of 18th June atthe Quai d&apos;Orsay, M. Bidault summarised the points of agreement reached andproceeded to raise as the item principally calling for discussion the questions ofan invitation to the Russians. He announced that a decision had been taken atthe French Council of Ministers that morning confirming the line which had beentaken on this question by M- Ramadier and myself on the previous evening. Itwas clear that progress on any other basis than that of a prior invitation to the Russians would be impossible, and M. Bidault even suggested that we should both go to Moscow the following week to confer with M. Molotov. I said thatI was willing to discuss the- form and nature of the invitation, but that I musthave a prior assurance that if the Soviet reply to such an invitation were negativeor non-committal the British and French Governments would proceed to set upthe committees charged with the task of preparing a plan and themselves inviteother European  Governments  to participate  in  an  appropriate  manner.14166   [33813] BSECRETCP. (47) 18823rd June; 1947
M* Bidault replied that lie wished to make it clear that the French government did not intend to subordinate the action which it took on Mr. MarshalTs proposalto the attitude of Russia and he indicated that the main concern of the FrenchGovernment was to disarm domestic criticism to the effect that Russia had notbeen given in good faith a full and cordial opportunity to join in the discussions at the outset. For this reason he attached great importance to the terms of the invitation. We must avoid the impression of putting a pistol to M. Molotov&apos;shead either by mention of a specific date for the further meeting or by not offeringM. Molotov some place of meeting other than London or Paris. We must alsoavoid any suggestion that the meeting would be held anyhow whether the Russiansaccepted or not. I said that I was not prepared to go to Moscow merely to courta rebuff. I should prefer that the meeting should be held either in London orParis, or in any case in some place other than Moscow, and that M. Molotov shouldbe so informed. If there was any desire to collaborate on the part of the soviet authorities they would surely be able to authorise M. Molotov to come to Parisor London for this important purpose. We left it that our advisers would draftah invitation which would be addressed to M. Molotov personally, and a press communique announcing the conclusions of the talks, which we would considertogether at a further meeting at 6 p.m.At midday we learned that M. Rourdan, the French Minister of information had announced on his personal responsibility that M. Bidault and I had decidedto set up a European Economic Commission [sic] for the purpose of preparing a european reconstruction plan, and that we were issuing an invitation to theRussians to join us. T.his premature announcement, which greatly agitatedM. Bidault, was most unfortunate, particularly as in the course of the afternoonthe story was denied at a press conference given at the Quai d&apos;Orsay. Theseconflicting reports having appeared in the Press, we decided at the eveningmeeting that it would be desirable to issue the official communique immediately.Since, however, it would have been discourteous to do so until the message hadbeen delivered to the Russians, we thought it best to arrange for the SovietCharge d&apos;Affaires in Paris to be handed a copy of the message in the early eveningas well as for it to be telegraphed to the British and French Ambassadors in moscow for delivery to M, Molotov. The Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires was dulyhanded copies of the message in French and English by M. Bidault and myselfon his return from what was alleged to have been an afternoon in the country;our reasons for selecting this method of transmission were explained, to him and he undertook to pass them on to M- Molotov when delivering the message.The text of the message to M. Molotov and of the press communique as finally agreed are contained in Annexes B and C. It will be observed that on thequestion of the place of the further meeting we finally compromised; the press communique leaving the question open, the message to M. Molotov expressing a preference for Paris or London, but offering to meet him half-way if necessary.The French wanted specifically to suggest Stockholm, but I felt that this was going too far and that it would be better to leave M. Molotov to make anycompromise suggestions if he was willing to meet us at all.In the course of the evening discussions I asked M. Bidault point blankwhether I could assume that the French Government would be ready to have afurther meeting with us during the week beginning 23rd June whatever thenature of the Russian reply. M. Bidault reflected for some time beforeanswering this question; he finally said that he did not think he could necessarilyundertake at this moment to attend a meeting at which the Russians were not present before 28th June, but he certainly thought that it would be essentialto have such a meeting in time to prepare a plan of action before the meeting ofthe Economic Commission for Europe on 5th July.  ,Meanwhile, our experts had been considering how the task could be under-taken with or without Russian collaboration from the outset. They exchangedviews on the sources of information available and other questions relating to theposition of the particular commodities for which ad hoc committees would haveto be set up. It was agreed that we should compare notes at our next meetingafter the experts on both sides had given further thought to the problems involved.We also agreed an agenda for this meeting (Annex D), it being understood thatif the Russians attended the meeting one or other of us would propose thisagenda without giving any indication that it had been agreed in advance:Apart from the Russian difficulty the two points on which we are likely tohave a difference of opinion with the French are the precise manner in whichthe Economic Commission for Europe should be brought into the picture andthe procedure for setting up the steering committee of experts and the ad hoc
committees. With regard to the latter point the French appear.to favour the calling of a procedural conference of European Powers. In my view this would greatly delay the proceedings and it is essential that &quot;two or three- sponsoringpowers should take upon themselves the responsibility of issuing invitations toselected individuals of a suitable calibre oh a* basis which ensures widegeographical representation. We shall have to discuss both these points further with the French at pur next meeting. In their present state of: mind it wasimpossible to get them to take a clear position; but,they are at least fully aware of our views.The results of the meeting are not as positive as I would have hoped but,given the French concern for their internal political situation, it would havebeen impossible to achieve any better result. I can only say that the first stephas been taken to set in motion the European initiative called for by Mr. Marshall.The next step depends on Moscow. If, as the French hope, rather optimisticallyas I think, the Russians give a clear answer one way or the other, we may beable to organise rapidly. If, as is more probable, they adopt delaying tacticsprogress will be slower and I fear that we shall find Ourselves in substantialdisagreement with the French on how to proceed.I should add that the American Ambassador in Paris was informed of thenature and outcome,of the talks on the evening of 18th June and the telegrams to London and Moscow were repeated to Washington for the information of theUnited States Department. I have since sent a message to M. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, through Sir A. Cadogan.The text: of the British record of my two formal talks with M. Bidault isattached (Annexes E and F).  We hope to obtain an agreed record of their talksfrom the French in the course of the next few days.: v&apos; &apos;: E. B.Foreign Office,23rd June, 1947.Annex a european Reconstruction PlanNote by United Kingdom DelegationAs has already&quot; been made clear in public statements^ His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom enthusiastically welcomes the inspiringlead given to the United Kingdom and to the peoples of Europe by the UnitedStates Secretary of State in his speech at Harvard on 5th June, and has: been considering as a matter of urgency the initiative which should be taken by theUnited Kingdom, in association with other European Powers, to prepare a european reconstruction plan as suggested by Mr. Marshall. While recognising that the acute shortage of dollars which threatens Europe is only one part ofthe world dollar shortage, it is the British view that the; European problem onaccount of its urgency should be tackled separately and at once.Considerable thought has been given to the manner in which the recon-struction plan suggested by Mr. Marshall should be prepared; as well as to theform which it should take.It is desirable that if possible the plan should relate to Europe as a whole and it would appear at first sight that the appropriate agency to initiate thework would be the recently established Economic Commission for Europe. this body, however, is but now in the process of organisation, and it is doubtfulwhether it has the necessary staff or has yet authority to undertake the work inthe time available; Furthermore, experience with other United Nations bodiessuggests that there may be dangers of protracted discussion and delay if thepreparation of the plan is entrusted in the first instance to the economic commission for Europe. Nor is it considered that any of the Specialised agencies of the United Nations are at the moment suitably equipped or constituted to initiate this work. The conclusion drawn is that the work must be undertaken on the initiative of European Governments themselves, but in the British view itwould be highly damaging to the prestige of the United Nations and to the futurework of the Economic Commission for Europe ih the field of European recori-struction if that body or other appropriate United Nations&apos; agencies were entirely by-passed in the preparation of the plan.&apos;    [33813]&quot; B 2
It is with the above considerations in mind, and with a full sense of theextreme urgency and importance of the task, that the following suggestions are put forward as a basis for discussion. They do not represent the final or con-sidered views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would welcome comment upon them by the United States and French Governments.It is suggested that, with the agreement of the United States Government,the British and French Governments should set up before the end of June a small body of experts drawn from a representative group of European countries,e.g., the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium or theNetherlands (for Benelux) and Denmark. The Danish member might be thechairman of the Economic Commission for Europe, and the Polish member the vice--chairman, or their respective nominee. For the rest, the Governmentsconcerned would be invited to provide such experts preferably by name. TheUnited States Government would no doubt wish to consider whether it wishedto be associated with the work. The function of these experts would be toco-ordinate the arrangements described below and to prepare a plan, to besubmitted to the United States Government early in September.As soon as possible the proposal to appoint a Committee of Experts shouldbe notified to all other European Governments (except Spain), who would beinvited to co-operate by providing information to the experts and by associatingthemselves with the work of the ad hoc committees suggested below. TheOrganising Governments, in association with other European Governments, would set up a series of ad hoc functional committees as necessary dealing with thoseparticular commodities which play a predominant role in European production,e.g., coal, cereals and fertilisers and transport equipment. European governments with a major interest in the production of these commodities would be invited toserve on these committees. Full use would be made of existing international bodies, such as the European Coal Organisation and the Food and agriculture organisation.The Second Session of the Economic Commission for Europe is to be held atGeneva on 5th July. It is considered essential that some progress should havebeen made with the arrangements described above before that date. It will thenbe possible for the sponsoring Governments to put forward at the Economic Corn-mission for Europe an agreed resolution describing the action taken, inviting theCommission to endorse it and European Governments to give it full support. this resolution would doubtless give rise to controversy. It is to be hoped, however,that a majority of Governments will be prepared to endorse the action taken andto co-operate with the committees set up, more particularly if proper steps are taken in advance to explain the reasons why such action has been taken.As regards the preparation of the plan itself, it is believed that in the time available the work should be concentrated, in the first instance, on key corn-modi ties that is to say, on the steps which are being taken by european governments to increase total European production and intra-European exchangeof food and other commodities and on anticipated import needs of thosecommodities and of the equipment to produce them in the light of such forecasts.It is suggested that as soon as the invitations for setting up the body of experts have been received, a public announcement should be made.17th June, 1947.Annex BThe British and French Governments have examined with interest the state-ment made by Mr. Marshall at Harvard University on 5th June last. The twoGovernments welcome with the greatest satisfaction the suggestions made bythe United States Secretary of State. Mr. Marshall has not made any officialapproach to the two Governments but in his speech he clearly suggests the drawing up of economic programmes by the European nations themselves andindicates that the United States will be ready to lend their aid to the fullest possible extent for the execution of these programmes.The Foreign Ministers of Great Britain and France consider that this aidis necessary but that it will only bear fruit to the extent that the countries of Europe make the maximum effort to develop once more the resources whichin the main they produced for themselves before the war and which they haveto import to-day along with indispensable industrial equipment largely fromthe American continent. The two Governments consider that the economic condition of Europe necessitates the rapid drawing up of comprehensive
programmes. Both programmes should be drawn up by all the countries ofEurope which are willing to participate in such action, in liaison with theappropriate organs of the United Nations. The initiatives to be taken are of extreme urgency because of the economic and financial situation of a great numberof European countries. In the view of the British and French Governments theseinitiatives should be taken by the three principal European Powers. In viewof the above,, before any examination of the practical measures which must bei taken to supplement the American proposals; Mr. Bevin and M. Bidault proposeto M. Molotjov that a meeting of the British, French and the Soviet foreign ministers should be held during the week beginning 23rd June next at a place to be agreed in order to discuss these problems as a whole. The most convenientplace for the meeting for Mr. Bevin and M. Bidault would of course be Paris orLondon. If however M. Molotov should consider that another European citymidway between Moscow and London should be chosen we are disposed toconsider any suggestions he might make.Annex. CM. Georges Bidault and Mr. Ernest Bevin met in Paris on 17th and 18th June,1947; and examined the statement made by Mr. Marshall at Harvard Universityon 5th June last. They welcome with the greatest satisfaction the thoughts he expressed about the organisation of economic co-operation between the countries of Europe and the help which the United States Government could envisage tomake such co-operation effective. They consider that this help is necessary butthat it will.only bear fruit to the extent that the countries of Europe make themaximum effort to develop once more the resources which, in the main, theyproduced for themselves before the war and which they have to import to-day.Along with indispensable industrial equipment, largely from the american continent. The two Governments consider that the economic condition of Europenecessitates the rapid drawing up of comprehensive programmes. Suchprogrammes should be drawn up by all the European countries which are willingto participate in liaison with the appropriate organs of the United Nations.Given the extreme urgency of the measures which have to be initiated, M. Bidaultand Mr. BeVin have decided to propose to M. Molotov that a meeting of theForeign Ministers of Great &quot;Britain, France and the Soviet Union should beheld during the week beginning 23rd June, in a place to be agreed, in orderto discuss these problems as a whole.Annex DAgenda for Meeting of Foreign Ministers on Marshall Plan during week beginning 23rd june .

Bidault&apos;s Office at 11 a.m. onWednesday, 18th June, 1947M. Bidault opened the proceedings by stating that in the light of the informal discussions of the previous evening and of a study by the French Governmentof the note submitted by the United Kingdom Delegation, it seemed to him thatthe two Delegations were in agreement on the following points:-(1) The Marshall Plan offered a great opportunity Of which Europe must take advantage. &apos;(2) It was important to try to find a solution applicable to Europe as a whole.(3) It would not be opportune to summon a special European Conference.(4) The Economic Committee for Europe could not suitably be entrusted withthe preparation of the plan suggested by Mr. Marshall.(5) It would be inappropriate to appear to ignore the existence of the united nations Or of the European Economic Committee altogether and anattempt must be made to get the work done other than through theirAgency, without appearing to by-pass them.(6) It was necessary to get to work quickly both because of Europe&apos;s needs and also in order to. anticipate an initiative by the EconomicCommittee for Europe which was due to meet on 5th July.(7) It was necessary to make an appeal to the Soviet Government whichwould provide a clear answer to the question as to whether or not they were willing to participate.  It was essential to know the position.   of the U.S.S.R. as soon as possible since this position would in a.  large measure determine the plan of action to be followed in any event,(8) The establishment in principle of a Steering Committee and of ad hocCommittees for particular commodities.M. Bidault then proceeded to discuss the desirability of a joint approach tothe U.S.S.R. He explained that the French Council of Ministers who had metthat morning were most emphatic that no appearance should be given of reachingany decisions between the two Governments or Of initiating any action until theU.S.S.R. had been given an opportuity of participating. He therefore regarded it as essential that the first step should be to address a courteous invitation in non--controversial terms to the Government of the Soviet Union calling for a clear answer as to whether they would be prepared to participate or not. Inorder to leave no loophole for delaying tactics it might be desirable to suggest a meeting of the three Foreign Ministers on a date to be specified during thecoming week at a place which could be decided by agreement.M. Bidault added that in taking this step it would not in fact be necessaryto suspend all consideration by the two Governments of ways and means of preparing a plan. It was clearly desirable that such preparatory work shouldbe undertaken urgently so as to have a consistent plan ready by early July.Mr. Bevin said it was clear from M. Bidault&apos;s statement that British andFrench thinking was moving along parallel lines. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas also anxious to take advantage of the Marshall offer. It was clear that theAmerican method of dealing with countries separately had not proved fruitful.Even before Mr. Marshall Bad made his speech Mr. Bevin.had a conversation withMr. Douglas in which the latter had agreed that European reconstruction was of prime importance, and from which it was clear that the United States were anxious to take some action to assist in the process, but that they had not made up their minds exactly what course of action to propose. Now that the Marshallsuggestion had been made, it seemed to him all the more important that europe should take the initiative in preparing a plan for presentation to the Americans.For this reason, His Majesty&apos;s Government had deliberately refrained fromasking the United States for an elucidation of the Marshall proposal and theyhad hot communicated with the United States Government, except to say that
it would be a mistake to leave Russia out of consideration. In Mr. Bevin&apos;view it was necessary for Europe to work out a plan in. order to help theUnited States Government to reach a decision as to the method by which theycould best solve the economic problems of Europe and of the world,Mr. Bevin then referred to the draft agenda^) circulated to the Meeting bythe French Government; In commenting on this agenda he made the followingpoints:- - . .(i) It would be desirable in Section II and (b), the supply of raw material. ; and food-stuffs, should precede (a), supply of equipment and meansof production; and he suggested adding to the first of these itemsanimal feeding stuffs. He made this proposal because hethought thatit was important to make a dramatic appeal to the United States and-     food was the first line of defence for European security.(ii) In his view the creation of a Steering Committee should precede theestablishment of specialised ad hoc Committees. The former wouldhave to work out the number and nature of the latter and determine the order of priority of their work. He therefore suggested at IV (2)should precede IV (1). .I (iii) In response to the. question raised by the French Government (Item vi of the agenda) as to whether it was advisable to bring up the general problems, concerning intra-European commerce and the foreign trade of Europe, Mr. Bevin said that he doubted the advisability of raisingthese -questions which were only liable to provoke controversy.M. Bidault indicated assent,(iv) As regards the representation of Germany (Item; VII (1) of the agenda): Mr. Bevin said that it was the British view that Germany should berepresented through the Occupying Powers, though German nationalsmight be brought in as experts. This was a matter which could beleft to the Steering Committee to work out.(v) As regards the representation of the United States during the prepara-tory period and. the procedure for communicating the plan to theAmerican Government (Items VII (2) and VII (3) of the agenda),Mr. Beyin.suggested that it would be premature to express views onthese questions at the present meeting. Clearly the first step wouldbe to discuss these aspects of the problem with the Americans, whichhe hoped to be able to do at an early opportunity.In Mr. Bevin&apos;s view there were two outstanding points. Firstly : the mannerin which the Economic Commission for Europe should be brought into thequestion. He agreed with M. Bidault that the E.C.E. was not constituted toprepare a plan with sufficient speed; He thought further that the Committeesset up on the initiative of European Governments must be woven into theEconomic Commission for Europe in some manner later on.Secondly, as regards the approach to the Soviet Union, Mr. Bevin said thathe thought the French Government shared the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat there was a danger that the U.S.S.R. might attempt to delay proceedings.He was willing to approach the Government of the U.S..S.R. with a broad gestureas had been suggested by M. Bidault, but he wanted to have a preliminary firmunderstanding with the French Government that if the U.S.S.R. employeddelaying or obstructive tactics as on previous occasions, the British and french governments would brook no delay and would get on with the job of preparing a plan in association with other European Governments prepared to co-operate.He emphasised that the British public was becoming exasperated with the delays in consideration Of international problems caused by the Soviet Union; and hewas anxious that the Soviet Union should hot be allowed to include political conditions in connexion with the plan itself which might prove inacceptable tothe United States, If they were willing to come in on the basis that there was ajob to be done of a purely economic character, with the object of getting america to help to irrigate world trade, that was another question.        -There was then considerable discussion as to the exact terms of the approach to the Soviet Union and particularly as to whether or not they should be offered a choice of venue for the projected meeting of the three Foreign Ministers duringthe following week. Mr. Bevin explained that he was not prepared to go to ameeting in Moscow if, as seemed probable, he would by so doing only court arebuff. M. Bidault said that the French Government would prefer to draft the invitation so as to leave the meeting-place open.  Mr. Bevin Vaid that it would(i) Annex D to O.P. (4?). .
\. , :$ ; v    \:v;;:;::&quot;&apos; 8 -..-:&quot;be preferable to invite M. Molotov to come to Paris or London. If he was preparedto attend a meeting at all he would probably be ready to come to one of thesecapitals.Other points covered in subsequent discussion were :-(i) It would be desirable to make a cordial appeal to M. Molotov personally.(ii) The best method of setting a time limit would be to fix a date for theproposed meeting and invite M. Molotov or his nominee to be present on that date.(iii) There was some difference of opinion as to whether the invitation should suggest that the meeting would take place in any event between theBritish and French Governments, or whether it should imply that itwould Only take place if the Russians accepted the invitation.(iv) The Russians might make play with the fact that the Marshall proposal had not been communicated officially to them. It should be pointedout in the invitation that it had not been communicated to the british or French Governments either, but the form of the suggestion made itclear that the European Governments were expected to take theinitiative and they were accordingly doing so.(v) It was desirable to keep the United States Government informed ofthe steps taken vis-a-vis the Russians and to consult them regarding their own participation in the preparation of the plan at an earlydate.(vi) The method of appointing a Steering Committee gave rise to some discussion. The French suggested in their draft agenda that thisshould be determined at a European Procedural Conference. TheBritish representatives favoured the issuance of an invitation to a group of, say, half a dozen individuals by sponsoring Powers, viz.,Britain, France and, if possible, the U.S.S.R. No decision was reached on this question which it was agreed to defer for later consideration in the light of the Russian reply.In conclusion, Mr. Bevin and M. Bidault (i) instructed their advisers to prepare a draft invitation to M. Molotovon the lines suggested in the course of the discussion; and(ii) instructed their advisers to draft a press communique summarising the talks and announcing the invitation to the U.S.S.R.The meeting adjourned until 6 p.m.Annex F. :Draft Record of Second, Meeting held in M. Bidault&apos;s Office at 6 p.m. onWednesday, 18th June, 1947The terms of a draft communication to M. Molotov and of a press communiquewere agreed. (2)As information about a proposed approach to Moscow had already appeared in the press it was considered desirable that the press communique should beissued at an early date. On the other hand, it was felt discourteous to issue sucha communique before the message to M. Molotov had been delivered. It was accordingly agreed that the Soviet Charge dAffaires in Paris should be requestedto call on M. Bidault and Mr. Bevin in the early evening in order to receive the message to M. Molotov. The message would also be telegraphed to the British andFrench Ambassadors in Moscow and a communique issued to the press at 9 p.m.for relaying on the air at 7 am. on the 19th June and for publication in the morning papers on that day.It Was. further agreed that separate explanatory telegrams should be sentto the British and French Ambassadors in Moscow in connexion with delivery ofthe note to M. Molotov. In this connexion Mr. Bevin said that the british delegation were anxious that the British Ambassador should be told thatM. Molotov might suggest when receiving the invitation that the whole question should be referred to the Economic Commission for Europe. Sir Maurice Petersonshould therefore be provided with the arguments which had caused the Britishand French Governments to wish to initiate action before the Commission met.It was further agreed that the text of the Russian reply should be publishedif and when received.(a) As at Annexes C and D respectively.
