SECBET Copy No.CP. (37) 18623rd June, 1947CABINETSECRECY OE CABINET PROCEEDINGSNote by the Prime MinisterTHERE have recently been a number of serious leakages in the. pressanticipating Government decisions. It has not been possible to discover theirorigin, but the position is disquieting. I ask my colleagues to read again the NoteI circulated on 9th November, 1945 (CP. (45) 282 copy attached).2.   I would impress on Ministers that-(i) proceedings in Cabinet and Cabinet Committees are secret;(ii) they should be careful not to discuss Government business with colleagueswhen other persons not in the Government Service are present;(iii) in conversation and speeches they should take particular care not toindicate future legislation before the announcement of the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to introduce it has been made.3. It will be realised that premature disclosure of prospective action makes the task of those responsible for publicity very difficult.  .4. I should be glad if my colleagues would bring this Note to the attentionof Junior Ministers in their Departments.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,23rd June, 1947[33804]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1947
[CP. (45) 282] ,[9th November, 1945]CABINET-SECRECY OF CABINET PROCEEDINGSNote by the Prime MinisterRECENT disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the cabinet or its Committees have caused me grave concern. If our intentions are disclosedbefore policies have been finally formulated, we lose the initiative and criticismoutruns our exposition of our plans. To the public we shall seem to have lostcontrol over the execution of our programme. And within the Governmentconfidence will be undermined: Ministers will hesitate to circulate full information about their proposals for discussion with their colleagues for fearof premature disclosure. If, therefore, these leakages continue they will damage the reputation of the Government and impair the efficiency of our administration.No Government can be successful which cannot keep its secrets.2. During the war military secrets were disclosed only to those who had toact upon them or had to know of them for the purpose of their official duties.This rule could not be applied without modification to political secrets in timeof peace. For Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the Govern-menfs programme must be generally aware of the development of important aspects of Government policy. But, outside this narrow circle, knowledge ofthese matters should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, whose duty it is to assist in the formulation of the particular policy concerned or need to know what is afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for which they are responsible.3. I ask my colleagues to look again, with these points in mind, at the notes on procedure which I circulated on the 8th August (paragraph 8 of C.P. (45)100, reproduced in the Appendix to this note) and to undertake a personal reviewof the arrangements now in force in their Departments. Every Minister has a personal responsibility, of which he cannot divest himself, for seeing that thegeneral principles which I have indicated are properly applied within his Depart-ment. No set of detailed rules can be applied uniformly to all Departments. Itmay, however, be helpful if I mention some supplementary points which ministers might keep particularly in mind in reviewing the practice, in their Departments : (a) A Minister who is a member of the Cabinet has responsibilities wider than those of his own Department, and will in that capacity receive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.
(b) A Parliamentary Secretary may have to deputise for his Minister, at cabinet or in the House, at short notice. Apart, from any special responsibility assigned to him in a limited field, he should be kept ingeneral touch with all Cabinet matters affecting his own department and should be encouraged to share in the responsibility for the f ormula-tion of policy.(c) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government:his chief duties are to provide a link between the Minister and theHouse and to facilitate the Ministers business, in the House, and theinformation given to him should be correspondingly limited.(d) Documents containing or reflecting the personal views of Ministers arein a special category, and their handling requires special care, if the collective responsibility of the Cabinet as a whole is to be preserved.(e) Special care is also required in handling the Minutes of the cabinet or of Standing Ministerial Committees such as the Lord presidents committee, each set of which normally covers a variety of subjects.For these documents no routine circulation list will suffice: a responsible person must decide on each occasion who should be made aware of the contents of each separate item. The Cabinet office have standing instructions to work on this principle in theircirculation of these Minutes to Ministers. Ministers should see thatthe same principle is applied in communicating to persons within their Department the contents of copies supplied to them (see para-graph 15 of CP. (45) 99).4. One final point. Public business cannot be transacted without a fairlywide dissemination of confidential information within Government circles andthe problem of secrecy cannot be solved.solely by rules, however carefully drawn,restricting the circulation of papers. The essential point is the observance ofa high standard of discretion by all who acquire knowledge of such information in the course of their duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interestsof the Government as. a whole and subordinates everything to that end. It isthe duty of Ministers to set this standard of discretion in regard to allconfidential matters which come within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see that their example is followed.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,9th November, 1945.
appendix extract from&apos;&apos;CP. (45) 100- * *. * . *. :&quot; .*&quot;&apos;*.PRECAUTION AGAINST UNAUTHORISED DISCLOSURES OFINFORMATION8. The Prime Minister invites his colleagues. to impress on all concerned the need for exercising the strictest discretion; in particular to see that thefollowing precautions are strictly observed not only in military but in domesticmatters : 1(1) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.(2) Ministers are expected to exercise a real measure of control in the matter,and must satisfy themselves from time to time that their instructions are being carried out.(3) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted in particular issues arising out ofCabinet papers, this should be done by means of minutes addressedto the officers concerned, confined to the particular points on whichthey are required to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of memoranda setting out the views of particular Ministers on mattersof policy which are under discussion in the Cabinet or in a ministerial committee.(4) All servants of the Crown, whether Ministers, members of the FightingServices or Civil Servants, must be most careful to observe duediscretion in regard to all matters of State. In particular, those whohold high office must remember that the degree of reticence which theyobserve in these matters will be taken as an example by those who serve under them. N(5) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of thePress of isolated scraps of information, each in itself apparently of little importance, gathered from several sources. The only safe rule is, therefore, never to mention such matters even in the form ofguarded allusions, except to those who must be informed of them for reasons of State, until the time has come when disclosure, in whole orin part, is authorised. I am prepared to recognise that reasons ofState may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communica-tion of some information to a responsible Editor, Lobby Correspondent,&amp;c, for purposes of guidance; but such communications are onlyjustified where it can be ensured that the confidence and the terms onwhich it is given are respected.(6) It is of the utmost importance in this connection that Press or public relations Branches or Departments should not be informed of cabinet discussions or decisions until action has to be taken by such Branchesor Departments. The information then conveyed, and the instructions given as to its use, should be as precise as possible.*X* &quot;K* .
