HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1947SECRET Copy No.   3 1CP. (47) 1958th July, 1947CABINETNATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in the first paragraph of his Memorandum (CP. (47) 189), the Minister of fuel and Power refers to the discussion which took place at the Lord presidents committee on 6th June on the memorandum which I had submitted in response toa request by the Committee on the development of National Arbitration Machinery(L.P. (47) 92). In pursuance of the conclusion reached at that meeting, I havecirculated a revised version of this memorandum to take account of certain views expressed during the discussions on this subject (CP. (47) 190).2. The present memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power, as its titleshows, covers a much wider scope than the particular subject discussed at themeeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on 6th June, and he has, in fact,appended a copy of his previous paper on National Wages Policy which wasconsidered by my colleagues in November last year. My observations on thismemorandum were contained in the memorandum (L.P. (46) 259) which I circu-lated then and which I now attach.3. Before attempting to deal with the additional memorandum which theMinister of Fuel and Power has now submitted on a National Wages Policy, i must point out that the fact that he links this subject with proposals for Govern-ment intervention in arbitration fully bears out my own contention that the issues involved in alterations to the present arbitration machinery cannot fail to have much wider repercussions. A national wages policy such as that advocated bythe Minister of Fuel and Power cannot be obtained simply by an alteration ofour arbitration system, but involves a complete recasting of the whole system ofindustrial relations which has been built up in this country over the past half-century.4. I suggest that the Minister of Fuel and Power is Understating theposition when he says that &quot; it may be true that the existing system has succeeded in avoiding some strikes.&quot; As I have endeavoured to show, industrial relations in this country work remarkably smoothly and with the minimum of disturbance.There is not a merely fortuitous connection between the development of jointorganisation in industry since 1919 and the very much greater measure ofindustrial peace that we have enjoyed in this post-war period compared withthat following the 1914^18 War; nor should we assume that the troubles that have been experienced in other countries, e.g., the United States and France, haveno lessons for us. The embarrassments which those countries have experiencedsince VJ-day are, to my mind, not unconnected with the attempt of their Govern-ments to intervene directly in wages questions. (I am not, of course, referring to the recent Hartley-Taft labour legislation in the United States.)5. The Minister of Fuel and Power suggests that the present system ofindustrial relations &quot; provides no assurance or even likelihood that due account would be taken, not only of the circumstances of the particular industry con-cerned, but also of the wider issues affecting the economy of the country as awhole.&quot; I cannot accept this contention. The Government have made clear to both sides of industry in considerable detail the general economic considerations to which, in the national interest, they should have regard in their considerationof wages questions. These considerations are, in fact, a frequent subject ofdiscussion in particular wage negotiations.33865
6. The objectives enumerated in paragraph 4 of the Minister of Fuel and power&apos;s memorandum seem to be dependent on considerable subsidies by the state in the form of family allowances. It is also suggested that, over and above acertain minimum, wages should be consistently related (a) on grounds of relativeskill, and (b) according to the requirements of the manpower situation. It isdifficult to see, however, how these two requirements could, in practice, beharmonised, still less how a consistent relationship could be maintained. On theparticular question of relative skills I do not see how any scale could be assessedwhich would have the slightest chance of acceptance by the workers concerned and by industry generally.7. The proposal in paragraph 7 appears to contemplate that before negotia-tions take place there should in all cases be a pronouncement by the central advisory Council. It is difficult to see how such pronouncements would be con-fined to a purely objective statement of economic facts and the procedure would,in practice, amount to a compulsory Court of Inquiry in advance of negotiations,which would result in those negotiations being reduced to little more than aformality. I cannot agree with the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s contention that such a scheme would not weaken the position of the trade unions engagedin particular negotiations. In my view, it would, in fact, destroy all sense ofresponsibility on the part of both sides, and make it impossible to maintain theauthority of the constitutional machinery.G. A. I.Ministry of Labourand National Service, S-W. 1,8th July, 1947.[L.P. (46) 259]2$th October, 1946ANNEXNATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in L.P. (46) 255 the Minister of Fuel and Power sets out proposals for aNational Wages Policy and in addition makes certain suggestions as to means for combating the present shortage of labour. Whilst I appreciate the care andthoughtfulness which has gone into its preparation I think it necessary to makethe following observations on this memorandum for the consideration of mycolleagues.2. I agree that in regard to wages there are two main problems facingIndustry and the Government at the present time, namely  (a) how to achieve an overall Stability of wages, and(b) how to secure any selective movement of wages which may be found tobe necessary for the benefit of vital under-manned industries (seeparagraph 12 below) without destroying that overall stability whichis an essential requirement.I feel bound to say, however, that I am not in agreement with the methodsproposed in L.P. (46) 255 for dealing with these problems.3. If I understand these proposals correctly, the Minister of Fuel and power suggests that a National Wages Authority should be constituted,consisting of representatives of Government and Employers&apos; and Workers&apos;Organisations, whose function would be to make recommendations to theGovernment regarding wages changes. It is not stated in detail how the Govern -ment would deal with these recommendations, but it appears to be contemplated that the decisions would be definitely governmental decisions (paragraph 15).This seems to leave no escape from a situation in which the decisions thus givencould be debated in Parliament.  In the result, Wages might become a political.
issue. This.to my mind is an insuperable objection to the proposal. I think thesituation which would result would be disastrous to our whole system of industrial relations.4. It is stated (paragraph 1Q) that the National Wages Authority could operate either in response to applications from different industries or by itselfinitiating proposals for wage changes. This would mean that applications ofan irresponsible and frivolous character could be put in to the National WagesAuthority, on whom would devolve the unpleasant task of rejecting them, thedecision being a Government decision. A union or extremists within a unioncould foment an agitation and place all the blame for failure on the Government.This in my view is a state of affairs that should at all costs be avoided.5. From paragraph 23 I understand that the Authority would also concern itself with the actual nature of the wages structure of particular industries,including piece rates. This is an impossible task to set a central authority,which could not fulfil it with all the detail and precision which piece-rate and bonus systems demand. Even the present central negotiating bodies of the separate industries avoid the actual fixation of piece-work prices and in no circumstances could a satisfactory result be achieved otherwise than by discus-sion at the shop level. The proposal contained in this paragraph is, indeed,directly in conflict with the widely accepted view that the maximum co-opera-tion between workers and management in, the factory must be achieved. Toremove from this sphere the discussion of piece-work prices would be a retrograde step, with the most serious consequence. In my view this proposal takes insuffi-cient account of the extremely complex nature of the general wages structure,which in most industries is a close fabric of national, district and other agree-ments designed to provide the maximum flexibility within a stable framework.6. The memorandum appears to be devoted largely to wages (or earnings)only. Wage rates, however, cannot be considered in isolation from other terms and conditions of employment to which they are intimately related under existing agreements. In my view, it would be impracticable for any national authorityto concern itself with wages only while leaving other terms and conditions tothe full discretion of the collective bargaining system.7. On the other hand, paragraph 6 contains a direct statement that &apos;&apos; wemust exercise some control over the relative attractiveness of wages and condi-tions in different industries.&quot; I am not clear as to the precise meanings tobe attached to the words &quot;control&quot; and &quot;conditions,&quot; but if, as might beinferred, the intention is that anything calculated to improve the amenities ofa particular industry is to be prevented because of competition with industries of more importance, the idea seems to me unsound. I do not think that this can be the intention, but I feel it necessary to draw attention to the statement.8. The proposals contained in the memorandum do not mention the meansof enforcing the Government decisions on wages. If an application is rejectedthere may well be a series of strikes. There might, indeed, be strikes, officialor unofficial, whilst the application for an increase was under consideration.It is not stated in the memorandum how the decisions will be promulgated,what form they will take or what steps will be taken to see that they are properly operated. If the decisions are to have any statutory significance the exact sanctions to be applied must be stated before it can be considered whetherthey are likely to be effective. Moreover, our experience in wage regulationshows that enforcement is impossible unless an adequate inspection staff is pro-vided. I would, however, emphasise that the success of an industrial relationspolicy depends not on the effectiveness of legal sanctions but on the willingacceptance of the settlements in question. This under the system of collective bargaining derives from the fact that the settlements are negotiated by theaccredited representatives of the men, who act under the democratic constitutionof their respective unions.9. It must be borne in mind that piece rates must be fixed to provide theaverage worker with the incentive to work for a certain standard of remuneration.Particularly skilful or adaptable workers will always be found who will obtainhigher earnings. In any system of enforcing maximum earnings the question will arise whether a worker who exceeds the maximum has done so through an illegal arrangement with his employer or simply because of his extra skill.It would clearly be impossible, and indeed undesirable, to deprive the good33865 b 2
worker of the rewards of his extra skill, but this dilemma would have to be faced if it were ever decided to enforce maxima. There is, of course, the furthercomplication that if a piece rate is fixed too high the Government would be under the necessity of reducing the rates, a procedure which, over a wide field of industry, would be certain to meet with the most violent and indignantopposition.10. My colleagues should be left under no misapprehension as to the effects of removing the full authority for the determination of terms and conditionsfrom the two sides of industry. In paragraph 8 of his memorandum, the Ministerof Fuel and Power refers to &quot; Defects of the traditional collective bargainingsystem.&quot; These remarks, however, are not valid criticisms of the system of joint negotiation as such, but a statement of what might occur if either or bothsides of industry operated the existing machinery without adequate knowledgeof the general economic position and without exercising their proper respon-sibilities. Furthermore, we must keep in mind the positive advantages andachievements which have led to the system of collective bargaining being supportedand encouraged by successive Governments since 1919. It is hardly necessaryfor me to redevelop in detail the arguments in favour of the system. I would,only stress that the process of adjustment of terms and conditions by jointnegotiation, quite apart from its positive stabilising effect on the course ofwages claims, exerts a decisive influence upon the general harmony of industrial relations as a whole. So far as the workers are concerned this harmony is foundedupon the full sense of responsibility which they have acquired from long experienceof free negotiation which, in turn, is based on the confidence of their members in the results of this method of settling terms and conditions. To remove fromthe employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s organisations the full authority for the settle-ment of terms and conditions would not merely sacrifice the machinery whichhas been built up with such care and operated with such success over manyyears, but would do much to destroy the general harmony of industrial relations which has been such an encouraging feature both during the late war and inthe present difficult period of industries reconversion. A sense of collective responsibility and the consequent willingness to abide by jointly negotiated agree-ments are the main bases on which industrial stability rests. They would be destroyed if the parties knew that the final authority on questions of terms and conditions rested not with themselves but in the last resort with the Govern-ment; that in fact the only effective negotiation would be with the Government.11. It cannot, moreover, be too strongly stressed that direct government intervention in the wages field removes the settlement of disputes from the field of industrial relations and brings one or other of the parties concerned intodirect conflict with the Government. A strike in such circumstances would, ineffect, be a strike against the Government, which would then have to take full responsibility for any situation which might arise. The disastrous effects of just such a system, which has always been studiously avoided in this country,have been only too clearly demonstrated in the course of the recent industrial unrest in the United States of America, which I have had some opportunity ofstudying at first hand.12. I should like to comment in particular on the second of the two proposedfunctions of the National Wages Authority (paragraph 17 (b) of L.P. (46) 255),namely, &quot; to develop a structure of relative wages which would help the flow oflabour in the directions desired and to prevent a flow in the opposite direction.&quot;In paragraph 7 of his memorandum, the Minister of Fuel and Power points outthat &quot; wages rates are not the only, and perhaps not even the most importanteconomic incentive. In present circumstances, hours of work, holidays, housing,working conditions and amenities may play even a greater role in attractingpersons to different industries or in keeping them once they have arrived.&quot; Withthis I would fully agree and would go further and suggest that economic incentivesare by no means the only factors determining the industry in which an individualworker chooses to be employed. Personal preferences, nearness to place of residence and means of transport, local custom and other traditions all play their part. A great deal of detailed investigation is needed before the influence ofrelative wage rates on the manning of particular industries can be accuratelygauged. This will no doubt be one of the first problems to be considered by thereconstituted National Joint Advisory Council and its Joint consultative committee.
13. The Minister of Fuel and Power also mentions the objective of elimination -ting unduly low wages and &apos; sweating- in badly organised industries.&quot; TheWages Councils Act and similar legislation contain ample powers for dealingwith such a situation and, if there exists &quot; sweating &quot; in any industry or sectionof it, I should like my attention drawn to it at once.14. In considering the part which they should play in promoting the attain-ment of the objectives I have mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the Governmentshould scrupulously abstain from any action which would impair the presentsystem of joint voluntary negotiation of terms and conditions. It has beenaccepted by my colleagues that the Government, in consultation with representa-tives of the employers&apos; and workpeopie&apos;s organisations, has its part to play in securing that the organisations responsible for collective bargaining exercise their functions with full knowledge of the country&apos;s economic requirements. TheNational Joint Advisory Council has now been reconstituted for this precisepurpose and the outlines of the country&apos;s economic situation and needs have beenput before them by the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade. I feel bound to point outthat the machinery of the National Joint Advisory Council is designed not merely for &quot; discussing the problems involved &quot; but rather to provide a regular systemof consultation between the Government and the two sides of industry responsiblefor collective bargaining. I have every confidence that these consultations willprovide the Government with a ready means of obtaining an authoritative and representative view on problems as they arise and that the organisations ofemployers and workers will have a regular means of assessing all the factorsrelevant to their consideration. These consultations are still at an early stage and their efficiency must be judged by their results. Meanwhile, I feel that i must warn my colleagues of what, in my view, would be the disastrous effects ofany attempt to undermine the authority of the system of joint voluntary negotia-tion upon which, encouraged and assisted by the Government, I am convinced the solution of our present problems must depend.15. In various paragraphs in his memorandum the Minister of Fuel and power refers to the need to control profits, and in paragraph 26 he suggests thatit would be valuable to obtain the views of the Board of Trade on the availablemeans to tighten up and extend the existing price control machinery. Myimpression has been that the field of price control is strictly limited by the prac-practicability of enforcement. I fully agree that, if wages are to be compulsorilytied to a particular level, an efficient price control for the whole field of industry would be an essential corollary. I should be surprised to learn, however, that theBoard of Trade consider price control over the whole field to be practicable.16. The Minister of Fuel and Power also deals at the end of his paperwith the problem of the general labour shortage and suggests in paragraphs 29-30that we should take deliberate steps to reduce the scope of industries consciouslyselected as overmanned, thus forcibly releasing labour for the genuinely under-manned industries. I examined this suggestion in the paper L.P. (46) 175, whichI submitted to this Committee in July last, and I cannot do better than repeat the following paragraph from that paper : &quot;The second method, i.e.s the deliberate creation of unemployment in less essential industries in order to force workers so rendered unemployedto more essential jobs, must also be ruled out for the following reasons : (a) This roundabout method of compulsion would be little, if any, morepalatable to the workers involved than direct compulsion. To thepublic at large it would appear to be deliberately created austerityfor reasons which would be ill understood, and it would be mostunpopular.(5) It is most doubtful whether the policy could be effectively enforced,(c) There can be no guarantee that the labour discharged would belabour of the kind required for the work to be manned up.Employers required to discharge workers usually select those whoare least vigorous and adaptable. There would also be a grave riskof such difficulties as men being discharged in districts wherewomen were required. Nor, without directions, would it bepossible to ensure, even if the redundant workers were of the kindrequired, that they, in fact, went to the jobs most needing workersinstead of drifting into other work no more essential than thatin which they had been rendered surplus. The sole result of thepolicy might be to create unemployment.&quot;
17.   With regard to paragraph 31, I fully agree that we should increasefar as possible the proportion of our population engaged in productive emploment.  This is one of the major objectives of the Prosperity Campaign publicitI fully agree also that the improvement of the efficiency of our industries is of first importance, and I have no doubt that the Ministers concerned are takirievery possible step to this end.G.
