Printed for the Cabinet    May 1947SECRETCopy No.C.R (47) 15416*A May, 1947CABINETADMISSION OF NON-EUROPEAN PERSONNEL INTO THE UNITEDKINGDOM ARMED FORCESJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for IndiaWE have recently been in communication with the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for War regarding the entry of men of non-European race into the United Kingdom Regular Forces. It has been ourcontention that British subjects and British-protected persons should not be automatically excluded from entry into these Forces on grounds of colour. Thepresent position is that, in November 1945, the then Secretary of State for Airagreed to permit the entry of non-European applicants into the post-war AirForce, provided that they attain the requisite standards, are resident in thiscountry at the time of application, and can satisfy the Selection Authorities thatthey are likely to mix with other entrants and hold their own in the corporate life of the Services. But the Admiralty and the War Office are unable to agree to asimilar arrangement for the Royal Navy and the Army. Since, in our opinion,this ban on the entry of non-En ccpeans into the Royal Navy and the Army is contrary to the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the peoples of India, Burma and the Colonial Empire, we feel that there is no alternative butto place the matter before the Cabinet. We hope that our colleagues will agreethat the Navy and Army should come into line with the Royal Air Force over thisquestion.2.   The past history of this subject is, very briefly, as follows : Before the war there was an acknowledged ban on the entry of non-Europeansinto all three Services. This was lifted in the first month of the war and non-Europeans were admitted, not only as other ranks, but also as temporarycommissioned officers into all three Services. It is hardly necessary to remind our colleagues that many of them rendered distinguished service.3. Our predecessors were all exceedingly anxious that there should be noreturn to the pre-1939 ban on non-European entrants. They felt as strongly aswe do that it was impossible to defend this plain example of the colour bar, andthey made several approaches to Service Ministers on the question during the war.Service Ministers felt themselves unable to come to a decision at that time, but, inNovember 1945, the Secretary of State for Air stated that the Air Council had agreed to the admission of non-European candidates into the post-war Air force on the conditions stated in paragraph 1 above.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War ofthat day, in refusing to agree to similar arrangements for the Navy and Army,came to the conclusion that the practical difficulties in the admission of non-European candidates were too great. They pointed out that British soldiers and sailors do not take kindly to being commanded by coloured officers; that there are obvious social difficulties; that a policy of admitting coloured men to the UnitedKingdom Forces might not be understood in the countries where the Navy and army had to serve; and that it would certainly cause embarrassment in someDominions.33627
5. In these circumstances the present First Lord and Secretary of State have proposed a compromise that, pending further experience, officers and men from india and the Colonies should continue to be entered into their own local Forces;but that this should be coupled with a more active and positive policy of givingthese entrants suitable facilities for training in and with the Royal Navy and theBritish Army. They suggest that active progress on these lines would give allconcerned, including the men themselves, experience of how more far-reachingreadjustment would work out in practice and provide the data for forming a long-term view.6. We have very carefully considered this proposal, but we do not feel ableto accept it. Not only would it retain the colour bar for an indefinite period, butit would not, in our view, achieve its primary purpose of providing the material for further consideration of the problem at a later date. In the first place, fewColonies will be able to maintain regular local military forces on a scale whichwill attract the best type of coloured entrant (and it is only the best type whowould be able to qualify under the normal regulations for admission to UnitedKingdom Forces) wishing to make a career in the Fighting Services, and probablynone will be able to maintain Naval forces on this scale. Secondly, the scheme would not provide a practical means of putting to the test two points to whichthe Admiralty and War Office attach major importance, namely, the possibilityof absorbing coloured personnel without friction into a British ship&apos;s company or regiment, and the capacity of coloured officers to lead and gain the confidence of British ratings and other ranks. Finally it would not apply to coloured Britishsubjects living in this country, many of whom are Colonial people who might wellprovide some of the best coloured candidates for employment in the Forces.For these reasons we conclude that an experiment on the lines suggested wouldnot provide a reliable basis from which, a fair judgment could be made as to the suitability of coloured personnel for admission to the United Kingdom Forces.7. We return, therefore, to the practical objections (referred to in para-graph 4 above) which the Admiralty and War Office have urged against theimmediate admission of coloured men to these Forces. We do not wish to minimise the difficulties, but we feel that they should not be decisive. If, as werecommend, the other two Services come into line with the Royal Air Force, thenumber of candidates eligible for entry will be very small. Successful applica-tions will not amount to more than a handful in the year. It can hardly be argued seriously that the admission of a few non-Europeans into the Navy orthe Army in any year can make an appreciable difference to the efficiency orwellbeing of these Forces; on the other hand, automatic exclusion on the ground of colour, even of a few candidates, may have serious political consequences.8. Nor do we think that it could be maintained that there is sufficient outlet,except in India and Burma, for non-Europeans in local forces. As has alreadybeen pointed out, Colonial naval and military forces where they exist are, andin time of peace will remain, relatively small. In some Colonies there may benone at all. And local forces in the Colonies do not provide for the coloured man who has been born and brought up in this country.9. Apart from any question of practical difficulties, we feel that this is amatter which must be considered against the background of Imperial policy inthe widest sense. The future of this country may well turn upon the successwith which we can ensure the co-operation of hitherto dependent territories, asthey achieve self government, in upholding and presenting to the world Britishideals and the British outlook upon social and political problems. The desire for such co-operation on their part cannot be encouraged by regulations whichreflect the old attitude of racial superiority.10. Some interest has already been shown in Parliament on this issue, and questions have been put to the Service Ministers.a. a j.16th May, 1947.
