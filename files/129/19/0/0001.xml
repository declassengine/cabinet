JPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1947SECRET Copy No.    StCP. (47) 15112th May, 1947CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME : 1947-48 SESSIONJoint Memorandum by the Lord, President of the Council and the minister without Portfolio1, At their meeting on 20th March (CM. (47) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4),the Cabinet invited the Committee on Future Legislation to give further con-sideration to the provisional programme of major and medium-sized Bills set outin CP. (47) 79 in the light of the Cabinefs views on the need for lightening the1947-48 Legislative Programme.2. The subsequent decision of the Cabinet (CM. (47) 37th Conclusions,Minute 8) that an Iron and Steel Industry Bill should be introduced in the 1947-48Session and the fact that all stages of the Government of India Bill, the Govern-ment of Burma Bill and the Electoral Reform Bill will have to be taken on the floor of the House seem to the Committee to strengthen the views affirmed by theCabinet on the need for a substantial reduction in the provisional pro-gramme set out in CP. (47) 79, and in drawing up the revised lists given in thefollowing paragraphs the Committee have felt bound to consider primarily notwhether a particular Bill was desirable in itself but rather whether there was somecogent reason for passing it in the 1947-48 Session instead of in one of the twosubsequent Sessions of the present Parliament.3. After carefully and sympathetically considering the representations ofthose Ministers affected1 by the revision of the programme the Committee now submit to the Cabinet the following revised lists of major and medium-sizedBills:-(i) Major Bills Iron and Steel Industry ...Criminal Justice ...      ......Agriculture (Scotland)  ...Poor Law (Abolition)Block  Grant  and  Rating  andValuationI To be ready for introduction at the&apos;    beginning of the Session.Government of IndiaGovernment of Burma   ...Electoral ReformRestrictive Practices(ii) Medium-Sized Bills Alternative Remedies (Lords)  ...Industrial Life AssuranceOverseas Resources DevelopmentRiver Boards (Lords)Superannuation  ...British Nationality and Citizen-ship (Lords)Milk     (Special    Designations)(Lords)  ...Motorways (Lords)To be ready for introduction aboutChristmas.To be ready for introduction at thebeginning of the Session.Cinematograph Films    ...      .... I T  ,        ,Training and Employment (Lords) \ c^XasChildren (Lords).........I    ^&apos;nilstmas-[33605]for introduction about
These lists contain 9 major and 11 medium-sized Bills, as compared witti 15 majorand 18 medium-sized Bills in the lists in CP. (47) 79. The real saving in parliamentary time is not, however, so great as these figures would suggest, sincethe reduction has been partly achieved by combining the English and ScottishBlock Grant Bills and the English Rating and Valuation Bill into a singlemeasure and by transferring the Children Bill from the major group to the medium-sized group.This revised programme must be regarded for the present as provisional andit could not be undertaken in full should it unfortunately prove necessary toextend the current Session into the Autumn.4. The Committee propose that in addition the following Bills should beintroduced in the 1947-48 Session if time permits : Sea Fish Industry.Legal Aid (Lords).Veterinary Surgeons (Lords).Nurses.Lunacy and Mental Deficiency (Scotland) (Lords).Legal Aid (Scotland) (Lords).It should be understood, however, that Parliamentary Counsel will undertake the drafting of the Bills in this group only so far as this can be done withoutinterfering with the drafting of the Bills listed in paragraph 3 and that theywould not be mentioned in The King&apos;s Speech.5. The lists in paragraphs 8 and 4 cover only major and medium-sizedBills, but the Committee have asked Ministers to state what minor Bills they wish to suggest for inclusion in the 1947-48 Programme, and they propose toput in hand the drafting of a certain number of such Bills in order that theymay be available when the Session begins. The final programme will also haveto include the usual group of essential Bills; and on past experience it wouldbe wise to allow for a certain number of emergency measures, the need for whichcannot at present be foreseen.6. It is important that the introduction of the major and medium-sizedBills included in the 1947-48 Legislative Programme should be so timed asto avoid undue congestion in the House of Commons in the period betweenChristmas and Easter and in the House of Lords towards the end of the session. The Committee are accordingly asking the Ministers concerned to make every effort to have their Bills ready for introduction early enough in the session to enable them to be read a second time and sent to Standing Committee beforethe Christmas recess. The Committee have also suggested that, in order to achieve a proper balance between the House of Commons and the House ofLords, a suitable number of Bills should be started in the House of Lords earlyin the Session. In the lists in paragraphs 3 and 4 above an indication has beengiven of the Bills which could appropriately be dealt with in this way.7.   The Committee invite^the Cabinet (1) to approve the revised lists given in paragraph 3 above as a provisional programme of major and medium-sized Bills for the 1947-48 Session;(2) to agree that, subject to the prior claims of the Bills in this provisional programme, the Bills listed in paragraph 4 above may be prepared with a view to their introduction in the 1947-48 Session if timepermits;(3) to note that the Committee will keep under review the progress madewith the preparation of the Bills listed in paragraphs 3 and 4 and thata final programme for the 1947-48 Session will be submitted to theCabinet when the time comes to consider the terms of The King&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.H.M.A. G.Cabinet Ojft.ce, S.W. 1.mh May, 1947.
