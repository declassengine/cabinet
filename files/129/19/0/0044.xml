r&quot;&apos;^^257(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(U-7)  A 9k5th July.  19U7.PALESTINE:THE MUFTI OF JERUSALEMJoint Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies1. Recent reports have suggested that the Mufti may shortly move from his present residence in Egypt to the Lebanon.Should he make this move by sea it is possible that his ship may call at Haifa.      The High Commissioner for Palestine has askedfor instructions on the action he should take if the Mufti comes within the jurisdiction of the Palestine Government.2. Action against the Mufti was last considered by theCabinet in November, 1945, when he was residing in France undersurveillance (CM. (k-5) 56th Conclusions, Minute 6).      It wasthen decided that if he fell into our hands he should not be tried as a war criminal or as a traitor, but should be sent,tothe Seychelles for detention as a political prisoner.      Shouldhe now appear at Haifa it would be legally possible to put thisdecision into effect.      He could be arrested and deported underPalestine Defence (Emergency) Regulations,  either as a person who had broken an exclusion order still in force against him or as a person whose liberty in Palestine was prejudicial to security.      Alternatively he could be denied permission to landin virtue of the exclusion order and permitted to continue on,his journey.3. If the Mufti is arrested he will be a graveembarrassment.     The High Commissioner is unwilling to keep him in Palestine because of the risk of Arab disorder.     He can be transported to a territory where suitable legislation- exists for his detention, e.g. the Seychelles, but he cannot be detained there indefinitely.      Sooner or later he must be setat liberty.      His arrest and deportation will add an element of martyrdom to the prestige he enjoys among the PalestinianArabs, the great majority of whom still regard him as their onlyaccredited leader.     Arab feeling in Palestine will be muchexacerbated.      Strong representations can be expected from theArab States, who, whatever their real feelings, are bound to protest against such treatment of an Arab patriot.      Iraq and transjordan-Jordan may not be wholehearted in their protests, but theycannot in this matter and at this time afford to break the solidarity of the Arab front on the Palestine question.      the mufti&apos;s arrest during the course of the United Nations inquiry would moreover be represented as a deliberate affront to theArabs and as prejudicial to their cause.h. Failure to arrest him should opportunity offer wouldhave consequences which, in our view, would be even more serious:-COPY NO3lCABINET
(o)   He would continue on his journey to the Lebanon,, whence,as in 1937-38, he would most probably organise Arabviolence in Palestine if the conclusion of the united nations is not acceptable to the Arabs.     Reports havebeen received that Pawzi Qawaaji,  the rebel leader whorecently returned to the Middle East from&apos; Europe, hasalready established a military headquarters in the lebanon and is recruiting forces for action in Palestine.This threat need not be serious unless the Mufti addshis energy and authority to the preparation of a campaign.The Lebanese Government would be unlikely to have the will or the courage effectively to restrict the Mufti&apos;activities should he reach their territory and claimasylum.(b) A storra of protest would be raised in Zionist circlesboth in this country and even more in the United States,if the Mufti came into our hands and were allowed to gofree*      The effect on Jewish opinion in Palestine also&apos; would be most disturbing.     Although technically he isnot a war criminal (being neither an enemy national nora person who served in the enemy forces) he is commonlyso regarded, since his record of treacherous assistance  st an c eto the Axis has been assiduously publicised by Zionistpropagandists.      The recent attempt by an Arab spokesmanat the Special Assembly of the United Nations to justifythe Mufti&apos;s wartime activities was very ill received bythe majority of delegates,(c) Such failure would be generally damaging to Britishprestige and would be interpreted as a sign of weaknessor as confirmation of the widely held belief that, ifnot actually a British protege, the Mufti relies on british connivance for the immunity, which he has so forenjoyed.      It would correspondingly strengthen his own position.,5- We therefore recommend:-(a) That the High Commissioner for Palestine be instructedthat,  if the Mufti comes within the jurisdiction of thePalestine Government, he should be arrested and deportedimmediately to the Seychelles for detention as apolitical prisoner.(b) That His Majesty&apos;s Minister Beirut be instructed to repeat the warnings he has already given to the Lebanese-Government against their allowing the Mufti to enterLebanon, and to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government count on the Lebanese Government talcing all possible measuresto prevent this from happening.E.B.A.&apos;G. J.5th July, 19U7.
