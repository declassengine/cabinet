SECRETCP. (47)  16021ST MAY.  1947CABINETPOWER STATION AT BANKSIDEMemorandum &quot;by the Lord President of the council at the meeting of-the Cabinet on 15th May (CM. (47)47th Conclusions, Minute 2) I was invited to consider withthe Minister of Labour, the Minister of Fuel and Power,  theMinister of Health and the Minister of Town and country planning whether, in the light of further information, itwould be desirable to modify their decision of the 1st april to proceed with the erection of a power station at Bankside.2. We have now gone over the grounds for and againstthe building of an oil-fired power station at Bankside, andour conclusions are set out below.3. First as to sites:    it is clear that all alternativesites,  including Rotherhithe and, Poplar,  are needed for theexpansion of existing stations or the building of new onesand the issue is therefore whether there shall be an oil-firedpower station on the Bankside site or not.4. We are satisfied that no case has been made outthat an oil-fired power station on the Bankside site would interfere with the dominance of St. Paul-&apos;s over the river and the model which has been exhibited in the Houses ofParliament has done much to allay fears that it might doso.      We are also satisfied that an oil-fired station wouldnot prejudice the redevelopment of this section of the South Bank as a commercial and residential neighbourhood inaccordance with the intentions of the London County Council;and the Minister of Town and Country Planning would securethat the neighbourhood is so&apos;developed.5. There are, however, two difficulties inherent in building an oil-Mred station, neither of which was brought out when&apos;the Cabinet agreed on 1st April that the stations should be oil-fired:    one economic, which is obviouslyserious;    and the other technical, which is capable ofsolution.6. Firing the station with oil instead of with coalis estimated to cost  450,000 more a year,  on the basis thatoil costs  6 a ton and coal  2.10.0 a ton.      Even if the extra expense.in transmission of placing the station lower down the river were set against this figure, an oil-fired station at Bankside would cost some  300,000 more a year to run,exclusive of the cost of dealing with the fumes.      these additional costs would mean adding . 33 of a penny to theoriginal estimate of .45 of a penny for generation costs per unit:    a very heavy addition, but they would of course bepooled with the cost of generating at other stations.      Thesecosts would be increased, though probably not substantially,by the process of eliminating the sulphur from the fumes.COPY NO.3\
7. Oil has about twice as much sulphur in it ascoal, and the prevailing wind is across the&apos; river toSt. Paul&apos;s.      It-is therefore clearly essential thatplant be installed to eliminate the sulphur.      How thisis to be done has not yet been worked out, but thetechnical experts who have been consulted are convincedthat it is practical (though it would probably not bepossible to have plant ready quite as soon as the power station).8. The issue,  therefore, resolves itself intowhether or not the additional cost of an oil-firedstation can be faced.     We feel that&apos;in view of the very,weighty amenity issues involved and of the desirabilityof using all available sites to increase electricity supplies in the London area, this additional cost wouldbe justified in the case of Bankside. -       ^9. We are accordingly satisfied that the decision reached by the Cabinet .(C.M. (47) 34th Conclusions, Minute 5)that a new 210,000 k.w.  power station should be erected atBankside, on the understanding that the electricity wouldbe generated by oil,  and that the building would be setback from the river, so as to avoid prejudicing the&apos; plans for redeveloping this area for commercial,  residential andpublic purposes - should be confirmed.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,S.W. 1.Slat May, 1947.    - -
