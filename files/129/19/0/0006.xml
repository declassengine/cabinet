PAYMENT OF EXPENSES OF MEMBERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIESJoint Memorandum by the Secretary.-of State for Scotlandand the Minister of&quot; HealthLast year the Cabinet invited us,  in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to appoint an independent committee to inquire into the question of the payment of allowances for attendance at meetings of local authorities(CM. (h6) hhth Conclusions, Minute 5).      This Committee, whoseChairman was Lord Lindsay of Birker, has now presented itsReport, which will be published as a Command Paper, just beforeWhitsun.2. A summary of the Report and recommendations is appended.There is a majority report signed by ten of the eleven membersof the Committee and a minority report signed by the eleventhmember.      The majority report concludes that in the best interests of local government there should be provision for thepayment of the travelling and subsistence expenses of membersof local authorities,  joint boards, etc.,  and of allowances for reduction of income or expenses arising from the loss,  throughpublic duties,  of time which they would otherwise have givento their normal occupations.    (These general principles are to someextent accepted even in the minority report).      Allowances for&quot;loss of time&quot; should be available to all members and not confined to any particular social groups or occupations, but it is emphasised that these allowances are to be related to actualexpense or reduction in income,  and are not a form of fee orremuneration.      Provision for the expenses of members is, inprinciple, to be mandatory on local authorities:    no generalscales of travelling or subsistence allowances are laid down, butthere is to be uniform provision for &quot;loss of time&quot;.      Maximumfigures for subsistence allowances (within which local authorities would have discretion in fixing scales)  and for &quot;loss of time&quot;are recommended.3. The Lord President&apos;s Committee at their meeting on the16th May (L.P.(117) 1hth Meeting, Minute 1) approved our proposal that the majority report should be implemented by the inclusionof the necessary provisions in the Block Grant Bill subject tofurther examination, when the scheme came to be worked out indetail, of certain points raised in discussion at that meeting.The report will be published on Thursday, the 22nd May,  and we now ask the Cabinet for authority to make a general statement inthe House in answer to an arranged Question on that day to theeffect that subject, to examination of points of detail,  theGovernment are in. general agreement with the recommendations in themajority report of the Committee and will take steps to implementthem as soon as Parliamentary time permits.16th May,  19^7.J.W.A.B.SECRET ^ /- &apos;- copy no.   z. *CP.

appendix summary OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON EXPENSESOF MEMBERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES1. The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Expenses ofMembers of   Local Authorities,  of which Lord   Lindsay of Birkerwas Chairman, has submitted a majority report signed &quot;by all themembers except one,  and a minority report signed by the dissentientmember5 Mr. R.H. Turton, M.P.2.        The Majority Report summarises the present law as follows:-(a) England and WalesCounty councils nay pay to their members travelling expenses butnot subsistence allowances for attendance at meetings of the council&apos;s or their major committees.   They may also pay the travelling expenses of members travelling on official visits of inspection within their areas.Joint committees of local authorities, and assessment committeescovering the areas of two or more local authorities, have powersvery similar to those of county councils.   Divisional executivesestablished.under the Education Act, 1944, have similar powersprovided the journey involves travel beyond a single county district.County borough, borough, urban district and rural district councils cannot make payments to their members for travelling orsubsistence on account of attendance at meetings of the councilsor their committees or of travelling on ordinary official businesswithin their areas, but in London metropolitan borough councilsmay pay expenses incurred in conveying members on inspections.All councils may pay reasonable travelling expenses and subsistence allowances to members travelling on the authorisedbusiness of the council outside the council&apos;s area.   All councilsexcept parish councils may, within certain limits, pay theexpenses of members attending the main.forms of local governmentconferences.No councils may pay allovrances for loss of remunerative timein connection, either with attendance at meetings or with travelon the business of the council,(b) ScotlandCounty councils may pay their members travelling expenses,*   subsistence allowances and allowances for tine lost fromordinary employment.   These provisions cover attendance at meetings of the council, its committees a.nd sub-Committees and,by administrative action, travelling on special duties for thecouncil and representing it on joint committees and joint boards.Joint committees as such are not covered.     Town councils and district councils have no such statutory powers, though towncouncils by use and wont in fact pay travelling expenses and subsistence allowances to.members travelling on the business ofthe council.*3,        The Majority Report considers that the present provision for theexpenses of members of local authorities is so limited as to impose unduehardship on some public-spirited.men and women who sex^ve on local, authoritiesin spite of difficulties, and to &quot;distort&quot; local authorities by keeping outof local government other persons who would be prepared to make reasonablesacrifices but cannot face the hardship which membership would involve.
These limitations of local government are detrimental to its quality andits representative character, and they cannot he remedied without provisionfor payment of members * expenses, and for other payments to make up forlosses involved.   Provision necessary to avert hardship should he assured toall members and should in principle be mandatory on local authorities, though,of course, without any compulsion on members to claim allowances.4.        The specific recommendations of the Majority Report are as follows(a) Travelling expenses(i) Local authorities should have power to pay.the actual faresreasonably incurred by members on travel by public transport.(ii) The system of travel vouchers should be a.adopted as widelyas possible.(iii) Local authorities should have power to pay reasonablemileage allowances for the use of members&apos; motor vehicles.(iv) Local authorities should have power to reimburse theadditional cost of air travel or hired conveyances whereit is approved by the Council.(v) It should be mandatory on local authorities to establishscales of allowances, and members should have a right tothe appropriate payments under the scales in force.(h) Subsistence allowances(i) Local authorities should have power to pay the subsistence-expenses of members necessarily absent from home, at ratesnot exceeding 5s. for an absence of 4 hours or more,10s. for 8 hours or more, 15s. for 12 hours or more, and 1.12.6. for a day and night, and these maximum rates should apply where allowances are- now payable.(ii) The maximum rate for a day and night should be increased to 2.2s.Od. where business in the Comity of London   is involved.(iii) The day and night allowance should be reduced by one-third. , where a member travelling overnight is provided with asleeping berth.(iv) It should be mandatory on local authorities to establishscales of allowances, and members should have a right to theappropriate payments under the scales in force.(c)Allowances for loss of remunerative time(i) Local authorities should have power to pay allowances for loss of remunerative time subject to a maximum of  1 for afull day and 10s. for half a day.   These figures -will beflat rates within which authorities will be authorised toaccept claims without challenging details,(ii) Payment of these allowances should be mandatory on localauthorities.-2.
(iii)    These allowances should be available to all members whoclaim then in connection with reduction of income orexpenses, arising from the loss, through public duties, oftime which they would otherwise have given to their normaloccupations.(d) Prevention of abuse.   Local authorities should be required:-(i) to use a prescribed form of claim.(ii) to publish in their minutes the payments of travelling expenses, subsistence allowances, and allowances for loss&quot;of remunerative time, made to each member.(e) Scope of the proposals. The allowances should, be available both to elected members and to persons co-opted or appointed understatutory powers to local authorities or their committees or sub-committees, in connection with the following kinds of dutyj-(i) Attendance at meetings of local authorities, of theircommittees and sub-committees, and of committees and other bodies on which the local authority are represented inpursuance of their statutory functions;   and, :&apos;&apos;meetings of &quot;divisional executives&quot;.(ii) Travel and time absent on the business of the localauthority, including business within iheir district whichis approved by resolution of the council or the appropriatecommittee identifying it by date and purpose,(iii) Attendance at conferences where expenses are payable,(f) Types of local authority. These-proposals should apply to countycouncils (including the London County Council), borough councils,metropolitan borough councils, urban district councils, and rural district councils, in England and Wales, the only exception beingthe City of London.    They should not apply to parish councils,except as relates to work done on behalf of rural district councilsbut parish councils should be brought within the scope of theexisting provisions relating to conferences.    In Scotland theyshould apply to county councils, town councils, and district councils:   the annual cost of allowances to district councillorsshould be excepted from the limitation of the expenditure of district councils to a shilling rate, and should be apportioned,between the district council and the county council where work is done for the latter authority.   Catchment boards, assessmentcommittees, and&quot;joint boards and joint committees constitutedentirely of local authorities, or established under statutory powers or by Ministerial order, should have the same powers and duties as local authorities, to the exclusion of those ofconstituent authorities,5.        The Majority Report makes also the following points:-(a) Estimates of the cost of a system of allowances varied widely:so far as could be judged, it would in some areas be a fraction(and on some assumptions a small fraction) of a penny rate, butin others it might be over a penny rate. A change from eveningmeetings to daytime meetings -would increase the cost of allowances, and the Committee thought there was much to be said for evening meetings wherever practicable.(b) Local authorities might prefer to grant only third-class fare,rather than first-class, especially on journeys of moderatelength. -
(o) The Committee drew attention to the recommendation of theRoyal Commission on Local Government that urban and rural district councils should have power (corresponding to thatof county and borough councils) to make an allowance to thehead of the council, and suggested that a similar powermight be given to burgh and county councils in Scotland,(d) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries might considerwhether to ask Parliament for power to apply the Committee&apos;sproposals to certain of the larger drainage authorities,other than catchment boards.6.        The Minority Report accepts the principle of payment of travelling and subsistence expenses, and in some circumstances of allowances for loss of remunerative time, but objects to the suggestion that provisionfor members&apos; expenses should be i. indatory on local authorities.    it considers that the recoixaendations of the Majority Report &quot;go far beyond what is necessary ..... and jeopardise the voluntary character of LocalGovernment Service&quot;, and makes the following suggestions:-(a) Travelling expenses.   First class railway fare should not beallowed for journeys of less than fifty miles, and themileage rate for private motor-cars should be limited tothreepence a mile.(b) Subsistence allowances.    It is doubtful whether these arenecessary in connection with meetings of Town and BurghCouncils, and meetings of Urban and Rural District Councilsthat are held on market days.(c) Loss of remunerative tine.   Allowances should be limited to15 shillings a day, and should be subject to a means test.Claims should bo strictly chocked.The Minority Report recommends also the discontinuance of the freepasses on public transport which in some places are available to members of local authorities, and the appointment of a RoyalCommission to enquire into the administration of the &quot;coonon good&quot;(revenue derived from ancient property of the burgh, and from other sources apart from rates) of Scottish burghs.    It does not agreeto the inclusion of drainage authorities, in any system of allowances in view of the direct interest which the members have in the workof t he authority, as owners or occupiers of land concerned.
