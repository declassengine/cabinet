IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S -E C R E TI desire to consult my colleagues on a point of difficulty which has arisen out of the Committee Stage ofthis Bill.2.      Clause 6 (2) of the. Bill reads as follows&quot;Where a training notice has been served on any person;,the service Authority may at any time before the dayon which he is thereby required to present himselfcancel the notice (without prejudice to the serviceof any fresh notice) or cause to be served on him a supplementary notice varying the training notice byaltering the place or time at which he is therebyrequired to present himself&quot;.The purpose of this clause is to enable the Services to cancel a notice calling up a man for a period of annualtraining, if for some emergency reason the training cannotbe carried out on the date and at the place where it had beenarranged.    This power to cancel the training notice mighthave to be used, for example, where a designated trainingcamp was made unusable by an outbreak of infectious disease   -or by fire, flood, etc.    More widespread interruption oftraining arrangements might be caused by transport strikes,or civil disturbances.    It will be noticed that the Clauseallows the original training notice to be cancelled &quot;withoutprejudice to the service of any fresh notice&quot;;    it also provides for a notice supplementary to the original trainingnotice to be served on a man to vary the place or time ofhis presenting himself for training, though not the date onwhich he must do so.    This last provision was intended tocover minor re-arrangements involving reporting for duty ata different time or place on the same day.3.     An amendment to this Clause was moved by Mr. Chetwynd(Labour;    Stockton on Tees) to insert after the words &quot;atany time&quot; the words &quot;not less than ik days&quot;.The object-of the amendment, as stated by its mover,was to prevent hardship to a man or to his employer, throughany re-arrangement of holiday periods, substitutes at his employer, etc. which might have been already made inaccordance with/the original training notice, and which itwould be difficult to vary at short notice.    Further, in  -certain cases, the cancellation at short notice of a training notice might involve the man concerned in financial loss.CP. (1)7)15215TH MAY.  19^-7CABINETKATIONAL SERVICE bill memorandum by the Minister of Defence
k*      in discussion of  oil is matter with ray Service colleagues and the Minister of Labour,  it has &quot;been represented that the&apos;Service Departments must retain the power to cancel theoriginal training notice at short notice, for- the reasons which I have mentioned above, and which are beyond their control.    At the same.time, the Minister of&apos;Labour pointsout that the arrangements in industry for fitting in theannual training period of a man with a reserve liabilitywill he complicated and will require to &quot;be made well inadvance of the actual training period.    To cancel these arrangements at short notice, and to require the necessaryre-arrangements for a training period later in the year, maywell involve considerable difficulty^    I consider there is a real risk of hardship being caused to the man, his familyand his employers; under the Clause as it new stands3 howeverreasonably the Service. Departments work: ,it in practice.5.      The alternative solutions appear to be as follows(a) To relinquish the power to cancel the trainingnotice once it has been issued, while retaining the power to vary the place or time of reportingby means oL  e supplementary JOTiice,,This means in pract:.ofi that in any case   where it proved impossible to follow the arrangements contemplated in theoriginal notice a, mar, would have to be sent to a differentcamp (possibly at a different time of day) to do his trainingperiod but always on the data fixed in his original trainingnotice.    Alternatively,  if no other camp were available, theService Departments might improvise such arrangements as were possible for continuous fall--time training within theoriginal period specified in the  draining notice? undertaken at, say,  the manfs normal drill hail or other Service   -training centre which might be available0Failing any alternative improvised training arrangements of the hind just mentioned,  a man, under this alternative,would have to receive military pay fcr the period specifiedin his training no bice, and that period would have to counttowards his annual training liability under the Billy withoutany training necessarily being performed,.(b) The other course appears to be. to retain the Clauseas now worded, while giving the fullest assurance to the House that the power to cancel a trainingnotice will only be used in cases of realemergency.............   .......in this case, it seems that the Government would haveto admit that when a training notice has unavoidably to be cancelled at short notice (and by that I mean in a matterof days only before the training is due to commence) thenhardship may well be caused through the cancellation, to aman, his employer, and possibly others concerned;    that theGovernment realise this possibility of hardship, and willmake proposals to the House, before periods of annualtraining commence under &quot;this Bill in 1950, designed to minimise such Hardship to those concerned,,    But in my view this second alternative may involve financial compensationfor   any extra expense in which those affected may be involved by the cancellation of the training notice shortly before it is due to take effee t.
6.      The service Ministers or myself will &quot;be pressed to say,on the Report Stage of the National Service Bill next week,what is the result of the undertaking given by the Secretaryof State for War,  on. 7th May lastb  to look at this matter again.    I prefer alternative (a), primarily &quot;because it notonly meets the immediate parliamentary situation, hut alsoavoids the complications inseparable from any considerationof compensation on grounds of. hardship.    On the other hand,I recognise that alternative (a),&apos;.in depriving the servicesof the power of cancellation, may both complicate Serviceadministration and reduce the effective reserve training aman may receive.    I ask the cabinet to decide whichalternative should he adopted.Ministry of Defence15TH MAY;  1.9*4-7,-&apos;5
