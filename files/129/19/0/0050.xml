Printed for the Cabinet,   July 1947CABINETABOLITION CP THE DEATH PENALTY;      Memorandum by the Home Secretary -AT their meeting on 19th June (CM. (47) 55th Conclusions, Minute 4) theCabinet agreed to consider further at a later meeting what attitude the Govern-ment should adopt to the proposal that capital punishment should be abolished.It may be of assistance to my colleagues if I summarise briefly the points whichI think we ought to have in mind When considering this matter.2. The arguments for and against the death penalty are summarised inparagraphs 55 to 68 of the Report of the Select Committee on Capital Punish-ment of 1930, and I attach as an Appendix extracts from this part of theCommittee V Report. We need not, I think; consider at length the ethical andmetaphysical arguments, and I suggest that we should direct our minds to thefollowing fundamental questions(a) Would the abolition of the death penalty increase the number of murders ?(&amp;) Is there a satisfactory alternative punishment?(c) Is there any change in existing law or practice which might be madeshort of complete abolition?(d) What would be the reaction of public opinion to a proposal to abolish the death penalty?(e) How should the matter be handled in Parliament?3. Would the abolition, of the death penalty increase the number of murders fThis is the crucial question, and was considered at great length by the SelectCommittee. The Conclusion which they reached was that capital punishmentcould be abolished in this country without endangering life or property orimpairing the security of society. The main arguments which led them to this conclusion were that the abolition of the death penalty for less serious crimeshad not, in fact, led to a serious increase in those crimes; and that the abolitionof capital punishment for murder in a number of foreign countries had notresulted in an increased homicide rate, and that, indeed, in some countries the number of murders had actually decreased. On the other hand, many ofthe witnesses Who appeared before the Select Committee suggested that it wasnot safe to draw analogies from the experience of other countries, where living conditions were different and where the alternative to capital punishment includeddeterrents such as solitary confinement which it would be impossible to impose&quot;in-this country. The view is held by many experienced police and prison officers that criminals would be more likely to use lethal weapons if the penalty for murder were imprisonment rather than death. Sir Alexander Paterspn in his evidence before the Select Committee of 1930 said : &quot; We who are in daily contact with professional criminals can safelysay that with them the dread of the gallows is a strong deterrent. . . . Theburglar is tempted to shoot the policeman or civilian who surprises him inorder to remove the evidence of his identity; If upon conviction for suchmurder he is only to receive a sentence of imprisonment a little longer thanthat which he will infallibly receive if he leaves alive the main evidence ofhis guilt, he will be the more likely to shoot than he is to-day.&quot;[33874] &apos; bSECRET Copy No. g-c.p..

4. Is there a satisfactory, alternative punishment f The Select Committeecame to the conclusion that if capital punishment were abolished, there wouldbe the strongest objections to imposing as an alternative punishment a specialtype of imprisonment involving more severe and rigorous treatment than is imposed for other crimes. Their view was that the only practicable alternativepenalty was that of imprisonment for life. In paragraph 228 of their Reportthe Committee said : &quot; For similar reasons, the life sentence we propose is not a life sentence ^without hope of release. It would be, as at present, indeterminate, with a prospect of release after a full period of years, and after considerationshaving in view alike the conduct of the prisoner and the safety of the public.In practice the life sentence is calculated at 20 years, with reduction for good conduct that may lessen it to 15 years. We would not propose to disturb the present practice.&quot;5. The administrative difficulties which such a change would cause are notinsurmountable, but regard should be had to the difficulties with which the prisonadministration may be confronted if, among those who are serving life sentencesfor murder, there are included men like Heath whom it is unsafe to release, andsuch men come to the conclusion after 15 or 20 years that there is no hope of release. The possibility that such a man may murder a prison officer cannot be excluded.6. Is there any change in existing law or, practice which might be madeshort of complete abolition? The Select Committee considered two possibilities,the first of which was that the degree of murder should be graded, either byindictment, by the Judge, or by the Jury. They reported that the weight ofevidence tendered to the Committee, was certainly against the bringing in of thissystem and that the Home Office witnesses gave evidence against grading oh thegrounds of the great practical difficulties in definition and in administration,because it would lack the precision and refinement which are considered necessaryaccording to the standards of justice in this country, and because it wouldinvade the wider powers exercised under the Royal Prerogative.7. The second possibility which the Committee considered was that thereshould be a larger exercise of the Royal Prerogative. Among the conditionalrecommendations which the Committee made in the event of Parliament deciding to maintain the death penalty was the following: &quot; That there might be a still larger exercise of the Royal Prerogative,and a raising of the line that has come through precedent to mark the limit of its application; and that such, a raising of the line could be effectedthrough a Resolution of the House of Commons.&apos;&apos;In his evidence to the Select Committee, Sir John Anderson said &quot;therewould be, in effect, no insuperable or very great difficulty in reserving capital punishment for what one might call colloquially the worst offenders.&quot;; 8. If, as a result of our discussion on this matter, we are agreed that it isdesirable that there should be some further restriction of the infliction of capital punishment but that the time is not ripe for its complete abolition, there is muchto be said for dealing with the matter in this way. The principal objection to itis that it would impose on the Home Secretary an even more arduous task than he has to bear at present. If the number of murderers executed for their crimeswas limited as a result of the wide exercise of the Prerogative to a very small proportion of the number convicted, it is inevitable that much controversy wouldbe aroused on each occasion that the Home Secretary decided not to recommend the exercise of the Prerogative.S. The definite recommendation of the Select Committee that the death penalty should be abolished for an experimental period of five years was in itselfan alternative; to complete abolition. This suggestion is no doubt intended toplacate the opponents of abolition and I have seen a circular inviting Membersof the House of Commons to support this approach to the problem. I can, however,see no practical way of giving effect to it. If Parliament were,to decide in favourof abolition for an experimental period, it would be indefensible to restore capital ^ jpunishment by means of a Resolution of Parliament or an Order in Councilapproved by Resolution of Parliament. The. restoration of capital punishmentwould be so grave a change that it ought not to be effected by anything less than an Act of Parliament.  Moreover, procedure by means of Resolution is liable to
involve an impasse if there is disagreement between the two Houses. There is thefurther point that abolition for an experimental period would weaken the force ofthe psychological effects which the supporters of abolition claim that it would have.10. What would be the reaction of public opinion to a proposal to abolishcapital punishment ? It was reported in the News Chronicle for 25th June, 1947,that the following question was put in a recent Gallup Poll in this country : &quot; In .this country most people convicted of murder are sentenced to death. Do you agreewith this or do you think that the death penalty should be abolished ? &quot; &apos; Theresults of the poll were : 69 per cent, said &quot;Agree with death penalty,&quot; 25 per cent, said&quot; Abolish death penalty &quot; and 6 per cent, said &quot; Don&apos;t know.&quot;11. Similar questions were asked in Gallup Polls in Canada, France, UnitedStates, Holland, Sweden and Brazil. The results in Canada and France, wherecapital punishment is the rule, were almost identical. In the United Statesopinion divided evenly, with only 8 per cent, undecided. The following were theresults in the three countries where murderers are not executed Holland, sweden and Brazil. In Holland 68 per cent, were opposed to reintroduction of the death sentence. In Sweden one-third favoured its reintroduction, one-third opposed itand one-third expressed no opinion. In Brazil 28 per cent, supported the death penalty, 37 per cent, opposed it and 35 per cent, were undecided.12. It is difficult to say whether any reliable deductions can be drawn fromthese figures, but the striking difference between the result of the polls held in countries where capital punishment is the rule and in those where it has been abolished indicates that some of those people in this country who supported the continuation of capital punishment may have done so from a reluctance to risk the consequences which they think abolition might have, without considering whether the risk is a real one or whether there are other arguments for abolitionso compelling that the risk ought to be taken. Perhaps the most that can be saidis that the figures represent fairly accurately the present state of public opinion in a period in which there has not been open controversy on the issue.13. How should the matter be handled in Parliament f-In view of theevident division of opinion among Ministers, it was suggested at the meeting ofthe Cabinet on 19th June that the best course would be to introduce the criminla justice Bill without any provision abolishing capital punishment and to explainin the Second Reading Debate-that..since the question of capital punishment wasone on which there were differences of opinion transcending Party lines, theGovernment felt that the matter should be left to a free vote on the Report stage of the Bill. There are, of course, objections to the proposal that the Governmentshould not take the initiative in this matter. To leave it to a free vote of theHouse might be taken as an indication that the Government had not made up itsmind and would be an invitation to the House of Lords to delete from the bill the clause abolishing the death penalty. When the Bill came back to the Commons,the question whether its reinsertion should be left again to a free vote of the house would raise some very difficult problems.14. Unless, therefore, we decide to resist the proposal, however strong maybe its supporters in the House of Commons, there is much to be said for takingthe initiative and inserting in the Bill, as introduced, a clause for the abolitionof the death penalty.15. There is an alternative to either of these courses Which may be worth considering and that is that the Government should take the line that they have come to the conclusion that, while some restriction ought to be made in theinfliction of the death penalty, the time has not yet come for its complete abolition.On these grounds they would propose to resist the clause proposing abolition, but,in order to enable the House to consider whether there should be a more frequentrecommendation for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, the Government would propose to table a Resolution in the same sort of terms as that included in, theconditional recommendations of the Select Committee, and that if such aResolution were passed, the practice governing recommendations for the exerciseof the Prerogative would be altered accordingly..   - ..    .

appendix extract  FROM  THE  REPORT  OF  THE  SELECT  COMMITTEEON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,  1930Arguments for the Death Penalty55. That, from the primitive point of view and in the interests of retribu-tive justice, murder deserves the punishment of death; that he who unlawfullyand purposely takes a life of another should forfeit his own; that what hehad done to some member of Society, Society ought to do to him by way ofretribution.56. That the penalty should be appropriate to the offence; that the greatestcrimes demand the severest punishment; that murder stands in a class by itself,and should have a punishment of its own; that there is something about murderwhich differentiates it from any other crime, and that, therefore, the death penalty should be reserved for it and it alone; that the most precious gift of all islife itself; and that no person should be able to deprive another of this supremepossession without himself paying the supreme penalty.57. That murderers are enemies of the State, which has a right to put them to death in self-defence; that the safety of the State is the supreme law;that the interests of the community are paramount. That in this way the Statesecures safety not only from the murderer himself, but from all those who aredeterred by the spectacle of his doom. Without Capital Punishment you wouldhave more decent people killed, and more rogues and wretches kept alive. Thatthrough it many lives are saved and that, in this way, the State appreciatesthe value of human life and pays tribute to its sanctity.58. That the fear of death is the most intense of all fears, and, therefore,the death penalty is the greatest of all deterrents; and that, if it is not a universalpreventative, it is at least effective in many cases; that there is a class in thecommunity regardless of the life of others, but careful of their owb men socruel and degraded that the only thing that will prevent them from committingviolent crime is the fear that they will lose their own lives; that for them itis the hangman&apos;s whip alone that will &quot; haud the wretch in order &quot;; and thatfor such, if for no others, the death penalty must be retained.59. That the death sentence is more calculated than any other to arousein the criminal a sense of his wrong-doing and to bring him to repentance.60. That, on the other hand, a lifelong sentence is but to let men rot anddecay, to doom them to an existence worse than death itself, and permanentlyto impair something more precious than the life of the physical body.61.   That for a certain type of criminal there is no hope of reclamation.Arguments against the Death Penalty62.   That every human life is of inestimable value, and that life itself is* the gift of the Creator which no man is empowered to take away.63. That this sanctity and inviolability of human life are as binding onthe State as on individual men; that the State itself commits a crime when itthus punishes it; that the more life is held sacred by the Government, themore likely is it to be preserved by the people the higher its standard, thehigher the effect on the&quot;public; that, in John Bright&apos;s words, &quot;If you wishto teach the people to reverence human life, you must first show that yoU reverenceit yourselves.&quot;64. That the deterrent effect of the capital penalty is greatly exaggerated;that its efficacy in this regard is a matter of conjecture; and that it is not justifiable to maintain such a revolting penalty on the precarious basis of mere supposition.That whatever its deterrent effect, that is more than counter-balanced by the example of the State itself taking life. That penal servitude for life is atleast a comparable deterrent, not so abrupt and intense but more prolonged and continuous in its example on the public mind. That a deterrent which hasnot the full support of the public as a whole, or is regarded by a large sectionof the community as wrong or unnecessarily harsh, is greatly weakened in its application, and seriously detracts from the certainty of punishment.   That
the greatest deterrents are in education, sobriety and the general social upliftof the people; and that the reliance placed upon the death penalty as an effectivedeterrent, has the effect of satisfying and securing the public mind, insteadof leading it forth on a crusade to eliminate crime by eliminating its socialcauses.65. That the death penalty unwarrantably abandons all hope of the reforma-tion of the criminal, whereas he should be given opportunity not only to repent,but to make good his repentance, that, even in the most abandoned, there isstill the possibility of reclamation and of moral and spiritual development; andthat you cannot put away a man as if he were absolutely useless, or cast him asrubbish to the void.66. That an Execution adversely affects warders and prisoners and all who are brought into contact with it, and that it has a brutalising effect onthe population at large. In this and other ways the maintenance of capital punishment prevents the spread of those finer social feelings and opinions thatare the real security against murderous crime. That the death penalty enlistspublic sympathy on the side of the murderer instead of the victim, and engendersa morbid interest, leading in some cases to imitative crime.67. That while from the individual point of view, murder is the mosthorrible and most heinous of all offences, yet there are high crimes of an unsocialnature more dastardly in their planning and more devastating and murderousin their effects. There are fraudulent conspiracies that result in the absoluteruin, destitution, loss of health, and slow death of many people, and all suchcrimes are equally deserving of the highest penalties.68. That, finally, the death penalty is irreparable, and an irreparable judg-ment should never be pronounced save by an infallible judge. Innocent menmay suffer, and have suffered, the death penalty; and no redress is possible.
