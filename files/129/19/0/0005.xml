Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1947SECEETCopy MqlCP. (47) 155l%th May, 1947CABINETADMISSION OF NON-EUROPEAN PERSONNEL INTO THE UNITEDKINGDOM forces memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty HAVE read the joint paper CP. (47) 154 circulated by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for India, about admitting intothe Navy and the Army for permanent service men who are not of pure Europeandescent. I appreciate the difficulties of both sides in this matter-being par-ticularly well placed to do so but I think that the joint paper has over-rated theobjections to the compromise plan which was put forward for the consideration ofthe Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for India, as outlined in paragraph 5of CP. (47) 154.2. The first objection cited is that few Colonies will be able to maintainregular local military forces on a scale which will attract the best type of colouredentrant. I consider, however, it would be wise to wait and see whether this provesto be the case; arrangements may be made for the Colonies to be grouped together for this purpose in areas. Moreover, there seems to be no reason why the forcesof the Colonies should not be efficient even if they are small, nor is it likely in factthat a Colonial subject&apos;s prospects of advancement will be greater in the UnitedKingdom Forces than they will be in his local forces. On the other hand, I doubt whether it is in the interests of Imperial Defence for these men to be attracted permanently to the United Kingdom Forces. By encouraging the bestmen to look to the United Kingdom Forces for a career we should at the outset beplacing a handicap on the local forces, and be tending to reduce their efficiency.3. The second objection advanced is that the compromise plan would not enable us, in so far as the Royal Navy is concerned, to form an opinion about thepossibilities of coloured officers leading and gaining the confidence of ratings, norof coloured ratings being absorbed into a ship&apos;s company. This might be true iftraining were confined to shore courses, but there is no reason why it should be soconfined, nor is there any reason why coloured officers and men should not be sentto sea specifically in order to get some idea of these very qualities. commanding officers could be informed of the reason for the presence of these officers and menand asked to pay particular attention to the reactions of all parties.4. The third objection put forward is that the scheme would not apply tocoloured British subjects living in this country. This is true, but the objection is more apparent than real, as it seems likely that most of the coloured men whohave come to this country have come for reasons other than a desire to enter the armed Forces.5. For these reasons, I consider that the compromise plan still affords an acceptable solution to the problem. I should in any case be opposed to making any alteration to the normal rules for entry into the Navy, which in the eventwould be one of form only and not of real significance. Commonwealth interests would be injured more severely if some years after relaxing our entry regulationsit was disclosed that no coloured officers had, in fact, been entered. Moreover,there is now an additional and important factor to be taken into account It[33629]
is by no means certain that India or Burma will remain within the BritishCommonwealth. Until the future can be more clearly seen it would, on this account alone, appear unwise to admit them on permanent engagements andin consequence undesirable at the present time to modify the regulations at&apos;all, since any discrimination between Indians and Burmese on the one handand Colonial subjects on the other would surely be the occasion of particular difficulty.6. In so far as the Royal Navy is concerned, the fundamental Admiraltyarguments in addition to those I have already covered above--against theproposal put forward by the Secretaries of State can.be briefly recapitulatedas follows: (a) The arguments put forward by the Secretary of State for War in cp. (46) 271 are valid for the Royal Navy and are accentuated bythe necessarily cramped living conditions of His Majesty&apos;s Ships.Life afloat entails a sacrifice of privacy and the acceptance of anintimacy which have no counterpart in shore life, thus making itfar more difficult successfully to absorb coloured officers and men* into His Majesty&apos;s Ships than it would be to absorb them into a land-based service.(&amp;) The welfare of the Royal Navy is planned on the basis that the UnitedKingdom is &quot; home.&quot; For instance, all sailors have a right to expect to spend some part of their time in reach of their families. Evenif a non-European was living in the United Kingdom at the time ofhis enlistment, it does not follow that his family and connectionswould be here. It would not then be possible under the existing schemes of Naval drafting for him to be given enough time with his family for his own well-being. Preferential treatment would be impracticable.(c) The Royal Navy is more liable than the other two Services to come into contact with the Dominions and with other countries. In many placesthe presence of non-Europeans in the complement of one of HisMajesty&apos;s Ships, especially as officers, would be embarrassing for. the Service, for the individual and for the authorities on the other side; it would be particularly so when His Majesty&apos;s Ships werevisiting South African ports. On the other hand, once they are enteredfor permanent service, regular Naval personnel should be capable of&apos; being sent anywhere the Navy goes and of filling any rank and postto which their abilities entitle them.7. In all the circumstances the Admiralty is opposed to any alteration ofthe existing regulations at the present time, but I shall, of course, be preparedto put the compromise plan (which does not require such alteration) into operation and to give it a full trial.H:A dmiralty, S. W. 1,IQth May, 1947.
