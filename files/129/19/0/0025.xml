-    138(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (U7) 1756th Jane,  19U7.DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL RESOURCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues are already seized of the importance ofincreasing production in the Colonies.      I have been&quot;consideringthe machinery for this and am convinced of the need for securingnot only the provision of basic social services and public works and- utilities but also the promotion of enterprises which increase production of foodstuffs and materials in short supply,  to thejoint advantage of the United Kingdom and the Colonies.      the funds of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act have hadperforce to be used for the first purpose.      Whatsis now urgently necessary is provision for the undertaking of ad., hoc schemes forthe development of individual agricultural and other industries.2. This is not a task which can be efficiently discharged by the scattered efforts of small private and public organisationscolony by colony.      The Colonial Economic and Development council has therefore recommended that a Colonial Development corporation should be set up with adequate powers to promote and undertake the expansion of supplies of colonial foodstuffs, raw materials and other commodities.3. It is clear that there would &quot;be considerable scope forsuch activities.      The Colonial Office is at the momentinvestigating the possibilities, for example, of large scale development of rice in Borneo, of linseed in a variety of colonies, of fertilisers and other minerals.      I should not wish,however,  to limit the functions of the Corporation entirely tothe expansion of supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials;    Iwould give it scope to develop other industries where these showpromise of being remunerative and of benefiting the Coloniesor the United Kingdom.h.    / The establishment of a separate Organisation for eachproject as it. arises is open to the serious objections thatthe initiation of projects is seriously delayed if special measures to create a new^organisation have to be taken for eachindividually,  and that there is serious loss of efficiency ifavailable supplies of experienced and expert personnel haveto be. dissipated among a large number of comparatively smallorganisations.      A special Corporation is being created to operate the East African groundnut scheme and the Minister of -Food is proposing that that Corporation should be empowered to operate elsewhere also;    but that is an exceptional case becauseof the very large scope of the groundnut scheme. &apos;    I am convincedthat a Colonial,Development Corporation with wider functions isalso required.COPY NO.   cabinet
5* The general functions I have in mind for such a.Corporation are -to enquire into new projects and conduct and pay for investigation of a commercial character;to operate new industries itself where appropriate;to develop and assist ad hoc undertakings and toprovide finance for such undertakings &quot;by taking upshares, debentures or other forms of capital eitheralone or in association with a Colonial Government orGovernments or with. Governments of other parts of theCommonwealth.I have discussed with the Minister of Food the more detailed definition&quot; of the functions of the suggested corporation and other provisions for its establishment and we are satisfiedthat adequate arrangements can be made to prevent overlappingwith the Corporation to be formed under his control and that thetwo can conveniently be provided for in a single Bill.6. I propose that the Corporation should have a broadrepresentation of persons with experience in business, appliedscience, administration and trade union matters in the^ Coloniesor elsewhere;    and that its capital should be obtained&apos; as tothe greater part by the raising of money by public issues underTreasury guarantee with a total borrowing power of  100 million,with provision for some initial contribution, direct from theExchequer.      I should contemplate that new undertakings would normally be actually, operated by subsidiary organisations whichmight be incorporated under the Companies legislation either ofthe United Kingdom itself or of the Colony or Colonies concerned.Such subsidiaries could then, supplement the finance provided forthem by the Corporation itself by issuing debentures or otherstock, which would provide an opportunity for the public in theColonies themselves to invest part of their surplus funds either in the stock of the main Corporation or in that of subsidiaries. .7. I should propose to lay it down as a principle that theCorporation should conduct its own operations and those of itssubsidiaries on public utility principles, that it should aim atearning over a period of years sufficient to pay its capitalcharges without aiming at large profits.      As its whole object would be to initiate genuinely new development, the risk of loss on individual projects would have to be faced, but theCorporation would be expected to &quot;break even&quot; on its wholeoperations over a number of years.8. In order to provide fully for regular consultation withthe Minister of Food,  the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Supply as well as the Treasury in the generaloperations of the Corporation,  so that full account could be taken of the   needs of this country for physical supplies and of thepossibilities of improving the balance of payments position ofthe sterling area .as a whole by developing new production, Ishould propose the setting up of a departmental committee whichwould keep in general touch with the operations of the corporation and give it guidance on major matters of policy.(i)(ii)(iii)
9- Legislation would be necessary -to establish such a colonial Development Corporation and, if we are, not to losemuch valuable time in getting ahead with the task of economic development in the Colonial Empire,  it is essential that such legislation should be passed during the next session ofParliament.      Account has already been taken of this and a place is reserved in the legislative programme for a Bill toestablish both the Corporation discussed here and that requiredto operate the East African groundnut scheme.      The necessaryprovisions will not be very long and I believe the measure would give rise to little Party controversy since the necessityof economic development in the Colonies is common ground withall Parties and the possibility of establishing some such organof - development as this has, been the subject of comment in all political quarters.      I am,  therefore,  seeking approval inprinciple in order that my officials may proceed, inconsultation with the Treasury and the Ministry of Pood, tothe detailed drafting of a Bill.A.C.J.Colonial Office,6th June,. 19.2+7&apos;
