Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1947SECRETCP. (47) 1967th July, 1947CABINETDESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER HOLIDAYNote by the Prime minister in the interests of efficiency I am anxious that all Ministers and senior officials should have a reasonable spell of uninterrupted holiday during the summer. I therefore propose, following last year&apos;s precedent, that during the six weeks from 11th August to 22nd September there should be no meetings ofthe Standing Ministerial Committees of the Cabinet and that the Cabinet itself should meet as rarely as possible.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider forthwith whether there are any matters on which they will have to obtain decisions from the Cabinet orfrom a Cabinet Committee before the latter part of September, and to make every effort to bring these matters forward for consideration before the endof July.3. I recognise that certain questions may arise during this period, particu-larly in the field of economic and of foreign affairs, which will have to be submitted for the collective decision of Ministers. I hope, however, that the occasions when Ministers will have to be called together may be kept to a minimum; andwith this in view I propose that urgent business which would ordinarily have beenhandled by a Cabinet Committee should be dealt with in this period by theCabinet itself if it should be meeting for other purposes. If, therefore, any suchbusiness should arise during the period 11th August to 22nd September, theMinister concerned should communicate with the Cabinet Secretariat, who will advise how it can best be handled.4. The Cabinet Secretariat will make the usual arrangements to ensurethat a nucleus of Ministers will be readily available for any meetings of theCabinet which may have to be held.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,7th July, 1947.33864  .Copy No.31
