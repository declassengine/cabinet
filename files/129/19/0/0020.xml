CP. (It-7) 17031 ST MAY, -19U7&apos; cabinet food IMPORT PROGRAMME 19U7-b,8Memorandum &apos;by the Mdnister of food.   ,  I must emphasise the gravity of the economic and political consequences which would flow from a &quot;decision to cut ou.r hard currency food imports for 191+7/2+8 by  80 million as proposed in cp. (1+7) 167. . ;2.    ?The present diet of our people is generally consideredinadequate.    Nor are our people wrong in so considering it.    Itis a debating answer to our political opponents to say that the -. &quot;diet of the worst off sections, of our -people was even-lowerbefore ,the war.    But the fact remains that judged by the standardthat matters, i. e.  the real requirements of different/-sectionsof the population, our present diet is physiologically inadequate for some sections, of the population, i. e. adolescents and     ^housewives whose families have no access to canteens, restaurants,or differential rations.    And it is psychologically inadequate,,  because of its lack of variety and. palatability, to the&apos; populationas a whole.    These facts are inevitably -reflected, by a growing- dissatisfaction with a food - situation which, two&apos; years after theend of the war,deteriorates rather, than improves.3*      In this connection I, received on 22nd- May a deputation ,.from the Rationing Committee of the Trades Union Congress which represented to me the necessity of a general all-round^improvement&apos; in the national diet,-if the increase in production which theGovernment requires is to be forthcoming.    What would-they&apos;have said if I had told them that instead severe cuts were-to be imposed?    It is these representations from our own side to whichX attach importance.    The attacks of the Conservative Party and.-. the Conservative Press have, it is true, been.characterised by..such exaggerations that they have been comparatively easy to,refute, as in the case of the recent debate in the House of Lords,where Lord Woolton and Lord Cherwell were so ably dealt with bythe Dominions Secretary.&apos;    These debating successes-must not blindus to the fact, however, that some of the assertions made by- our opponents&apos; are dangerously near the truth.    For example, it is,the case that the housewife, whose household has &apos;no- access., todifferential rations or to canteens, can now provide no more-   than about 2,100 to.&apos; 2,300 calories per head to herself and herfamily.    Taken with the disturbing evidence of loss of bodyweight in adolescents (see CP. (2+7) 99) this is, surely, amost distressing fact.    These are the results of the substantial-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. ^ t       J qIt is issued for the-persenal-use oi...../^..M.$&amp;*^^ &apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;TOP SECRET Copy No.......
post-war deterioration in our diet caused by the cut of oneounce in the bacon ration, the cut of one ounce in the margarine-butter-cooking fats ration, the imposition of oread rationing,a reduced distribution of cheese and the severe tightening up ofthe points scheme, all of which cuts have occurred during theperiod of office of the present Government.  (The only offsettingration increase has been a 2d increase - the meat ration)    Itis against this background that it is proposed to announce andimpose further severe, cuts in the national diet.    Of course i recognise that those who favour this course are just as reluctantas the rest of us.to reduce our people&apos;s food supply.    But they feel that there is no alternative, if the balance of payments isto be redressed sufficiently soon,5.      An essential point for the Cabinet to weigh is whether a cut in our food imports of  80 million, involving the reductionin the national diet shown in paragraph 6 &quot;below will in facttend to redress the &quot;balance of payments.    The view that it will do so is based upon the unstated premise that a further reductionin our people&apos;s food will not cause a falling off in production -nor will even prevent the indispensable increase in production on which we must count.    I submit to my colleagues that a furthercut in our people&apos;s food will quite inevitably cut output and soexports.    Therefore, the whole calculation by which  80 million is struck off the import side of the account, while nothing isstruck off the export side, would prove in practice disastrouslyfallacious.    After all, no one would think that we could&apos;calculate in this way in the case of raw materials.    If we weremad enough to make a comparable slash in our imports of rawmaterials we should know that we had to face a corresponding,and far greater, fall in our output and exports.    But food isalso a raw material.    It is the raw material out of which wedraw the energies of our workers.    If we cut it down we cannot expect to escape a corresponding, and very likely much larger,cut in our exports.6.      A cut of  80 million in our hard currency food imports would have the following effect on our national diet:-(i) We shall in any case, upon supply grounds, have to cut the meat ration by 2d.  worth of canned cornedmeat at.the end of June for a period of some months.. The  80 million cut would mean that we should be unable to purchase any United States meat afterthe end of June and in.that event it would.benecessary in the autumn to make a second cut of2d.  on carcase meat which would have to be continuedindefinitely.(ii) No United States dried fruit at all.      consumption would be down by hO% and this would have the worst effects on all cake and bun making, as wellas on the housewife.
(iii)    No United States or Canadian apples - thiswould mean few applies in the winter monthswhen they are so &quot;badly needed.(iv)    No United States canned fruit - which in practicemeans almost no canned fruit at all, as thereis no appreciable alternative souroe.(v)    So drastic a cut in coffee (&quot;by one third of itspresent consumption) that we should immediatelyhave to ration it.    This would mean putting onto rations a commodity which has been unrationedthroughout the war and would be particularlyserious today when the fate of the tea rationis hanging in the balance.(vi)    No North American poultry.    This would reduceimported supplies by 25%.(vii)    No domestic pack dried eggs.    This would meanexhausting our stocks by June 19^8 so that weshould have to rely entirely on shell eggs in19WU-9.(viii)    An inability to increase the sugar ration, although we have completely adequate supplies to do so and to maintain the increase through 19^8 withoutfurther dollar purchases above the presentauthorisation.    I attach the greatest importanceto making this increase so that our people will feel that, though many things are getting worse,some, at any rate, are getting better, and as aproof that when it can secure supplies theGovernment does give the people the benefit ofthem.    In this connection as our stocks rise itwill be increasingly embarrassing to justify out failure to increase the ration, as the facts will inevitably become known from the Trade and navigation returns.(ix)    The series of minor cuts involved which,&apos;thoughsmall individually, would taken together havemost serious effects in destroying whatvariety and portability is left in the dietof our people.7.      We are asked to impose all this on our long sufferingpeople for the sake of a further  80 million cut, which can have no chance of enabling us to avoid asking for UnitedStates help, and would do very little even to postpone our having to ask for it.    For what is the basis of the case foran  80 million cut in dollar food inrporta?   The originalTreasury proposal was for a cut of  150 millions in food imports in order to.avoid having to ask for further UnitedStates financial help.
8.     But this purpose has now &quot;been abandoned.     For itwas seen on examination that even a cut of  150 million would be almost certainly inadequate to effect it.Clearly, therefore, a cut of  80 million cannot be intendedto enable us to do without some form of United States help.And in fact it is now proposed by the Chancellor, quiterightly in my view, to lay the facts of the situationbefore the United States Government in the immediate future,,9.     What then is the purpose of the  80 million cut?Various purposes have been suggestede(1)    It has been said that we must impress theUnited States Government and people withour efforts.    But all our advice from theUnited States authorities themselves isthat the way to do this is to show that britain is a going, thriving concern,worth&quot; investing in.    Rising coal outputfigures, rising exports, the beginningof actual work on constructive projects,such as the Eas.t African Groundnut Scheme,are the ways in which to impress the americans.    A further cut in what the americans believe is the already miserableBritish diet,&apos;, far from impressing them will convince them that we are goingdownhill;    its inevitable effect on our production and exports will confirm this impression.(2)    It has been said that we must give a salutaryshock to the nation which is living beyond- its means.    An  80 million cut in food imports will undoubtedly give our people ashock.    But does anyone seriously think thatthey will respond to this kind of shock by increased output?    Is it not obvious thatthe resulting ration cuts will remove muchof the incentive to work and earn - whywork overtime when the money will buy youeven less cake, coffee or meat than now?;   (3)    It has been said that-,  at least,  a cut of  80 .million will gain us time.      At the present rateof drawing of the loan it would gain us alittle over one month.     For the sake of thatwe are asked to do the grave damage to our&apos; diet shown in paragraph 6 above.     We are toldA-
that this delay in the running out of theUnited States credit might just see us overthe American Presidential elections.     but no one con possibly foresee the rote of exhaustion of the United States credit as exactly as that -it depends on all sorts of factors such aswhether&apos;United States prices break in the autumn,the availability of non-dollar supplies, e,g,in Russia, Central.Europe, Indonesia and else-whore, the course of events in Germany, etc.10,     What is now clear is that we cannot get through withoutfurther United States help of one kind or another.     Let usface that fact, and let us arrive at the moment at which wemust have such help with our people in good heart, on risingcurves of production and exports, so that the United StatesGovernment considers us a credit-worthy concern, instead of on a diet which must mean failing industrial effort, - and so will convince the United States Government that to invest inus would be to throw good money after bad,11.     All this does not mean, however,  that the Chancellor&apos;demand for the utmost possible economy in dollar expenditure is not entirely justified.      It is not possible to bridge&quot;the gap&quot; in the balance of payments by a cut in imports,for an import cut on a sufficient scale would inevitablycause a corresponding drop in exports and so leave the gapas wide as ever.     Nevertheless even with further UnitedStates help Tire shall still be faced with the necessity ofbalancing our overseas payments at the earliest possible moment.      I have therefore examined and re-examined1 our proposed food import programme with the utmost care.      MyDepartment has been pressed to the utmost to see what items .can be pruned without causing such a deterioration in our people&apos;s diet as must have grave economic-and political consequences.12.      It must be emphasised that any cuts, no matter howchosen, will have unpleasant consequences.      Our import programme was ^designed to do no more than to attempt to makethose minimum improvements in the, national diet which,  inthe  third year after  the end of the war, our people were,surely,  fully entitled to expect.      (No more than this,  itis anticipated, will be possible on supply grounds, in anycase).      Only the very gravest considerations could, i submit,  justify us in attempting to do less than this. ForI have no doubt that such modest improvements in our people&apos;sdiet would do more than any other-single thing to get theincreased production which we must have.    My Department&apos;programme aimed at securing supplies which would have enabled us to improve a little the variety and palatabilityof our diet, by providing some 10jZ more egg products, rather more poultry, one-third more canned fruit and a good deal more fresh fruit and canned fish.     We should also, and asan offset to the inevitable cut in the meat ration, havebeen able to increase the sugar ration b^ two ounces,  andto restore the -bacon ration from its present miserable levelof two ounces to three ounces in the winter, while makingthe usual winter increase in the Cheese ration from twoounces to  three ounces,  (bread rationing can also be
abolished if supplies permit) - all on the assumption thatthe requisite supplies were forthcoming, which would certainly not have proved to be a true assumption in all cases.    these were the targets to be aimed at.      True we should not have. reached them all.     But if we are not to aim at them then theresult might well prove far worse than anyone is anticipatingtoday.      if, for Instance, we are not allowed to buy eggs oncurrency grounds and we fail to get meat on supply grounds,we shall be left short of both.     The supply and currencydeficiencies may, that is to say,, prove cumulative,.13,     Nevertheless the dollar situation is so. grave that i recognise that my colleagues may take the view that we shouldnot even aim at somj of these small improvements, and should accept some cuts even below our present levels - though i must warn them that if we do this the result, all our experience shows, will almost certainly be worse than it lookson paper, because of some inevitable disappointments oversupplies.      If we accept this view, it is possible to make substantial dollar savings without eating into the vital partsof our food supplies,  though inevitably at a loss of varietyand palatability.14.     We might, then, cut out all our United states orangesand grapefruit; all our. United States miscellaneous fruit,most of our United States canned fruit, all our North Americanpoultry and some of our coffee (but not so much that we hadto ration it).     By means of these and many smaller cuts itwill be possible to save  25 million.      Under such a programmewe should be able to avoid the, second cut in the meat ration,&apos;the  refusal to distribute our available sugar, and the runningout of our dried egg supplies next year,15.      I must emphasise that,: this figure of  25 million has notbeen arbitrarily arrived at.      It represents the very utmostthat can be squeezed out of our food import programme withouteating into the vital parts of the national diet.    When we go beyond a cut of  25 million severe consequences to the people&apos;sdiet, above all in variety and palatability, become, in evi tab le.(See Sir Wilson Jameson&apos;s remarks at Appendix II on thenecessity of palatability if people are in practice to eatenough to keep up their health and strength.16.      A final word on the Chancellor&apos;s recommendation thatthe reduced food programme should be authorised for the next six months only.      I must assume that this does not mean that my Department would hot be in a position to make any singlecommitment beyond the 31st December.      It would clearly be quite impossible to carry on our extensive trading operations on that basis.     We must be.free to take advantage offavourable opportunities of purchase as they present&apos; them-selves,not only if we are to secure our food at the most advantageous prices but also if we are to avoid losingsupplies to our competitors.^..    Many of the foods we buy areseasonally produced, and unless we are free to purchase them at  the right  time we may lose them altogether.

17* I attach appendices showing detailed comparisons ofthe various programmes (Appendix&apos; IA and IB) and notes &quot;by-Sir Wilson Jameson (Appendix II) on the nutritional effects of various cuts.      These latter notes were prepared,  Iunderstand, at a time when cuts of . 100*  80 and . 50 millionsrespectively were being examined at the official level.18, I therefore ask my colleagues with all the earnestnessat my command:-(1)    to confine any cuts in hard currency food imports to a sum not exceeding&apos;  25 million;(2)    to authorise me&apos;to announce the consequentialration changes, viz. one cut of 2d.  in the meat ration and a two ounce increase in the sugar ration in due course.J.

APPENDIX IIN0T3S. BY SIR WILGQi; J..MASON, 0HI3F MSDIO. .L OFFICER,MINISTRY OF lUALTHa ON NUTRITION ..L. EFFiiiCTii OF OUTSIN THE MINISTRY OF FOOD liJPOLIT EROGP-JLU(A) KDTRITIOITAL-- BFi&apos;S0T8 Or;&apos; OUT OF  100 MILLION(1)    The proposed cut of  100&apos;million would, result inu. diet that would closely resemble that of 1940/1941 -the worst period of the war - and would compare unfavourably with the diet of 19U4/us.      In particular, the tot...l amountof fat available per person in the civil population, if theproposed cuts were applied, would be significantly lower than at any time since the outbreak of war.      It is important,moreover, to bear in mind that the civil population nowincludes large numbers of young men and women, formerlyin the Services, whose nutritional requirements are relatively high. ,(2)   The turning point in the nutritional history of thewar coincided with .the introduction into the diet of certainfoodstuffs of a similar nature to those it is now proposedto cut - foodstuffs which make for palatability and varietyand which cannot be replaced by extra rations of bread and potatoes.     A decline in palatability would inevitably resultin a lower intake of food and, consequently, in reducedindustrial output.     Nor should the psychological effect offurther restrictions be ignored.(3)   With expert assistance from the Ministry of Food wehave examined the possibility of substituting alternativesavings which would have less   severe effects on nutritionhut without any successful result.(4)   For these reasons we cannot but regard with the utmostmisgiving the reductions in food imports discussed in thepaper submitted by the Ministry of Food.(B) NUTRITIONAL SFF^CTo ON GUT OF  60 MILLION OR  50 million have had an opportunity of discussing with theMinistry of Food the proposals to cut hard currency food imports by (a)  80.millions, or&quot;(b)  50 millions,1 have made it clear, I think, that any cuts in theexisting.rations are to be deprecated, on psychological no less than on physiological grounds.       if, however, ministers have come to the conclusion that certain cuts are unavoidable,I regard the suggestions made by your Department as the bestin&apos; the circumstances.The retention of canned meat and canned fish will help to maintain the present nutritional value of the diet and.will preserve a useful degree of variety and palatability.Obviously I should much prefer, for general nutritionalreasons, the  50 million cut to the  80 million.
In &quot;both proposals the population will,--theoretically,have available a diet of sufficient calorie value.     Thetwo main difficulties will still be the lov fat content and,   particularly for adolescents and for adultsundertaking various forms of heavy m.nual work, the nonetoo generous allowance of animal protein.       I appreciate,of course, that if a cut has to be made so:e of it must&quot;be&apos;&quot;borne by carcase meat which &quot;bulks so largely in ourhard currency spending.     A reduction of the carcf.semeat ration to i/20., together with a smaller quantityof meat sent to manufacture, will take a lot of publiceducation if it is to be regarded-as a -proper sacrificeon the part of the British working man.
