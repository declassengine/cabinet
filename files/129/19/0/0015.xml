J63(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC&quot; MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)A        S E CRETCP. (47)  165 COPY NO.    O &apos;20th May. 1947CABINETEQUAL pay memorandum hy the Minister without PortfolioOn 7th January,  1947,  the Prime Minister appointed a Committee of Ministers under my Chairmanship. (CP. (47) 22)to examine the issues raised hy the Report of the RoyalCommission on Equal Pay.      The Committee has been assisted by a Working Party of Officials.2. As a result of a preliminary discussion of thesubject, we reached the conclusion that before any steps couldbe taken to give effect to the principle of equal pay, very careful consideration must be given both to the cost of suchaction and to its effect at the present time upon the economicSituation of the country.      We therefore asked the official working Party to.consider what would be the cost of introducingequal pay in the public services (i.e.  the nOn-industrial civil Service, the Local Government Service and the teaching profession), including the cost of any consequential schemeof family allowancesj    and to consider the possible repercussions-. :sions of this step on wage levels and costs in industry generally and its effect in the present economic and financial situation of.the country.3.. The estimates submitted by the Official working party show that the Cost.of introducing equal pay in thepublic services would be as followsCivil Service Between  5m.  and  10m.Teachers- Between  9. 7 and  11. 7m.  risingeventually to  16.5m.Local Government     Between  3.25m.  and  3.75m.including nursesTotal Between  17.95m.  and  25.45m.rising eventually to  30.25m.Of this total of some  30m.,  the Exchequer under present arrangements would bear some  19m.,  the remainderfalling on the rates.      But when the National Health Servicecomes into force,  the.Exchequer share would rise automaticallyto some  22m.  and there might well be pressure for furthertransfers of charges to the Central Government.4. If equal pay were introduced by itself the result would be that the married man with a. family, would be left ina worse position than any other,member of the employed community.a
It seemed to us inevitable, therefore,- that equal pay shouldbe accompanied by a scheme of family allowances.      TheOfficial Working Party estimate that if an allowance of  25a year for each child,  except    the first, were paid to membersof the public services, - the cost would be a little over 2 million a year, while if the allowance were  40 for each child,  the cost would he  11.2 million,  on the assumptionthat the allowances were abated in each case by the amountof the National Allowance of 5/- per week.      These figuresindicate the range of expenditure that might have to becontemplated.5. The combined cost of equal pay and family allowancesmight therefore be:-Equal pay fromAllowances    &quot;Total (say) &quot; 17. 95m. 2. Ora. 20m.to  30.25m.to      11.2m.to      41m.6. If equal pay wereservice this-would be boundindustry.      This would haveto be introduced into the public to lead to its introduction into two effects:-(i)    increased costs through an increased wage bill,which would not be limited to those industries where men and women are employed together.Even outside that field sympathetic increases would be inevitable;(ii)    serious disturbance of the present stability ofindustrial relations.      Throughout industrydifficult and contentious negotiations would arise.      Any suggestion that equal pay shouldbe confined to the office staff of industrial undertakings would obviously cause immediate difficulties with the industrial workers.7. The introduction of equal pay would moreover be wholly inflationary in its economic effects at a time whenthe inflationary potential is already serious.      Such an addition to purchasing power without any increase in theoutput of goods or services would be bad enough if the concession could be limited to the public service.      Theconsequences of any more general concession might well be extremely serious. ,8. We therefore consider that it would be inexpedientfor the Government to introduce equal pay in the public services - a view which we note is also shared by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum on the cost ofthe Civil Service (CP. (47) 150).9. If the Cabinet agree with this view, what is to besaid in any public&apos; statement about the principle itself?Granted that its application must be postponed,  do theGovernment wish to reaffirm the principle?  . In the view ofmy Committee it would be most undesirable to do so.      Theeconomic difficulties with which the country is faced are not likely to be overcome quickly, and it would be embarrassing
for the Government to -undertake now any further commitment in favour of equal pay, which they might well he expectedto carry out before the General Election.      Moreover, anysuch declaration of principle would he embarrassing to theMinister of Education, who would find it difficult to restrain the Burnham Committee any longer from activediscussion of the matter.10. We consider that in announcing their decision onthis matter the Government should point to the revolutionarychanges which are about to be. introduced in the social services,  the total cost of which, after these changes, will amount to some  380 million in 1948.      The Government cannot   ,pledge themselves to the introduction of equal pay in thepublic service involving as it must,  if justice is to be preserved,  a substantial scheme.of family allowances, until these great changes have been completed.      Before any further advance can be made time must be given for production toincrease, without which any raising of the level of salaries and wages can only lead to inflation.      We, attach as an Annexa draft statement on these lines.11. It remains to be considered when this statement should &quot;be made.      There will no doubt be considerable pressure for some declaration of Government policy at theLabour Party Conference.     This could not of course be givenunless a statement had first been made in Parliament.Before a statement can be made it will be necessary for thePrime Minister to give &apos;a ome advance notice of its contentsto the Trades Union Congress, who have been pressing him toreceive&apos;a deputation on this subject.      The statement couldnot therefore be made before Friday morning at-the earliest,and there is likely to be strong criticism in the House if    ,,an important statement of policy of this kind is made at short notice on the last day before the Recess.      My committee therefore recommend that a statement on the lines suggestedbelow should be made, at some convenient opportunity when theHouse reassembles, and that in the meantime the Labour party conference should be informed that the Government intend tomake a. statement at an early date.A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W,1.;20th May,  1947.
ANNEXEQUAL PAYDraft, of Statement to be made in ParliamentHis Majesty&apos;s Government have now considered thereport of the Royal Commission on Equal Pay and I will shortlygive their conclusions.      First, however, I should like to thank the Commission in the name of the Government for the valuable work which they have done.      Its terms of reference were &quot;to examine the existing relationship between the remuneration of men and women in the public services, in industry and in other fields of employment&quot; and &quot;to considerthe social, economic and financial implications of the claim of equal pay for equal .work&quot;.&apos;.    Unlike other Royal Commissions,.,they were not asked to make recommendations but to set out thevarious considerations that would have to be taken into accountbefore decisions were reached.      I am sure that the House will agree that the Commission have faithfully carried out this difficult task.&quot; Before I give the Government&apos;s decision on the main problem,  I must first state their conclusions on two mattersof principle which&quot;-fundamentally affect their general conclusions.The Government is,  of course, primarily concerned&apos; with theproblem of equal pay for equal work in that group of thepopulation which is engaged in public employment - thenon-industrial Civil Service (including the Post Office),  thelocal Government Service (including nurses),,and the teaching &apos;profession, but,  in the Governments view,  there could be noquestion of confining equal pay to these occupations.      its introduction in industry and the professions would inevitablyfollow.      It would, moreover, be almost impossible to introduceequal pay without bringing simultaneously into operation ascheme of family allowances,  since the Government could not
contemplate so grave a spcial injustice as to put the married man who hears family responsibilities into a position inferiorin purchasing power to that of the unmarried woman worker.The Government therefore take the view that equal pay,  ifintroduced into the public services, would soon be of universalapplication.      Moreover,  it would have to be accompanied by asystem of family.allowances.      What would be the financialand economic consequences of such developments?The cost, estimated by the Government in the light -of material provided, in the Report, of its immediate introduction in. the public.services alone would be as follows:- m.Civil Service 10Teachers,    ; 11&apos;-&apos;[-3 . .:. 1 &apos;,.-;.V--. ? &apos;   &apos; v;/.&apos;-:.- r.-&apos;:%     .&apos;Local Government exceptnurses ,75Local Government Nurses S. 75Total     -.        m 24.5Of this, approximately  16m.  would fall upon theExchequer and the rest upon the rates.      The cost of equal pay for the teachers would eventually rise by a further  6m.When the National Health Service comes into force,  theExchequer/,will take over not only the cost of the LocalGovernment nurses  2.75m. ) but of the voluntary nurses,costing a. further  5m.      The cost for the above public services may therefore be some  3.5m.      There still remain the women inthe Armed Forces who,  the Commission estimate, might cost,some  3m.  to  6m. . -That still leaves the industrial public servicesand the whole mass of professions and trades outside the public services.      The Commission give no estimates in this field butit is obvious that the cost must be very high.      Estimates of
the additional cost of family allowances are of coursedependent upon their size, but whatever figure were envisaged,  itis certain that their cost would add very considerably to thetotal cost of any equal pay scheme.Apart from the immediate burden upon the Exchequer,there would be new loads upon commerce and industry.      production costs would rise through an increased wages bill,  especially as repercussions in the form of sympathetic increases inwomen&apos;s rates of pay would no doubt be stimulated even outsidethe field where men and women are doing equal work.:The main question which the Government have had. to facein considering the economic implications of these facts&apos; is whether the country would be able to sustain this large burden.The Government is convinced that the consequences of assumingsuch.vast additional expenditure would be seriously detrimentalgo the country&apos;s economy in existing circumstances.      TheGovernment with the authority of Parliament is already under-taking important expansions in the field of social services witha view to redistributing more equitably the purchasing power ofthe people;    family, allowances have been introduced and a nationshealth scheme is being established,  and there are also the new schemes of national insurance and public assistance.      TheGovernment is proud of these achievements.      But the cost ofthese measures is substantial;    the country has for the timebeing reached the limit of its capacity to finance them,  andthis is not the moment to add a further burden which mightgravely imperil the- progress already achieved.      The more -general economic consequences of introducing equal pay wouldlikewise be serious,  since it would add to the amount of money in circulation without any increase in the output of goods or services,  and it would thus be wholly inflationary in tendency.For these reasons the Government have concluded that -there would be serious objections to any proposal to. introduceequal pay in the public service in the present financial andeconomic situation of the    country.Pi1 -6-
