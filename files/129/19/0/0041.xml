-    243Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1947 &quot; &quot;Copjf No. 81CABINETANGLO-FRENCH-BELGIAN COLLABORATION IN africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues are aware that soon after the close of the war in Europeaction was taken to resume and to expand the Anglo-French collaboration incertain technical matters in the Colonies which had been initiated between mr. MacDonald and M. Mandel in March 1940. Conversations took place inNovember 1945 between officials of the Colonial Office and the Ministre de laFrance d&apos;Outre Mer, and. agreed conclusions were reached in a wide field of subjects; these have resulted in a considerable increase in the number and variety of contacts between officers of British and French administrations and ColonialOffices, and in some instances beginnings have been made in more directly practicalco-operation in Africa. In particular they have led to the holding of conferencesin West Africa on the subjects of Animal Health, Health and Communications.2. Our policy in pursuing this course has been inspired by the realisationthat many of the problems of African administration can best be attacked by adopting (so far as conditions permit) common methods of approach, thus over-riding the artificial boundaries drawn on the map. To take one practical instance the measures for the control of cerebro-spinal-spinal meningitis, which breaks outperiodically in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, are greatly increased in effectiveness by being concerted with the French. This policy is also, ofcourse, in the best spirit of the Treaty signed recently at Dunkirk.3. Our co-operation with the Belgians is of more recent date, having been initiated in June 1946. It has followed much the same lines as with France,the emphasis being placed on the fact that it is in Africa rather than inEurope that solutions to our common problems should be worked out. It isappreciated that under the colonial system the initiation of this collaborationmust take place in the metropolitan country : but little of benefit to Africa canresult unless the local governments also collaborate closely and give practical effect to the results achieved in discussion.4. In January 1947 the French and Belgians held discussions with one another on similar lines to those which both had previously held with us, andat that conference a suggestion was made by M. Ryckmans (late Governor-General of the Belgian Congo) that the circle should be completed by tripartiteAnglo-Belgian-French discussions. This tripartite meeting duly took place inParis between 20th and 22nd May.5. Attached to this paper my colleagues will find a memorandum whichsets out in detail the conclusions which were agreed on at the recent Parismeeting, and the programme of technical conferences, mainly in Africa, whichit has been agreed to hold during the next three years. I do not now proposeto go into matters of detail, but I should like to draw attention to the followingpoints: (i) Although the discussions in Paris were confined to ourselves, the Frenchand the Belgians, we do not intend this policy of co-operation tobe exclusive, and. the technical conferences which are to take placein Africa over&quot; the next three years will include representatives ofthe Portuguese colonies, of the Union of South Africa and of SouthernRhodesia, whenever subjects in which they are concerned are to bediscussed.SECRETCP. (47) 191BOth June, 1947[33816]B
(ii) The Colonial Office was particularly concerned that opportunity shouldbe given for associating Africans and other non-officials with the workof the technical conferences in Africa. At the recent Anglo-french conference on Communications in Dakar two African representatives were present, and such representation will become more important asAfrican legislative responsibility increases. I am pleased to say thatwe found the French and Belgians most ready to accept this.(iii) Part B of the agenda in Paris was concerned with policy towardsthe United Nations on colonial matters. In our co-operation withother colonial Powers in Africa, as elsewhere, clearly the welfare of the territories must be the primary consideration, and this was fully accepted by all three delegations at Paris. But the attitudeof the rest of the world towards the colonial Powers cannot be dis-regarded, and we had to consider our policy in connection with thead hoc Committee which was set up to assist the General assembly in considering the information submitted under Article 73 (e) of theUnited Nations Charter, and will meet shortly before the next sessionof the Assembly. The history of the establishment of this Committeewas explained in CP. (47) 5 of January 1947. To put it very briefly,its appointment resulted from the efforts of certain delegations at theGeneral Assembly to use the obligations in Chapter XI as a meansof enabling the United Nations to exercise supervision over all colonial administration. Although Article 73 (e) is precise, the examinationof information supplied would present plenty of opportunity for theprotagonists of this point of view to do this. Material supplied bythe eight different colonial Powers would naturally differ in form, andattempts to standardise it might easily result in the formulation of a questionnaire similar to that provided for in Article 88 in respectof trust territories. Again, in the course of considering the informa-tion supplied, requests for clarification might well lead on to a demandfor information outside the scope of this Article. We were, there-fore, concerned to see that while we carried out our obligations infull under the Charter, we should resist any action by theUnited Nations which infringed the principle that our jurisdiction inrespect of the non-self-governing territories (other than Trust Terri-tories) was recognised to be of the same quality as our jurisdiction inthe. metropolitan area, and that Article 2 (7) of the Charter should apply in each case. The summary Of Our discussions underPart B 4 (a)-(c) indicates the measure of agreement that this attitudemet.6. I submit this paper for the information of my eolleagues. The readiness of France and Belgium to follow the lead of Great Britain- at least at the con-ference table is very marked. The greater understanding of our colonial administration which has resulted from the collaboration that has taken placeso far has, I think, increased the respect in which the French and Belgiansalways held it. There is a willingness to follow our lead and to learn from us,which in some instances has already borne fruit in the technical fields in Africa.A. C. J.30th June, 1947.
3244MemorandumFrench-Anglo-Belgian Conversations on 20th, 21st and 22nd May, 1947President: M. Gustave Moutet.Secretary: M. G. Monod.; Members:British Delegation.- French Delegation:Mr. Poynton. M. Bonneau.Mr. Ashley Clark. M. Boissier.Mr: Robinson. M. Le Roy.Mr. Campbell. M. D&apos;Andurain.Mr. Millard. M. Vuilleaume.M. Delavignette.Belgian Delegation: M. Clap.\      M. Ryckmans.. j . ?enrJ\M. Lowers.   . . M Augendre.M. Dupont.M. de Kerchove de. Denterghem.Following the conversations which had been held between France and theUnited Kingdom, France and Belgium, and the United Kingdom and Belgium,the Governments of the three Countries considered that it would be profitable tocontinue their collaboration on a Iri-partite instead of a bi-partite basis. Thediscussions now concluded were in pursuance of this and centred on an agendawhich had previously been agreed between the three countries.Preamble &apos;-The Conference recognised that the items appearing in Chapter A of theAgenda, which had in view a constructive, plan of work for the benefit of theinhabitants of their territories, constituted the main aim of tripartite co-operation in Africa. It was only on this basis that the results of this conference could be presented to international public opinion.The present conference followed naturally on the bi-lateral co-operationundertaken spontaneously between the three countries on common technical problems in Africa.The French delegation submitted to the conference a general scheme forthe organisation of tri-partite co-operation in Africa. ...The Conference recognised the necessity of establishing some permanent bodycharged with putting the co-operation agreed into effect, but left the details to be^determined by each of the technical conferences which are to be arranged. .Theseare indicated in the table at Annex I.It is for each technical conference to decide how best this permanent bodycan be created. This would be done in each case by the countries participating inthe conferences without other formality.Each Government will take all necessary measures to ensure both locally andin the metropolitan country, the centralisation of the results of its technical co-operation in the fields set out. It is envisaged that officials (in Africa as wellas in. Europe) charged by the participating Governments and by the metropolitanGovernments to follow up these questions, should meet frequently and survey theresults achieved. ...A. 1 (a). Technical Collaboration in Africa subjects justifying futuretechnical conference^f-The table annexed indicates the subjects on whichtechnical conferences can be held.1 (b). Subjects on which practical collaboration can be arranged forthwith:-These are indicated by the order of priority in the attached table. In addition,the Conference recognised that in the medical field:* the arrangements for combating endemo epidemics should be concludedas rapidly as possible, on the basis of already existing sanitary con-ventions, in.the spirit of the Accra Conclusions.* the Accra Conclusions about pathological laboratories should beextended to all the African territories of the Three Powers.[33816] B 2
The Conference recommends that in the phyto-sanitary field an exchangeof regulations in force should take place with a view to their standardisation.A convention could eventually be prepared by a conference in Africa.The Conference also takes note that a meeting will be held between belgian and United Kingdom experts preparatory to a Conference on the hydro-biologyof the Great Lakes.A. 2. Determination of the regions appropriate to each subject and to eachconference. ^See the table annexed.A. 3. Governments to be represented at each conference. The attachedtable indicates that invitations are to be addressed to certain governments not represented at these discussions. As a rule, the question of extending invitationswill be examined officially, bearing in mind the interest which the countries whichare to participate have in the subject matter of the conference. It is understoodthat no invitation will be addressed except after agreement between the three governments (Belgium, United Kingdom and France), and that it should be preceded by an approach in order to ensure that it would be welcomed by thecountries interested.The question of the participation of the Portuguese Government in further conversations has also been brought up. The United Kingdom delegationindicated that this participation raised certain points of interest to it and under-took to obtain the advice of its Government. The French and Belgian delegationsmade it known that their respective Governments welcomed very favourably suchan extension of the tripartite conversations. Each Government will arrange withthe Portuguese such bi-lateral conversations as seem necessary.A. 4. Composition of delegations with reference to: (a) inclusion of adminis-trative as well as technical officials. The composition of each delegation to the conferences in Africa will be at the discretion of the Government interested,having in mind the object for which the conference is called.(b) Possibility of including Africans and other non-Officials. The Con-ference approved the participation at the technical conferences of non-official members in particular cases and on the basis of their personal technical qualifica-tions. On the other hand, the Conference appreciated that it would be desirable or prudent to bring Africans into participation at these technical conferenceson the basis of the contribution they could make to them.A. 5. Programme of dates and places for conferences over the next twelvemonths. This point is covered by the annexed table.A. 6 and B. 3. Relationship of technical conferences with internationalSpecialised Agencies. Means of collaboration on questions of colonial policy towards the Economic and Social Council and its Commissions. /The delegationswere in agreement that the Specialised Agencies of the United Nations shouldbe invited to send an observer to conferences which deal with questions coming within their purview, it being understood that the invitation would be addressed,by the host Government in agreement with the other two Governments.The permanent body of a conference will maintain contact with the specialised agency corresponding to its activity, through the intermediary of the Govern-ment concerned. This permanent body will, however, send direct to the specialised Agency the official documents published,in common by the Govern-ments or in their name by such permanent body. For the future, and to theextent to which co-operation should be extended regionally, the interested Govern-ments would have to agree whether this body should be proposed as the regionalbody corresponding to the Specialised Agency concerned. In the meanwhile,the question of the relations between the various bodies for co-operation in africa and the Specialised Agencies would be examined together by the three countriesin each particular case.The delegations agreed to recommend to their Governments that they should instruct their representatives at the United Nations and in the specialised agencies to oppose any suggestion which was made on the basis that it waspossible to discriminate between non-self-governing territories for which theywere responsible and independent States which were faced with similar problems.B. 1 and B. 2. Effect of the technical collaboration outlined in Section a with particular reference to publicity policy. Other possible steps in relationto United Nations General Assembly resolution of December 1946, on conferences and representation of non-self-governing territories which might be taken by thethree Governments (a) individually, or (b) collectively. The plan set out for tri-partite co-operation in Africa cannot be considered in itself as an answer to therecommendation of the Assembly that conferences of non-self-governing peoplesshould be held.   The Conference, moreover, decided not to take the initiative in
communicating the results of the present conversations to the Assembly of theUnited Nations.However, the attitude of the United States Delegation at the time of thediscussion of this question in the Assembly in November 1946, seemed to indicatethat the United States Government was more interested, so far as concerneddependent territories, in forms of regional collaboration than in recommendationsof a political nature.The Conference expressed its opinion that it would be advantageous to make use of the occasion of the visit to Europe of a qualified American official, or byother means to inform the Department of State of the work of this Conference.In the event of the agenda of the next session of the Assembly containingan item bearing on the steps which the colonial Powers had seen fit to take inpursuance of the recommendation of the Assembly, the present Conference con-sidered that its results could be presented as emphasising that the end of tri-partite co-operation in Africa was consistent with the essential aims of chapter XI of the Charter. Moreover, the activities of the South Pacific Corn-mission and the Caribbean Conference could also be invoked. Finally, each of the delegations could make known the internal measures taken by its Government inthe territories under its jurisdiction.B. 4. Article 73(e) of the United Nations Charter, (a) Definition of non-self-governing territories.-^)^ Conference agreed that there could be no ques-tion of establishing a definition of non-self-governing territories. The UnitedKingdom and French delegations explained the reasons which made it advisable to keep out certain names from the list of territories in respect of which informa-tion was to be supplied. These two delegations were equally in agreement thatthey should furnish in common the information concerning the New Hebrides.(b) Nature of information to be submitted: The Conference confirms thatthe information sent should be limited to that enumerated in Article 73 (e) ofthe Charter. A list already compiled by the United Kingdom Government forits territories is annexed to the present memorandum (Annex II).The delegations agreed that any explanations on the statistics furnishedshould be limited to such as were i indispensable for a correct unstanding of them. ;.In addition to the information corresponding to Article 73 (e) of the Charter,the Conference approved the sending to the Library of the United Nations, asan act of courtesy, reports presented by local governments to legislative and otherassemblies, and all official documents.(c) Policy towards the Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly whichis to examine this information. The three delegations considered that the termsof reference of this Committee did not go so far as to justify an examinationof the basis of the questions on which the information should be furnished.The A d Hoc Committee should be considered as a temporary body assisting the Assembly, and especially charged with co-ordinating and standardising theinformation furnished, and assisting, so far as concerns Article 73 (e) of the charter, the General Assembly and the Specialised Agencies. The Conferenceconsiders that when the Ad Hoc Committee meets, the delegations of the three countries should strive to avoid being dragged into discussions which would giverise to an examination of the information submitted, and to limit themselves to giving the Committee the explanations necessary to the interpretation of theinformation furnished. Instructions should be given to the delegations of thethree countries so that they should maintain close contact on this subject.The division of the A d Hoc Committee into several technical sub-commissions(as has been proposed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations) did not recommend itself to the Conference.The Conference approves the principle that discussions with the UnitedStates Government should be held on the subject of the A d Hoc Committee (seeB. 1 and B. 2). Finally, the Conference recognises that it would be useful to make contact with other colonial powers on the Ad Hoc Committee but, on the otherhand, without being opposed to contact with the non-colonial powers on theCommittee, the Conference does not think it advisable to take the initiative inconcerting action with them.[33816]
