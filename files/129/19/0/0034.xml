(47) 14th Meeting, Minute 1) the DefenceCommittee had before them a memorandum by the Minister without Portfolioreporting the conclusions of the Committee on Services&apos; Land Usage on the needsof the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Supply for land for training and other purposes:2. The conclusions of the Defence Committee on the proposals of the service departments, together with a summary of the reasons on which their conclusions are based, are set out below. I also attach a draft of a White Paper which, inview of the deep public concern on the subject, has been prepared with theassistance of&apos; the Central Office of Information in a form designed to make theproposals as widely and as easily understood as possible.3. The following statements show the extent of the requirements of theService Departments for. land for all purposes and their effect on various civilinterests : (a) Land required for training purposesService.

The large increase in the amount of land now required for training purposes, in comparison with the amount of land used for this purpose before thewar, is largely accounted for by the following factors : (a) The introduction of Compulsory National Service means that 200,000......National Service men will be serving at any one time, in addition tothe regular Forces, and this number must be trained within the year of their service.(b) Areas reasonably convenient to their homes must be provided for thetraining of men in the Auxiliary Forces undergoing their period of reserve service.(c) Developments in the range and power of weapons and the immenselyi increased mobility of the modern army involve corresponding increasesi in the size of training areas.(d) The development of realistic training methods, such as the use of live. ammunition and exercises involving various arms in co-operation, alsoincreases the amount of land required.Training with live ammunition, an innovation first introduced during the war, has been instrumental in saving many lives in action,(ii)(iii)(iv)
because it accustoms troops to the conditions and sensations of battlein controlled conditions. For this reason it has been decided that itshould be continued as a permanent part of normal peace-timetraining.5. The requirements set out in table (a) in paragraph 3 have been arrivedat after careful examination of all possible alternatives and with strict attentionto the necessity for economy in the use of land, particularly where agricultureand forestry are affected.  The factors taken into account include the following : (i) Transfer of Training OverseasNearly all units of the regular Army are already abroad and no special provision for their collective training is included in the present proposals. Itwould be impossible, within their period of service, to train National Servicemen abroad, nor could there be any question of transferring the training of the auxiliary Forces overseas.Apart from these practical considerations one of the major reasons of policyagainst a general transfer of training overseas is that in the event of war acomplete redisposition and reorganisation of training arrangements would benecessary to enable training to be again carried out in the United Kingdom; this change would disorganise the machine and seriously reduce our readiness forwar at a vital time.Moreover, the cost of training overseas would probably be prohibitive, andthere could be no question of transferring the training of the Auxiliary forces overseas.(ii) The possibility of training in Scotland or Northern Ireland /Surveys of the two countries have been carried out, and the conclusion hasbeen reached that, apart from the areas already taken up, the terrain in those parts where the acquisition of training rights by the Service Departments would cause little or no injury to civil interests is unsuitable for the training of a highlymechanised modern army.Further, even if suitable areas could be found in Scotland or NorthernIreland, the difficulties in the way of using them would be very great. the location of the Armed Forces in this country is largely governed by the distri-bution of existing accommodation and the building of the new accommodation,installations, and roads would be extremely expensive, and probably impossiblefor a long time to come.(iii) A djustments of Service plans in the light of civil requirementsThe Defence Committee were satisfied that the Service Departments have drawn up their proposals so as to minimise their effects on civil interests to theutmost extent possible. Thus, in addition to making direct economies by arrange-ments for intensive and continuous use of particular areas (as at Castle Martin),joint user by two or more Services, and the location of ranges so that danger 33798a] b 2
areas are seaward, they have, wherever possible, made adjustments and reduc-tions in their demands so as to preserve public access and reduce interferencewith agricultural operations to a minimum. There is little or no prospect of achieving major sayings by any further measures of this kind which may bepossible, although as detailed plans are worked out, further minor adjustmentsmay be made.6. In the light of the foregoing considerations the Defence Committee are agreed that the use for training purposes of an amount of land of the order of800.000 acres is necessary if the Services are to be trained to maximum efficiency,and that, subject to what is said in paragraph 8 below about Stanford andThetford, the losses which will be suffered by civil interests, including agriculture,forestry and amenity, must be accepted.The draft White Paper7. The attached draft White Paper explains in some detail the considerations underlying the proposals of the Service Departments and dealsalso with a number of subsidiary points, of which the two most important arethe following:- (a) Public enquiriesI gave an undertaking in the Debate on the Address on 15th November, 1946(Official Report, Volume 430, Columns 449/450) that public enquiries would beheld when desired in all cases involving acquisition of land. Not all of theproposals of the Service Departments, however, involve acquisition, and the realissue arising in all cases is the question of user. Accordingly it is proposed thatthe holding of public enquiries should extend to cases involving (1) acquisitionof training rights, (2) change of user only, and (3) existing user if it was begunduring the war and there is strong objection to it.(b) PledgesThe Cabinet will recall that in the case of some of the areas required by theServices, notably Stanford and Purbeck, pledges were given by responsible localofficials when the areas were taken up during the war that those inhabitants whohad to leave would be reinstated when the emergency was over.There has been a good deal of public discussion about the nature of thesepledges and whether they are binding on the Government. Whatever may be the precise legal position I feel that the right course is to state frankly that theGovernment accept the fact that pledges of reinstatement were given, and tomake it clear that, though the Government could not agree not to use an other-wise suitable area merely because of the existence of a pledge of reinstatement,they would be prepared to give appropriate monetary compensation and such assistance towards resettlement as was practicable, if, after public local enquirythey decided that displaced persons could not be allowed to return to their homes.
.  Thetford and Stanford Training Areas.8. The Defence Committee felt some doubt about the proposals of the war department to continue in occupation of the armoured vehicle training area atThetford and the battle training area at Stanford in view of the importance ofthe areas to the Forestry Commission, and they invited the Minister without portfolio to inspect the area, in company with the Minister of Agriculture, theSecretary of State for War and the Minister of Town and Country Planning,with a view to formulating proposals for excluding from further use for training purposes that part of the area on which trees had been planted.9.   The Minister without Portfolio and his colleagues have now completed their enquiry.  Their conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a) StanfordThere are two types of area involved here, (i) the approach and deploymentareas (10,000 acres), in respect of which rights of manoeuvre only are required,and (ii) the central battle training area (18,000 acres), from which the public mustbe entirely excluded because live ammunition will be used.The military authorities have given assurances that all damage to trees inthe deployment areas will be avoided and that they will take all possibleprecautions to protect the plantations in the central area. The Minister without portfolio states that these plantations show no obvious signs of damage, even after five years&apos; use of the area by the Army, and there is no reason to suppose that any serious damage will be done in the future, although injuries to isolatedtrees by ricochets and bad aiming must be expected. Arrangements will be made &apos;to permit Forestry Commission employees to enter the area to tend the trees.Some 7,500 acres of the central area were under crops or grass before the war,and though the soil is light the land produced useful crops, particularly of sugar beet, carrots and barley. It is, however, now heavily overgrown withbracken and even if the War Department surrendered the area it would need agood deal of clearance and restoration.(b) ThetfordThis area comprises some 18,000 acres consisting mainly of heath land withsome established plantations of trees in the south-west corner. These plantationsare the only ones of importance in the area and the Secretary of State for war has agreed to surrender this part. For the remainder, there are a few smallplantations and windbreaks as well as a certain amount of land of low agriculturalvalue, and the military authorities have given an undertaking in the same terms as that given in respect of the central area at Stanford that, in consultation withthe Forestry Commission and the local agricultural authorities, they will do everything possible to prevent injury either to the trees or to agricultural interests.The Minister without Portfolio remarks that although the area.has been in use,like the Stanford area, for about five years, it does not appear to have sufferedany significant damage.
In order, to ensure that in carrying out their undertakings the militaryauthorities have available to them at all times advice and assistance on forestryand agricultural matters, it is intended that experienced liaison officers should beappointed to the local military (District) headquarters and if necessary to the command headquarters.10.   These arrangements for closer contact between the local officials concerned and the military authorities will not be limited to Thetford and Stanford, but will; apply wherever there is likely to be conflict between the interests of agriculture&apos;and forestry and the interests of training.11; The War Departments proposals at Stanford and Thetford will preventthe acquisition by the Forestry Commission of a good deal of land suitable forplanting with trees and to meet this point the Minister of Town and country planning has undertaken to endeavour to indicate suitable land elsewhere in replacement.12. In conclusion the Minister without Portfolio states that he and hiscolleagues are satisfied that the arrangements outlined above will meet the essential needs of forestry both at Thetford and at Stanford and that the Chairman ofthe Forestry Commission is in general agreement with this conclusion.13.   I invite the Cabinet (1) to agree that the proposals of the Service Departments for the acquisitionof land for training purposes amounting in total to about 800,000 acresshould be approved;(2) to approve the attached draft White Paper;(3) to approve the arrangements for the protection of plantations of treesowned by the Forestry Commission in the areas at Thetford andStanford.C.

SECRETPROOF201NEEDS OF the armed FORGES FOR LANDFOR TRAINING ANDOTHER PURPOSES
NEEDS OF THE ARMED FORGES FOR LAND FOR,  TRAINING AND OTHER PURPOSESPART I.-introduction.   Land is needed by the Services both for permanent installationsthat are part of the national defences, and for training.   The Governmenthave considered the land requirements of the Service Departments and.of the Ministry of &quot;Supply (x) from two points of view:  ^(a) the size of the total need for land (including sea danger areas related to such land) in Great, Britain, and the effect of that need uponthe public interest, especially in such matters as Agriculture,forestry, fisheries, and access by: the public for the purpose ofrecreation; and(b) the distribution, of the land requirements (i) between home and overseas;(ii) within Great Britain, between England, Scotland and1&apos;Wales.Their conclusions are set out in the succeeding paragraphs.2. The procedure for holding public local inquiries is also set out.It will be recalled that on 15th November, 1946, the Prime Minister gave an undertaking that public local inquiries would be held when desired inall cases involving the acquisition of land. The scope of these inquiries has,however, been extended (subject to security considerations) to cover changes of use of existing Service Department land, proposals to acquire training,rights and cases where existing user was begun during the war and thereis strong objection to its continuance.PART II.-LAND NEEDED BY THE SERVICES FOR purposes other THAN TRAINING3. The needs of the Services for land for permanent installations thatare part of the national defences are as follows:-(a) The Eoyal Air Force and the Admiralty need airfields for defence purposes.   These have been selected from those in use during- the war.(6) Space is needed for accommodation and storage; most of this isalready held by the Services.(c) Sites for anti-aircraft defences and coastal artillery.(d) Sites for radar installations.(e) Land needed by the Ministry of Supply for experimental and research work ranges and trial grounds, in addition to land usedjointly with the three Services.Airfields4. The B.A.F. airfields, in this country are the main bases from whichthese two forces operate, and upon which they are maintained, trained and(&apos;) For the purposes of this paper the Ministry of Supply is treated as a service Department.
accommodated. In the ease of the Admiralty these airfields are an- indispensable supplement to the carrier forces for training, maintenance anddisembarkation, of frontline squadrons; The airfield plan has been drawnup in the light of strategical arid tactical requirements, and-is now beingconsidered ih the light of the views of the interested civil departments and6f the lisast possible interference with amenities-. A large number of airfieldswill be shared with the Ministry of Civil Aviation or the Ministry of Supply.Living and Recreational Accommodation5.   Many more men have -to be accommodated than before the war,d  while a greater proportion of the Royal Navy must now be quartered ashore,^ chiefly because of the extensive preliminary training that must be givento i National Service men before they go to sea.   Many additional married quarters are needed in all three Services, as part of the general policy of improving living conditions.    Much of the basic accommodation exists,but it needs modernisation and some extension.   Moreover, many barracks.   at present without garages arid workshops must be provided with them:The total requirements for land under this head are, however, small andwill be met as far as possible by the use of land already held by theServices.     &apos;,Storage - , . .:;;-6. The increasing amount and variety of-equipment used by theServices have created new demands for storage accommodation. these will be met in the main by the development of existing depots on whichconsiderable sums of money were spent befpre or during the war. In afew cases new accommodation will be needed; e.g-,; for distribution&quot; points for supplies and stores near large troop concentrations, or in replacement of properties at present requisitioned for storage purposes.Defensive Installations7. If the Forces are to operate successfully in. an,emergency,&apos; certainstatic defences such as Ariti-Aircraft and Coast Artillery are needed,together with many scientific and mechanical aids necessary to them,including the radio and radar network. These installations cannot be erected hurriedly, but must be permanent, though little land is needed for them. .Ministry of Supply        .i 8. The Ministry of Supply provides the aircraft; weapons, fighting vehicles, ammunition, and most of the other types of equipment and stores,needed by the Army and the Royal Air Force; much of the armaments and ammunition required by the Royal Navy, and aircraft and relatedequipment for Naval Aviation.... The land &apos; used, by industrial /establishments and the&apos; -storage accom-modation attached to them falls outside service requirements; but spaceis needed for:        ,(a) experimental and research establishments, including ranges, inconnection with the design; development, and testing of arma-ments, munitions and aircraft.(6) trial grounds for fighting vehicles;-(c) bulk explosive depots;(d) accommodation and recreational establishments for staffs.&apos; [33798] b 2
The rapid advance of scientific knowledge in recent years,,: and its application to all aspects of attack and defence, has necessitated corres-correspondingly more extensive and specialised facilities for research and experi-mental work. Thus, increases are necessary in the size of ,the research and development establishments, and more; particularly of the ranges wherenew.weapons are tested: To some extent, the needs ,of; the Ministry ofSupply in respect of its experimental work can be met by using areasheld by the Service Departments for their own purposes, and such joint usehas already been arranged with the War Department and the. Air Ministry.In other cases the nature of the Ministry of Supply work is such that itmust be carried: out separately.; While certain experimental and research work is being carried out over-iseas, in.the main such work must be done in this country within convenientreach of the Headquarters of the Service and Supply Departments, and ofthe-main: centres of scientific and industrial: activity.   ,PART III.-MORE LAND NEEDED FOR TRAINING THAN BEFORETHE WAR9. The problem of service training has greatly changed since pre-wardays. Three new factors have to be considered. One is the decision takenby Parliament to continue National Service in peace-time, as a result ofwhich 200,000 National Service men will be serving at any one time inaddition to the Regular Forces. -Thus, not only will: the numbers in theServices be. higher than before the war, but training must be icarried; oncontinuously throughout the year: The pre-war: practice of concentratingtraining mainly in the summer months would, if applied now, lead; to muchgreater demands for land than the Services are in fact&quot; making.10. - A second factor is the larger space required for manoeuvre and. forthe use of modern weapons. Oh the one hand the proportion of armour toman-power is greater, and there is need to use more tracked vehicles; onthe other hand the enormous increases in range and mobility arising fromimprovements that have taken place in the, design of existing weapons andthe introduction of new ones into all the Services have, also increased theamount of land needed &quot;fbr practice in their use.11. Thirdly, land must now1 be set aside where -various arms inco-operation can train with live ammunition. This form of training,; triedout during the war and since adopted by the principal powers, accustomstroops to the conditions and sensations of battle, and, by creating confidence,has been an important factor in saving life in action.   V, &quot; -&apos;; Training for aircrews must also be. provided, which involves the dischargeof live bombs,, rocket projectiles, and ammunition from aircraft at operationalheights and speeds. These danger areas are at sea wherever possible, but some land-areas are essential.Because of the danger from unexploded ammunition, the&apos;:- public; must at all, times be excluded from training areas of this kind, though some limiteduse may be made of them for purposes such as forestry.PART IY THE LAND NEEDS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES OFEACH BRANCH OF THE SERVICES12. The following paragraphs atteinpt to show for what purposes landis needed by each Service, in order that all branches of the Armed Forcesmay be trained in peace-time to a standard that will allow weapons to be
used at short notice with efficiency. This involves not only constant practice by the men, but also continuous use of equipment to make sure that itfunctions properly throughout the year. The inadequacy of pre-war traininggrounds was found to be a grave handicap.Royal Navy13.   The land requirements of the Royal Navy are mainly for navalgunnery, aviation, and the training of Royal Marines.    Naval gunnerypractices are carried out largely at sea, or- from sites on shore where thedanger area is mainly at sea; two land areas are necessary for ship to shorel-firing.. . .    ..&quot; Training in naval aviation involves the use of land for dive bombing, air to ground firing, rocket projectile firing, and live and practice bombing. TheRoyal Marines need land for weapon training, company and platoon training.Commando training, and training in minor demolition., The Army14. The recruit joins at a Primary Training Centre, and passes to a Corpsor other training unit appropriate to his arm of service, before being posted asa trained man. Army schools provide specialist and advanced training, andbattle-practice (which involves the co-operation of all arms of the Service)is carried but in specially selected areas, which must be extensive to allow the unrestricted cross-country movement of all arms.Thereare at present 64 Primary Training Centres, each of which needs asmall range hear the barracks or camp for the firing of infantry weapons, andenough land to practice cross-country movement and the judging of distances.The Corps training units, of which there are at present 65, must useexisting barracks and camps if extensive building work is not to be under-taken.   They need land for field firing and tactical exercises for small bodies.The land needed for the Army Schools (including Officer training colleges) varies considerably with the type of establishment. For example,alarge area is needed for the School of Infantry, having regard to the weaponsused and present tactical methods, while, by contrast, a very small area will suffice for the Coast Artillery School where firing is seawards.Five areas for battle-practice are needed, two in England, one each in wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, if a balance is to be maintained between the different parts of the country and there is to be reasonableaccess to the areas from all parts of the country.Royal Air Force 1      &quot;15. Apart from the. airfields themselves, the Eoyal Air Force needs landmainly for armament training.In the case of training in bombing, most of the exercises are done withpractice bombs, but a number of &quot; live &quot; exercises must be included topractice air crews in carrying and dropping full loads, ground crews inarming up, and Station and higher organisations in the supply and handlingproblems involved.Much valuable gunnery training can be given by the use of cine-cameras,but men must be trained also . in the use of their weapons with liveammunition.In spite of the development of weapons and projectiles, which demandlarger training areas than before the war, the Royal Air Force has kept downto the minimum the size of danger areas. The strategic deployment of theRoyal Air Force very largely governs the distribution of the ranges they use,
used at short notice with efficiency. This involves not only constant practice by the men but also continuous use of equipment to make sure that it functions properly throughout the year. The inadequacy of pre-war training grounds was found to be a grave handicap.

Royal Navy

13. The land requirements of the Royal Navy are mainly for naval gunnery aviation, and the training of Royal Marines. Naval gunnery practices are carried out largely at sea, or from sites on shore where the danger area is mainly at sea; two land areas necessary for ship to shore firing.

Training in naval aviation involves the use of land for dive bombing, air to ground firing, rocket projectile firing, and live practice bombing. The Royal Marines need land for weapon training company and platoon training. Commando training and training in minor demolition.

The Army

14. The recruit joins at a Primary Training Centre and passes to a Corps or other training unit appropriate to his arm of service, before being posted as a trained man. Army schools provide specialist and advanced training, and battle-practice (which involves the co-operation of all arms of the Service) is carried out in specially selected areas, which must be extensive to allow the unrestricted cross-country movement of all arms.

There are at present 64 Primary Training Centres, each of which needs a small range near the barracks or camp for the firing of infantry weapons, and enough land to practice cross-country movement and the judging of distances.

The Corps training units, of which there are at present 65, must use existing barracks and camps if extensive building work is not to be under-taken. They need land for field firing and tactical exercises for small bodies.

The land needed for the Army Schools (including Officer Training Colleges) varies considerably with the type of establishment. For example, a large area needed for the School of Infantry, having regard to the weapons used and present tactical methods, while by contrast, a very small area will suffice for the Coast Artillery School where firing is seawards.

Five areas for battle-practice are needed, two in England, one each in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, if a balance is to be maintained between the different parts of the country and there is to be reasonable access to the areas from all parts of the country.

Royal Air Force

15. Apart from the airfields themselves, the Royal Air Force needs land mainly for armament training.

In the case of training in bombing, most of the exercises are done with practice bombs, but a number of "live " exercises must be included to practice air crews in carrying and dropping full loads, ground crews in arming up, and Station and higher organisations in the supply and handling problems involved.

Much valuable gunnery training can be given by the use of ciné-cameras, but men must be trained also in the use of their weapons with live ammunition.

In spite of the development of weapons and projectiles, which demand larger training areas than before the war, the Royal Air Force has kept down to the minimum the size of danger areas. The strategic deployment of the Royal Air Force very largely governs the distribution of the ranges they use,


but in order to avoid interference with civil interests, a distance of as muenns 50 miles between the range and the operational station using it has beenaccepted.One ground training area and an Anti-Aircraft Gunnery School, as wellas the use of rifle ranges, are needed for the R.affairs. Regiment. As far aspossible, these will be shared with the Army.Auxiliary Forces16. Auxiliary Force units in any oi the Services need parade-grounds,week-end camps, loeal ranges and land for tactical exercises within reasonablereach of the homes of the officers and men. A fair amount of laud is needed for these purposes, though each piece is small. Annual camp and similartraining is carried out on land used jointly with the Regular Forces, and theincreased land required is included in their figures.PART Y. THE POSSIBILITY OF TRAINING OVERSEAS17. In view of the large amount of land inevitably needed, it is natural that the suggestion should be made that training which would cause difficultyif carried out in this country should take place abroad.In the case of the Regular Army, this is of course happening at present,since most of the Regular Army is abroad upon occupation duties in Germanyand elsewhere. Therefore, the training of a large part of the Regular army will in fact take place abroad for some time to come. It is necessary, how-ever, for security reasons that a reasonable proportion of the Regular Army(which alone is available for immediate service) should be stationed at home;training facilities for these units must therefore be provided in the UnitedKingdom. An additional factor to be remembered is that the sending of ahigh proportion of Regular units overseas for training would have a bad effecton recruiting, because it would increase the already long period of service overseas.18. One of the main reasons against training abroad, is that inthe event of war or an emergency, a complete redisposition and reorganisa-tion of the training establishments would be required, because danger to shipping and many other factors would clearly then make it necessaryto carry out training in the United Kingdom. This change woulddisorganise the training machine and drastically lessen our readiness for war at a vital time. Money spent on training facilities would have been wasted,and much of the equipment would be out of use. The change over and the replacement of essential equipment might take many months.In order to avoid, these difficulties, it would be necessary to have shadowschools and training establishments in the United, Kingdom. It would thenbe necessary, to provide and hold, complete sets, of equipment,, to. earmarkaccommodation and training areas that could be taken over and, to proyidetraining and administrative staffs ready to operate these establishments.PART YI. THE POSSIBILITY OF TRAINING IN SCOTLAND ORNORTHERN IRELANDv 1.9. The Government have carefully considered, whether a: greater;propor-tion of training could not be carried out in remote areas, of Scotland andNorthern Ireland, and the survey of these two countries referred to in thePrime Ministers statement of 25th February,has now been carried out.
20. The reasoag why the remoter areas of Scotland, at first sight most likely to be useful for training are unsuitable are :-. (a) Some of the areas are interspersed by large and small valleys whichare crossed with difficulty, if at all. Moreover, the interveningground tends to be deficient in &quot; features &quot; such as are essential for military exercises.(b) In other areas the surface is too wet, soft, or broken, to allow the easypassage and movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles, and evenin the drier or firmer parts the possibilities of manoeuvre are solimited as to be- almost negligible.   Surfaces which are not peatyI are usually too- steep and rocky.(c) The climate severely limits the seasons within which operations arefeasible.Accordingly, the number of areas which are usable at all, apart fromminor training and this is not the type of training that really gives rise, todifficulty-is comparatively small.20. Of Northern Ireland much the same can be said, while there is theadditional difficulty of the sea transport that would be necessary.Land was requisitioned during the war for training purposes, and theServices have at present approximately 33,000 acres in use there. Experi-ence during that period showed that there is little scope for armouredrtrainingin:that country except in isolated foreshore areas,: and that the additional land needed for this purpose cannot be found there.. 21. The Army must in war be able to fight on any type of land. Ingeneral, therefore, it is desirable to train men and practise the use of equip-ment under varying conditions, but clearly the elementary stages oftraining must be carried out: on land which does not present abnormaldifficulties to those under instruction. In any ease training could not belimited solely to.the very bad conditions which may be encountered from timeto time in war, owing to the time lost, the expense incurred by damage tovehicles and equipment, and the false lessons which such limited trainingwould impart.22. Moreover, the administrative difficulties in the way of using such areas- as are physically suitable would be serious. The location of the Forcesin this country is largely governed by the position of existing accommoda-tion; the building of new accommodation, installations and roads in the few physically suitable areas in Northern Ireland or the remoter parts ofScotland would be extremely expensive.PART VII.-THE CHOICE OF TRAINING AREAS WITHINGREAT BRITAIN2.3. It has been explained that difficulties of national security and- trans-port prevent the greater part of training being carried out overseas, whilethe unsuitability of the terrain and the location of existing accommodationmakes it impossible to use Northern Ireland or the remoter parts of scotland as the principal areas..In the rest of the United Kingdom it is obviously essential to avoid,if at all possible, the use of good agricultural, land or .that; reserved for-forestry, as well as catchment areas for water, supply. - Land near largecentres of population is clearly unsuitable for many forms of training.
The strongest criticism: of the distribution of the requirements of theService Departments in England and Wales is that they are unduly concen-trated in potential National Park areas and others of high recreational orlandscape value. It must be borne in mind, however; that the only type ofland the use of which for Service purposes would not be open to objection on the grounds mentioned above is, broadly speaking, that found in areas of high amenity value. This, and not any disregard by the Services of the needfor preserving them, is the reason in many cases why training is proposedin them. .- - .24. It has been suggested that all Army training should be carried outon land near the main military centres, such as Aldershot, Colchester anddfcGatterick. As explained in Part III, certain training facilities must exist^^within reasonable reach of the centres where itroop3 under training areaccommodated. If, therefore, all the training necessary has to be givennear the main military centres, it follows that all the troops to be trained, mustbe located in these areas. Much money has, however, already been spent in providing accommodation in many-other parts of the country. Toreplacethis accommodation by new building in the main military centres wouMmean the loss of large sums, while in any ease the land areas available are inadequate.25. Care has been taken to reduce the total requirements of the services to the minimum consistent with efficiency, by arrangement to share areas where this is possible, and a special Inter-Service Committee was estab-lished by the Government for this purpose.26. In some cases, e.g.; the practical training area at Stanford and the armoured training area at Thetfprd, land already planted with trees orcapable of afforestation will, be- affected. The Government attach greatimportance to the preservation of the plantations in these areas and arrange-ments have been made for their protection. There will be close co-operationbetween the Service Departments and the Forestry Commission and theMinistry of Agriculture both at Headquarters and. locally, and the Govem-meht are-satisfied that the needs of the Armed Forces can be met with little detriment to existing plantations.In some areas the Service Departments&apos; proposals involve the acquisitionof land or training rights on land which would probably otherwise have been used for afforestation. In such cases every effort will be made, to providesuitable alternative land. , ;PART YIII.-THE AMOUNT OF LAND NEEDED BY THE SERVICES27. During the war, 11,547,000 acres of land in Great Britain were heldor used by the Services; of&quot;this area over 10 million acres have alreadybeen released. The rest of the land no longer needed will be given up assoon as possible. It is, however, necessary first to clear the land ofunexploded ammunition of one kind or another, and this is the main reasonfor delay.28. As already explained, the land -needs of the Services fall into two parts; that for training, and that for other purposes. For training itis considered that 805,000&apos;acres are required and for other purposes,314,700 acres. .

The land needed for other purposes is divided as follows (see part II):-;    &apos;                i . Acres -R.A.F.

Of the 805,000 acres needed for training, 106,000 acres are arable land, of which 60,000 acres will be lost to cultivation. These 60,000 acresare classified as follows : - -    .

Included in the total of 805,000 acres are 335,000 acres to whichthe public at present has access. They will still have access to 228,000 acres,subject to conditions to be prescribed in bye-laws or otherwise, but 107,000acres will be closed.33.   Charts illustrating these figures will be found at the end.-34. Areas at sea have been selected with due regard, to the safety ofshipping lanes and public rights of navigation.: There will,, however, be some interference with inshore fishing interests but figures of. the-area over which fishery operations will be restricted cannot be given. Local arrange-ments will be made to minimise interference with fishing.35. Where : wild moorland or hill country which is a. gathering&apos;ground for public water; supplies is to be used for training, local. arrangements willbe made to guard against the risk of damage to darns and other works, orof pollution of the. water.36.   A. number of roads will have to be permanently closed, but alterna-tive routes for traffic will be provided wherever necessary.Economy in the extent of training areas required can be brought about   &quot;if firing across roads is allowed and the proposals take account of. this expedient.  The Government !are; satisfied that, subject to certain safeguards,it can be authorised without, danger to passing traffic.   Guns wilt be keptso far back that no risk will arise to users of the roads nor will the noise  .of explosions distract the attention of drivers.&apos; - -37. The Government recognise that to retain the amount of land they feelto be necessary for the national safety and for the proper training of NationalService men is to ask from the nation a sacrifice both of wealth, in so far asland is.used that is of agricultural or other economic value, and also ofrecreation and enjoyment. This sacrifice is, however, lessened in so:far asover wide areas the Services only require freedom.to move troops,for training purposes, in other respects the, land being available for agriculture, forestry :and public recreation, and the. sea ior fishing. .38.. The following statement shows the needs of the Services for trainingland in Great Britain, but not in Northern Ireland: -1 &apos; Statement
PART IX.-THE PROCEDURE FOR EXAMINING INDIVIDUALPROPOSALS BY SERVICE DEPARTMENTS39. The Services fully appreciate the growing dependence of.the. nationupon home agriculture; the vital importance of home-grown timber-; the need to maintain unpolluted sources of water; the part, direct and indirect, played by bur fisheries; the recreational value of the countryside, and their importance as an economic asset. In many cases areas alternatives to those areas first proposed have been adopted, or substantial modifications made.This review is continuing, and is one of the main reasons for the time taken infining to final Conclusions about Service land requirements.40. The Government feel it desirable to - make sure that both localauthorities and amenity societies have full opportunity to make representa-tions- upon the effect of the proposals on the public interest they represent.The procedure laid, down in the following paragraph will therefore apply with two exceptions. It is not considered necessary to extend, the review indetail to land owned by the Services before the war, on which training is to be continued without change of use or additional buildings erected forpurposes of storage or accommodation, or small training grounds for theTerritorial Army. Where operational requirements cannot for reasons of secrecy be made the subject of public local enquiry, then stage (c) of theprocedure must be omitted.41.   The. procedure will be as follows:  Regional consultation by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning,with the local authority1 and water supply interests, and consulta-tion by the Headquarters of the Ministry of Town and country planning with amenity and scientific societies having no regional organisation.   Similar consultations with Scottish interests will bearranged by the Department of Health for Scotland.Consideration of proposals by an Inter-Departmental Committee inthe. light of objections expressed by any Civil Department and of representations made under (a), and the submission of reports forconsideration by Ministers.Public local.enquiries (subject to consideration of security) into pro-posals to which objection is maintained by the local authorities,water supply undertakers, or amenity or scientific societies on, grounds of public interest.Regional Consultations .42. The object of the regional and Headquarters consultations under1 (a)of the preceding paragraph is to ascertain and, as far as possible, to resolveobjections put forward in each case.,. As a result of these consultations and after considering the reports of theInter-Departmental Committee, it may bo decided that the Service&apos;Depart-ment proposals must be abandoned. In other cases, the contending claimsmay be so evenly balanced that a final decision cannot be readhed withouta public local enquiry. There is, however, a large intermediate range Of cases in which either no objection has been taken from any quarter or the proposals have been so substantially modified that there is reason.to suppose that no opposition remains. In such eases steps will be taken by the Ministry of town and Country Planning to confirm that the local authorities and otherpredominant public interests agree that a public local enquiry is unnecessaryin the particular case.
Public Local Enquiry43. &quot; In cases where substantial objections on grounds of the publicinterest still remain, then (subject to security considerations) a public localenquiry will be held, after due notice, at a convenient place.The object of this enquiry will be to hear and report on objections raised on grounds of public interest, national or Ibeah  These will comprise:-(a) Objections raised by local authorities, water supply undertakers,amenity societies and other bodies concerned, on the grounds of injury to the public interest; and-.(fa) Representations of scientific or ;archreological societies against curtail-ment of opportunities; for scientific investigation, such as bhsgL-watching, or damage to areas of unique scientific interest.     -$P44. The enquiry will be presided over by : a person selected by theMinister of Town and Country Planning (or, in the case of areas in Scotland,by the Secretary of State for Scotland), on the basis of his experience andstanding in public affairs. As the enquiry will be of a non-statutory nature,there will be no powers of summoning witnesses sub poena, taking evidence on oath, or charging expenses on any body or person. An officer representingthe Service will explain generally the nature of the requirements and answer questions of fact which may be put-to him at the discretion of the. personappointed to hold the enquiry. Suggestions for the use of specific areas inthe same general locality as alternatives to those under enquiry will beadmissable, but not arguments of a general character, such as that therequirements should be met in some other part of the country or abroad,which would re-open in the particular case questions of.principle which theGovernment have decided generally on the grounds stated in earlier para-graphs of this memorandum.45.. . It is not a purpose of the enquiry to hear individual owners or lesseeson the ground of disadvantage to their personal interests, although they willnot be debarred; merely because of their interest in the land, from making representations as to the effect of the proposal on Ehe public interest. Subjectto this, the question who should be heard in evidence will be a matter for thepresiding officer. The guiding aim will be, on the one hand, to hear fully allthat can be said as to the effect of the Service Department proposal on thepublic interest, and on the other, to prevent repetition which wouldprolong the enquiry without benefit.46. In the case of the proposed practical training area at Stanford and ofthe Purbeek tank gunnery school, it has been represented that pledges weregiven that displaced persons would be allowed to return to their homes atthe end of the war. The Government accept the fact that pledges of thiskind were given or. understood to be given, and it will not therefore benecessary to press the point at any public enquiry. -At the same time for reasons given in earlier paragraphs, areas for practical training must be provided, and the; Government could not decideagainst the use for this purpose of an otherwise suitable area on the groundonly of the. existence of such pledges. If, however, after a public localenquiry, the*Government decided that displaced persons could not be allowedto return to their homes, appropriate monetary compensation would be given,and such assistance offered towards resettlement elsewhere, as was practicable.Considerations of Security47. Reference has been made above to the fact that in some cases,e.g.,&apos; anti-aircraft gun sites, radar stations, airfields, experimental ranges and establishments, security considerations will preclude the holding of a public
local enquiry. In such cases, local authorities, amenity societies, and similarbodies representing public interests will have the opportunity of making representations to the Inter-Departmental Committee.Public Local Enquiry upon&apos;Use of Land48. Public local enquiries may also be held on occasions when no questionof the acquisition of land. arises,: either because the Service Departmentalready owns the land or because they only need to obtain training rights over it. &quot;the point really at issue is whether the use to be made of the landis, or may be, objectionable, and not the acquisition of the land itself. A,-&quot;-ublic local enquiry will therefore be held (subject, as stated, to security con-vJierations), if on land already held by a Service Department, a new use isproposed, and objected to on grounds of public interest by a body of responsible opinion; or an existing use, started during the war, is similarlyobjected to; or even in eases where training rights only are in question if thereis objection to their exercise.Informal Consultations -*.-.-.-49. There may be other cases in which informal, conferences between representatives of local authorities, amenity societies, and other publicinterests, and the Departments concerned, or a hearing before the Inter-Departmental Committee, would be more appropriate than the procedure ata public local enquiry.. A request for such an informal conference expressedby these interests will readily be met.
