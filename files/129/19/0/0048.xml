SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (47) 1987th July, 1947CABINETPROPOSAL TO CHARGE WAY-LEAVES FOR OIL PIPELINESIN PALESTINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Defence Committee at their meeting on 3rd March (D.O. (47) 6th Meet-ing, Minute 1) invited me to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum dealing withthe proposal of the Palestine Government that they should make way-leave charges in respect of any new oil pipelines brought through Palestine. This matter arose in connection with the proposals for the construction of new pipelines by theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company in partnership with an American Company from the ,Middle East oil areas to the Mediterranean.2. Conventions governing the construction of pipelines through Palestineare already in force with the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Anglo-Iranian oil company and the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company. Details are set out in theAppendix to this paper, but the important feature of each of these for present purposes is that they provide that no tax of any sort is to be imposed on theCompanies except in respect of profits accruing from the sale of the Companies&apos;products for consumption in Palestine.3. The Government of Palestine is now considering two further projects for the construction of pipelines through the country : 1The first is an application by the Iraq Petroleum Company arising outof an agreement recently reached with Transjordan giving them a concession to explore for and produce oil there on the condition that they obtain theright to transport the oil by pipeline through Palestine to the Mediterraneancoast. A new agreement is necessary between the Company and the palestine government because the existing 1931 Convention covers only oil originatingin Iraq.Secondly, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Standard oil company of New Jersey have requested facilities for a further pipelinethrough Palestine territory.The High Commissioner has told both Companies that the facilities they requestcannot be granted without some direct contribution by them to the revenue ofPalestine.4. He has taken this line in view of past criticisms of the existingConventions on the ground that they contain no such provision. These criticismswere made when the Conventions came before the Permanent Mandates Corn-mission of the League of Nations. The late Lord Lugard, who was the british representative on the Commission, then argued that it was worth while for thePalestine Government to grant facilities without any direct payment on accountof the indirect benefits which would accrue to the territory by way of increasedemployment, &amp;c. It has, however, been evident for some time that public opinion in Palestine is not satisfied on this score, and the conclusion of the Conventionwith the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company last year was followed by severe criticism of the Palestine Government in the local press.5. In this matter, Palestine opinion cannot but be conscious of the situationobtaining in the neighbouring territory of Transjordan.     The Transjordan[33871]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1947
Government receives from the Iraq Petroleum Company an annual payment of 22,000 as a contribution towards the security measures required for the pipe-line constructed in 1931. The Company have now agreed to increase this figure to  60,000 in consideration of the new concession to them to search for oil inTransjordan (see paragraph 3). Similarly, when the Trans-Arabian Pipe-line Company negotiated in 1946 for facilities for their proposed pipe-line to cross Transjordan, the Transjordan Government insisted for these facilities ona payment which was eventually agreed at  P.60,000 per annum.6. In connection with these negotiations with the Trans-Arabian Pipe-line Company, the question was considered whether the payment of a fee ofthis kind contravened the provisions of Chapter III, Section A, Article 2, ofthe &apos;&apos; Proposals for consideration by an International Conference on Trade andEmployment&quot; (Cmd. 6709), and some correspondence on this point took place with the United States Government. The Foreign Office were informed by theUnited States Government in a semi-official letter of 3rd April, 1946, that&quot; whatever may be the historic precedents, existing and future pipe-line conces-sions in the Near and Middle East countries should reflect full recognition of theprinciple that countries which contribute in any way to the development and.commercialisation of petroleum resources should receive fair and reasonable com-pensation for such contributions. In line with this general policy and in referenceto the specific case in question, the United States Government would favour thepayment of a reasonable transit tax by the Arabian American Oil Company tothe Transjordan Government on the ground that Transjordan is entitled to receive compensation for transit privileges granted.&apos;1 Subsequently, with particular reference to the position in regard to the International Trade Organisationproposals, the United States Government indicated that they did not considerthere was any conflict as the proposed payment was more in the nature of a business licence tax than a transit tax, and was a payment for the privilege ofmaintaining a pipe-line and for such administrative and physical inconveniencethat this might present. It is clear, therefore, that the United States Governmentwill not object to the principle of a direct payment.7. The Government of Palestine, in the light of all these circumstances,have come to the conclusion that the granting of rights to the Trans-ArabianPipeline Company on the terms of the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s 1931 Con-vention have made matters even as far as the obligations of equal treatmentunder Article 18 of the Mandate are concerned and that these Conventions shouldnot be taken as a precedent for the future. They have indicated both to theIraq Petroleum Company and to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that theywill expect a direct payment in consideration of the grant of the facilitiesrequested, and that they are taking this line (a) in the interests of the people ofPalestine, and (b) on account of the cost of security measures for the pipe-line.8. I should perhaps add that the Iraq Petroleum Company have recentlyenquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the Convention and Statuteon Freedom of Transit signed at Barcelona on 20th April, 1921, as operativein relation to the transit of oil across Palestine. They argue that, if it isoperative, it would not be open to the Palestine Government to charge a transitfee. The view of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office legal advisers on thispoint is in brief that while the Convention is operative it does not precludea charge for Way-leave.   This, therefore, presents no obstacle.9. I therefore recommend that the right of the Palestine Government tomake charges for pipe-line facilities should be approved in principle, and thatthe actual amount of the payment should be settled in negotiation between thePalestine Government and the Companies concerned.10. This memorandum has been prepared in consultation with the ForeignOffice, the Treasury and the Ministry of Fuel and Power.Colonial Office, 7 th July, 1947.A. C. J;
APPENDIXConvention governing the Construction of Pipe-lines through Palestine(a) The Iraq Petroleum Company (5th January, 1931)This Convention gives the Company power to lay pipe-lines through Palestinef and to erect refineries and other ancillary works. The Company pays a nominalrent for State land through which the pipe-line passes. Private land requiredfor the pipe-line has to be acquired by agreement between the company and the owners, but, failing agreement, the High Commissioner acquires the land under the Palestine Exappropriation of Land Ordinance and it is then leased tothe Company at a nominal rent. The Convention also provides that no propertytax, income tax or any levy or fiscal tax of any sort is to be imposed on theCompany, except in respect of profits accruing from the sale of the Company&apos;sproducts for consumption in Palestine. No taxes are to be imposed on oilpassing through the pipe-line or the derivatives thereto unless they are sold forconsumption in Palestine.(b) The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (18th October, 1933)This Convention, which is in identical terms with that referred to in the pre-ceding sub-paragraph, provides for the right to transport crude oil by pipe-line from the frontier of Iraq to a terminal port on the coast of Palestine. The Com-pany have not yet exercised their right to construct a pipe-line under thisConvention. A supplementary Convention was, however, concluded on10th March, 1938, securing them the right to erect refineries in Palestine for thepurpose of refining mineral oils of any origin. Under this supplementary Con-yention a refinery has been erected at Haifa by Consolidated Refineries (Limited),in which the shareholding is equally divided between the Anglo-Iranian oil company and the Shell Oil Company,&quot; for the purpose of refining crude oil broughtto Haifa by the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line.(c) Trans-A rabian Pipe-line Company, a subsidiary of the A rabian A merican oil company, which is a Joint Interest of the California Teaas Company andthe Standard Oil Company of California (7th January, 1946)This Convention is practically in identical terms with that of the iraq petroleum Company and throughout the negotiations which led up to its con-elusion the representatives of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company made it clearthat they would be satisfied with nothing less than such terms. In making thisstipulation they were on solid ground as a Convention was signed by the UnitedStates Government and the United Kingdom Government on 3rd December, 1924,extending to the United States the benefits of the Mandate, Article 18 of which provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations should beentitled to equal privileges in connection with the grant of concessions inPalestine,
