(47) 1799th June, 1947CABINETDEFENCE REQUIREMENTS IN CEYLONReport by the Chiefs of StaffAT their meeting on 6th May (CM. (47) 44th Conclusions, Minute 2) theCabinet invited us to consider the arrangements which would have to be madewith the Ceylon Government to safeguard our defence interests, if the Islandattained a position of independence within the Commonwealth.Military Requirements2. In view of the strategic importance of Ceylon our military requirementsin the Island are in broad terms : (a) In peace, the right to base forces and to maintain the necessary facilitiesin the island; and to retain our necessary telecommunication andsignal intelligence facilities.(b) In the event of a threat to Commonwealth security, the right to introduceadditional forces, and to develop and add to existing facilities asnecessary.3. The requirements which we consider are essential to the three Servicesin peacetime are given below.Navy4. (a) The continued use of the main Fleet base at Trincomalee, with all its, facilities, including an airfield.(b) Three associated establishments situated within 25 miles of the port.(c) The occasional use of repair facilities in Colombo.(d) The retention of four store depots at Colombo itself.   The retention ofthree store Depots and two wireless stations within 25 miles and onestore depot within 60 miles of Colombo.A ir Force5. (a) A flying-boat base for one squadron at Kogalla.(b) An airfield at Negombo for a land-based maritime strike squadron, andfor an Air Staging Post on trunk routes.(c) Wireless transmitting and receiving stations in the vicinity of Colombo.(d) Storage facilities at Karunegala for wartime reserves of bombs.(e) Air H.Q. and a few small miscellaneous units in the Colombo area.A rmy6. Although at present we do not plan to locate a combatant unit other thanA.A. and CD. in the Island in peacetime, we require the right to move in suchforces as we may deem necessary for the defence of the facilities required bythe other Services against external threat or internal disorder.[33740]. Requirements Common to all three Services7.  (a) The continued use of our Tele-communication facilities for theEmpire Cable system and for the Empire integrated wireless chain and theirextension if necessary.(b) The continued use of the Signals Intelligence Centre near Colombo.(c) Leave, recreational and hospital facilities to the existing standard.(d) The use of port facilities in Colombo for the maintenance of our forces.8. The requirements shown above for the three Services are the minimumnecessary for the satisfaction of our strategic responsibilities. Any attempt toconcentrate them in one area of the island would result in heavy expenditure,some loss of efficiency and of the advantages of dispersion.The Security of Ceylon9. All the above will be of no effect unless the integrity of the Island isfully preserved.   We must therefore concern ourselves with : (a) The security of Ceylon against external aggression.(b) The maintenance of internal order within the island.External Defence10. As it is unlikely that Ceylon will be able to provide forces capableof defending the Island against aggression we must assume responsibility for&quot;its defence. This is no new commitment since Ceylon is only likely to bethreatened in the event of a major war, and under these circumstances we shouldwish, in any case, to preserve our essential defence interests in the country.While we must retain the ultimate responsibility we suggest that the co-ordination of defence matters with the local authorities would be made easierby the establishment of some form of Joint Defence Committee.Internal Security11. There is always a danger of India (especially Congress India) inter-fering in Ceylonese internal politics and promoting discontent among the power-ful Indian minority. The extent of this danger depends upon the futureconstitutional set-up in India. This danger is superimposed upon the problemsof racial differences, anti-European feeling, communism and labour unrest whichby themselves are liable at any time to cause internal disorders. Such disorders,however provoked, would have a serious effect upon the working of our serviceestablishments.Although the Ceylon Government should be responsible for internal security,in the event of the situation becoming beyond her capacity to control and ourdefence interests being threatened, we should reserve the right to introduce forces,and to take action as necessary to protect our interests.Locally raised forces12. With a view to improving the standard of locally raised forces so that&gt;they can maintain internal order and assist in the defence of the Island we shouldwish them to be developed and expanded with our assistance and under ourdirection.Conclusion13. In view of Ceylon&apos;s vital and continued importance to us as a basefrom which to exercise control of Indian Ocean communications, we concludethat, if she attains her independence within the Commonwealth : (a) Her continued integrity will be of the utmost importance to us, and wemust continue to accept responsibility for her defence.(b) Her co-operation should extend to : (i) Granting us in peace-time the right to base naval and air forcesin Ceylon and to maintain the necessary facilities there; tostation limited land forces as a nucleus organisation for thedefence of the Island and to introduce further land forces inthe event of internal disorder, beyond the capacity of theCeylon Government to control, threatening our Defenceinterests : and to retain our telecommunications and signalintelligence facilities and to extend them if necessary. (ii) Granting us in the event of a threat to commonwealth security the right to introduce additional forces and to develop andadd to the existing facilities.(iii) Agreeing to the development of Ceylonese forces under our super-vision and with our assistance.(iv) Establishing suitable joint Civil and Military machinery toco-ordinate Defence matters with us.Methods of Obtaining Our Defence Requirements14. The decision as to the method of approach to the Ceylon government must be a political one. Our military requirements would however be satisfied ifan agreement on a permanent basis were concluded with Ceylon, whereby, in returnfor the use of facilities and installations as outlined above, we guaranteed the integrity of the Island.We would suggest that any such agreement might be modelled on the bilateral agreement concluded between the United States and the Philippine Government.There is no satisfactory analogy with the Simonstown agreement which deals with one isolated area, whereas our requirements in Ceylon are dispersed throughoutthe Island.(Signed) TEDDER.MONTGOMERY OF ALAMEIN.R.
