(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)CJ70) 12nd January1970COPY NO.63CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL. MANPOWER 1970-71Memorandum by the Lord Privy SealDepartments have been discussing with the Civil Service Departmentwhat their non^industrial manpower requirements will be up to 1st Aprils 1971, and decisions have now to be made on the manpowerprovision to be taken in the 1970-71 Estimates,,    I seek my colleagues^views and their endorsement of the line that I propose to take,2.      To put the 1970-71 figures in perspective^ I attach at Annex A a table showing the movements  in numbers of non-industrial and industrial civilservants over the past 20 years0     Figures for particular years can ofcourse be very much affected by organisational as well as policy changes(for example,, the transfer of a body of work into or out of the Civil Service).But overall the pattern on the non-industrial side (with which this paper isconcerned) is of a continuous rise (averaging about Z\ per cent per annum)since about 1958-59 when the post-war contraction had run its course.    Thisrise parallels, at a rather slower rate8 the growth in public and supply expenditure over the same period,,30      Following on a decision of Cabinet in January^ 1968(CC(SS) 7th Conclus ions) we have imposed on non-xindustrial Civil Servicenumbers for each of the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 an overall ceiling whichhas been announced beforehand in Parliament and subsequently adhered to.The Government is not alone in maintaining some kind of manpower control system alongside financial controls a number of progressive firms do tooaOfficials are embarking on a major study of the manpower ceiling system as it has operated during 1968-69 and 1969-70 to see how far it can be developed into a more flexible system of manpower planning in the longer term.    It is too soon yet to speculate how practicable this will be but I amclear that the system even as we now have it provides an importantreinforcement to our controls on expenditures and that an overall ceilingshould again be settled for 1970-71 and announced to Parliament in duec curse 0(**L-
40      Existing policy places a manpower ceiling (which must not be exceeded) for all Departments at 496, 500 for 1040 70o    As the PrimeMinister explained in his Parliamentary statement on 26th February lastffthis represents an increase in ceiling of 8? 700 in the course of the year(from a starting point at 1.4. 69 of 472, 800) plus about 15, 000 in respect of former Post Office staff who have been employed, as from 1st October, 1969by the Department for National Savings and the Ministry of Posts and telecommunications,,    All the evidence is that the actual number in postat 1.4.70 will be within the ceilings    Indeed, some ceiling reductions havebeen made to take account of changes in recent months in Departments *planning, reflecting economy in manpower use as well as revised estimates of recruitment trends, and the revised total of departmental ceilings can betaken as 495^ 750 for 1. 4, 70,5e      Let me now turn to 1970-710    Despite strenuous efforts by theCivil Service Department in discussion with Departments generally to keepwithin a 500, 000 total, bids for 1970-71 would bring the ceiling for 1.4. 71to just under 506, 000s an increase of about 9o 500 as compared with theannounced ceiling for 1.4C 70 and of just over 10, 000 as compared with the revised ceiling mentioned in paragraph 4.    Of this figure about 900 does not represent an actual increase in total manpower employed, but is accountedfor by the net effect of transfers to and from bodies now outside the CivilService or from industrial to non-industrial status.    The genuine increase is thus about 9.500 or just under 2 per cent, i.e. greater, but onlymarginally, than the increase allowed for in the current year.   A statement is attached showing the variations Department by Department (Annex B)c6,      About 6,800 (just under 70 per cent) of the total increase proposedis accounted for by four Departments?Inland Revenue 2, 600Home Office le5Q0Department of Health 1,400and Social SecurityDepartment ofEmployment and productivity 1,300These increases -reflect mainly the development of existing work,,    new work properly so-called (as distinct from development of previous policy)is estimated to require about 1,000 new posts, taking Departments as a whole,There is also an element (an additional 850 staff spread among thedepartmental figures) for work arising out of the Fulton report this represents a reduction on the numbers originally estimated to be requiredby Departments, but is in line with the expenditure figure for this itemagreed in PESO discussions.
70      As regards savings, there is proposed a further reduction In the size of the Land Commission and a small reduction in the diplomatic service    There Is alao a reduction of about 500 in the Ministry of Defence,which would have been about 13100 were it not for the transfer of about 600from industrial to non-Industrial status.    This Is a smaller net reductionthan had been expected on the basis of previous forecasts and is attributedby the Ministry of Defence largely to a slower run down In defence units and establishments^, the advent of further measures of non* Industrialisationand the inclusion of new commitments like the implementation of Fulton0They also point out that their total civilian manpower (industrial and s*,on-industrial together) Is consistent with the 80^000 rundown envisaged In theDefence Review White Paper,80      The estimates presented by Departments follow on prolonged andthorough discussions they have had with my officials over the past six monthsduring which some savings have been achieved by some Departments undervery strong pressure    Departments have also allowed so far as they can forthe savings they see as flowing from either the specific or general recommendations of the Bellinger Panel, though the^e are In many casesextremely difficult to quantify,    Nonetheless., an Increase to the ceilingfigure of 50Sa 000 Is regarded by Departments as essential if they are tomeet adequately their existing^ developing and new responslbilitIese9,      I recognise the general^ and growings pressure on Departments3manpower resources and would broadly accept the assessment that 506,000is near the minimum requirement on the basis of current polIcles0    On theother hands I take the view that ihere is scopes if we are sufficientlydetermined,, to limit the rate of increase in Departments4 manpower andbelieve that the ceiling figure for lc 4, 71 could be held at about 504P 0000    Inone sense a reduction of this order on Departments^ bids might be regardedas no more than an economy at the margin,,    On the other hand8 the cost is substantial (say  2 million per annum for each ls 000 staff) and it seems tome that we should be aiming at manpower figures which^ at leastc representa slightly smaller real Increase than In the current year0   A figure of5043 000 would achieve this.    I believe also that It is achievable^ withouttoo serious consequences for Departments,10o      Annex B sets out one way in which a reduction target of 2a 000 couldbe achieved,,    The reductions Indicated (to which the Departmentsconcerned have not been asked to assent) reflect many factors^ for exampleereassessment of recruitment possibilities^, the possibility of slowing down the rate of development on projects to which Departments do not accord thehighest priorityj, orj, in the case of the Ministry of Defence^ a fasterrundown In defence non-industrial manpower.    The reductions proposedarep oi course^ open to variation.    For example^ they bear relatively hardlyon the smaller Departments % this seems inevitable if the programmes of thelarger Departments 9 which are as crucial as they are manpower- intensive j,are to be allowed to develop as planned, but there Is no doubt that it wouldbe preferable if the larger Departments could ease the burden on the smallerby undertaking further,, Indeed relatively quite smalls economies over and above those indicated in Annex B0*** 3***
110       There are9 I fully acknowledges strong pressures in favour of keeping manpower in 1970-71 to a still lower figure such as (say) the target;we originally pressed of not more than 500^ 000,    But I must advise thataon all the evidence, it would not be possible to reduce the ceiling markedlybelow 504, 000 unless by a positive reduction in workload or by arbitrary(and therefore probably to a great extent counter-productive) reductions,,Moreover8 even at the 504, 000 level we would have no reserve to meetunforeseen new tasks imposed on Departments between now and1st Aprils 1971s and it would be imprudent to make it any more difficult todeal with these as they ar se012,      I recommend therefore that we set a ceiling for !..&quot;40 71 of about504j, 000 (as compared with a revised ceiling for 1,4C 70 of 495^750) andinstruct our respective officials to prepare Departmental Estimates for1970-71 on that basis and be guided in detail by the reduction targets set outin Annex B0    I would regard the increase this new ceiling represents asdefensible^ taking into account on the one hand the need for economy In theuse of manpower and on the others the general increase in Governmentactivity in the economic and social spheres and the continuing., andproportionately greater^ increase in public expenditure,    I invite mycolleagues&apos;&apos; agreement and their co-operation In achieving the proposedeconomies within their Departments,,SoCivil Service Department, S0W010Znd January^ 1970
