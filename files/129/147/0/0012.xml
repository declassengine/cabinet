Iam now circulating a revised version which I hope my colleagues will agreeshould now be published.2,      I was asked to give further thought to the possibility of amending the document in such a way that the circumstances in which firms might bereferred to the Commission for Industry and Manpower v/ere made more precise;,    I have carefully examined the various &quot;triggers&quot; for referencesset out in paragraph 7 of the original docuaae&amp;fe (paragraph. 13 of the revise)and have suggested some tightening up of the wording (ii) and the inclusionof &quot;pay structures&quot; as well as &quot;settlements&quot; in (iv).30      I have also carefully considered the suggestion that we should saythat; these are the only contexts which would trigger off references,,    I amstill convinced (as was the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy)fchat this would be a serious mistake and would in fact not really help us withthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI).    In the first place I think it ismuch more difficult to present our policy as dealing with the general problems of imperfect competition and the holding dawn of costs if we dropany reference to general examination of the conduct of firms exercisingmarket pov/ers such as obtains In the present Monopolies legislation,,4,      Secondly., if we try to incorporate a precise list of &quot;triggers&quot; in thelegislation we may on the one hand limit our freedom of action on someessential point while on the other increasingj, rather than diminishingP thefears of the CBI0    The safeguards against unwarranted interference in industry must and can only lie In the way the powers are administered asis the case with the present powers against monopoliese

I have therefore redrafted the Document leaving these as the normaltriggers of reference in practice and emphasising that we are in fact in thisway seeking to give as much clarity as possible in the case of the new commission.6,      E my colleagues decided that in spite of the objections they want a precise and exhaustive list of triggers to be included in the legislation, then it will be necessary fco add the following &quot;triggers&quot; In order fco cover allthe situations with which we are trying to deals(v) failure to maintain a satisfactory level of experts to overseas markets, or an unacceptable loos of the home market to foreign competitors?(vi) failure to maintain or install adequate productive capacity to meetthe requirements of the market, or to maintain an adequate levelof technological development;(vii) a level of profits or dividend distribution which appears excessiveand Is based on the unreasonable exercise of market power,70      The first two of these triggers are included in the factors to betaken into account in determining the public interest in Section 14 of the1948 Monopolies Act,    And the last is firmly included in the White paper on Prices and Incomes after 1969.80      I ask my colleagues to agree either   -(a) to the issue of the Consultative Document as in the text annexed9and to drawing up a Bill on this basis?   or(b) to the inclusion of an exhaustive list of triggers for referencewhich would include the additional ones set out in paragraph 6 above&quot;Early Warning&quot;9,      Lastly I want to draw my colleagues attention to a point arising on paragraph 3S0    I have referred these fco &quot;notification&quot; in contrast fco the reference In the White Paper to the continuation of the early warning system,.In the present legislation the powers fco require early warning of increasescan be used to demand that In effect a monfch% notice must be given fco theappropriate Department before implementation.10.      In my view our decision not to continue statutory stand stills on wage settlements must mean that early warning of such settlements cannot beprovided for in afcs present form which would have fco include &quot;penalprovisions &quot; for unions which try fco coerce employers to implement asettlement during the &quot;early warning&quot; period.    I propose therefore that-2-
the legislation should provide for prior notification without specifying theperiod of notice0    And because of fchiss it must I think follow that we musttreat prices in the same way and accept that the present statutory provisions for early warning cannot be continued,    A form of notification will still be valuable and will indeed provide some degree of statutory backing for the voluntary arrangements which production Departments will seek to continue0But I think we must accept that ae-statutory provision must be restricted toa power to require &quot;prior notification&apos;&apos;1 without specifying a particular periodof notice oB.A.department of Employment and Productivity, SoWol017th January? 1970-3-
COMMISSION FOR INDUSTRY AND MANPOWERConsultative document.    The Government has announced its intention cf establishing a new body -the Commission for Industry and Manpower - to take over and develop the work atpresent carried out by the Monopolies Comnission and the National Board for prices and Incomes.   The two bodies have been concerned with different butrelated aspects of some of the central economic problems arising in a modernindustrial society.   Neither covered the whole ground which needs to be covered.The Government believes that a single strong and independent body is needed whichcan be asked to report on all these matters as they affect the general interestsof the community.2.    The central problems with which the Commission will be concerned will beto ensure that the public interest is adequately considered in a situationwhere the domination of so many industries by a small number of firms means that it is increasingly difficult to rely on traditional competitivemarket forces alone to protect consumers;   and to give further incentives to the more efficient use of manpower and other resources, and so reducethe costs of providing goods and services not only in the private sector of industry, but in the public sector of industry and the public services.3.    The White Paper on Productivity, Prices and Incomes Policy after 1969 setout in broad terms the reasons why these matters cannot be left wholly to marketforces and why they need to be considered together.   Market power is increasinglybeing concentrated in a smaller number of firms and the Government recognises the need in many cases for such concentration.   But ologopoly always involvespossible dangers to the public interest.   The significance of price competitionis often lessened.   The pressure to explore all possible methods of reducing costsnay be lessened by the relative ease with which prices can be raised.   There is/a risk
a risk that a dominant firm, or a snail group of firms, may not consider itworthwhile to try to secure productivity-based pay settlements rather thaninflationary ones if it seems not too difficult to pass on the resultant coststhrough higher prices.    It is true that as import tariffs are reduced Dritishindustry has to take greater account of competition from firms abroad and thisprovides a new protection to the consumer in some parts of the economy.   Butthe need remains for machinery to deal with all situations of imperfectcompetition.4.    The new Commission will be in a position to deal with this problem through-out the economy.   It will be concerned with structure as well as behaviour:with long term problems as well as short term ones:   with the scrutiny of the factors which make for inflationery pay and price increases as well as withbehaviour which restricts or distorts competition:&apos;   with problems arising innationalised industries and the major public services as well as those in private industry.5.    The creation of a single body will therefore improve the present positionin two respects.   It will remove the overlapping of functions between the nbpi and the Monopolies Commission in examination of the behaviour of private industry - an overlapping which has become increasingly obvious over the years.At the same tine it will ensure that all aspects of the problems, in both theprivate and public sectors, can be considered by the sane body.   Productivity,prices and incomes policy and &quot;competition&quot; policy will no longer be treated asif they were entirely separate strands of our economic strategy.6.    The Government intends that references should be nade to the new Commissionon all the various natters which have in the past been dealt with by the twobodies.   However, the Government believes that the growth of large industrialunits has weakened competitive forces and made it necessary to widen the areaof public scrutiny. .J 0 /l.   This
7.    This paper sets out the Government&apos;s proposals for the main powers whichshould be included in the new legislation which would replace, with modifications,all the existing legislation on monopolies and mergers and on prices and incomes.The legislation will not affect the position cf the Restrictive Practices Court,the 1958-59 or the CHI, all of which have specific responsibilities which areseparable from those proposed for the Commission on Industry and Manpower.The paper deals withI  The scope of possible references to the CommissionII   Constitution and Procedures of the CommissionIII   Powers of the GovernmentTHE MATTERS WHICH MAY BE REPEIulED TO THE commission a.   Privately Owned Enterprises8.    The Monopolies Acts which the legislation will supercede, provide that inany case where a firm (or a group of firms acting together) has a dominantposition in the market (defined as control of at least on third of the market in particular goods and services) the Government can refer the situation to theCommission and the Commission is required to examine whether the behaviour of the firms in relation to this market is contrary to the public interest.9.    For the reasons summarised earlier the Government considers that theexistence of a technical monopoly by no means covers all the situations ofinperfect competition in the economy;   and it proposes therefore to include in the field of possible reference all major firms (defined as those withcapital employed of more than  10m) as well as those in a monopoly position.10.   This would mean that the firms whose activities could be so referred wouldbe those:-/a.   which
a. which have capital employed of uore than  10m;    orb. which supply or purchase at least one-third of specified goods or services in the UK or a substantial part of it.The possibility of references of firms with capital employed of more than 10n would apply to about 400 major industrial firms and to the major financial institutions.   These would include most major firms in important industrieswhether or not they controlled one-third of the market in particular products,and v/ould therefore cover the important cases arising at present under theprices and incomes policy while excluding small firms with limited market power.11.   The inclusion of large firms within the field of possible enquiry does not of course imply any presumption that concentration into larger units is initself undesirable;    any more than in the present monopolies legislation thecontrol of one-third of the market is presumed to be against the public interest.The Government recognises that if industry is to make full use of technological development and is to command the resources needed for modern research anddevelopment, production must in many cases become concentrated in fewer - and larger - units.   But the Government has always envisaged that this greater size and greater concentration may involve risks to the public interest against whichproper safeguards must be created.12.   The present Monopolies legislation does not include any indication as tothe circumstances in which individual firms in a monopoly position are likely tobe referred to the Commission.    In practice, however, references have normallybeen made either of firms with a very large proportion of a market, or cf firmswhere there were specific aspects of their behaviour which appeared to be insome way restricting or distorting competition.    Similarly in the case of the largefirms the Government considers that it is desirable to give some indication of thecircumstances in which a reference to the Commission would be made... /l3.   Individual
13,   Individual references would in practice normally arise in one of thefollowing contexts: -i. Price increases, or price levels, which appear to need review inthe context of the jjrices and incomes policy, particularly in situationswhere there may appear to be a lack of competitive pressures adequate to protect the public interest.ii. specific practices which appear to prevent, restrict or distortcompetition in relation to the supply of goods and services, includingissues concerning discrimination between supplies, distributors orcustomers.iii. the dominating position held in a sector of the economy by asingle firm, or a small group of firms (including cases where the firmor firms controls a high proportion of the supply of particular- productsor services).iv. pay settlements by individual firms or ther pay structures which appear to need review in the context of the prices and incomes policy.Such specific questions would however be considered in the context of the firm&apos;business as a whole.   Enquiries starting from such issues could therefore entailinvestigation into wider aspects of a firm&apos;s efficiency.   The Commission wouldnot be used for generalised enquiries into the efficiency of individual firms.14.   An illustrative list of this kind may however not be particularly suitablefor inclusion in the legislation;   and it may be preferable to use more generalphraseology.   For example, the Act could provide that references would normally be concerned with enquiries into such questions as prices and profits, conductlikely to prevent, restrict or distort competition, and payments to employees and shareholders... - /15.   The5
15.   The legislation would also provide for references of agreements and common practices among those concerned with providing or purchasing services where these appear likely to prevent, restrict or distort competition (most such agreements in respect cf the supply of goods will of course remain a matter forthe Restrictive Practices Court and not the Commission).l6.   It is also intended to continue the provision for a reference to theCommission where two or more firms appear to be conducting their business(though without any registrable agreement or arrangement between them) in suchaway as to prevent, restrict or distort competition.    In most cases, the conductof the firms concerned would be referable since they would fall within the definition in paragraph SiO.However, some of the firms concerned might not fall within this definition;    and the legislation would provide for reference of theconduct of all the firms concerned.17.   The legislation would say that the purpose of a reference would be for theCommission to report on how any aspects of the issues raised by the referenceaffected the public interest.    &quot;Public interest&quot; would be defined in the termsof Section 14 of the 1948 Monopolies Act, and the Commission would therefore berequired to have regard to the need to achieve:-a. the production, treatment and distribution by the most efficient and economical means of goods of such types and qualities, in such volume andat such prices as will best meet the requirements of home and overseas markets;b. the organisation of industry and trade in such a way that their efficiency is progressively increased and nev; enterprise is encouraged;c. the fullest use and best distribution of men, materials and industrial capacity in the United Kingdom;    and d. the development of technical improvements and the expansion ofexisting markets and the opening up of new markets.
B. Public Enterprises18.   The nationalised industries are required to work within a statutory frame-work which takes account of the public interest.   Nevertheless there have beenoccasions in the past when enquiry by the NBPI has been helpful, and the Board&apos;work in the nationalised industry field will be continued by the Commission.The legislation will, therefore, provide for references on natters relating tothe conduct of public enterprises on broadly the same lines as for privately owned firms,19,   In appropriate cases references would be made on prices, charges or pay.In addition, Ministers nay from tine to time wish to make general references onefficiency, where the CIM like the NBPI would, in appropriate cases have a role to play.   Such studies, undertaken at intervals, can make a contribution to management and to the work of Ministers responsible for policy in this field.The legislation will provide for this,C. Public Services20 The Commission would deal with references in relation to pay in the public services of the kinds which are now made to the NBPI. Such references would, inno way affect the arrangements for pay negotiations in the public services.21.   In sone cases, the purpose of the refernce would be to investigate whetherclains or settlements for particular groups of workers conformed to the objectives of the incomes policy.    In other cases the reference nay be concerned with widerranging enquiries into pay structures and their relation to efficiency in thepublic services, which Ministers nay from tine to tine wish to ask theCommission - as they have the NBPI - to undertake &quot;in relation to particularpublic services.7/22.   The Connission
&quot;22.  The. Commission v/ould also he given the responsibility for. advising cn therenuneration of certain groups in the public services for whom no pay negotiatingDachinery can be Revised.   One example of this would be. the pay of the armed forces, where the Commission would take over the present responsibility ofthe n3pi for advising the Government on their remuneration.23.   In addition, the Commission acting through a special Panel would be askedto advise from tine to time on the renuneration of such groups as Members ofParliament, Ministers of the Crown, Senior Civil Servants, the Boards of nationalised Industries and the highest paid group of local authority officers,D.   Prices and Incomes Policy24-.   The Commission would have a responsibility for advising on issues arisingfrom the application of the prices and incomes policy.   References would be madeto the Commission in appropriate cases where proposed price rises or pay settlements appeared contrary to the prices and incomes policy or raised general problems of importance in relation to that policy.25.   Proposed price increases and pay settlements by large individualenterprises and public bodies could be referred to the Commission under theprovisions of the earlier Sections.   In addition the legislation would providefor references concerning pay agreements involving more than one employer and pay increases proposed by such bodies as Wages Councils.26.   This would mean that all increases in prices or pay of major economic       &quot;significance Bould be referred to the Commission.   In dealing with thesenatters the Commission would have regard to the prices and incomes policy ofthe tine./E.   Mergers
E. Mergers27 The new legislation would-incorporate the provisions on mergers (includingnewspaper mergers) contained in the 1965 Monopolies and Mergers Act. It is not intended to make significant amendments in these provisions.28.   Experience has however shown the desirability of enquiring at a later dateinto the consequences for the public interest of mergers carried through whetheror not the proposal was examined by the Commission.   At the tine of a merger itnay be expected that the advantages which will flow from the nerger are likelyto offset any disadvantages to the public interest flowing fron increasedconcentration of market power.   The Government considers it desirable in certain cases to enquire later whether the advantages expected fron the nerger have actually resulted and whether the disadvantages have been no greater than was thought.   It is therefore intended to provide for references of this character.(The firm concerned would of course in virtually all cases fall within the definition of paragraph 9 above)F. General References29.   In addition to references concerned with individual enterprises, whether inthe public or private sectors, or with practices restricting competition, theGovernment considers that the Commission can have a valuable role to play in considering more general issues.    Since 1965 both the Monopolies Commission and the nbpi have been given general references;    and it is intended to continue this practice.30.   The legislation would therefore provide for reference to the Commission ofgeneral questions affecting an industry, trade or profession as a whole rather thanindividual firms.   This would enable the Commission to be given references such asthose given to the Monopolies Connission on professional practices or to the NBPIon the structure of costs and prices in an industry or on retail nargins for a class of product.31.   The legislation would also provide for reference of general questions related to particular kinds of business practice in the economy as a whole.   This wouldenable the Commission to be given references on natters such as those nade to the monopolies Connission on recommended resale prices or to the NBPI on productivity agreements or Salary Structures.32.   These general references would be essantially &quot;study&quot; references.   TheCommission would no doubt make reconnendations for action either by the interestconcerned or the Government.   But the legislation would not provide any powers forthe Government to require any action following a reference of this kind.q /CONSTITUTION
CONFIDENTIALCONSTITUTION AND PROCEDURES OP THE COMMISSION33,   It is proposed that the Commission should consist of a full-time Chairman,and up to 20 other Members (some full-time and some part-time).   The commission would conduct inquiries only on reference to it by Ministers.   The commission would be encouraged to establish a strong Secretariat and would be given theresponsibility of keeping under review important matters concerning its generalfield of activity.   The Commission would operate in an independent manner.Like the Monopolies Commission and the NBPI it would have the necessary powersto obtain information relevant to the references made to it, and a duty to avoid the unnecessary disclosure of such information.34.   It is desirable that the Commission should deal as expeditiously as possible with matters referred to it, consistent with a full examination of the issues,and adequate opportunities to those concerned to present their case to theCommission.   References dealing with relatively straight-forward issues would bedealt with in Jj-6 months by the Commission, in the same way as the NBPI hasdealt with enquiries on such matters.   References concerned with questionshaving wider implications, including studies of major monopolies of the kindcarried out by the Monopolies Commission in the past, efficiency studies on the nationalised industries, and general references, would naturally take a longer period to complete.   However, even in these cases it is desirable to shorten asfar as possible the period taken for carrying out the enquiry.   The legislation would provide for Ministers in all cases to fix dates by which the commission shall report on each reference.35.   In cases where the Commission is considering whether the conduct of an enterprise is contrary in some respect to the public interest it is particularly important that those concerned should be given precise indications of the issues involved, and a proper opportunity to deal fully with them.   The procedures ofthe Commission would provide for this.POSTERS OP THE GOVERNMENTNotification of Increases of Pay, Prices and Dividends36.   The legislation would include powers to enable the Government to requirenotification of price increases and pay settlements prior to their implementation,and of increased dividend declarations.   The Government believes however thatthese matters are best handled by voluntary arrangements with the powers only in reserve.10 /&quot;stand stills&quot;
&quot;stand stills&quot;   During Enquiries by the Commission37.    The legislation would provide as in the 1 965 Act for proposed mergerswhich have been referred to the Commission not to be concluded until after theCommission has reported.   The legislation (unlike the 1966 Prices and incomes act) will not however give the Government power to hold up implementation afternotification of a proposed price increase or pay settlement during the period when it has been referred to the Commission.Powers Following Reports of the Commission38.    Where the Commission reports that in its view the conduct of an enterpriseis in specified respects detrimental to the public interest, Ministers willhave the powers set out in Section 3 of the 1965 Monopolies Act.   These includepowers:1.   to declare agreements unlawful or to require the parties to bring them to an end.(This will not apply to pay agreements)2.   to declare unlawful the withholding of goods and services or the placing of conditions on the supplying of goods or services.3.   to stop discrimination in prices or other matters concerning thesupply of goods and services.4.   to regulate prices charged for goods and services.5.   to prohibit or restrict acquisition of undertaking or assets.6.   to require division or sale of parts of an undertaking.39.    These powers would however be exercisable only in so far as they weredirectly relevant for the purpose of remedying specific detriments to the publicinterest set out in the Commissions Report.   Moreover the power to regulateprices would be exercisable only where the Commission finds specifically thatthe prices charged (or to be charged) would be against the public interest andthat there is an unreasonable exercise of the power of the firm to determineprices for goods and services which it is supplying.   The Commission will berequired to give reasons for their conclusions./40.   These11
40.    These powers will apply equally to privately owned and publicly ownedenterprises except that the powers to prohibit acquisitions or to requiredivestment of assets would be inappropriate and will not apply in the case of publicly owned enterprises.   Powers will not be exercisable in relation toreferences concerning the public services or to 1 general&apos; references.41.    The powers would be exercisable through Orders subject to approval byParliament.12
