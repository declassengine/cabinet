30      In the event: this statement was not made but The Queen*s Speechhas promised legislation in the current Session arising out of the SeebohmCommittee&quot;s recommendationsa4,      The Social Services Committee have been considering the content ofthis Bill0    To save time they have agzeed that a start be made with the drafting on a provisional basis but  here are a number of points on whichthe Cabinet*s endorsement or decision is required.    These are set out below.    They need to be viewed in the context of decisions on the structure of the health service and on reorganisation of local government.Scope of the Bill5,      A short Bill is proposed dealing only with the essential core of theSeebohm committee^s organisational recommendations.    It would thus make no attempt to consolidate, modify or extend the powers and duties of localauthorities to provide services as did the Social Work (Scotland) Act of 1968,This could come later, but to seek to do this now would greatly add to thelength and complexity of the Bills and the Ministers concerned are satisfiedthat the new powers and duties which have been conferred on local authorities by the Health Service and Public Health Act, 1968 and the Children^ and young Persons Act, 1969 justify us In claiming that no local authority need be prevented by lack of statutory powers from developing its services onthe lines recommended by Seebohm,6,      As the Cabinet agreed last July, the Bill will be concerned,therefore, with the chlldren4&apos;s and welfare services and with certainpersonal social services now administered as local authority healthservlceSo    The Seebohm Committee recommended that education welfare and child guidance services, together with certain social work currentlyundertaken by some housing departments, should also be brought at thesame time within the arnMt of the new department.    The Social services committee have concluded, however, that,, as in Scotland, transfer of theeducation welfare service should not be made mandatory, at any rate forthe present.    Further analysis and definition of function is needed herewith a view to concentrating the work of genuine social care in the social service department when it has established itself, and the Bill will provide that additional furxciions may be transferred to the social service department with Ministers8 agreement.    The future location of the childguidance service is best settled in conjunction with that of the school health service.    Social work in connection with housing already rests for the mostpart with chiidren*s or welfare departments and here again no mandatorytransfer would seem to be needed,7,      The defcatted allocation of functions between the social service departments and the new health authorities (and in the interim period, theremaining local authority health department) Is deal?: vriSb. in my forthcomingpaper on Reorganisation of the National Health Service,
Mgj&amp;jjd jrf imple menta t ion8Q      There are two problems here9 both affected by general localgovernment considerations,,    The first relates to the intention to providefor a statutory social services committee supported by a statutoryprincipal officer whose selection would be subject^ initially., to consultationwith the Ministers concerned (by approval of a short Hst)0    these requirements would supersede, the existing obligation to establish separatecommittees in the Seebohm field and Ministerial control over Children*sOfficer appointments0    The local authority associations have shown themselves to be opposed in principle to all such requirements on the viewthat each authority should be freed to order its own business as it wishes,,and of course such provisions run counter to the philosophy of the MaudCommittee on Management which v/as reaffirmed by the R.oyal Commissionin relation to the&quot; new authorities they proposed,,    The Social services committee have9 however, from the start accepted that such provision, isof the essence of the Seebohm Committeecs recommendations and essentialto the efficiency of the services at this stage    Without it experience showsthat some authorities at any rate would organise these services undermedical direction to the prejudice both of the social work profession (whichis not equally influential or politically articulate) and of the personal social services themselves,,    Moreover, there is a special need for a statutory chain of command for services which carry responsibilityaffecting the life, the person and. the freedom of individuals09,      The Social Services Committee,, In confirming the need for such provision in the Bill, have considered whether it could also provide forthese requirements to expire after a specified period as the Secretary ofState for Local Government and Regional Planning requested,,    If, however,it were to be of value in the Redcliffe-Maud context the stated time limitwould have to be relatively short and the Committee did not feel that itwould be justifiable to take this risk with the independence and cohesion ofthe new service.    It would, however, be the intention at the Second Reading,while justifying the special case for a statutory committee, to make it plain that the requirement is not seen as a permanent one? the Bill will anyhowcontain a flexible provision permitting extension of the committee *s area ofresponsibility! and as with the previous Scottish Act it will provide thatMinisterial control over the principal officer^ appointment should lapse assoon as it is possible to prescribe qualifications for the post,,    TheGovernments stance would be easier if we could announce an intention to abolish certain other existing requirements outside the Seebohm field forthe establishment of local authority committees or the appointment of chiefofficerss it v/as thought that provisions to this effect, if agreed to, could hardly be included within the Seebohm Bill without unaccepfcably wideningits scope.10o      The second problem is whether,, in the light of the proposals for local government reorganisation., the statutory requirement should beapplied to individual authorities &quot;across-the-board&quot; at; the earliest possiblesingle date (1st April, 1971 or, in the case of Wales, at such other date as
might be appropriate)^ or selectively where there was no good reason to wait for the completion of local government reorganisation,,    Thearguments for both courses were set out at some length in C(69) 81,    Thelocal authority associations have spoken with no clear voice on this subject8being disposed anyhow to oppose any kind of mandatory solution,.    TheAssociation of Municipal Corporations have expressed their anxiety onpractical grounds at the prospect of a single appointed day for the implementation of Seebohm prior to general reorganisation and haveexpressed particular concern over the revocation of the statutory schemes under which some thirty county district councils at present exercise health and welfare functions by delegation from the County Council^    On the otherhand -- on the assumption of mandatory legislation - both Associations11&apos;Secretaries have indicated that they would not dissent from generalimplementation if provision were made for exceptions where good causecould be sbown01L       The Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planninghas maintained the case for the selective approach on the score that itwould not be reasonable to impose these statutory requirements upon allmajor authorities outside Greater London at a time when it would be known that many of them would have only a few years of separate existence beforethemu    If any exceptions were to be allowed from an &quot;across-the-board&quot;approach many authorities could be expected to apply.  In the absence of anyclear criteria it would be very hard to distinguish between their claims;and a selective system would in&apos;fact be likely to emerge in practice,.    Itwould be preferable^ therefore, that the Bill should empower Ministers to fix a date or dates for bringing Its provisions into forcef either as regardsindividual provisions or individual authorities..    It would then be possible toapply the requirements straight away to the London Boroughs, to Wales at whatever date appears to the Secretary of State for Wales to be appropriatehaving regard to the progress of local government reorganisation there,and to the remaining authorities inEngland either at their request or byMinisters11&apos; direction If it appeared,, for example, that they would not be greatly affected by local government reorganisation (as might be the case with about one-third of the authorities concerned),,120      The rest of the Social Services Committee continue to prefer the&quot;across-the-board&quot; method on the view that further delay would be very badfor the services concerned and would In particular be likely to tell againstauthorities which did not reorganise immediately, in that (he best staff would tend to move elsewhere.    The double upheaval, or reorganisation of services within existing authorities on Seebohm lines followed by localgovernment reorganisation generally, would affect primarily the posts atprincipal officer level rather than the area teams in which the localpersonal social services would be organised^  it might indeed bi an advantage to get the reorganisation of the personal social services underway before the general recasting of local governments and the Committeenoted that In Scotland, although there had been criticism of the intention to reorganise the social work services in. advance of local government0*4-
reorganisation, the local authorities had, when the time came, shown themselves ready to co-operate.,    The Committee were, however, disposed to agree that there could be a limited number of exceptions where a good case could be made fco Ministers by an individual authority In the light of allthe relevant circumstances.   The latter could Include *:he probable effects of local government reorganisation, but this could not in itself be a decidingfactor in all cases if general implementation of the Seebohm recommenda-tions at an early date was to be the aim.13.      I accordingly ask the Cabinet(a) fco confirm the proposals for the scope of the Bill to reorganisethe local authority personal social services (paragraphs 5-7)?(b) to endorse the intention to provide in the Bill for a statutorycommittee and a principal officer selected during an initialperiods, from a short list approved by Ministers (paragraphs 8-9)^(c) to decide whether the requirements at (b) should be appliedselectively or &quot;across-the-board&quot;, with exceptions In special cases (paragraphs 10-12),K-0 H0 Sa C oDepartment of Health and Social Security, S0E.l08th January, 1970ij-5-
