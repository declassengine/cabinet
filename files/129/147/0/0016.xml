llANNEX ADRAFT STATEMENT ON DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1970CHAPTER I
stateme:?t on the, de?e:;cs esti :ates ,19,701POLICY AND ii&apos;ANAGEKF.I!TINTRODUCTION1,    Britain enters   the Seventies with an overall military capabilitywhich no other West European power can surpass.     Ker Armed Forces arethe most highly trained in the North Atlantic Alliance and they havealready in service or in immediate prospect a range of new equipment which is second to none.2,    Britain&apos;s military role has been transformed, over the last fiveyears by the historic decision to withdraw our forces from their basesEast of Suez and to concentrate them in Europe.     While our military commitments are being reduced in this way,  the nation is getting bettervalue for the money it spends on defence: thus, despite the reductionin expenditure imposed by our economic needs, we have been able toincrease our contribution to the defence of Europe which is vital toour survival and simultaneously to reduce the over-stretch from which our forces have suffered in the past.3.    The next decade is likely to see changes in the international situation which strengthen the powerful arguments for closer european defence co-operation.     Britain&apos;s contribution to that co-operation will reinforce the growing political and economic unity of western europe.THE DEFENCE ENDOETk.    The Defence Budget Estimates for 1970-71 which are now beingpresented to Parliament total  2281m.      At 1969 Survey prices - theprice basis used in the White Paper on Public Expenditure 1968-69 to1973-7U (Cmnd. U23k) - this represents a total of  21hhm.      In real terms therefore these Estimates are  67m. below the figure of  2211m.given in Table 1,h of Cmnd. U2&apos;3k.      At 1969-70 Estimates prices this^presents a total of  2139m.  i.e.  127m. below the Defence budget estimates for 1969-70 of  2266^0NFjDENTiAL
-    The Estimates do not provide for all the increases in forces&apos; pay which-ill take effect in 1970-71. Assessment of the total cost of these increases must await the Government&apos;s consideration of the further recommendations ofthe National Board for Prices and Incomes (see paragraph 6h below).The necessary supplementary provision to meet the cost of the forth-coming pay awards will be sought from Parliament.     Thus the finalfigure for the Defence Budget will be higher than that of  2281m.covered by the Estimates now being presented.6,    These Estimates will represent about 5? per cent of the gross national Product compared with about 7 per cent in the Estimates forthe years up to 1965.     By 1972-73, when the process of concentratingour defence effort in the NATO area will have been completed, it isestimated that this proportion will have been reduced to a littleunder 5 per cent.NORTHERN IRELAND7,    The most important operational role of the forces during the last twelve months has been in Northern Ireland.     The outbreak of communalviolence during August 1969 in Belfast, Londonderry and other towns was brought under control only by the intervention of troops, in response to a request from the Government of Northern Ireland for their help in aid of the civil power.     We made a rapid and substantial reinforcement of the garrison of Northern Ireland.     The General Officer Commanding,Northern Ireland was made Director of Operations with control of theRoyal Ulster Constabulary for security operations and of the UlsterSpecial Constabulary for all purposes.     Although there were furtheroutbreaks of serious rioting in Belfast in late September, and in thefi?8t half of October when the troops were compelled to return fire ona limited scale, the measures which the military and police forces have^ken under the direction of the G.O.C. have effectively contained/c ommunal
communal violence in all parts of Northern Ireland.      While the G.O.C.remains the overall Director of Operations, his responsibility for theRoyal Ulster Constabulary can now be expressed as the co-ordination oftheir tasks.     The presence of troops made it possible for the royal ulster Constabulary to give up its para-military role and to ceasecarrying arms in accordance with its new policy.8    The use of troops to help in restoring law and order in theUnited Kin; dora is unprecedented in recent years.     But although their task was a most difficult and distasteful one, the officers and menconcerned have shown exceptional qualities of skill,  tact and patience in carrying it out with restraint and impartiality.      Theyhave thus pained a very substantial measure of co-operation from thepeople of Northern Ireland.9,    For a time the normal Northern Ireland garrison of a brigade headquarters, two infantry battalions and elements of an armouredreconnaissance regiment was reinforced by eight major units, an armoured car squadron, a field squadron of the Royal Engineers and an additionalbrigade headquarters.      A Royal Marines Commando and a wing of theRoyal Air Force Regiment took their turn in the rotation of units onunaccompanied tours of some four months.      Of the major units threeinfantry battalions have now been withdrawn without replacements,leaving a total of seven major units in the infantry role and elements of an armoured reconnaissance regiment.      Although the nature and timing of a return to normality is being studied, we cannot&apos;yet saywhen the other additional units may be withdrawn or what the level ofthe permanent garrison may have to be for the future.     further reductions will be made as soon as circumstances allow.10.  The permanent garrison v/ill soon be supported by the Ulsterdefence Regiment, a locally recruited part-time force now being formed for defence against armed attack or sabotage.
CONFIDENTIAL-jl      We have been able to supply the necessary reinforcements with less strain upon the capacity of our forces than would have been thecase before the re-orientation of our defence policy.      But we mayhave to make some temporary redeployments of units from B.A.O.R. for short unaccompanied tours in Northern Ireland.      These will be kept to a minimum and the units concerned, which will remain available tothe Supreme Allied Commander,  Europe, could quickly return to germany in a N.A.T.O. emergency.IOUTSIDE EUROPE12.     The withdrawal of our forces from their bases in Malaysia and singapore is proceeding as planned and will be completed by the end of1971.     By 1 April 1970, the total number of those working in or forthe Services in the area will be about i+3,500 compared, with 73,000 on1 April 1968 and over 90,000 at the end of &quot;confrontation1&quot;.     Duringthe current financial year about 6,500 Servicemen and 150 UnitedKingdom civilians will have returned to the United Kingdom;   and the brigade of Gurkhas v/ill have been reduced by 1,900.      The number oflocal civilians employed by the Services will have been reduced byh,800 and the number of locally enlisted military personnel by 1,150.The rundown of support facilities in Malaysia and Singapore is proceed-ing steadily.     Under the agreement described in paragraphs 8 to 10 ofthe Supplementary Statement on Defence 1968 (Cmnd. 3701), the value ofland, facilities and associated equipment notified to Parliament as likely to be transferred free of charge to the Governments of malaysia and Singapore in the current financial year was nearly  13m.     Most ofthis will have been handed over by 1 April 1970,  including theCommonwealth Brigade base at Terendak in Malaysia and parts of theRoyal Air Force base at Seletar in Singapore.13.    A second successful Five Power Conference on the defence of theMalaysian/Singapore region was held at Canberra in June,  against the background of the announcements by the Australian and New Zealand/Governments
Governments last February that they would maintain operational forcesof all three Services in the area after 1971 and the recognition bythe Governments of Malaysia and Singapore that they regard thedefence of their two countries as indivisible.     These four Common-wealth countries have made substantial progress towards setting upeffective regional defence arrangements for the future.     The UnitedKingdom has given them all possible help in planning the transition tothese new arrangements;    and the process of planning them was carried forward at a meeting of senior officials of the five countries inKuala Lumpur in November.11).,     By participating in the major Commonwealth exercise BERSATU PADUto be held in Malaysia later this year, we shall demonstrate our capacity     rapidly to deploy forces to the Par East from our generalcapability based in the United Kingdom.     Our contribution to thisexercise will be substantial, involving combat units of all three services.     We shall continue to train forces of all three services in the Par East after 1971.     Indeed, British forces will continue to train and exercise in many parts of the world after that date.     Thiswill be essential both because of the acute shortage of training areasin the United Kingdom and to provide the necessary variety in terrainand climate for the maintenance of efficiency and morale.15.     It remains, our intention to withdraw British forces from thePersian Gulf by the end of 1971;   we expect to begin the withdrawalduring the year.16,     In discussions between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the new government of Libya,   it was agreed that the obligation of the UnitedKingdom to come to the help of Libya in the event of war, and the associated rights of the United Kingdom to defence facilities in libya under the 1953 Treaty, were no longer operative.     The with-drawal pf British forces from El Adem and Tobruk will be completed &quot;by31 March 1970.
17.    The wide range of duties undertaken by the Services outside their main N.A.T.O.  role is described in some detail in Chapter II.They include peace-keeping operations for the United Nations in cyprus;    the Beira Patrol;    assistance to the civil power at home andin the dependencies;   exercises in many countries;   and assistance inrelief work following natural disasters, in development work and inexploration.THE DEFENCE 0? europe the Challenge of the Warsaw Pact18.     The main function of British forces in the future will &quot;be tohelp in guaranteeing   peace and security for Europe through the north atlantic Alliance.     Although there are no indications that, the warsaw pact countries at this time contemplate armed aggression againstmembers of N.A.T.O.,  their military strength continues to incx^ease.There has been a continuous rise in the Soviet Union&apos;s expenditure on defence and space, averaging probably some 6 per cent a year in recentyears at constant prices:    it is at present absorbing about 9 per cent of Russia&apos;s Gross National Product, a proportion comparable to that ofthe United States.     The defence spending of the other members of the warsaw Pact has also been rising.19.     The Warsaw Pact countries have 500^000 men in their navies, over three million men in their armies and over one million men in air androcket forces.     Substantial Russian forces remain in Czechoslovakia,Altogether Borne thirty Russian divisions and 1,900 tactical aircraft are now permanently stationed in the four countries (including Hungary)opposite the central region of Allied Command Europe;    and during thepast year the Soviet Union has made greater efforts to improve the integration and military effectiveness of the Warsaw Pact.     At sea,the Russian western fleets alone include about 250 submarines a propor-$ion of which are nuclear powered, nearly J100 strike and reconnaissance aircraft and ninety sizeable surface ships.     The Russian maritime
CONFIDENTIALt-presence continues to expand, particularly on N.A.T.O. &apos; s Southernflank in the Mediterranean, and Russian warships have begun to be deployed even further afield.r^TU^St^ategy20.    Against forces of this size the security of Western Europe must rest fundamentally,  as it has since the Second World War,  on theguarantee provided by the strategic nuclear forces of the United States.Until recently N.A.T.O.  strategy envisaged an almost automatic recourse to nuclear weapons should aggression occur against a member country.But by the early 1960s both sides   possessed increasing numbers oftactical nuclear weapons and were developing strategic nuclear systemscapable of surviving an enemy&apos;s first strike.      Together with other allied governments, we have therefore been working to develop astrategy which would improve the prospects for rational control of amilitary conflict in Europe while maintaining the credibility of the nuclear guarantee.21,     Three main aspects had to be considered.     First,  the strategyhad to be compatible v/ith the resources which N. A.T.O.  countries couldrealistically be expected to devote to defence.      Second,  a balanceshould be struck between the nuclear and conventional forces of the alliance which would make the strategy credible.     Third,  the problemsassociated with the control of nuclear weapons and their place in a newstrategy had to be examined in detail.22.     In December the Alliance adopjted a new strategy designed toprovide a wider and more flexible range of response appropriate to thenature of the threat.     It recognises that, while N. A.T.O. must beready to use nuclear weapons if necessary,  this must not be the onlyresponse which the Alliance can make to any of the threats which itmight have to face, and that steps must therefore be taken to maximisethe capability of N.A.T.O. *s forces in conventional conflicts.
23,     The nuclear aspects of the strategy have been pursued in thelluclear   Defence Affairs Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group,which provide a forum in which the role and control of nuclear weaponscan be freely discussed between those countries which themselvescontribute nuclear weapons and those which do not.      During 1969 N. A.T.O.successfully completed studies which led to the further development ofpolicy on the role of nuclear weapons in the overall strategy,political guidelines for the initial tactical use of nuclear weapons in the defence of the N.A.T.O.  area have been agreed and procedures for consultation on the possible use of nuclear weapons have beenrefined.     Both these achievements are the result of thorough and detailed work by N. A.T.O.  as a whole;    but in the framing of the guide-lines the United Kingdom and Germany played the leading part.2k.     We believe that N. A.T.O.  strategy as it has now been revisedoffers the best available security for the Alliance.      It dependscritically on maintaining conventional forces in Western Europe at a level which will give N.A.T.O. an alternative to a nuclear responseagainst anything but a major deliberate attack;    and which,  if anattack on this scale should occur, would allow time for negotiations to end the conflict and for consultations among the Allies about the initial use of nuclear weapons if negotiations should fail.      Atpresent the level of these conventional forces is just sufficient forthis purpose, though there is a need for improvements in quality andequipment.britain s Contribution25.     The United Kingdom is making a major contribution to the forcelevels which N.A.T.O. needs.     Virtually all our Navy is earmarked forassignment;    the British Army of the Rhine and Royal Air Force Germanyprovide a powerful contribution in central Europe;    and most of thecombat units based in the United Kingdom are also formally committedtoN.A.T.O.      Our Army Reserves   have been reorganised to provide a confidential /more
more effective   reinforcement for the regular units which we have committed to N.A.T.O.      Substantial increases in Britain&apos;s contributiontoN.A.T.O. following the invasion of Czechoslovakia were announced in last year&apos;s Statement on Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 3927).26,     Since then the Canadian Government has decided to reduce thelevel of its land and air forces in Europe.     As part of a N.A.T.O.study of remedial measures, a proposal was made that the UnitedKingdom should in the autumn of 1970 return to Germany 6 infantry brigade and the other units which had been withdrawn early in 1968 to save foreign exchange.     We are discussing with the Federal GermanGovernment ways in which the extra foreign exchange might be satis-factorily offset.     We have already agreed to provide a signals troopto replace the Canadian troop which is to be withdrawn in mid-1970.27.    As part of our continuing effort to improve the conventionalcapability of our forces, we are embarking on a programme of active and passive defence measures at our airfields in Germany to protectaircraft on the ground.     Royal Air Force Bloodhound air defencemissile squadrons and light anti-aircraft squadrons will be deployedto Germany in 1970 to improve airfield defence against low levelattack;   and we are planning an initial programme of aircraft shelters.We are also making arrangements to provide additional reinforcements from the United Kingdom to strengthen airfield defences in an emergency28,     Our sea,  land and air forces make a significant contribution tothe defence of the flanks of N.A.T.O.      The United Kingdom Mobile Forceconsisting of elements of the Army Strategic Command and Royal AirForce Support Command, provides a capability for rapid reinforcementfrom the United Kingdom.     The Army and the Royal Air Force contribute to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force which can be used on eitherflank.     In addition one Royal Marines Commando Group has a reinforce-ment role on the Korthern flank for which it is being equipped forwarfare in very cold climates.      In the Mediterranean, a naval
amphibious force formed part of our increased naval presence in 1969,which will be increased again this year.      H.M.  ships,  air forces and royal Marines Commando units have taken part in major N.A.T.O.exercises in the Mediterranean in the past year.SECURITY IN THE SEVENTIESThe Search for Disarmament29,     While the security of Europe will continue to depend on amilitary capability sufficient to deter the use of force as an instrument of policy, all means must be explored of bringing about a lasting peace which does not rest on the effort to maintain a balanceof power in a continuing arms race.30.     We look forward to the Seventies as an era of negotiation between the opposing alliances.     IT. A.T.O. Ministers at their meeting in Washington in April 1969 set in hand detailed studies of various issues for exploration and possible negotiation.      In Brussels inDecember 1969, Ministers took stock of this work and reaffirmed their willingness to engage in constructive East-West contacts through all appropriate channels.31.     N.A.T.O.  is continuing its study of the problems and. implications of mutual force reductions by the Alliance and the Warsaw Pact countries.The United Kingdom has given strong support to this work.      The main problem to be resolved is how to achieve significant force reductions on both sides without prejudicing- the degree of security which eachenjoys at present.     Adequate verification and. control of these reduc-tions would be essential.     Related measures also under study includeadvance notification of military movements and manoeuvres,  exchange ofobservers and techniques for inspection for verification systems.32.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to play a leading parthi N. A.T.O. &apos; s work on European security measures.      Progress in negotiations already initiated, such as Pour-Power consultations on/Berlin
Berlin and the Federal German G-overnrnent1 sproposals concerning its relations with Warsaw Pact countries,  could make improvements possibleover a wider field, in Europe.33,     The Government has welcomed the beginning of the talks betweenthe United States and the Soviet Union on the limitations of strategicarms.     Although the d.iscussions are bilateral, they are of fundamental importance for Western security as a whole and in common with our european Allies we shall continue to follow their progress with close attention.3k-     In the international disarmament negotiations, the UnitedKingdom has put forward in the Conference of the Committee on disarmament in Geneva a draft Convention for the prohibition ofbiological methods of warfare.      During the course of 1969, the UnitedKingdom played a constructive role in the substantial advance made inthis Committee towards agreement on an international treaty to preventnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction being placed onthe seabed beyond a twelve mile coastal zone.35.     We welcome recent moves towards the entry into force of the Ion-Proliferation Treaty,  in particular the signature by the United Statesand the Soviet Union of their instruments of ratification and the signa-ture of the treaty by the Federal Republic of Germany.A European Defence Identity36.    The confidence of the European members in N.A.T.O.  rests on theirfaith in the commitment of the United States to the Alliance, whichPresident Nixon has reaffirmed.     An &quot;era of negotiation&quot; between theN.A.T. 0. and the Warsaw Pact countries would cast up many issues of vital importance to European security; and the European members ofN.A.T.O. have come to realise that they can contribute far more effectively-vely to these discussions if they can speak with a common voice.    More-over whether or not negotiations between East and West result In mutualforce reductions, the European members must recognise that someredistribution of the common.h.ur.d.en:W^DE^TM&apos;0pean defence is lively to-11- /taket Ns-a
take place in the 1970s.    TherecS^only^onM^^way in which the E\iropeanAllies can hear a fairer share without increasing their defence expendi-ture to an extent which none of them to uld regard as politicallyrealistic in present circumstances:    this is &quot;by co-operating more closely with one another.     The concentration of   our own defence effort onEurope and the se^s around us presents Britain with new opportunities totake the lead in this co-operation.37.     Following a British initiative, the European Defence ministers have held regular discussions throughout the year on the occasion of thenormal N.A.T.O. meetings;    they have exchanged views on major issues of alliance policy and,  in particular,  on how closer co-operation couldincrease the effectiveness of their forces.38.    The procurement of defence equipment is one essential field forco-operation.     All the countries in Europe capable oi&apos; producingadvanced weapons systems face development costs which are rising higherthan is justified by their national requirements.     Provided they canreach agreement on the requirement, the natural solution is for two ormore nations to share the research and development costs of the project and to benefit from the economies resulting from the longer combined production run.     The use of common equipment also opens the way to greater economies in logistic support.      It was,  above all,  these considerations v/hich led the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy todecide to co-operate in the multi-role combat aircraft project.     Thiskind of co-operation will be increasingly important as the cost of modern weapons rises.     The United Kingdom is also pursuing the aim of greater European arms collaboration through its participation in thework of the appropriate N.A.T.O.  agencies and in a number of bilateraland trilateral steering committees with European Allies.39s    The. key to greater progress in European defence co-operation iscloser collaboration between the European military staffs in developingand harmonising their tactical doctrJnes, since tactical doctrinesdetermine operational requirements and operational requirementsdetermine the scope for collaboration in the procurement/of
of defence equipment.   The United Kingdom has substantially developedits contacts with the European Allies to this end in regular bilateralstaff talks.   For the first time a number of officers and officials from other European countries will attend the 1970 course at theImperial Defence College - to be renamed the Royal College ofDefence Studies (see paragraph 65 below).kO.   A closer European defence identity within N.A.T.O., which waswelcomed by President Nixon at the meeting of N.A.T.O. Ministers in washington in April last year, will thus greatly strengthen themilitary security of Europe.    It will enable Europe to speak more effectively in the dialogue between East and West.    It will give an impetus to the developing political unity of Western Europe;    andit will help to maintain and extend Europe&apos;s capability in manyfields of advanced technology.    For all these reasons we hope thatPrance will find it possible to play a fuller part in this fruitfulprocess during the new decade.DEFENCE ORGANISATIONU10   As Britain brings to an end her major military role outside europe, the size and shape of her Armed Forces will be determinedprimarily by the needs of the North Atlantic Alliance.   Within the alliance, as the European defence identity develops, there shouldbe scope for greater co-operation among the European members notonly in producing military equipment but also in the organisationend deployment of military forces.   Meanwhile major changes in theorganisation of Britain&apos;s defence effort are taking place to meetthe change in Britain&apos;s role.Support Facilitiesk2.   Expenditure on the support of the Services, i.e. on theirlogistic, training and personnel functions and facilities, willbe reduced by up to 15 per cent over the next eight years or so.At the end of this time, the cost of support units and facilities/will
CONFIDENTIALwill be a lower proportion of the Defence Budget than the cost ofcombat units:    this will he the reverse of the position today.   Thistrend is due chiefly to the re-orientation of defence policy and,in particular&apos;, to the closure of barracks, hospitals, store depots,repair establishments and other support facilities overseas as our forces withdraw from Malaysia and Singapore and the Persian Gulf.Major measures of reduction and reorganisation have also been planned for the support facilities in this country.43.   In the United Kingdom there are well over half a million Service-men and civilian employees in more than 1,500 establishments and installations large and small, built by the Services over many years.Past changes in the tasks, the organisation and, above all, the size of the Services have been matched by measures to reorganise and inrecent years to reduce the size of support facilities.   For example,over the last five years the Royal Naval Supply and Transport service has given up over fifteen depots;   the Army has closed about fiftymajor and minor depots;   and the Royal Air Force has closed onemajor equipment supply depot and five other depots in MaintenanceCommand and four technical training schools0kk.   The Statement on Defence Estimates 1 969 announced the initialdecisions on support reductions which had followed the revision ofdefence policy.   It also included an account of measures taken tostreamline the command structure of all three Services in thiscountry.   The Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, was appointed in 1969as Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command with subordinate Area FlagOfficers at Plymouth, Chatham and Rosyth.   In November 1969 coastal command disbanded and its duties were taken over by No. 18 (Maritime)Group of Royal Air Force Strike Command.   The Headquarters of this group remain at Northwood, where they continue to work very closely with Headquarters, Western Fleet,A5.
0,   The Services have completed major reorganisations of training establishments.   /The Royal Navy will concentrate general navaltraining ashore at five existing centres over a period of years, withthe eventual closure of five training establishments^   The Army willhe reducing the number of infantry adult recruit training depotsfrom fifteen to nine.   With the decision to bring the Granwell cadetentry to an end in 1970 the Royal Air Force is planning to reorganisegeneral service, management and initial professional training ofofficers;    this will be centred on Granwell but will also make thebest use of existing training facilities elsewhere in the Royal AirForce.   The Royal Air Force basic flying training school at Syerstonhas been closed.k6.   Chiefly as a result of the ending of fixed-wing operational flying in the Fleet Air Arm, but partly of decisions (reported in Chapter III)to rationalise aircraft support functions between the Royal Navy andthe Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy has completed plans   to close theR.N. Store Depot and Air Workshops at Llangennech and to transferthere the task of the R.N. Store Depot at Coventry;   the R.N. StoreDepot at Perth will also be closed, but the Air Workshops there willbe retained.     The Army has carried forward its plans for there organisation of Royal Army Ordnance Corps support;    the centralstores sub-depots at Derby and Old Dalby and the central vehicledepots at Feltham and Irvine will be closed.kl.   In all these measures regional planning considerations were taken into account before a decision was reached, so as to minimise the economic and employment difficulties which will be felt in some areas.   They will result in eventual savings of over ii,000 militaryand civilian   posts and savings in running costs of over  7m. a year,in addition to the savings from measures announced in last year&apos;sStatements     The Services will continue to employ the most modern/management
CONFIDENTIALmanagement practices in order to ensure the most effective and economical use of all their facilities in this country.Headquarters Organisationk8.   Since the unified Ministry of Defence was created in 1964* the headquarters organisation has been regularly reviewed, and a seriesof changes has &quot;been made in order to produce greater efficiency and economy.   In 196h the Ministry was a comparatively loosely-knit federalorganisation in which the single-Service Departments had been brought under the direct control of the Secretary of State for Defence &quot;butretained their traditional structures and organisation more or lessintact.   Without weakening the management of the three Services an organisation has evolved which reflects the essential unity of defence policy and operations, provides for clear political direction, ensurescloser and more effective co-ordination between the Services andeliminates much duplication.k10.   Changes have been made of two kinds:    areas of work of theDepartment have been organised on a more unified basis;    and those parts of the Department which formulate policy and co-ordinate its execution have been strengthened.    In the first category are theabolition of the separate Ministers of State and Second permanent under-Secretaries of State for the three Services and the establish-ment in their place of two Ministers of State and two Second permanent under-Secretaries of State responsible for Administration (mainlypersonnel and logistics) and Equipment;    the creation of singleorganisations for civilian management, management services, contracts,accounts, statistics and finance;    and rationalisation, particularlyin the supply field, where one Service undertakes a task on behalf ofone or both of the others.   The second category includes the improve-ment of the Chiefs of Staff organisation &quot;by appointing a Deputy Chiefof the Defence Staff (Operational Requirements) to co-ordinate the/Services&apos;-16-CONFIDENTIAL
Services&apos; future requirements for weapons systems and two AssistantChiefs of the Defence Staff for Operations and Policy respectively;and the creation of the post of Chief Adviser Personnel and Logisticsto give stronger central direction to the work of the Principalpersonnel Officers and Principal Administrative Officers.   savings of higher posts in this period have included the abolition of the deputy Chiefs of Staff in the three Services.50.   The evolutionary changes towards a more streamlined and closely-integrated structure have produced a better and more effectivedepartmental organisation.   They have taken place during fundamentaland far-reaching reviews of the whole defence programme, and the factthat the Department    has stood these tests well confirms the valueof the changes.   But at a time when our forces are being significantly reduced and we are at a turning point in our defence policy, it is right that there should be a critical look at the headquartersorganisation needed for the future to ensure that it matches the new and less varied pattern of our defence responsibilities.51.   A committee has therefore been appointed under the chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of defence to look into these matters.   The committee includes two members from outside the Ministry of Defence as well as senior representatives ofall three Services.   It has been asked to examine critically all areas of activity in the Ministry of Defence to consider the extentto which the work still needs to be done;   whether it requires socomplex a structure of consultation;   whether it could with advantagehe devolved   or delegated elsewhere;   and whether changes in organisa-tion would aid efficiency.   It will draw on other valuable work whichis already in hand in various areas, such as the studies of thecommittee under the chairmanship of Sir John Mallabar into H.M, Dock-yards and the Royal Ordnance Factories, and by the Army Department/into
into the future command structure in the United Kingdom.52.   Such a fundamental study will take many months involving as itdoes the work of the whole Department and its major subordinateformations.   The committee has however already been able to make somespecific recommendations affecting the top structure of the Ministry.53s   The Government has already made it clear that the three services should continue as separate bodies.   The committee, while stronglyendorsing the need for firm central policy direction in determiningpriorities for the allocation of resources, agrees that much of theorganisation particularly at the executive levels must continue tobe shaped round the individual Services.5k.   The problem therefore is to strengthen the machinery for inter-Service decisions within the Ministry while preserving clear linesof leadership and executive control of the Royal Navy, Army and RoyalAir Force in their own single-Service spheres,55,   Some of the changes already recommended by the committee cannotbe implemented before their implications have been elaborated in more detail, in relation to changes which may. prove desirable in theorganisation at other levels both inside the Ministry and in head-quarters elsewhere.56.   Two recommendations are however already being put into effect.The Chief of the Defence Staff is being given greater authority inhis own right, as distinct from his position as the Chairman of theChiefs of Staff Committee.   The three single-Service Chiefs&apos;of staff will continue to play a full part in determining policy and willremain the effective heads of their separate Services.   The ChiefAdviser Personnel and Logistics is being made responsible to theChief of the Defence Staff, the senior military adviser to the Secretaryof State, and is being empowered to initiate and co-ordinate studiesand other action on matters affecting all three Services.   In future/he will
he will be called the Chief of Personnel and Logistics.   This decision will in no way cut across the need for each Service to co-ordinateand administer the many personnel and logistics  matters which are of concern to it alone,57.   Parallel with the work of the committee, the ministerial structure of the Department has been under review in the light of experienceover the three years since the last changes at this level were made.It has been decided that the two functional Ministers of State for administration and Equipment should be replaced by a single seniorMinister of State who would be called the Minister of Defence for the armed Forces and would be the focal point for resolving issuesconcerning personnel, logistics and equipment, whether affectingone Service or all three,58.   The role of the three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of Statewho have single-Service responsibilities has also been considered.While the long tradition under which there has been a Ministerassociated specifically with each Service has been borne in mind, ithas been concluded that decisions would be reached with greater speed and efficiency if these Ministers were replaced by one or moreParliamentary Secretaries with responsibilities covering all three services,59.   These changes at the ministerial level will be introducedtowards the end of the year when some of the consequential changesin administration have been decided, in the light of further work by the Headquarters Organisation Committee.MANPOWER60.   The strength of the Armed forces on 1 January 1970 was  &quot;      Jtcompared with 1+25,100 in October 1964.   In 1 974 the strength will bein the order of 350,000 or nearly one-fifth lower.61. The rate of re-engagement continues to be encouraging and providesevidence that the Service career is found, on experience, to be/attractiveC.99UFIDENTIAL
attractive and worthwhile.   But it is essential to maintain a steadyinfusion of new recruits.   In 1968-69 we obtained just under 29,000male other ranks.   On the trend so far over the last twelve months,there is a prospect that recruitment in 1969-70 will rise to about   135,000, but this would still be well short of our requirements.62.   The individual regular Serviceman deserves good terms andconditions of service.   As his skills increase and the national income rises, they should automatically improve.63.   In June 1969 the National Board for Prices and Incomes published a thorough review of the system of forces8 pay (Cmnd. L079).   TheGovernment accepted its recommendations in principle.   This will result in the establishment of a new pay structure and the introductionof an improved system for the review of forces&apos; pay.    Single men will no longer be paid less than married men for doing the same jobt   AllServicemen will be paid at comprehensive basic rates but they will pay fair charges for certain things which the Services have hithertohad to subsidise or provide free of charge, in particular accommoda-tion and food.   This principle has been described as the &quot;militarysalary&quot;, because it will be the true military counterpart of the salary and wage structure of all other walks of life.    It has alsohowever been recognised that the Serviceman&apos;s reward should take account of the special conditions of the military career that cannot he compensated for as they arise.   Job evaluation methods will enablenew pay scales to be developed, ensuring a square deal for theServiceman in relation to civilian earnings.6U.   As a result the Services as a whole will do better than theywould have done if we had retained the method suggested by the QriggCommittee by which their pay has been calculated in recent years.There will be an automatic review of pay not less frequently thanevery two years, with a more fundamental structural review every six years.   The National Board for Prices and Incomes is expected to/publish
publish Its third report on forces&apos; pay this month, setting out itsdetailed proposals for implementing the &quot;military salary&quot; concept.HIGHER DEFENCE TRAINING AND STUDIES65.   Major changes have been made, or will shortly be introduced, inthe composition, teaching methods and syllabus of the ImperialDefence College and the Joint Services Staff College.   At the I.D.C.,where the Hon. Alastair Buchan, C.B.E., is serving as Commandantfor 1970 and 1971, senior officers and officials study problems ofstrategy, international relations and major issues of defence policy.Students from other European countries are for the first time joiningthose from the Commonwealth and United States to make up a studentbody drawn from eighteen nations, and the course provides for study of European problems in greater depth than in the past.   The Collegewill be renamed the Royal College for Defence Studies in 1971*   Inthe same year the Joint Services Staff College will be renamed theNational Defence College,,   Its aim is to help in fitting officers whoare in the middle of their career for key posts in the direction ofdefence.66,   The Ministry of Defence continues to build on itB already closerelationships with the universities and other academic bodies,   sixuniversity posts of Defence Lecturer have been established:    the costs of the posts are borne on Defence Votes.     Six Defence Fellow-ships are awarded annually to provide opportunities for senior officersand officials to spend a year at a -university in study or research in thedefence field.    Study conferences are arranged from time to time bythe universities on behalf of the Ministry of Defence.   Seminars are also:held at the Ministry of Defence to which representatives of theacademic world are invited.67.   Public interest in defence problems is also fostered through the government&apos;s support of the Royal United Services Institution,   TheInstitution is now carrying out the re-organisation approved two years/ago

Our Armed Forces move into the 1970s more soundly balanced andwith a greater assurance of stability than they have enjoyed for/many
many years.   But their environment will remain full of change andchallenge.   British external policy looks to a developing Europe as its central theme for the Seventies and the forces will he deeplyinvolved in the process.   They will he concerned to maintain a formidable-able contribution to the prevention of war in Europe;   to integratethis contribution more and more closely with that of our european allies;   and to take a creative part in adjusting the North atlantic alliance to new circumstances in a changing world.   These tasks willgive them a positive role of critical importance in the developmentof Europe.   As a practical expression of the nation&apos;s commitment, theywill carry a direct responsibility for building the confidence and understanding between neighbours and allies which must be the founda-tion for closer European unity in policy and action.   This responsibilitywill increasingly engage the forces at every level and in every arm.The forces bring with them from the 1960s unmatched standards of skill and experience.   It will be their purpose in the 1970s not only to preserve these standards but to apply them with increasing effect tothe needs of an evolving Europe.

Troops of theRoyal Engineers have carried out a number of tasks including alarge agricultural development project in West Malaysia whichhas made rapid progress.     This project, which involves theconstruction of settlers&apos; huts, a community centre,  roads,  and bridges, the cost of which is partly paid by the Malaysian/Government,-7-C confidential
Government, not only contributes to the development of thecountry but provides excellent training for the troops.     a royal Engineer survey troop also carried out a partial re-survey of Singapore.19.     Photographic reconnaissance aircraft of the Royal AirForce have continued with their aerial survey tasks andShackletons have provided routine maritime surveillance.Hong Kong20.     The garrison has continued to assist the police to control the frontier and to maintain la?/ and order throughout the Colony.Battalions have taken their turn at watching likely troublespots and helping the Hong Kong Government counter subversionby patrolling remote areas and Islands.     Particular emphasishas been placed on assisting local communities.     The three services have undertaken minor constructional tasks in oversixty village communities and helped some forty youth clubs invarious ways.

On 19 March 1969,  as the result of a decision by her majesty&apos;s Government to restore legal government on the island,the tactical battalion headquarters and two companies of the2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, together with a detachment of Metropolitan Police, were flown out to Anguilla by aircraft of Air Support Command.      Troops, Royal Marines,  and sailorslanded from H.M. frigates Minerva and Rothesay and took controlof the airstrip, while helicopters dropped leaflets appealingfor co-operation from the islanders in restoring peace and stability.     Subsequently demonstrations were staged but these were contained without the troops having to use force.     On28 March 19&amp;9 seventy men of the Royal Engineers v/ere flown tothe island with their equipment to carry out projects to improve the living conditions of the islanders.     One company of therParachute Regiment was withdrawn at the same time.     Duringthe next six months the remaining company patrolled the islandhelping the detachment of Metropolitan Police to keep law andorder and maintain the confidence of the people.     As a resultconditions improved sufficiently to allow the remainingparachute troops to be withdrawn in September 196.9.     A forceof Royal Engineers has remained to complete aid projects which include the building of a school, construction of a jetty, and west INDIES-12/re-surfacing

They were supported by Wessexhelicopters of 72 Squadron Royal Air Force.Other Islands3h.      Patrols by frigates in the Bahamas were again carried out during the year to prevent the illegal use of small islands byintruders.     In addition to operations in Anguilla, the presenceof the frigates contributed to the maintenance of internal security throughout the area.      Exercises with local naviesagain took place.     An all weather airfield constructed by 53Field Squadron (Airfields) Royal Engineers on Beef Island in theBritish Virgin Islands v/as opened on 12 April 19&amp;9.      the airfield will contribute substantially to the local economy.The Royal Engineers are also engaged in an under water blastingexercise in Barbuda designed to give access to the site of a proposed new jetty.THE AMERICAS35.

The Fishery Protection Squadron continuedto patrol the 3,000 miles of United Kingdom fishing limits.Over a hundred arrests have new &quot;been made since the presentlimits were introduced in 196h,     The coastal minesweepers ofthis squadron are on occasion augmented by fast patrol boats and helicopters.      The introduction of the North East atlantic fisheries Commission Joint Enforcement Scheme will involve theRoyal Navy, together with thirteen other countries,  inadditional fishery protection activities on the high seas,hi.     Minehunters, naval and civilian diving teams, and civilianmanned recovery craft have continued to meet requests to locateand recover missiles and crashed aircraft from the seabed.L2.     /Army.      In April 1969 sabotage took place at publicutility installations in Northern Ireland.     As a consequence ofthese attacks troops were deployed to guard a considerablenumber of civil key points in rural areas.     To assist thepermanent garrison of Northern Ireland, which comprised a brigade headquarters, two infantry battalions, and elements of an armoured reconnaissance regiment,  it was necessary in lateMarch and April to reinforce it with an additional infantry battalion and a troop of Royal Engineers.1+3.      Inter-communal rioting took place in Belfast in earlyAugust, and serious disturbances occurred in Londonderry on the12 and 13 of August after the annual Apprentice Boys&apos; march on12 August.      In these disturbances clashes took place betweenProtestant and Roman Catholic elements of the population andalso between the civil police and the Roman Catholic inhabitants of the Bogside area of the city.     Following these, the Bogside-15^ /areaCONFIDENTIAL
area of the city was barricaded off by its inhabitants.     Thesituation had deteriorated on the afternoon of 1k August tothe extent that it was necessary for a battalion of infantry tobe deployed into the city to restore law and order.     the deployment of this battalion had the desired result of re-establishing peace in the city, but the Bogside area remainedbarricaded off from the rest of Londonderry.kk.     Serious rioting broke out in Belfast on the following day.In these riots there took place numerous clashes both between members of the two communities and between crowds and the police.A considerable number of houses were burnt in the central areaof Belfast.     As in Londonderry, two areas of the city whichwere inhabited almost entirely by Roman Catholics were barri-cacled for     These serious riots and disorders necessitated the calling out of troops in aid of the civil power in Belfast.k5o     The deployment of troops into the two cities of NorthernIreland and to a number of rural areas as a precautionarymeasure, placed a very considerable strain on the resources of theGeneral Officer CommaiidingyNorthern Ireland.      It was necessaryto reinforce the permanent garrison further both in August and again, after further disturbances, later in the year.     Thesereinforcement measures brought the garrison up to a total oftwo brigade headquarters, ten major units in the infantry role,an armoured reconnaissance regiment,  and one field squadronRoyal Engineers by 12 October 19&amp;9.k6.     On 19 August the Prime Minister of Northern Irelandvisited London and, following discussions with the UnitedKingdom Prime Minister, the G.O.C. Northern Ireland..was given full/responsibility
CCJjTmMTJALresponsibility for all security operations in northernIreland.     For this purpose he was given control of the deployment and tasking of the Royal Ulster Constabulary for security operations, and full control and command of the UlsterSpecial Constabulary.     This, together with the increased numberof troops in Northern Ireland made it possible for the U.S.C. nolonger to be used for riot and crowd control duties.     The G.O.C.immediately instituted a number of measures designed to restoreand maintain law and order in the cities and throughout theprovince.     Among these measures were the construction of atemporary fpeace line&apos; in Belfast to assure protection to the two communities,  and the institution of a vehicle control system in belfast aimed at ensuring that neither irresponsible individualsnor weapons were able to enter or leave the areas most affectedby the disturbances.     He also established a rigorous system ofmilitary patrolling.h7.     A period then ensure during which prolonged negotiationstook place designed to persuade those inhabitants who haderected barricades in the cities that these should now beremoved and the areas concerned permitted to return tonormality.     During this period further disturbances took place at various times and places and,  on a number of occasions,  itwas necessary, in order to restore law and order, for the troopsconcerned to use CS riot control agent.     The most seriousdisorders occurred over the weekend 11/12 October, shortly afterthe publication of the Report of the Advisory Committee on police in Northern Ireland under the chairmanship of Lord Hunt.The report recommended reorganisation of the R.U.C. and theL^jJ. /replacingCONFIDENTIAL
replacing of the U.S.C. in its local defence role by a local military force under the command of the G-.O.C. Northern Ireland.In these disturbances troops In the Shankill Road area of belfast came under direct gunfire and were forced to returnfire on a limited scale in order to restore law and order.This was the only instance in the disturbances in NorthernIreland in 1969 when troops were forced to open fire.I4.8,     Despite the disturbances outlined above, the patient and prolonged negotiations for the removal of barricades from the cities were eventually successful, and by late September mostof the barricades in both cities had been removed.      Subsequentlya start was made, through joint civil and Royal Military Policepatrols,  in the restoration of normal policing to these areas.Since the October disturbances in Belfast the situation inNorthern Ireland has remained relatively quiet, though a numberof incidents have taken place,  and it has been possible tomake some reductions in the reinforced garrison   and to limit   thenature of the G.O.C.*s overall direction-of the R.U.C. in thesecurity field to the coordination of its tasks.     nevertheless the persistent fears and suspicions still felt by many peopleof the two communities, and the tension which unfortunately still remains, make It necessary for us to continue to deploy consider-able forces in aid of the civil power in Northern Ireland.I4.9,     Throughout these most difficult and distasteful operations,under trying and arduous conditions,  our forces at all levels haveshown not only a very high degree of skill and profes.sionalismbut also great tolerance and patience.      By exhibiting thesequalities and by their complete impartiality servicemen have-18- /playedCONFIDENTIAL
played a major part in helping to restore order in the province/.50.     Royal Air Force     Lightning aircraft of Strike Commandhave continued to maintain a 2h hour watch over the UnitedKingdom air space to intercept and investigate unidentifiedaircraft that approach our shores.     They have been particularlyactive keeping a watch on Soviet aircraft flying in the area to the North of the British Isles and many interceptions havebeen made over the Norwegian and North Seas.51.      In conjunction with ships of the Royal Navy and otherN.A.T.O, maritime forces, long range maritime reconnaissancesquadrons.based in the United Kingdom have continued to patrolthe surrounding sea areas.     These forces have been involved inconsiderable activity during the year in maintaining a watch on both surface vessels and submarines.52.      In April Argosies, Hercules, and Britannias of Air SupportCommand transported the first reinforcing battalion to NorthernIreland.     These aircraft continued to maintain subsequentreinforcement and re-supply flights throughout the deployment.53.     Air Support Command continued regular scheduled services to bases abroad carrying Service personnel and their dependents,government passengers, and freight.     The YC10 in particularoperated on six days each week to the Far East,  including HongKongo       An indication of the total effort of ail aircraft onscheduled services is given by figures showing that passengermiles amounted to 60,133,000 and freight miles on short tons to5,02h,000 each month.      In addition, there were special flightsrotating and re-supplying military detachments overseas.Royal Air Force Regiment squadrons have been deployed to/Northern-1 9-
Northern Ireland to protect Royal Air Force establishments andto supplement Army units in the general security effort.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY5ho     From the details given above some impression will be gained of the wide variety of ways in which all three Services haveassisted civil communities in the overseas areas in which theyare currently der:loyed.     In all cases the tasks have providedexcellent training and have helped to foster good relationswith the local community.     We are continuing to explore withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of overseas Development ways in which the Services can assist in overseas development projects in the cause of acquiring thetraining they require in overseas environments.55-     H.M.  ships and naval helicopters continued to answer manycalls for assistance worldwide.      In July and August,  thePlymouth Command Clearance Diving Team was engaged in the difficult and hazardous task of removing and disposing of un-exploded 1,000 lh.bombs from a wreck off Jersey.     The organisa-tion for dealing with oil pollution at sea in the United Kingdomarea has now been agreed.      Such assistance as may be given bythe Services will be at the request of the Board of Trade or localauthority.     H.M. ships and aircraft of the Royal Navy and RoyalAir Force have continued to report incidents of oil pollution inthe normal course of their duties.55.     The Army continues to carry out many and varied tasks in aid of the civil community, particularly engineer tasks.     Forexample, they constructed a 275 ft. heavy girder bridge for theInvestiture of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales at Caernarvon,     The^20- /pamphletCONFIDENTIAL
pamphlet cMilitary Aid to the Civil Community&apos; has been circulated all over the country and, as a result, the kinds ofassistance which can be provided and the way in which it shouldbe requested are much more clearly understood.      In additionto assistance with routine tasks,  emergency aid was given in providing electricity to Whitby in Yorkshire and to isolatedfarms in the North West of England during the severe weather in March 1969.     A bridge which had been destroyed by floodwaters at Stoke by Nayland in Suffolk was replaced during thesame period and the new bridge was open to traffic within four days of Service assistance being requested.      In December 1969a bridge 537 ft. long was constructed for the Ministry ofTransport at King&apos;s Lynn to carry the Ah7 road over theGreat Ouse.     This was required to enable the permanent bridgeto be closed for urgent repairs.     Royal Engineer and royal army Ordnance Corps teams within the United Kingdom have continuedto deal with bomb disposals.     As a result of some 500 investiga-tions during the year, about 9000 explosive items requireddestruction or some disarming action.     In addition 2,250acres of land were cleared of explosive objects.57.     The Royal Air Force continued to provide aid to the civilcommunity, particularly in emegencies..      Helicopters, marinecraft, fixed-wing aircraft, and mountain rescue teams responded to emergency calls for search and rescue and medical assistance./&quot;      J servicemen and J civilians were rescued inincidents during the year.     /&quot;      J civilians were moved to hospital by helicopter.     Two Britannias of Air Support Command/carried
carried blankets and tents to Tunisia and Algeria when wide-spread flooding occurred in those countries.INVESTITURE OF H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES58,     All three Services had the honour to be involved in thepreparation for the Investiture of H.R.H. The prince of wales and took part in the ceremony.THE YEAR&apos;S EXERCISES59.     In 1969 British forces engaged in a large number ofexercises both at home and overseas.     Many of these were arrangeby N.A.T.O. and other treaty organisations.     The following is asummary of the more important ones:a*     3SaAsJLsJ1*     Nine maritime exercises;    two allied command Europe Mobile Force exercises;    two air defence exercises;    two command post exercises, anda United Kingdom Mobile Force exercise at brigadelevel.^&apos;      SMSl0.&apos;     A maritime exercise;    an air defenceexercise;   and a search rescue exercise.c*      S.E.A.T.O.

A contribution was made to nine N.A.T.O. maritimeexercises in the Atlantic, Western Approaches,  and Mediterranean.This included aircraft carrier support to both the supreme allied Commander, Europe and the Supreme Allied Commander,Atlantic, logistic support by ships of the Royal Fleet AuxiliaryService,and contributions by submarines and long range maritimereconnaissance aircraft.     V-aircraft of Strike Command flew intwo maritime exercises, and our amphibious force took part inone in the Southern Region. /61.-22-CCNFIBENTIAL
61.     British Array and Air Force units assigned to the allied command Europe Mobile Force participated in the exercises heldin Denmark and Greece.     The Army units also carried out winterwarfare training in Canada and Norway and our artillery batterytook part in the AMF annual gunnery practice in Belgium.62.     The 2k Infantry Brigade of 3 Division particupated in?Exercise Bold Adventure&apos;  in Jutland and Schleswig-Holsteinduring the period 21 February to 15 March,  1969.     The aim ofthis exercise was to train part of 3 Division and units of air support Command to deploy and operate in support of N.A.T.O.  inthe Baltic Approaches.63.     Squadrons from Royal Air Force Germany participated inmany allied exercises and exchanges.     During N.A.T.O. tacticalevaluation exercises our squadrons demonstrated their ability to perform their assigned missions.     Lightning aircraft ofNo. 92 Squadron together with aircraft of a Belgian Air Forcesquadron won the Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT) air defence Competition.      In the annual N.A.T.O. PhotographicCompetition and the annual AFCENT Air Weapons Meeting, crews from RoyalAir Force Germany crews distinguished themselves.     In the manyN.A.T.O. command post exercises during the year Royal Air ForceGermany played an important part.6h.     V-aircraft of Strike Command took part in seven N.A.T.O.land/air exercises,  and cur land, sea and air forces contributed to many of the other minor exercises arranged by N.A.T.O.CENTO EXERCISES65*     Locally based naval units,  including a frigate, a submarine and mine countermeasures forces, and. long range maritime/reconnai s s anc e

In preparation for the phasing out of the fleet carriersexercises involving the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have beenmounted to test the arrangements for the air defence of thefleet in the post carrier era.     Routine exercises were alsocarried out at the Joint Anti-Submarine School, Londonderry.In the autumn, a large scale national submarine exercise tookplace in the Eastern Atlantic and a major command post exercisewas arranged to evaluate the new Naval Home Command in whichseveral categories of naval reservists played an important role.68.     During the year army units have trained in at leasttwenty six overseas areas including Belgium, British Honduras,the Caribbean, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Ethiopia, Fiji, France,Germany, Gibraltar, Hong Kong,  Iceland, Italy, Malaysia, Malta,New Zealand, The Netherlands, Norway, the Persian Gulf, the solomon Islands, and the United States..     In addition toregular units, twelve major and sixty-seven minor units of theT. &amp; A.&quot;V,R. trained overseas this year and 500 individuals were attached to units overseas, /69o
COTODSyriAL69.     Air Support Command strategic and tactical aircraftconveyed and supported the personnel and equipment in the over-seas training exercises as well as providing air transport forexercises mounted from overseas &quot;bases.     These aircraft operated in diverse and often hazardous weather conditions.70.     Strike Command aircraft flew one reinforcement exerciseto Malta and two to Malaya and Singapore,  one of the latter bythe Westabout route.     On both occasions during their stay inthe Far East, part of the Vulcan force deployed to Darwin totake part in Australian air defence exercises.     The Victortanker force continued regular air-to-air refuelling exerciseswith Strike Command&apos;s Lightnings,  and deployments to ContinentalEurope, the Mediterranean,  the Gulf, and the Far East were carriedout.      In addition, Lightnings again flew non-stop across the atlantic to Washington and to Toronto.   For the first time, in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; air race a Harrier aircraft flew non-.step in both directions across the Atlantic with the support ofVictor tanker aircraft.     The squadrons of &quot;the Royal Air ForceRegiment based in the United Kingdom have taken part in air and ground defence exercises in Germany, Cyprus, and the Far East.These exercise deployments continued to demonstrate the ability of our forces to reinforce areas overseas quickly,71,     A wide range of exercises took place in the Near East and far East,     An air defence exercise took place using naval andair forces in the Mediterranean.

IIIMINISTRY OF DEFENCENUMBERS1.     The Statement on Defence Estimates 1 969 forecast a reductionof about 7.500 in the number of civilian employees of the Ministryof Defence In the financial year 1969-70.    It is now expected thatthis forecast will be substantially exceeded:    the total reductionduring the year is now likely to be /Tl,5007, (Z4,6007 UnitedKingdom employees and/6*,90CJ7 local entrants overseas).2.     During the next financial year the Estimates provide for afurther reduction of about ^9,500/ employees, (/h,50CJ7 United-Kingdom employees and /5,0007 local entrants overseas).   By 31 March1971 more than half the total reduction of 80,000 mentioned in the supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967 (Cmnd.3357) will therefore have been achieved.3.     The figure quoted in the previous paragraph includes a net reduction of /j)00/ in the number of non-industrial United Kingdom -based employees.   This net figure allows for the reclassificationas non-industrials of some  5007 employees at present classified as industrial.   These reclassifications do not increase the totalnumber of Ministry of Defence employees but alter the division with-in the total between non-industrial and industrial.    In order to achieve the net reduction of /500/ in non-industrial employees,there will therefore have been a reduction of some /T,0007 in thenumber of employees currently classified as non-industrial,CIVILIAN MANAGEMENT ORGANISATIONk.     The Civilian Management organisation, already unified under one Deputy Under Secretary of State, has continued to manage non-industrial staff in groups according to the Services for whom they/work
work, &quot;but plans for closer integration and management by groupsrelated to their &quot;specialist&quot; or &quot;administrative&quot; functions, as outlined in the Report of the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service(Cmnd.3638), are now well advanced.     Regrouping of the staff employed on civilian management duties will entail a considerablechange of accommodation which it is hoped to make in the second half of 1970.   Meanwhile, work is in hand to prepare for thecomputerisation of the personal records and other managementdocuments of all non-industrial staff;    this is a big task whichwill take some years to accomplish.   In all these -matters the staff side of the Ministry of Defence Whitley Council is being eloselyassociated at the formative stage.5.     The new Management Services organisation, which serves thewhole Ministry, has had a year of heavy work arising from currenttasks of rationalisation throughout the headquarters and the need to look ahead to the future.    Staff have been appointed to planfuture developments in computers generally in the defence field,and to forecast related requirements for the future recruitment,training   and deployment of programmers and systems analysts.   Workon the development of appropriate management information systemsfor the Ministry continues.   For example, a start has been made onthe design of an information system for managers of all non-indusrialstaff to link with the computerised personal records referred toabove:    also a study team is considering what is involved inintegrating and expanding existing financial information systemsfor the whole Ministry.   There has also been progress in the service departments:    the Navy and Air Force Departments continue to make progress with the development of co-ordinated systems, particularlyin the field of material management;    the Army Department has set/up a-28-
up a study team to determine the management information needs ofthe Army Board with a view to developing systems to meet them.   a standard Language Authority has been set up to foster standardterminology in support of the development of management informationsystems.    Special programmes to study the problems of introducingmanagement by objectives and office work measurement are beingcarried out, in both cases with the participation of management consultants.   The latter programme includes a pilot study in methodsimprovement and work measurement of typing services in the interestsof improving effectiveness in an area presenting continuing recruit-ment difficulties throughout the Civil Service.   The management services organisation is also participating in the majority of theother management consultancy studies described in Chapter VII, and developing close contacts with units which either give specialisedsupport to single Services or are part of a lino management structure.A Management Studies Centre has been set up to extend knowledge ofthe new managerial techniques which are increasingly being applied.NEW FORM OF DEFENCE ESTIMATES6.     On 23 July 1969 (HC hi 1)  the Select Committee on Procedureapproved with qualifications our proposals for a new form of defence estimates and related procedures; and they were approved, by the estimates committee on 23 October 1968 (HC kkk) and by the Public AccountsProcedure Committee on 25 November 1968 (HC 27).   Ministry ofDefence Estimates are now presented similarly to Civil Estimatesas Class XII of a comprehensive series of supply estimates.   Wehave accepted the recommendations of the Committee that separateVotes should be presented for the pay and allowances of each of the armed Forces, and that appendices to the Estimates should describe the composition and responsibilities of the three Service Boards/and the-29-
and the Defence Council.   A &quot;Vote on Account of Defence expenditure has been presented as the Committee recommended.7.     In Annex C the Estimates now presented are shown in the oldform to provide a comparison with last year&apos;s Estimates.   Thisalso meets the recommendation of the Committee that tables givinginformation on the Estimates on a single Service basis should bepublished;, although the Committee accepted that the old Votes didnot show accurately the cost of each Service.   The possibility of continuing to provide information on this basis has been examinedbut, owing to developments in the organisation of the Departmentswork referred to in Chapter I, it will not be practicable to continueto classify expenditure by the former Votes.RATIONALISATION8.     The measures initiated in 1 96U to rationalise on a single-manager basis the supply, maintenance, and repair functions ofthe Services are largely complete.    These measures involve one service exercising a function on behalf of all three Services.Important studies continue, as reported in the following paragraphs;and there is also considerable inter-Service work directed towardsthe evolution of uniform practices and procedures in the logisticfield.LOGISTICS9.     Aircraft Support.   Detailed planning continues in order toenable the Royal Air Force to take over responsibility for provision-ing, stock control, and stock-holding of naval air stores, and thisis planned to coincide with the end of fixed-wing operational flyingby the Fleet Air Arm.   /it has also been decided that the navy should become responsible for the repair of rotary-wing airframesfor all three Services and the Royal Air Force for the repair of/fixed-wing-30-
fixed-wing airframes for all three Services.   The repair of certainaircraft components will he centralised to make the maximum economicuse of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force facilitiesjJ710.   Food.   The evaluation of the trials of alternative methods of supplying food to the Services in the United Kingdom has takenlonger than expected.    It has been a complex task to assemble andanalyse all the detailed costing data, and the practical implications for the Services of alternative supply arrangements have had to be fully examined.    The evaluation report will be considered shortly.1&quot;! *   Hovercraft Support.    The overhaul of Service hovercraft and engines is now being undertaken by the Royal Naval Aircraft Yard,Fleetlands.   Responsibility for the spares support of SRN 6 craftwill remain with the Army Department.12.   Motor Transport.   The rationalisation of Service motor transportunder Army management has been extended to make the best use of theavailable Service repair resources.    This will not only save manpower,but also lead to a reduction in workshop requirements as a whole.Greater standardisation of equipment for handling materials has broughtabout a reduction in the range of fork-lift trucks In use.   Forexample the Army range has fallen from twenty five types to eight.Further reductions are being investigated, of other equipments of similar commercial pattern.13.   Water Transport.    The Royal Navy has now widened its existingresponsibilities to cover the design and procurement of all marinecraft of the Services, and the procurement and supply of spares,together with the major repair and refit of Army marine craft andthe Royal Air Forces Interim Recovery Vessels and Long Range RecoveryVessels.   The transfer of responsibility to the Navy Department forthe major repair and refit of the older Royal Air Force marine craft,/currently
currently carried out at R.A.F. Mountbatten,    is planned to &quot;becompleted by the end of 1970-71.   The rationalisation measures already implemented will result in savings of about  75.000 a year.1L.   Weapons.   The supply and base repair of small arms and weaponsup to UO mm. common to more than one Service are now the responsibilityof the Army,   Logistic support on the single manager principle, as planned by the Army for the Rapier guided weapon system, will beintroduced, where appropriate, for other new weapon systems andequipments.^5* General. Under the co-ordination of the Director-General ofSupply Co-ordination,there continues to be an extensive programmeof work to improve the management of the Services&apos; inventories of stores and equipment.16.   The reduction of variety, and thus of management costs, is achieved through the twin processes of codification and standardisation-tion.   Over the last four years., nearly   50%   of the items to beadded to the inventory v/ere found, through the process of codifica-tion, to be duplicates of existing items.   Of over   600,000   items in stock which have been codified in the same period   17%   were found to be duplicate items.   The setting of standards also makesan important contribution to the reduction of variety both in the range of supply items stocked and in the procurement of new items.Since 1966, when the centralised Directorate of Standardisation was set up, over   36,700     items have been classified as non-standard and will therefore eventually be eliminated from tho Services inventoriesIn addition, the Ministry of Defence, in accordance with theGovernment&apos;s policy in adopting the metric system in the UnitedKingdom, has been collaborating with industry in introducing metricstandards.   This is providing an opportunity to revise staff/requirements-32-
-33-requirements and materiel standards which have become out-of-date,to rationalise requirements for equipments, components, materiels,and spares with the aim of achieving the maximum possible reductionin variety and to ensure that standards meet the needs of today.17.   The United Kingdom was the host nation to the Fourth N.A.T.O.Symposium on Codification of Stores and Equipment.   The Symposium,which took place in Church House, Westminster between 15 and 19September 1969, was opened by the Minister of Defence for Administration,and it was attended by 1+50 delegates from home and abroad, represen-tatives of government departments and industry.   The Director ofthe Symposium was Air Commodore H.E. Barker, the Director of theDefence Codification Authority.    The Symposium took &quot;Codificationas an Aid to Materiel Management&quot; as its main theme.   N.A.T.O.Codification is international in character and application, and itwill facilitate co-operation on the increasing number of multilateralprojects in which we are engaged.18.   Studies are continuing on how best to develop logistic manage-ment on compatible lines.   They take account of the need to lay down guidelines for the long-term development of automatic data processing systems in the logistic field.   We are introducingstandardised terminology and a number of standard procedures.   Itmay be possible to improve the working of the single managerarrangements or to extend them as a part of the continuing drivetowards the better utilisation of the resources available to theServices.INSPECTION SERVICES19.   The Committee of Enquiry under the chairmanship of ColonelG.W. Raby, C.B.E., the setting up of which was announced in theStatement on Defence Estimates 1969,  has submitted its report.   The/report
-3k-report identifies the principles of quality assurance, to whichthe Ministries of Defence and Technology already largely subscribe,and makes a number of practical suggestions which will give addedimpetus to their implementation.   It is also the intention to setup a Defence Quality Assurance Board as recommended by the Committee.The further application of the principles will lead to economies:in the inspection services and in the system of supply of defence equipment, as well as to an improvement in the quality of individualproducts.20.   Further steps have already been taken to rationalise inspectionservices.    Inspection of textiles is now the sole responsibility ofthe Inspectorate of Stores and Clothing.   A Service ElectricalStandards Centre has been set up in the Ministry of Technology toprovide a central facility for establishing prime electricalstandards and for calibrating standards held by defence research and development establiahments and inspectorates.

Our ground forces in Central Europe continue to comprise theBritish Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) and an independent brigade inBerlin,   B.A.0.R, is organised as a corps of three divisions, each with two brigades, and corps troops including two artillery brigadesand an armoured reconnaissance force.   With the agreement of our allies, one brigade (less its armoured regiment), together with a heavy air defence regiment, is stationed in the United Kingdom, but/remains-35-
remains under the command of the 1st (British) Corps and an integral part of B.A.O.R.    Arrangements exist for this &quot;brigade to be movedback to Germany rapidly in a period of tension and for B.A.O.R.  tobe reinforced, whenever necessary, to double its peacetime strength,mainly by individuals and units from the reserves.    In addition,the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF) now has as its primary rolethe support of N.A.T.0.    The ground forces of UKMF are 3 division which comprises three airportable infantry brigades, a parachuteforce of a brigade headquarters, two parachute battalion groups,support units, and divisional troops, and to provide additionalengineer and logistic support for the division, elements of the ArmyStrategic Command Support Echelon.    They are supported by No. 38Group Royal Air Force.    22 Special Air Service Regiment also has a variety of roles in support of Allied Command Europe (ACE).   Wefurther contribute to the ACE Mobile Force (Land) which is a multi-national immediate reaction force with special tasks on the flanksof ACE.    The ground forces contribution to this force includes an infantry battalion group having a light battery,  an engineer troop,and an Army aviation flight, an airportable reconnaissance squadron,a logistic support battalion, and force headquarters elements.EQUIPMENT5.     Anti-Armour Capability.    The quality of our ground forces inEurope has been further improved by equipping two more armouredregiments with Chieftain tanks.    There are now seven Chieftainregiments in B.A.O.R., and there will be two more by the end ofthis year,   We have begun to supply armoured regiments with Swingfireanti-tank guided missiles on a special version of the standardarmoured, personnel carrier.

VRESERVE FORCES AND HOME DEFENCEROYAL NAVAL RESERVE forces.     There are nearly 12,000 officers and 20,000 ratings and other ranks in the naval reserve forces available on mobilisation.   Ofthese, the biggest part consists of Regular Reservists (ex-royal navy personnel) who have retired or left the Service and have noregular training liability,2,     The Volunteer Reserves (i.e. the Royal Naval Reserve, royal marine Reserve, and &quot;Women&apos;s Royal Naval Reserve) number some 3*300officers and 4,100 ratings and other ranks.3.     The majority of these volunteers from civilian life trainregularly in R.N.R. sea training centres, using eleven minesweepersentirely manned by them and based on these centres.   They take partin N.A.T.O. and national exercises, and provide about half thecountry^ N.A.T.O. minesweeping exercise effort in home waters.Last year, in addition to visits to British and continental ports the ships of the R.N.R. Squadron exercised together for a month offGibraltar.   The crews were changed after a fortnight by an airliftprovided by the Royal Air Force.   The R.N.R. also includes profes-sional seamen from the merchant navy and the fishing fleets.4.     In war the R.N.R. would man their minesweepers, provide the manpower to back up the ships of the Fleet, shore headquarters,communications centres, and the Naval Control of Shipping organisa-tion, and provide a nucleus of naval expertise within the ships ofthe merchant navy.ARMY RESERVE FORCES5.     The Army Reserves consist of two main elements:-a.     the Regular Army Reserves, which.consist of former/Regular-46-
Regular officers and men, and the Army general reserve, which consists of certain formerNational Servicemen;b.     the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (T. &amp; A.V.R.)and the Long Term Reserve which consists of men whohave completed service in the Regular Reserve and army Pensioners.6.     The Army Reserve Act of &quot;1969 prolonged the existence of theArmy General Reserve for a further and final period of five years ending on 30 June 197k.   A review of the availability of individualreinforcements showed that this Reserve was the only source ofabout 15,000 specialists and others needed to bring Regular and reserve units up to full strength in a general war emergency.   Theextension will allow time for the remaining categories of Reservesincluding the T. &amp; A.V.R. to be built up in replacement of the ArmyGeneral Reserve.7.     The disbandment of T. &amp; A.V.R.- Category III and the cessation of recruitment to the Special Army Volunteer Reserve has led tothe T, &amp; A.V.R. becoming a single force.   However, units whose members are liable to be called out when warlike operations are in preparation or progress are distinguished by the administrativetitle &quot;Group A&quot;, the small balance being &quot;Group B&quot;.8.     The strength of the T. &amp; A.V.R. on 31 October 1969 was 1+7,100.At the beginning of 1969   its strength, apart   from   the disbandedCategory III, was k1,k00.     The improvement was due, in part, to some3,h00 transfers from Category III and, in part, to a recruiting drivein the early months of 1969.9.     Ninety cadres, each of eight officers, N.C.0.S and men, havebeen formed, most of them bearing the titles of former T. &amp; A.V.R./Category III
Category III units.   Their functions were outlined In the statement on the Defence Estimates 19^9, Chapter V, paragraph 10.   Experienceduring the year has demonstrated their value in providing support and assistance for the units to which they are attached.10.   Nine additional infantry companies and four additional RoyalArtillery Latteries have been formed in the T. &amp; A.V.R.    Theserepresent part of the adjustments to the T. &amp; A.V.R. order of battleconsequent on the recent earmarking of additional regular forces for N.A.T.O.ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT11.   On 1 January the formation began of the Ulster Defence Regiment.The role and nature of this new force were described in a white paper, Formation of The Ulster Defence Regiment (Cmnd. hi 88) published in November 1969.12.   The Regiment will be a locally recruited,part-time force underthe command of the G.Q.C. Northern Ireland,   When it is called out for emergency service, its task will be to support the regular forces inNorthern Ireland in protecting the State against armed attack and sabotage.    It will fulfil its role by undertaking guard duties atkey points and installations, by carrying out patrols,  and by establishing check points and road blocks when required to do so.It is not the intention to employ it on crowd control or riot duties in cities.13.   It will consist of lightly armed companies, grouped intobattalions of different sizes whose areas will approximate to countyboundaries.   Enrolment, now in progress, is open to all male citizens of good character of the United Kingdom and Colonies, normallyresident in Northern Ireland, whatever their denomination.   the size of the Regiment will be determined in the light of experience/as the-L8-
as the build-up proceeds but will not ultimately exceed 6,000officers and men.1h.   The annual cost of the Regiment will be about  1m,ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES15,   The Royal Air Force Reserve Forces consist of the RegularReserve and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which provide apool for the reinforcement of regular units, and the Royal AuxiliaryAir Force, which consists of three Maritime Headquarters Units andwould in an emergency reinforce No. 18 (Maritime) Group&apos;s operational control organisation.   Certain officers and airmen are earmarked for special tasks in an emergency.   A small number of reservistsundergo training each year.16.   The Royal Air Force has decided that there is no longer a requirement to maintain the Emergency List of officers or Class Gof the Royal Air Force Reserve.   These reserves consisted of formerNational Servicemen.   As a result, the strength of the Royal AirForce Reserve is now approximately 11,700 officers and 22,200airmen.COST OF THE RESERVE FORCES17.   During 1970-71, the cost of the reserve forces is expected tobe: - Ma. Royal Naval Reserve ............... ( )b. Army Reserve...................... ( )c. Royal Air Force Reserve........... ( )TOTALHOME DEFENCE18.   Since civil defence was placed on a care and maintenance basis in January 1968, central and local government planning has continued
to the extent necessary to permit the level of civil defence preparations to he raised again should this prove necessary.Advice has been given by circular to local authorities about their civil defence planning responsibilities.   Central training courseson various aspects of civil defence have been provided at the civil defence Training Establishment at Easingwold near York.   The UnitedKingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation, which includes theRoyal Observer Corps, has continued training and exercises tomaintain its essential skills.   Police and fire service war plans have been re-cast in the light of current strategic assumptions.Total annual public expenditure on civil defence is expected toremain at between  7m and  8m.
viRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTGENERAL1 .     The estimate for total research and development expenditurein 1970-71 is       m.    This represents a reduction, at constant prices, of       m. on the estimate for 1969-70, and more thanachieves the cutback announced in the Supplementary Statement ofDefence Policy 19^7 (Cmnd. 3357) aimed at reducing the previouslyplanned expenditure for 1970-71 by about  30m.2.     There has been continued progress towards European co-operation in defence procurement.   The most important of our collaborativeventures is tho Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) in which we are co-operating with the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy.    TheMemorandum of Understanding on the project definition phase was signed in May 1969.    The RB 199 has been chosen as the engine forthe aircraft and a joint company has been formed between Rolls Royce,Mo toren und Turbinen Union, and Fiat for its development and produc-.tion.   Collaboration continues with France on the Jaguar strike-trainer, the Martel air-to-surface guided weapon, and the Gazelle(SA that), and WG 13 helicopters.    In addition,  the development ofa new towed gun in collaboration with the Federal Republic ofGermany, is continuing successfully.3.     The measures referred to in Chapter VI of last year&apos;s statement on the Defence Estimates for strengthening the machinery for examining end reviewing operational requirements, and for themanagement of defence development projects, have during the yearbeen complemented by the introdiiction of revised procedures in theDefence Research Committee.    These will enable the Committee to scrutinise the content, objectives, and balance of the research/programme
programme in greater detail than was possible under the earlierarrangements,  and will facilitate its task of ensuring that thework done is properly geared to defence needs within the resources available.I)..     The Select Committee on Science and Technology published itsreport on Defence Research last summer.    This contained a numberof far reaching recommendations on the conduct of defence research and development.   The Government&apos;s reply, giving a comprehensive statement of Government policy in this field, has been published as Cmnd. h236.PROGRAMMES 1970-715.

In view of the possibility that the third London Airport maybe built at Foulness or at another site which might interrupt thework of the Shoeburyness range, we are considering how the facili-ties at Shoeburyness could be re-provided if this should prove tobe necessary.   Discussions have been taking place with the local planning authority and other bodies representing local interests,about the possible development for this purpose of some 9,000acres of land and foreshore at Pembrey,  together with an extensionof the existing Proof and Experimental Establishment at Pendine byabout 1,900 acres.

In the Statement on Defence Estimates1969 we announced the forthcoming concentration of naval newentry training in H.M.S. Raleigh/H.M.S. Fisgard.2.       A major long term plan has new &quot;been drawn up for therearrangement of general naval training establishments in fourfurther centres devoted to;Weapon engineering training at H.M.S. Coilingwood;Marine engineering training at H.M.S. Sultan;Tactical/operations training at H.M.S. Dryad;Ship fighting and management training at H.M.S. Excellent3.       This arrangement should provide a more effective and more economical training system,  in particular by permitting closer  .co-ordination within each broad field of training and by makingthe most economical use of expensive equipment.     The plan willbe put into force gradually over a period of years.     We expect that ultimately it will produce an annual saving of  1m,  inrunning costs mainly through savings of some 250 naval and 200civilian posts.      The net capital costs will be  6.Am.A.

Discussions are taking place on thescope for widening such recognition to include advancementcourses completed by naval airmen, mechanics, mechanicians,artificers,  and supply ratings.     Recognition will take the formof existing City and Guilds certificates in cases where thesecorrespond with the naval standards.      In other cases, the institute will create new certificates with various levels ofattainment which correspond to levels recognised in establishedCity and Guilds courses.11.      Instructional Techniques.     Developments continue in thefield of instructional technology and the design of trainingsystems.     Emphasis is now being placed on the necessity for a preliminary objective analysis of the training requirement.This then leads to the design of a carefully structured trainingsystem and the selection of the most appropriate techniques of presentation.     Programmed instruction methods continue to be developed in training situations which require a high degree of quality control and self-help.     The issue of a programmed-6o- /]D00kCONFIDENTIAL

H.M.S. Collingwood is developing an entirelyindividually paced course for the training of Radio ElectricalMechanics, which is due to become operative in 1971* This isbelieved to be the first such large application of programmingmethods in this country, and considerable savings in trainingtime are expected.12.     Royal Marines,.     The training for long service Royal Marineofficers has been reviewed and it is now planned to have asingle entry each year.     After an initial year at the InfantryTraining Centre, Royal Marines, and a second year in an operationalCommando, the officers will attend third year courses atBritannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.     These arrangements will bring the academic training of Royal Marine young officersinto line with those for Royal Navy sub-lieutenants.     The firstentry to be trained on the new pattern joined in September 1969.The arrangements for training Royal Marines recruits have been revised to reduce initial training to six months,  and to concentrate recruits training at the Infantry Training Centre,Royal Marines.THE ARMY13.

The first course at thenew establishment at Warminster was held in June 1969 and was attended by 100 young officers including some from abroad.The course is of eight to ten weeks in duration and fourcourses are to be run annually.15.     Instructional Techniques.     The use by the Army of instruc-tional techniques, e.g. programmed learning, closed circuittelevision, audio visual aids and instructional methods is rapidly increasing.     Control and direction has new beencentralised by the establishment of an Army School ofInstructional Technology beside the Army School of Education atBeaconsfield.Adventurous Training.     Plans have now been completed for expansion of adventurous training.     There will be an increasein the adventurous aspects of normal training, further support-62-

Thenew term &quot;Adventurous Training&quot; is used as a more appropriateterm to embrace all the activities of this expanded scheme.It is intended that the expansion should be spread over thenext four years./of advanced weapons systems has increased the size and cost ofthe training task.     We are continuously looking for means ofmaking savings and increasing productivity.     Research intotraining methods continues and we are making increasing use ofjob analysis.     A close liaison has been established with thevarious Industrial Training Boards.18.     Technician and Apprentice Training.     In October 1969 thefirst Royal Air Force Technicians completed their period oftraining and entered productive service on the new air weapons and other advanced equipments which they have been trained tomaintain.     A new scheme to recruit apprentices to train asmechanics is under way and the first entrants began trainingin October 1969.     These apprentices are engaged initially untilage 2k:    their training takes one year.     Craft apprenticetraining continues in various skilled trades.19.     Flight Simulator Servicing Training.     Training programmeshave begun which are designed to provide the highly skilled men who will maintain the new generation of computer-basedROYAL AIR FORCE17.The continuing introduction-63-

The trainers are to be usedto support the conversion training of pilots, navigators,  andair electronics officers destined for the Harrier, Nimrod,Phantom, Buccaneer,  and Jaguar aircraft.      The total length of extra training required to provide a skilled tradesman in this field is about twelve months, but this cost will be more than offset by savings in the cost of &quot;live&quot; aircrew training.20.     Training for Multi-Role Combat Aircraft.     Although theM.R.C.A. project is still in its early stages discussions havealready been held with the other governments concerned.     we hope to achieve a high degree of standardisation,  and henceeconomy,  in the training equipment to be adopted.21.      Training foji^United States Government.     Following thestatement of intention by the United States Marine Corps topurchase twelve Harrier aircraft, arrangements are in hand to train their instructors and. key maintenance personnel ettraining schools in the United Kingdom.22.      Officer-Training - General.      Since September 1969 therehave been two main centres for initial general service trainingof Royal Air Force officers.      R..A.F. Henlow now undertakes the initial training of aircrew officers which was previously given at Church Fentcn,   and now forms an Officer Cadet Training Unitfor all branches,  including Women&apos;s Royal Air Force andPrincess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.     The RoyalAir Force College, Cranwell,  continues to provide cadettraining, for entrants to the General Duties branch (Aircrew),to the Engineer, Secretarial and Equipment branches and to theRoyal Air Force Regiment.     After October 1970 there will bec; /no-6k- &apos;CONFIDENTIAL

Ht theend of 1973 the Officer Cadet Training Unit will move fromHenlow to Cranwell which will then become the centre of general service training for all entrants to commissioned service.During 197k certain other officer training units will move toCranwell and Henlow.,  and thus permit the closure of R.A.F.Upwood.     This reorganisation is expected to produce manpowersavings of about /T 7 military and /&quot;        J civilianposts and an annual saving of about   J in running costs.23.      Staff and Management Training.      Staff training is given at the Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell and at the junior Command and Staff School at Ternhill,     Managementtraining has always been an element of staff training syllabuses,but it is specifically taught at the Management and Work StudySquadron, now at Upwood, where regular courses are given.     Weare also using outside management training courses whose contentis relevant to Service needs.     For example,  six Royal Air force officers will attend the one-year course in management at manchester University Institute of Science and Technology in1970/71.PLYING training royal NAVY2k.      The last fixed-wing pilots and observers to be trainedwill complete their training this year.     Helicopter trainingcontinues for new entrants and for some former fixed-wing navalpilots.

The School of Army Aviation accepts about 100 studentsannually for a flying training course of nine months duration.Students are trained initially on fixed-wing aircraft beforeconverting to helicopters.ROYAL AIR FORCE26.     The basic flying training school at Syerston was closedat the end of last year.      Basic pilot training is now carriedout at Cranwell, Deeming, and Lintcn-on-Ouse.27.      Simulators for the training of navigators and airelectronic operators will enter service this year.     These willenable a reduction to be made in the hours flown by aircrewduring training, with resulting economies.f28.      The operational conversion of aircrew on the new Harrier,Phantom,  and Nimrod aircraft, which began last year, continuessuccessfully and will build up as increasing numbers of these aircraft become available in front line squadrons.     Trainingof the first Royal Air Force crews for Buccaneer aircraft hasbeen undertaken by the Royal Navy,  and will continue in thecoming&apos; year.COST OF INITIAL,   SPECIALIST AND FLYING TRAINING29.

Paragraph /&quot;       J of Chapter I outlines the major measures taken in 1969-70 to reduce and reorganise support facilities inthe United Kingdom.     The following paragraphs describe them more fully and also summarise the further progress made in improving; management efficiency in the production,  repair and supply organisation.Mallabar Committee31.     The Government committee under the chairmanship ofSir John Mallabar has been examining whether the existing organisation and systems of control and accountability of large scale production establishments in the Ministries of Defence and technology offer impediments to the achievement of fullefficiency.     The Committee has been studying; the royal ordnance Factories and H.M. Dockyards at home.H.M. DOCKYARDS32.     During the year,  responsibility for H.M. Dockyards was transferred to the Minister of Defence for Equipment.
Mr. L.W. Norfolk, a highly qualified engineer with wide Indust-rial experience,  took up the appointment of Chief Executive,Royal Dockyards,  in September 1969.     The Department is alsostudying the long-term future management structure of theRoyal Dockyards with a view to obtaining the greater managerialfreedom necessary for such a large industrial concern.Labour Force33.     As part of the progressive reduction to be achieved bythe mid-1970s, a reduced work-force is planned for the homedockyards in 1970-71.     This is expected to be achieved bynormal wastage without any declaration of redundancy.     proposals have been put to the trade unions concerned for the negotiation of productivity agreement aimed at increasing efficiency,adjusting the balance of trades to match the changing natureof the task, and providing increased earnings for the workpeople.DockyardiFacilities3h.     The detailed planning of further measures of rationalisation-tion and modernisation is now well advanced.      This isparticularly aimed at a quicker turn round of ships.      It isintended to develop specialised refitting complexes in whichselected docks and berths vail be equipped in the way most efficient for particular classes of ships.     Following theequipping of Rosyth and Chatham for the refitting of nuclearsubmarines, good progress has been made in planning theLeancLer class frigate complex at DeyonpOrt, which is due for completion in 1974.     /JL similar complex for the refitting ofguided missile destroyers at Portsmouth is also being planned/&quot;./programme-68-
CpWIL^TTJALProgramme of Work35.     All the dockyards will continue to have a full load ofwork during the coming year.     The programme for Portsmouthincludes the long refits of two guided missile destroyers, twofrigates,  and a submarine,   and. the conversion of a destroyer,H.M.S. Matapan to a sonar trials ship,      Devonport will have thelong refits of H.M.S. Tiger, three frigates,  including the firstIkara conversion of the Leander class,  and three submarines.Chatham will start its first refit and refuelling of a nuclearsubmarine, H.M. S. Valiant,  and, will have three frigates in hand for long refit.     The first refit and refuelling of a Polarissubmarine, H.M.S. Resolution, will start at Rcsyth, where twofrigates will also be in hand, for long refit.R.N. AIR REPAIR AND SUPPLY ESTABLISHMENTS36.     /The end of fixed-wing operational flying in 1971/72, andthe rationalisation of air support described in paragraph /&quot;   Jof Chapter III, will reduce the Royal KavyTs requirement for support establishments in the United- Kingdom.     The R.N,Aircraft Yard at Fleetlands, Hamshire will carry out the air-frame and in-service engine repair of helicopters of all three services from about 1972-73.     The R.N. Air Workshop at Perthwill carry out the repair of mechanical components for helicopters-copters.     From 1973 there will be no requirement for the R.N.Store Depot at Perth and the R.N.  Store Depot and Workshop atLlangennech.     However, the task of the R.N. Store Depot atCoventry is to be transferred to Llangennech.     These measures will together produce an eventual saving of about 1300 civilianposts,  and a reduction in annual running costs of about  2m ^-69-Cj)confidential
CONF IDEM? IALROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES37.     The Royal Ordnance Factories continue to increase their output of equipments,  stores, and munitions for the Services andfor friendly governments.     Output in the current year is abovethe original expectation and now stands,  Including development and civil work, at  L6m. compared with  h3m* in 1968/69,,     the planned figure for 1970-71 is about  50m.     None of thesefigures includes the value, about  28m. in 1970-71,  of equipmentsand materials supplied to the factories for incorporation intheir products.38.     Although the value of planned output is about 15 per cent above that achieved in 1968-69 the labour force employed willhave increased by less than 2 per cent.     This reflects the continuing efforts made in the Royal Ordnance Factories to improveproductivity.     To sustain these efforts, factory staff respon-sible for such management techniques as production engineering and method study,  and those engaged in preparing the ground for incentive arrangements, have been strengthened and theirfields of responsibility widened.      The R.O.F.s&apos; ability tooffer value for money is one of the reaons why their contributionto overseas sales of defence equipment continues to rise.     In1970-71 almost a quarter of their output will be for overseascustomers;    this amounts to two and a half times the level of exports in 1967-68.39.     Each of the eleven factories has a particular role and a range of manufacturing facilities appropriate to the products for which it Is responsible.     The complexity of modern weaponsrequires a great diversity of facilities,  techniques, and-70- /services;CONFIDENTIAL
services.   For manor projects, factories work together toprovide an overall R.O.F. management and technical effortsuited to the project.     In addition to their defence develop-ment and production tasks,  the R. O.F.s undertake civil workwhen this will enable an essential defence capacity to he maintained against a potential future requirement.     For examplethey produce coinage blanks for the Royal Mint, mainly for thenew decimal currency.      In 1969-70 R.O.F. Radway Green, usingplant also employed in the manufacture of small arms ammunition,produced one thousand million coinage blanks,  and the sames cale of output is planned for 1970-71.l+O.    During 1970-71 an expansion of R. 0.F. Birtley will becompleted as will be the reorganisation and concentration of theRoyal Small Arms Factory at Enfield.      R.Q.F. Birtley is situated in a development area and has played a significant partin manufacture for export.     For all eleven active factories theprogramme of investing in modern plant and machine toolscontinues.     There are, for example,  already more than one hundred and thirty automatically controlled machine tools inthe R.0.F.S and the number will be increased in the coming year.R.A.0.C.  ORGANISATIONR.A.0.0. Organisation in the United Kingdomhi.&apos;    The re-organisation of R.A.O.C. support in the UnitedKingdom, including the establishment of regional depots andordnance support units, will be largely completed by 1 April 1970.h2.   A further study has been completed of the long-termrequirement for the central storage of equipment and vehicles.The R.A.O.C. central stores organisation in the United Kingdom/cons ists
consists at present of five establishments,  three depots atDie ester, Chilwell,  and Donnington,  and two sub-depots at Derbyand Old Dalby.      It has now been decided that the two sub-depotsshould close during 1971.    At Old Dalby the E.E.M.E. workshopswill remain,  and an ordnance sujoport unit is also planned to beestablished in part of the sub-depot there.    The R.A.O.C. vehicleorganisation in the United Kingdom consists at present of fiveCentral depots, at Ashchurch, Hilton, Ludgershall, Feltham, andIrvine.    It has been decided to close the depots at Peltham andIrvine,  in 1971 and 1972 respectively.    These four closures will result in an eventual saving of some 1,500 military and civilianposts and  2.5m. a year.L3.    A detailed study has established that it is possible toincrease by 20 per cent the range of stores and equipment acceptedby the R.A.0.C, from manufacturers in trade standards of packaging.Although this will involve,  on receipt in central ordnance depots,the provision of some additional protection to meet military storage and issue requirements,  it is expected that there will be a finan-cial saving of up to  1m.  in the financial year 1970-71.R.A. O.C.  Support in B.A.O.R.l+L,    The R.A.O.C.  support in B.A.O.R.  is beingcre-organised and strengthened as a result of the completion of two new depots east of the river Rhine,  one for stores at Dulmen,   and one for vehiclesat Recklinghausen, which have been built and paid for by theFederal German Government.    Both depots have been specially builtfor the stores and vehicles they will hold, and the more efficientstorage arrangements will yield useful savings.      The new depotswill be well placed in relation to the units and formations whichthey will serve.    They will both be in full operation by the endof the year.     Hew depots for ammunition and petroleum,  also to be located East of the Rhine, are now being planned.-72- /MANAGEMENTCONFIDENTIAL
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUESValue Engineering45.   Value engineering and value analysis techniques are alreadyapplied in the Ministry of Defence.   /Ji firm of management consul-tants is currently engaged on a study in depth to establish the best way of organising and extending the application of these techniques/^project Control46.    Project management arrangements continue to be improved where possible, particularly with a view to the rapid reporting of techni-cal or financial difficulties.47,    In the Navy Department these arrangements are used Loth in the dockyards and in the departments concerned with new production.    Inthe case of the Mk.24 and Mk.31 torpedoes a project type organisation has been set up on the same pattern as was suecessfully adopted forthe Polaris programme.    Ship projects are subjected to the additionalscrutiny of high-level watch committees and new techniques are being applied in various areas.     These include in the dockyards new controlsystems    linked to time PERT networks, using two types of informa-tion feed-back devices for reporting progress and points requiringspecific management attention.    One system based on Kimball pre-punched tags, widely used in industry for inventory control, will beemployed on the first Polaris submarine refit at Rosyth.   The other,using Autelector as the input medium, is being used and developed invarious refits.48.   During the year the Army Department have appointed two more pro-ject managers, and the project manager for the towed medium gun (FH 70)will extend his responsibility to cover the self-propelled version ofthe gun.   A study by an outside consultant into the appropriate formof training for personnel engaged in project management is in hand.Budgetary Control49.   All production in the Royal Ordnance Factories, whether for defence or civil customers, is now undertaken at fixed prices,following the success of the scheme extended experimentally to     / ,,
-7k-all factories on 1 April 1967.   The scheme gives an effectiveincentive to factory management to control costs as well as givingcustomers firm information about their financial commitments.   ThePublic Accounts Committee have welcomed these developments.50.   In H.M. Dockyards the Chief Executive is studying the introduc-tion of management accounting systems which will assist in assess-ing and maintaining standards of efficiency, and thereby contribute to the solution of a basic managerial problem in this non-profit-making service industry.   These systems are likely to bring the concept of some kind of commercial costing policy into the dock-yards and to bring about improvements in management accountability.The introduction of management accounting systems, using budgetarycontrol and standard costing techniques, is xoroceeding in the large army logistic installations in the United. Kingdom.    Six R.A.O.C.depots and sic R.E.M.E. workshops are now using these systems;    and work is in hand to introduce them to other establishments, including two more workshops and a major R.A.O.C. depot in B.A.O.R.Sufficient experience has been gained to allow the procedures usedto be rationalised and it is hoped that this will enable the newsystems to be introduced more rapidly.   The information generatedby the systemsis facilitating management control.Productivity Measures51.   In the Royal Ordnance Factories, besides the capital invest-ment programme, incentive schemes directed towards increased manpowerproductivity are being introduced.   A scheme devised by management consultants for maintenance workers in seven engineering factoriesis fully operative in two of them and is being introduced in theremaining five.   Other productivity agreements are being negotiatedin various other factories.   The computer at R.O.F. Blackburn also
aids productivity.   It is a pioneer scheme in Government industrial establishments, being used for production control and associatedtasks.    It is playing an increasing role in the activities of R.O.F.Blackburn and other factories, and will be used, among other things,to provide information for the management control of importantprojects o52.   Interim productivity agreements have been negotiated at fourR.A.O.C. depots and two sub-depots in the United Kingdom.   It ishoped to use the new management accounting systems in negotiatingfurther productivity agreements at other major installations.   the productivity agreement introduced into 38 Central Workshops Chilwellis now well into the second of its four phases.   The productiontarget set in Phase 1 was exceeded, and that for Phase 2 has alreadybeen achieved.   R.E.M.E. are in the process of negotiating furtherproductivity agreements at several more static workshops.   Anenabling agreement has been concluded for the Clyde Submarine Baseas a whole and in the R,N. Supply and Transport Service /seven/productivity agreements have been concluded;    others are being negotiated.Computers for Management53.   It is planned to extend the use of computers, which are nowused to control supplies of stores and spare gear to the Fleet, inorder to rationalise systems and improve centralised control.   Thisshould be implemented in the early 1970s.   The possibility of achieving greater concentration of naval supply computer capacity in the late 1970s is also being considered.   The Royal Navy&apos;present manual systems of pajr and records are to be changed to a computer-based system centred at the new Naval Pay, Drafting, and records Establishment, Gosport.   The computer will also be used to/provide-75-
conditions.   The system   will employ advanced computer techniquesto select proper statistical samples, to provide accurate analysis,and to record performance,provide information needed by the drafting organisations for royal naval and W.R.N.S. ratings and Royal Marines other ranks;   but everycare will be taken to ensure that this does not involve any loss in the personal touch in drafting and that the present standard ofservice to &quot;the individual is maintained or improved.   These draftingorganisations will move to the new establishment at G-osport begin-ning in 1970.5k.   The first of the new computer configurations for stores control(a contract for which was referred to in the 1969 Statement) isbeing Installed and will be brought into operation in stages betweenAugust 1970 and November 1971.   The second configuration is due tobe delivered in 1971-72 and these new facilities will eventuallymake possible a far reaching re-organisation of the control of theentire R.A0O.C. inventory.   The depots at Chilwell, Donnington, andBicester will all be involved, as well as other R.A. O.C. establishments,.ibut decisions about the division of work-load between them have notyet been finally taken.   Further studies are being made of usingautomatic data processing systems for the control of stocks in B.A. O.R. and within 1 (BR) Corps,55,   The Introduction of these computer facilities wiHalso enable ma^oradvances to be made in checking the reliability and analysing the performance of ammunition in service.   From 1971, the assessment of ammunition serviceability will no longer be by the visual inspec-tion of components:    instead, selected rounds will be proof-firedunder carefully controlled operational, climatic, and environmental
56.    In the past the control of the Array&apos;s 30,000 vehicles in theUnited Kingdom has been conducted by clerical methods.   A system has recently been introduced to improve control by providing up-to-date management and statistical control data by means of computerprintouts.   The new system started early in 1970.57.   The Royal Air Force Supply Control Centre, Hendon has now taken over control of more than three quarters of the stores inthe Royal Air Force Inventory and the benefits continue to increase as techniques of automatic data processing are developed.   Computersat the Equipment Supply Depots in Royal Air Force MaintenanceCommand are now fully operational.    They provide immediate access to information on the storage and supply task, and, have taken overmany routine supply processes.   The computer at the Supply ControlCentre will need to be replaced within a few years and this will involve a further streamlining of the supply system.Management Consultants58,   Management consultants are currently employed in a number ofstudies within the Ministry of Defence in association with theManagement Services Organisation.   Particular care is being takento ensure that these studies are directed to clearly definedobjectives within specific terms of reference, and that, where appropriate, they include the training of Ministry of Defence staffin particular techniques.59.   Current studies includes-a, the installation of management by objectives inthe naval training establishment at H.M.S,Collingwood;b, examination in depth of the problem of working out the optimum stockholdings required ashore
CpjglDENTIALand afloat for the support of the Fleet duringthe 1970s;c. a pilot scheme for introducing work measurement,incentive schemes and new management controls inRoyal Air Force Maintenance Command;d. examination of the organisation for planning and controlling the production of ammunition;e. preparation of a programme plan for the longrefits of H.M. ships from initial planning to completion of refit.60,   The installation of management by objectives in the royal naval Stores Depot, Copenacre, has been completed and the benefits are now being evaluated.    Initial savings of  36,000 per annum havealready been realised.   The installation of this style of manage-ment is being extended to other parts of the Royal Naval Supply andTransport Service.   The efficiency audit at the Royal OrdnanceFactory, Birtley, has been concluded with satisfactory results andits lessons are being applied elsewhere in the R.O.F. organisation.COST OF PRODUCTION, REPAIR, AND SUPPLY ORGANISATION61.   The overhead costs in 1970-71 of the production, repair, and supply organisation, in terms of money and manpower, in the UnitedKingdom are expected to be about f      JJ.

During 1970-71 the total number of single air journeysis expected to be about kOk,000 of which about 75 per cent, in termsof passenger-miles, will be undertaken by Air Support Command.   Themajority of the passengers carried by Air Support Command will beorouted through R.A.F. Brize Norton or R.A.F. Lyneham,   The adminis-trative trooping service operated by Air Support Command is expectedto carry at least two thirds of the personnel withdrawn from theFar East and Persian Gulf during 1970-71.6k,   A Services Booking Centre is to be established later this year under the functional control of the Air Force Department.   It willcombine the booking staffs of the three Services and provide one central passenger booking agency for all administrative trooping/from the

The use of International StandardsOrganisation containers for consignments to Germany is expected to save  180,000 per year.   High priority cargo of all three services will continue to he carried by Air Support Command, augmented as necessary by the use of civil airlines.   Control over the movementof air freight from the United.

This organisation is responsible for the efficient use of airlift capacity for cargoand is expected to deal with 80,000 applications for airlift in1 970-71 .66.   A study is in hand for a joint Services system of freightmovement within the United Kingdom and between the United Kingdomand the Continent,   The aim is to devise, in the light of theTransport Act, 1968, and in conjunction with the Railways Boardand the National Freight Corporation, a new system which will makethe best possible use of all transport facilities.67. Unaccompanied Baggage. The Royal Naval Store Depot, Deptford, now operates a unified system for handling all the unaccompaniedbaggage of Service personnel and their families leaving and return-ing to the United Kingdom,68.   During 1970-71 the total cost of movements in the three services, excluding the cost of those movements by air covered in chapter IV, paragraph /    m/, will be about  &quot; of which someCOST OF MOVEMENTS

The first Skynet satellite was launched in November 1969 bythe United States, using a Thor Delta rocket, and has been positionedin correct orbit.   Proving trials are about to begin and oursatellite communications system is expected to become operationalduring the third quarter of this year.COST OP COMMUNICATIONS70.   The cost of communications networks in the United Kingdom for1970-71 is estimated to be about  &quot;      JJ%   All other expenditureon communications in the three Services is attributed to the costs of the combat forces.   &apos;METEOROLOGY71,   Approval has been given for the Meteorological Office topurchase an IBM 360/195 computer, one of the fastest and most powerful computers in the world.   It is due to be installed atBracknell in 1971 and will enable the Meteorological Office to exploit operationally in day-to-day forecasting the substantialadvances which have been made in recent years, and which areconfidently expected to lead to weather forecasts of greaterreliability and range.    It will also keep the Meteorological office in the forefront of research into the evolution of weather systems of all kinds.   Careful planning and systems analysis are requiredin order to take full advantage of the greatly increased computercapacity which will become available,72, Modernisation and automation of the meteorological tele-communications centre, now in progress at Bracknell, includes provision for three Myriad computers to enable the centre to/provide-81-
provide the high speed communications needed for national purposes and for the fulfilment of the responsibilities of the United kingdom as a Regional Meteorological Centre and Regional Tele-communicationsHuh under the World Weather Watch plan.73.   Following the successful development of a much improved radio-sonde system for upper air observation, preparations are now beingmade for its introduction into operational service.   Plans includethe use of small computers on ground stations for processing the observations received.74.   The Meteorological Office has assisted the Board of Trade by providing meteorologists for the support ship for British trawlerspatrolling the seas north of Iceland during the winter.   A specialweather forecasting service v/as arranged for the Concorde provingflights at R.A.F. Fairford.   Dissemination of warnings of adverse weather by radio and television has been improved.    If snow warningsare in force, they are broadcast as a routine at a fixed time on.B.C. Radio 2.   There has been an encouraging improvement in the accuracy of 30-day weather forecasts, and significant relationships between sea temperatures in the Atlantic and subsequent weather havebeen established.75.   Satellites are expected to play an increasing part in meteorolo-psychological  observation for World Weather Watch purposes, and thought hasbeen given to how the United Kingdom might best take a share inthis development.   As part of the national space programme, aBritish meteorological satellite has been the subject of a feasi-bility study and is now in the project definition phase.   Othercontributions to World Weather Watch include plans for the estab-lishment of a joint Anglo-French upper air station in the new hebrides Condominium and for two other upper air stations in the/Gilbert-82-

In order to relieve overcrowding and to provide for expandingcommitments, including the new computer and the automated tele-communications centre, plans have been prepared for the extensionof the Meteorological Office building at Bracknell and for a newtechnical building at the experimental site nearby.   Plans havealso been drawn up for conversion and new building at ShinfieldPark near Reading to enable the Meteorological Office training school to move from its present accommodation at Stanmore,COST OF METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES77.    The net cost of meteorological services to the defence budget is estimated at  &quot;        /,    This includes:    first, the cost of operational services directly provided for defence purposes, mainlyat Royal Air Force stations, at home and overseas;    secondly, thecost of meteorological research;    and thirdly,  the net cost of services for the general public and for other civil purposes,including World Weather Watch, after recoveries have been made from certain users, including primarily the Board of Trade in respectof civil aviation.cLANDS78.    It is essential to the operational efficiency of the Army inthe United Kingdom that it should maintain a high standard of train-ing.   There must therefore be adequate land available in the UnitedKingdom for training purposes.    Modern tactics,  weapons, and equip-ment require an increasing amount of space for training.   new weapons in the future, requiring more range space, may well increasethe total need for land.
79.   Accordingly it has not been possible to meet a request by the countryside Commission and the Dartmoor National Park Committee that steps should be taken to terminate military training on Dartmoorby the end of 1975.   Agreement has been reached with the Duchy of cornwall, the principal landowners, that the licences from themthat expire in 1970 will be renewed for a further seven years onthe understanding that a comprehensive review will be started in1975 to establish whether, as we now think, a further extension ofthe licences beyond 1977 will be necessary.    It is hoped to makesimilar arrangements with other owners,WORKS SERVICES80.   It is estimated that in 1970-71 some  66m. will be spent bythe Ministry of Ptiblic Building and Works on new works for thethree Services, and a further  8hm. on the maintenance of the wide variety of technical and other accommodation, special facilities,and installations which make up the extensive estate of the Servicesthroughout the world.   These figures are of the same order&quot; asthose for 1969-70.   Apart from the construction and modernisation of living accommodation referred to in Chapter IX, the programmeof major new works includes the provision of new and betterfacilities in the home dockyards, the extension of the guidedC&quot;weapon range in the Hebrides., and the continued provision of specialworks services for the Royal Air Force to meet their requirements;e.g. for a large flight simulator programme and extensive pavementworks for the introduction of Phantom, Buccaneer, Harrier, andNimrod aircraft.SURVEY81. The Survey units of all three Services are continuously occupied in meeting the increased demands for surveys of very high accuracy/occasioned-8A-
CONFIDENT I AX,occasioned by modern technological developments.   At sea, thegrowth of deep-draught merchant vessels calls for more extensiveand more refined surveys on the continental shelves, while inoceanic areas deep-diving submarines require multi-purpose surveysto provide detailed information on the physical characteristics oftheir environment.    Satellite and inertial navigation systems add to the demand for precise geodetic and gravitational data, while on land new tactical concepts and associated weapon systems call for field surveys of high accuracy.   In the air, emphasis on lowflying makes extensive surveys of man-made obstructions necessary.82.   The Hydrographer of the Navy continues to employ thirteenvessels on hydrographic and oceanographic surveys, and. to producecomprehensive marine charts for which demand is growing.    MilitarySurvey units at home and overseas have continued to provide maps,aeronautical charts, and geodetic data needed by the three Servicesand to co-operate with our Allies in mapping and survey work.    two british teams are taking part in the United States GeodeticSatellite Programme.    The aerial surveys carried out by the RoyalAir Force have improved the maps in various parts of the world.Close co-operation is maintained with civil aviation and with various scientific bodies and mapping organisations.SALES83.   On 1 October 1 969 Mr Lester Suffield took over the post ofHead of Defence Sales from Sir Raymond Brown, 0.BoEo, who had heldit since it was created in May 1966.

The increasing trend of sales of defence equipment which has&quot;been reflected in preceding Statements continues and in the year1970-71  the total value of defence exports is expected to reach 200m. of which the Ministry of Defence share is estimated to &quot;beabout  69m.   Details of sales of defence equipment are confidential and any proposal to export defence equipment is carefully considered in the light of the strategic, political, economic, and securityaspects, to ensure that it conforms with Government policy.   As thefigures indicate, exports of defence equipment, which include thewhole range of aircraft, aero-engines, electronics, communicationsequipment etc. as well as more traditional items, make a significant contribution to our balance of payments.SUMMARY OF OTHER SUPPORT COSTS and miscellaneous EXPENDITURE85.    The total cost in 1970-71  of support functions other thantraining, production, and repair, and war and contingency stocks in the United Kingdom,  in terms of money and manpower, is estimated to be  &quot;      J.

The costs of other miscellaneous items of expenditure in all departments which, by their very nature, do not fit easily intocategories nor are readily or accurately foreseeable, are coveredby a separate programme;    they include, for example, compensation payments.   These costs are offset by receipts, the largest part ofwhich is for those sales of defence equipment, the credit for whichhas not been attributed to other programmes.   As a result, thefigure for the programme as a whole amounts to /        ^7 net income to the defence budget.87.   A programme covering special materials amounts to about  &quot;   Jof this sum, about  &quot;      J per cent represents the payments made from the defence budget to the Atomic Energy Authority for supplies and services related to special materials.   The remaining  per cent is the seventh of eight payments to be made to the atomic energy Authority to cover outstanding liabilities in respect of thecapital cost of plant being maintained as reserve capacity, andfor certain terminal expenses.

Cadets now enteringCranwell are being given the opportunity of doing a special one-year course there, with the object of then transferring to degreecourses at university or civilian colleges.   The Royal Air ForceCollege Cranwell continues for the time being to provide training for the Royal Air Force cadets for the General Duties (Aircrew),Engineer, Equipment, and Secretarial branches, and for the RoyalAir Force Regiment.   Following the introduction of the graduateentry scheme at the end of 1968, the last engineer cadet entry tothe College entered in October 1969, and the last cadet entry forthe other branches will be in October 1970.   Thereafter Cranwellwill become the centre for general service training for all entrants to commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and also the centre forinitial specialist training for most officers.1k.   During 1969, 185 university cadetships were awarded includingk8 to Cranwell cadets who transferred to universities after one year at the College - an increase of 106 on the previous yearTs achieve-ment.   Whilst the number of cadetships awarded for the General Dutiesbranch was satisfactory, it was not so in the Engineer1 and the othermain ground branches.   At the end of 1969, there were 266 cadetsin residence at the universities compared with a maximum of 137 in1968.

During          jmale adults were enlisted into the Army, of whom           j or        ^/per cent were young solders aged 17 to 17i years.   Part of this improvement reflects the attraction of the short 3-year engagement,the scope of which was extended on 1 April last year.            m/ percent of male adults and young soldiers were enlisted on this engage-ment.   Recruiting of junior soldiers (ages 15 to 16) increased fromc 3 to r j.18.   The pilot schemes for centralized selection of adult and juniorrecruits which were started in 1968 continue to be encouraging, andwe are now studying ways in which we might extend this method of selection,19.

Following the acceptance of the recommendations of theSecond Report by the National Board for Prices and Incomes onthe. pay of the Armed Forces, the entitlement to marriedaccommodation has been extended to all married servicemenregardless of age.     The consequent extra demand is being met in the immediate future by additional hirings.     A statisticalstudy is being carried out in order to determine the effect ofthis decision and of current marriage rates on the Services&apos;building programmes.2.     It is estimated that the cost of hirings in 1970-71 forall three Services will be  l4.n1. in the United Kingdom and  10m.overseas.

Redundancy in the Royal Air Force in 1969-70 will belimited to some 80 officers.     Up to 25 more officers are expectation-ted to leave the Service under the redundancy scheme in 1970-71,but there will be no need to make any airmen redundant.7.     In the first year of his appointment as Honorary adviser on Forces Resettlement, Mr C.A. Roberts, C.B.E., has carried out a review of resettlement arrangements within the Services andthe Department of Employment and Productivity, with special ref-erence to the opportunities and facilities available for jobfinding.

Servicemen.     We maintain close collaboration with the SmploymenDepartment of the Officers&apos; Association and the Regular ForcesEmployment Association.8.     The Services have continued to expand and improve theirfacilities for resettlement training.     The Royal Air force has instituted new courses in welding and car maintenance,and there has been a further expansion of the variety of courses sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, particularly inthe industrial field.9.     The eligibility of Servicemen for pro-release resettlementtraining has been widened to include all personnel retiringvoluntarily after age forty provided that they have sufficientservice to qualify for retired pay or pension.10.   We have continued to expand the counselling services andthe number of career guidance courses has been increased.The problem of publicity has been given special attention.The distribution of the Forces Resettlement Bulletin has been increased and its scope and standard of presentation improved.11.    Polytechnics and Technical Colleges have been most helpful in running resettlement courses of the professional typecovering such subjects as industrial training, personnel management, computer programming and systems analysis, and business studies.      Many Service personnel attend 28-day pre-release resettlement courses at Service Resettlement Centresor do a training attachment of the same length with a civilianfirm or organisation.12.   A special scheme was introduced on 1 July 1969 to assistServicemen and Service women in the purchase of a house inthe last twelve months of their service.     The scheme is-100- 7  .CONFIDENTIAL /aimed

Delete and insert:&quot;On 1 April 1970 approximately 11+9,000 United Kingdom-basedindustrial staff, or about 70 per cent of the Industrial CivilService, will be employed by the Ministry of Defence in a wide range of activities, some of which involve highly sophisticated and novelproduction techniques,  in many diverse industrial establishments.This represents a reduction of approximately k,500 on the numbers employed on 1 April 1969.   The management of so many diverse industrialenterprises inevitably presents problems.    We must be capable of recruiting and retaining workers with the skills and abilitiesrequired.    Experience of the new p?jy structures which were introduced, &apos;following Report No. 18 by the National Board for Prices and Incomeson the Pay of Industrial Civil Servants (Cmnd. 303k) with effect from1 July 1967, has established the need for a further review of thebasis for determining the pay of the Industrial Civil Service.   the confidential / Board are

In the meanwhile, Management andTrade Unions are co-operating in many areas of industrial activityto improve upon existing systems of incentive payment   and tointroduce new schemes which will offer increased earnings in returnfor improvements in productivity and efficiency.    In addition, theMinistry has been reviewing existing organisations, systems of control,and management techniques by using, where appropriate, both its ownManagement Services staff and the services of Consultants to helpmanagers improve efficiency over a wide range of activities.    Thefollowing paragraphs describe these various measures more fully andsummarise the progress made.&quot;
