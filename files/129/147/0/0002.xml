S3C(70l.2 COPY NO.__CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATIONg . OUTSTANDING ISSUESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Local. Gpyernment and regional PlanningI shall, shortly be circulating a draft of the White Paper on LocalGovernment Reorganisation which we aim to publish during; the first week in February,,    This will follow the general decisions we took on myearlier paper C(69) 166s which was discussed on 11th December, 1969(CC(69) 60th Conclusions, Minute 5)i but there are four more points of substance which I should refer to the Cabinet separately and inadvance.Local Government Taxation.and Financial Relationships, with CentralGovernment2,      The Ministerial Committee on Local Government Reorganisationhas considered reports from officials on the reform of the rating system,on possible ways of supplementing rates with other forms of local taxation and on the implications of local government reorganisationfor the financial relations between central and local government.    Theseare all important and complex matters and legislation on them, coveringGreater London as well as the rest of England, will probably have to beseparate from the Bill to reorganisation .se local government,,    Moreover s therehas not, as yete been any opportunity for consultations on these matters,,The Committee therefore thought that they should form the subject of aGreen Paper published later in the year, to provide a basis for discussions with the bodies chiefly concerned.    Meanwhile the White Paper would dealwith them on the lines of Annex I to this paper0AHggSSPftB. andiSalayies^for^j!^mb^g830      The Wheatley Commission recommended that allowances tocouncillors to meet expenses should be improved, and that all councillorsshould be paid salaries (which would naturally replace allowances for theloss of earnings).    The Maud Committee on Management of LocalGovernment had earlier recommended that salaries should be paidto councillors with special responsibilities.    The Redcliffe-MaudCommission said that they would, not dissent from this.    In discussionS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJ STY*S GOVERNMENT)
in the Ministerial Committee on I-.oc.aI Government Reorganisation, mostMinisters favoured the Governments announcing their intention to providefor substantial improvements in allowances, to meJce sure that the generalrun of councillors v/ere not out of pocket, but not to provide for salaries;though it would be suggested that the question of salaries might be reviewed by the Government of the day when experience had been gained of the working of the new authorities040      On reflection, I doubt if we should commit ourselves about salariesat this juncture0    I suspect that wo may find that making largeimprovements in allowances would encounter difficulties of principle and comparisons    Moreover, it would not be wholly convincing to argue that more will be learnt from the working of the new authorities, manyof which will be smaller than some existing all-purpose authorities,;    i suggest that we should say in the Wliite Paper that we shall startconsultations about improving allowances,  and go on to say that thequestion of salaries is one on which there is much difference of opinion in the country, and that we shall take further steps to ascertain opinionsand then give the matter further thought ourselves0 with a view to reachingconclusions before the time comes to present legislation,    (if it issuggested that we have already ha,d plenty of time we can point outthat the local authority associations have never given us their viewson the recommendations of the Maud Committee made three years agojthat comments on the Wheatley Report generally are not yet due?  and thatthe Wheatley Commissions recommendations differed from those of theMaud Committee and from the opinion of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission,which was itself only tentatively expressed),,Aldermen50      Aldermen form an indirectly elected element on county councils and borough councils in England and Wales j  there are no aldermen inScotland,    The Committee on the Management of Local Government (1967)and the Royal Commission on Local Government in England (.1969) bothrecommended the abolition of aldermen, and this proposal accords withthe view which has long been held within our Partys    The ministerial committee v/ere clear that there should be no aldermen on the new localauthorities to be created in England outside Greater London,, and if mycolleagues agree the White Paper will announce our decision on this point.The position of aldermen on the Greater London Council, the LondonBorough Councils and (more awkwardly) in the City of London needsfurther consideration? on this the White Paper would merely say thatwe propose to discuss the question of aldermen in Greater London withthe authorities concerned,E lectoraljjssjj e g6Q      The RedcIiffe^Maud Report and the earlier report of the Committeeon the Management of Local Government both contain recommendationsaffecting the membership and election of local authorities! other proposals in this field have emerged during the consideration of these reports,,    they include the following S-**2i ***
(a) The proposal that there should be an enquiry into whethercouncillors should sit for four years (instead of three asat present) and whether it would be better to hold localgovernment elections in the autumn instead of the spring,(b) That all members of all authorities should retire together(instead of a proportion retiring each year as is the case with some authorities at present), and that local government elections for the main authorities should be held on the same day throughout the country,,(c) That elections to local councils should be held in the middle ofthe term of office of the main authorities,(d) That the main authorities and the larger local councils shouldbe elected on the basis of single member constituencies.All these matters need to be the subject of consultations with the political parties^ the local authority associations and the associations of localgovernment officers responsible for elections, in the light of our conclusions on the structure of local government.    The view of the ministerial Committee was that the White Paper should merely contain a general reference to the Governments intention to pursue suchconsultations.    Although it is not a matter which needs specific mentionin the White Paper., consultations could also cover rural weighting,7,      Both the Royal Commission and the Management committee recommended a maximum limit of 75 members for the main authorities;.The Royal Commission also thought there should be a maximum of 50for local councils.    Comments on these proposals have generally deniedthe need and desirability of fixed maxima, and there might well be a case for a larger membership for some of the main authorities.    We propose,therefore, that the White Paper should merely say that the varying needsof the new authorities will be discussed with local government bodies,8,      1 invite the agreement of my colleages to the line proposed onthese electoral issues,9,       There is also a strong feeling within the Party that except wheresenior people are concerned a local government employee should nolonger be disqualified from becoming a. member of the council whichemploys him.    Reorganisation will increase the number of employeesso disqualified.    The Ministerial Committee will be discussing the matterthis week, the essential point at issue being how far we should go in theWhite Paper, in advance of discussions with local governments towardssaying that we favour a change.    The point will come before the cabinet when the text of the White Paper is being considered.
Adjgtioiuti;&apos; Metropolitan Areas10,      Besides these four points, we have outstanding a decision aboutmetropolitan areas.    At our meeting on 11th December we agreed to providefor a tv/o-tier structure in West Yorkshire and in South Hampshire (withthe Isle of Wight.) as well as in the three metropolitan areas proposed bythe Royal Commission (Mersey3ide, SELNEC and the Weet Midlands),We also considered whether there should be two tiers in CentralLancashire and in Derby/Nottingham, but we did not reach a conclusion.It may be helpful for our resumed discussion for my colleagues to readwhat is said about these two areas in Annex H to this paper, which was prepared for the Ministerial Committee and reviewed a number of possibletwo-tier areas,,Summaryllo       I invite the Cabinet to agree that -(a) The White Paper should announce the intention to deal with local taxation and financial relationships between central and local governmentin a Green Paper later in the year (paragraph 2),(b) It should deal with the question of salaries and allowances forcouncillors as proposed in paragraph 4,(c) It should announce a conclusion that aldermen should not beprovided for in the new organisation and that there should be discussions about the future of aldermen in London (paragraph 5).(d) It should deal with electoral matters as proposed in paragraphs and 7.,12,      The Cabinet will also wish to reach a conclusion on whetherCentral Lancashire and Derby/Nottingham should be organised as proposedby the Royal Commission or as tv/o^tier areas (paragraph I0)oSi:orey&apos;s Gate, S,WU1,8th January, 1970

Financial Controls.The most irksome form of central government control is almost certainlyI control over &quot;borrowing, which in practice takes the form of the GovernmentfsI sanction being needed for the great majority of capital projects.   As the\ Commission say, central government must certainly concern itself with totalI investment, with its allocation among-the major services and with nationalJ standards in those services.   However, control over borrowing in the form whichI it has taken under successive-Governments for many years past is more restrictiveI and laborious than it need be.   The Government is at work, and will be seekingI the help of local government, on ways to improve the system.   Indeed, as the; Prime Minister has announced, the Government are seeking means of increasing theI discretion of local authorities even before local government is reorganised.This is only one part of the thorough-going review of local government finanfor which the reorganisation creates both the necessity and the opportunity,   Thireviev; must comprehend, of course, taxation levied by local government, on which some conclusions of the Government are recorded below.   Before legislation isprepared, the Government wish to obtain the views of local authorities and other&quot;which means setting out proposals in more detail than the Commission were ableto do or would be appropriate to the present paper.   They intend at a suitablestage to publish a Green Paper dealing fully with control and with taxation, oneallied matter is the system of audit,,   This-has a close relationship with theproposals for greater devolution.   Moreover, it bears on an objective which theGovernment are pursuing of reducing effort spent by Government Departments andlocal authorities on accounting transactions between them.+ 4-4-4- 4-4- 4-4-viii.., taxationThe Commission pointed out the drawbacks of local authorities dependingfor a substantial part of their revenue on grants made at the discretion of central government; and of the fact that though the level of central taxationI ^uwv^ich these grants are derived is strongly influenced by local authorities1;j expenditure, local authorities do not have to defend to the electorate this
part of their expenditure.   They drew attention to suggestions which hadbeen made to them for additional sources of local revenue, hut did not discuss their merits or demerits.   They did, however, state their belief that rates onproperty, modernised from time to time, must remain the chief local tax.As is said above, proposals about local revenue-will be put forward in aGreen Paper about local government finance.   However, it should be said atonce that the Government share the Commission^ opinion that for localgovernment of the kind now visualised, rates must remain the principle localtax; subject, that is, to reforms, and particularly to improvements in therebate system to reduce their tendency to take a higher proportion of small-incomes than large ones.   Any other source of revenue must be supplementary.4-4-4- + 4-4- 4-4-
CONFIDENTIALATOEX ITADDITIONAL. METROPOLITAN AREASReport by the Chairman of the Official Committee1.    At their meeting on 21st October (LGR(M)(69)5th Meeting), Ministers had beforethem LGR(M)(69)19 on the number of unitary areas, LGR(M)(69)20 on the allocation of functions in metropolitan areas, and LSR(M)(69)22, a paper on the implications ofLGR(M)(69)19 and 20, when considered together, for the total structure of localgovernment in a reorganised system..   The present report has been prepared in response to the request by Ministers that officials should make a further study of the division of functions in metropolitan areas and should examine the possibility of extending the two-tier metropolitan pattern to six other parts of the country inaddition to the three proposed by the Royal Commission.*   The six were:West YorkshireTyneside/WearsideCentral LancashireSouth YorkshireDerby/NottinghamSouth HampshireThe layout of the report is as follows:Part I        -    Allocation of functions in metropolitan areas - paragraphs 2-17(i)   Education at second tier: housing divided - paragraphs and *f(ii)   Education and housing at the first tier - paragraphs-10(iii)   Education at first tier: housing divided - paragraphs; 11-17Part II      -    Division of additional metropolitan areas into districts -paragraph 18* A decision to extend the metropolitan pattern in England would also have implications-tions for the review by the Secretary of State for Wales of the proposals for south Wales.1.

The division of functions in metropolitan areas proposed by Redcliffe-Maud isshown in Annex A.   The issues for consideration arise on the allocation of respon-sibility for education and housing.   Otherwise the distribution suggested byRedcliffe-Maud is generally accepted.   Any reservations would not affect the viabilityof the two-tier system or its extension to other parts of the country.   The decisions on education and housing are, however, crucial to the balance between first and second tier and to the question whether there should be more metropolitan areas.Solutions which would put the personal social services as well as education and mostof housing at the first tier have not been examined,,   On functional grounds, the HomeOffice would rather have child care with education at the first tier than administeredseparately at the second tier but child care could not go to the first tier withoutthe other Seebohm services and a two-tier metropolitan system in which the secondtier had no major functions would not be viable.   Nor have Departments considered anydivision of planning and transportation between the tiers in view of the importancethey attach to maintaining the whole responsibility for both these services in one authority.(i)   Education at second-tier: housing divided3&quot;     If functions remain divided as recommended by Eedcliffe-Maud, with education,the personal social services and a good deal of housing at the second tier, then thecase is strong for accepting the Redcliffe-Maud districts as they stand in Selnec,Merseyside and the West Midlands (Annex B).   Some metropolitan districts in these areas are weak, especially for education, and they could be strengthened by reducing their number.   But the resulting units would be unsatisfactory.   They would not meetthe view of D.E.S. that there should be a single education authority for the whole ofa metropolitan area;   and in order to achieve larger populations, they would includeplaces that had less in common with each other than would be appropriate at this level.There might, then be pressure to abandon the two-tier system and have a number of largeunitary authorities instead.   But such authorities could not possibly have suitableareas for planning and transportation. All major problems would straddle theirboundaries.2.
3-If.    With education and housing at the second tier, the argument for adding to thenumber of metropolitan areas is.weak.   There would be better planning areas in up to six parts of the country.   But the planning case on its own is probably not strong orclear-cut enough to justify departure from the unitary system.    If functions aredivided between tiers as proposed by Redcliffe-Maud, the districts in the threeRedcliffe-Maud metropolitan areas should be left as they are and no additionalmetropolitan areas should be created,(ii) Education and housing at the first tier5.    The situation changes if education, house-building and house ownership becomefirst-tier responsibilities.    The arguments for and against this were set out inLGR(M) (69)20.   The districts are then left v/ith the personal social services as theironly major function.   Some districts in the three Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan areascan be smaller than the Commission proposed, though the Official Committee considersthat populations should not fall below the minimum stipulated by Redcliffe-Maud ofabout 250,000.   In the view of D.H.S.S. a lower figure would be insufficient either for the administration of the personal social services or for the unitary health authorities in the reorganised National Health Service, whose areas are intended to be identical with those of metropolitan districts.   Strong outside pressure could however be expected for the creation of districts with populations less than 250,000,especially as the functions of the second tier would not include those normally thought of by the local authorities affected as requiring an extensive area or a large population.   The result could be an increase in the number of districts in theMerseyside area from k to 5 or 6, in Selnec from 9 to 10 or 11 and in the west midlands from 7 to 9 or 10, (Annex C).6.    The gain from creating additional metropolitan areas would be much greater wheneducation and the bulk of housing were first-tier functions.   Not only would there bethe planning advantages, with some consequential advantage for transportation, of larger areas that corresponded   better to the areas within which problems could be solved.   Metropolitan authorities would also be able to meet housing needs and settlepriorities over the whole of their areas, with a wide choice of sites at their disposal.   Planning and housing both benefit when the two functions are in the samehands.   There would, furthermore, be strong education authorities, with the resources to act as pace-setters, maintaining and improving the service provided by one or twoof the best authorities in the present system, whose organisations and traditionsthey would in some measure inherit.    (The point should be made here that as spendingon education is much heavier than on any other local government service, themetropolitan authority should also be the rating authority if it becomes responsiblefor education).7&apos; Unitary authorities included in any additional metropolitan areas would normallyhave to be divided if metropolitan districts were to be responsible only for personal
social services out of the major local government functions.   The reason would bethe some as for dividing districts in the Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan areas - therewould not be a case for such large units if the personal social services were their main responsibility.,   There would again be pressure for some second-tier authorities with a population below 200/250,000.80     Putting education, housebuilding and house-ownership at the first tier withplanning and transport, while leaving the personal social services and house-management at the second tier, runs contrary to the view of both Redcliffe-Maud andSeebohm that education, housing and the personal social services should be admini-sterod at the same tier-   But it concentrates at the first tier responsibility for services that benefit from administration over large areas by powerful authorities,possessing the resources to deal effectively with the massive environmental and educational problems of extensive, heavily populated and often obsolescent areas;and through house-management the second tier would provide the link with housingthat matters most for the personal social services.9o     In addition to the objections raised by the social service Departments to this division of functions which are set out in LGR(M)(69)20, an additional drawback isthe diminished credibility of the second tier,,   Both in the three Redcliffe-Maudareas and in the six other areas now under consideration, the second-tier units would often be centred on what are now county boroughs, exercising all localgovernment functions.   To enlarge their areas on the generally accepted principlethat authorities at both levels of a two-tier system should, wherever practicable,represent a union of town and country, and yet at the same time leave them with the personal social services as their major responsibility would make the second tierlook artificial.   The essence of the two-tier metropolitan pattern is that in certain areas some functions have to be administered over a wider territory and for a largerpopulation than would be appropriate for unitary authorities.   The corollary is that both tiers must be a reality - otherwise the better course would be to adopt which-ever pattern of unitary authorities has least blemishes.   To leave the personal social services on their own at the second-tier, unrelated to any of the other majorservices, puts the reality of that tier  in- doubt.    It would not help much that the districts also managed houses which they neither built nor owned.10.   A further point is that though some Redcliffe-Maud districts and unitary areascould be divided to make second-tier units for the personal social services, itwould not be practicable to break up such cities as Manchester and Birmingham forthis purpose.   To take both education and housing away from these cities and leave them with only the personal social services is hardly a proposal that they would belikely to agree to.(iii) Education at first tier: housing divided11.   There is a cogent case for putting education at the first tier in the threeif.
Redcliffe-Maud areas and in any others created, (LGR(M)(69)20).   Education shouldnot be divided between the tierso    It should be either wholly a first-tier orwholly a second-tier functioiio    If the view is accepted that education need not be administered at the same tier as the personal social services, the functionaladvantages of putting it at the first tier are decisive.12.   The case is also strong for putting most of housing at the first tier.   Butthough unsatisfactory, it is not impossible to divide housing between the tiers,roughly as the Commission proposed.    The Commission recommended that metropolitanauthorities should not only settle general housing policy but should also be ableto build in the interests of their areas as a whole, to carry out their planningpolicies and to rehouse people displaced by their redevelopment projects.   Inaddition, they would be responsible for policy on rents and selection of tenants.Any other housing powers, which would mean most building and would include allhouse-ownership and management, would be in the hands of the districts.13.   This division of housing responsibility between the tiers has many disadvan-tages.   There cannot be a fully unified housing policy and executive action isfragmented among a number of authorities with differing resources and capacities.But it should be possible to devise better machinery and powers than the RoyalCommission proposed for giving the metropolitan authority the means of securingeffective action throughout the metropolitan area, including reserve powers tobuild where a district is not able or willing to do its job.   With this qualificationthe allocation of housing functions between the tiers proposed by the commission could be accepted.1^f.   The main reason for accepting it would be to make the two-tier metropolitansystem viable.   A second tier responsible for both the Seebohm services and a large part of housing would have substantial functions.   The loss of education would be resented by Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and other county boroughs but theservices they retained might be sufficiently important to dissuade them from flatopposition to the new distribution of services.15-   If the districts in the three Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan areas retain thehousing functions proposed for them as well as the personal social services, then there would be much less of an argument for increasing their number and reducing their size than if they lost both education and housing.   Second-tier housing authorities should be as strong as possible, responsible for substantial populationswhose housing needs can be considered in relation to areas which give room formaneouvre and whose building programmes are on a scale that makes best use of resources.   On the assumption that the second tier should consist of reasonablypowerful units whose areas bear some correspondence to local social and geographicpatterns, the Redcliffe-Maud districts in Annex B are probably as good as can beexpected.
16.   If housing is split between the tiers, the argument for extending the metro-politan concept to other areas becomes weaken    The gain from having an authority-able to exercise the housing functions of a metropolitan authority over territoryincluding a number of unitary areas has to be balanced against the awkwardness ofsharing responsibility between two levels and the increase in the number of authorities with housing powers that would come not only from adding the metropolitanlevel but also from dividing unitary areas to make a larger number of second-tierauthoritieso   Disadvantages which can be accepted when confined to three areas bulklarger as the proportion of the country affected by them grows-17o   The planning and consequential transportation advantages remain, of course, andso does the educational advantage of having an authority able to plan and providefor the needs of a large population.Part II - Division of additional metropolitan areas into districtsl8o   In suggesting how any additional metropolitan areas might be divided intodistricts, it is assumed throughout that education would be a first-tier function.The districts proposed are based on a judgement that balances the size of unitrequired for housing and for the personal social services, the character of the places concerned and the likely pressures for separate second-tier authorities.All areas are divided into more than two districts.   The reason is that, each district being based on its own centre, an area which contained only two might find difficulty in overcoming their separatist tendencies and would be vulnerable to claims by both for unitary status.. . O(a) West YorkshireThe metropolitan area would consist of the Redcliffe-Maud unitary areascentred on Bradford, Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield and Dewsbury/Wakefield.If education is at the first tier but housing is divided, the districtsshould be identical with these 5 unitary areas (annex D).    It is important that each second-tier housing authority should be as strong, and should beresponsible for as extensive an area, as is compatible with having a two-tier system.If however education, housebuilding and house-ownership are all at thefirst tier, there might be 9 districts (Annex E).(b) Tyneside/WearsideThe metropolitan area would consist of the Redcliffe-Maude unitary areasof Tyneside and Wearside.Whether housing is divided or mainly at the first tier, there should be5 districts,  (Annexes D and E).Wearside would be one.    Tyneside would be divided into four, centred onNewcastle, Gateshead, South Shields and Tynemouth.6
(c) Central LancashireThe metropolitan area would consist of the Redcliffc Maud unitary areascentred on Blackpool- Preston, Blackburn and Burnley.Whether housing is divided or mainly at the first tier, districts shouldbe identical with these four unitary areas,  (Annexes D and E).(d) South YorkshireThe metropolitan area would consist of the unitary areas centred onSheffield and Doncaster and also perhaps the Chesterfield area in Derbyshireand the Worksop/East Retford area in Nottinghamshire,,    Unlike (a) to (c)above there is a case for a substantial alteration in the boundaries of the redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities if metropolitan areas are created for SouthYorkshire and Derby/Nottingham.   Redcliffe-Maud stuck closely to the Yorkshireboundary with Derbyshire and Nottinghamshireo   There are good grounds for doing so and if a unitary pattern was adopted the Redcliffe-Maud boundarieswould be suitable.   But if a metropolitan pattern is preferred, with betterareas for planning as one of its principal aims, the transfer of Chesterfieldand Worksop to the South Yorkshire unit would have to be examined.   This wouldtake a little time.   The comment which follows&quot;on districts in the SouthYorkshire metropolitan area assumes that the Redcliffe-Maud boundaries areuseduWhether housing is divided or mainly at the first tier, there should be four metropolitan districts.   One would be identical with the unitary areacentred on Doncaster.   The Sheffield unitary area would be divided into threedistricts, centred on Sheffield, Rotherham and Barnsley (annexes D and E).(e) Derby/NottinghamThe metropolitan area would consist of the unitary areas of Derbyshireand Nottinghamshire unless, as suggested above, Chesterfield and Worksop/East Retford join the South Yorkshire metropolitan area.Whether housing was divided or mainly at the first tier, there would be5 metropolitan districts, one centred on Derby,    one centred on Nottingham,one for the Erewash valley, one for the rest of Derbyshire and one for therest of Nottinghamshire (Annexes D and E).(f) South HampshireThe metropolitan area would consist of the unitary areas of Southamptonand Portsmouth.Whether housing was divided or mainly at the first tier, there would be four metropolitan districts, three centred on Southampton, Portsmouth andWinchester, and one consisting of the Isle of Wight (Annexes D and E).7
In a two-tier system the pressure would probably be irresistible for-making Winchester the centre of a separate metropolitan district fromSouthampton.   But the population of this district would be only 130,000.There would be a case for taking it out of the metropolitan area and including it with Basingstokc in a North Hamoshire unitary authority(detaching Basingstoke from the Reading unit where Redcliffe-Maud puts it).This would however involve an   extensive redrawing of Redcliffe-Maud areas in southern England-   The consequences could affect the Aylesbury/High Wycombeunit and perhaps Surrey as welloThe Isle of Wight has a population of only just over 100,000. Rcdcliffe-Maud includes the island in the Portsmouth unitary area.   But it would surelyhave to constitute a second-tier unit in any two-level system.Part III - Assessment of additional metropolitan areas(i) Education and housing at first tier19-   If education and most of housing become first-tier functions the advantage forthe organisation of services is clear in each of the six possible areas. responsible-ility for planning, transportation, education and most of housing is concentrated in an authority with a larger area and population than could easily be given to a unitary authority.20.    If the personal social services and house management are enough to make thesecond tier worthwhile and acceptable, if the personal social services can be separated from education and (together with house-management) from housebuildingand house-ownership, and if the risk that the eventual xoattern will include somesecond-tier units with populations below 200/250,000 can be taken then it is possibleto contemplate the application of the metropolitan system in each of the six areas.This statement is made without considering whether the creation of six moremetropolitan areas, with the personal social services the main function of thesecond tier, would open the door wide to a two-tier system throughout the country.That question is discussed later.(ii) Education at first t^IlLi^V!:gj-.^,AiyJ-de^21.   If the second tier must have wider responsibilities in order to be accepted asa realistic part of the new local government structure, and if to achieve this aimhousing is left divided between the tiers, with some reinforcement of the powerssuggested by the Commission for the metropolitan authorities, then the strength ofthe case for extending the metropolitan pattern varies from one area to another,(a)   West Yorkshire22.   The case is strongest in West Yorkshire.   One of the official conurbationsdefined by the Registrar-General for Statistical purposes in 1951, it might seemnatural to treat West Yorkshire in the same way as Merseyside, South East lancashire and the West Midlands.   West Yorkshire suffers badly from obsolescence and poor8.
housing-   The unitary areas proposed there by Redcliffe-Maud have many planningproblems in common.   A metropolitan authority would be able to get to grips withmajor questions and would have plenty of space to work in for solving them.    Itwould also be, in part, a successor to the highly regarded West Riding educationauthority.23.   Moreover, as the metropolitan pattern would consist of a metropolitanauthority superimposed on five districts whose areas were the same as those of the redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities, it could be represented as a strengthening ofthe Commissions proposals which yet retained some basic features of the Redcliffe-Maud solution.24. On the other hand, in comparison with the concentration of housing powers inthe Redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities, the division of housing between the tierswould partly offset the advantage of having a metropolitan authority with housingresponsibilities.(b) Central Lancashire25.   The four Redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities already have many common planning and housing problems (especially Blackburn and Burnley) and the case for ametropolitan authority rests in part on the same grounds as in West Yorkshire.It also depends however on the unifying effect of existing and proposed motorwaysand the further urban development in Central Lancashire where the growth of a central Lancashire new town would link the whole area more closely together..    Inaddition, the metropolitan authority would to some extent compensate for the lossof Lancashire county council as an education authority.   Here too, a metropolitanpattern, which retained the Redcliffe-Maud unitary areas as metropolitan districts,could be represented as adding an important element to the Redcliffe-Maud proposalswhile keeping much of their substance.(c) Tynesi de/Wearside26.   The case in the other four areas is less strong.   D.E.S. would xvelcome thelarger education authority for Tyneside and Wearside but have not suggested an amalgamation of the two unitary areas.   The areas of the Tyneside passenger transportauthority is wholly contained within the Tyneside unitary area.27.   Nonetheless the current land-use and transportation survey covers Wearside aswell as Tyneside, the development of Washington New Town concerns them both andthe Regional Economic Planning Council estimates that &quot;the Tyneside economicentity will eventually encompass an area&quot; stretching from Morpeth to Sunderland.28.   It is possible that a metropolitan solution with housing divided between twotiers would be worse for housing than the two Redcliffe-Maud unitary areas. Wearsidewould be a less substantial unitary authority than Tyneside but the Tyneside unitwould be powerful and compact, well equipped as an all-purpose authority to dealwith the whole range of its housing problems.   To share housing responsibilities9*
among a metropolitan authority and five metropolitan districts could be less satisfactory than having two authorities each able to deal with its area as a unity.(d) South Yorkshire29o   Again D.E.,So would v/elcome a larger education authority but have not asked forthe amalgamation of the Doncaster and Sheffield unitary areas.   There is a case for creating a single planning authority for the two areas but it is not strong.   Theemployment links between the Sheffield and Doncaster units are found mostly along the boundary between them.30o   The position on housing would be much the same as for Tyneside/Wearside.Sheffield is a strong unitary authority.    Its population of 1,080,000 is the largestof any unitary authority proposed by Redcliffe-Maud.    The Doncaster unitary area ismuch smaller but the housing problems of Doncaster and Sheffield areas do not oftenneed to be considered in relation to each other.    To have one metropolitan authority and four metropolitan districts responsible for housing could be less advantageousthan the two unitary authorities proposed by Redcliffe-Maud.31 o   A possibility which should be mentioned but which is not thought to deserveserious consideration is that South and West Yorkshire might be joined in a singlemetropolitan area which would include practically the whole of the West Biding andall the county boroughs there.    The result would be a metropolitan area with a population of 3*6 million and much larger territory than that of any othermetropolitan area.   The case for doing this does not carry great weight.    There arenot many local government questions which have to be considered in relation to bothWest and South Yorkshire.   The main advantage would be the resemblance of themetropolitan authority to the present West Riding County Council, with all thecounty boroughs added.   But a two-tier pattern on this scale, based largely on thearea of an existing county, could be expected to have repercussions throughoutEngland.(e) Derby/Nottingham32.   The case for a metropolitan authority rests first on the need for unifiedplanning of the built-up areas around Derby and Nottingham, which have alreadyribboned out towards each other and show signs of becoming a future conurbation,and secondly on the Erewash valley where outworn housing, industrial derelictionand the need for new employment affect areas on both sides of the boundary betweenthe Redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities for Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.33^   The north east of Nottinghamshire and the north west of Derbyshire are not however much involved in these problems which concern mainly the southern parts ofboth counties.Once more D.E.S. would be content if the two unitary areas were joined in asingle education authority but the unitary authorities, one with a population of862,000 combining Derby and Derbyshire and the other with a population of 997,00010.
combining Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, are satisfactory for education as they stand.35.   The question for housing is again whether two unitary authorities or onemetropolitan authority and five districts would provide a better organisation fordealing with the problems in this part of the country.(f)   Spuj^ Jfe^oshire36.   Unlike the other five areas under consideration, South Hampshire does notsuffer from bad housing or an outworn environment.    It is a very attractive area for new development.   The reason for considering a metropolitan authority is to plan the large-scale voluntary expansion expected in the area behind Southamptonand Portsmouth and likely to weld these towns, which are already growing closer together, into a single urban complex.37.   This is another area where D.E.S., though content with a larger authority,have not argued for the unitary areas to be joined.   And the question again arises whether housing would be better in the hands of two unitary authorities or onemetropolitan authority and four metropolitan districts (though the Isle of Wightas a second-tier housing authority would not be much concerned with developmentson the mainland).Part IV - Where could the line be held?380   Ministers have asked for advice on where a line could be drawn that would prevent a two-tier system from spreading all over the country, with the delay whichexamining a two-tier structure on the national scale would involve,(i)   Functions39&quot;   Any extension of the metropolitan pattern carries the risk that the end-resultwill be a two-tier system throughout the country (as the Commission believed) or atany rate that more of the country will be organised on a two-tier pattern than wouldbe desirable.   The risk will be less if housing remains divided between the tiersin the three Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan areas and the districts are left as theyare than if house-building and house-ownership go to the first tier along witheducation.    It would be possible to transfer education alone to the first tiersimply on the merits of whore responsibility for education should lie in these three areas.   This would not imply any need to create other metropolitan areas orto make any further changes in the Commissions proposals.kO.   In general, the more functions there are at the second tier, the easier itis to argue that second-tier units of the appropriate size cannot be found in mostparts of the country.    (This is of course very much the case with a second-tier ofthe Redcliffe-Maud type which is responsible for education.)H-l.   If, however, the second tier is confined to the personal social services and house management, then some Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan districts will be divided.This diminution in the districts&apos; functions combined with the decrease in their
12.-size would pave the way for what can, for convenience, be called a Senior-typetv/o-tier pattern, not only in additional metropolitan areas but everywhere,(ii) Areasii?    Nearly two years will elapse between the publication of the White Paper andthe introduction of a Bill in 1971-72;    and the Bill will then have to be steeredthrough Parliament.   The strongest line at this stage is for the White Paper to endorse the Eedclif fe-Maud proposals.   Alterations need to be backed by argumentsmore convincing than those on which the Eoyal Commission based its recommendations.The prudent course at the outset is for the Government to say that it accepts thenew local government map put forward by the Royal Commission.   Criticism will thenremain directed at the commission s report.   Subsequent changes can be representednot as concessions by the Government but as a response to the views put forward inthe further discussion that will follow the appearance of the White Paper.kj.   If, however, the White Paper proposes additional metropolitan areas - especiallas many as six - then the Government will be publicly committed to its own concept of the new local government system, which will be substantially different from thatof the Royal Commission;    and by having decided right at the beginning to departfrom the Royal Commission on so important a point as the areas where the unitarysystem is suitable it will open the way from then on to pressure for furtherdepartures.(a)   West Yorkshirehh.   If the White Paper is to propose an extension of the metropolitan concept, the clearest stopping-place would be found by applying it only to West Yorkshire out ofthe six possible areas.    It has similar problems to the three Redcliffe-Maudmetropolitan areas, like them it includes an official conurbation and to put ametropolitan authority on top of the 5 Redcliffe-Maud unitary areas could be saidto strengthen the Redcliffe-Maud system in West Yorkshire.^5.   It is also true however that the towns in the West Yorkshire conurbation are more separate from each other and the density of population is much less than inMerseyside, South East Lancashire or the West Midlands.   An overall land-use and transportation study has been completed for the area but the Ministry of transport was unable to find sufficient movement between the towns in West Yorkshire tojustify the establishment of a passenger transport authority there. The RoyalCommission after studying the matter in great detail decided that West Yorkshirewas in a different category from the 3 metropolitan areas it recommended.    (Inaddition to the treatment of this question in the report, one of the researchappendices in Volume III discusses the different characteristics of the 5 officialconurbations.)   It is of interest that the Local Government Commission for England,after considering West Yorkshire as a special review area under the LocalGovernment Act 1958, came to a similar conclusion.
h6.   Nonetheless West Yorkshire is the most natural and obvious additional area for the application of the metropolitan concept.(b) Central Lancashire47.   The next stopping place after West Yorkshire would be to apply the metropolitansystem to Central Lancashire.,   The case for having a metropolitan authority in central Lancashire resembles that for West Yorkshire;    and in both areas theretention of Redcliffe-Maud unitary authorities as metropolitan districts means that the addition of a metropolitan authority can be said to strengthen the redcliffe-Maud system.48.   Central Lancashire is not, however, an official conurbation, so that thisreason, which is admittedly irrelevant to the merits of the argument, would not beavailable for distinguishing metropolitan areas from the rest of the country.   the likely benefit from applying the metropolitan Concept would be greater in WestYorkshire and Central Lancashire than in any of the other four areas under examina-tion but the grounds for including Central Lancashire and none of the others wouldhave to be that it was the Government&apos;s judgment that Central Lancashire would gain from a metropolitan system in a way that the others would not.    This decision wouldcertainly be defensible but it would depend entirely on the Government&apos;s view ofthe situation which not everyone would share.   For example, a parallel could bedrawn with South Hampshire.   Both in Central Lancashire and South Hampshire thecase for a metropolitan area is related to the prospect of large-scale new development.   A flank would also be open to demands for a two-tier system in those parts of the country where towns that would think they had as good a claim tosecond-tier status as Blackpool or Burnley are now included in Redcliffe-Maudunitary areas.   Bath, for example, which is included in a unitary area with Bristolwould press to become the centre of a second-tier authority, especially as thepopulation of the Bristol unitary area is only 75,000 less than the population ofa Central Lancashire metropolitan area would be.(c) The other four areas49-   A metropolitan authority in West Yorkshire would open the way for one in CentralLancashire, which would in turn suggest the possibility of a metropolitan patternin the other four areas under consideration.   These four areas cannot be graded interms of whether one of them if it became a metropolitan area would be less likelythan the others to lead to the general extension of a two-tier system.    If themetropolitan pattern was applied to one there would be no good reason to withholdit from the other three.    If all four had a metropolitan system, there would thenbe nine metropolitan areas, with a total population of 17=3 million, nearly halfthe population of England outside Greater London.    Clearly the larger the number oftwo-tier areas, the more difficult it is to find objective criteria which providea firm basis for refusing to extend the two-tier pattern yet further.    (For example,
to Surrey, Kent, North and South Humberside, Bristol and Bath, and Ipswich,Suffolk and North East Essex).   The 9 areas could be distinguished from the restof the country only on the basis of the Government&apos;s judgment that these areas are suitable for metropolitan treatment but unitary authorities are appropriateelsewhere.Part V - Likely reactions50c    If there were 6 additional metropolitan authorities and 28 metropolitandistricts instead of 17 unitary authorities as proposed by the Royal Commission,then if each authority had 75 members there would be nearly 7,300 elected members with responsibility for local government services compared with 6,000 on theEedcliffe-Maud pattern.   This might do something to meet the criticism that the redcliffe-Maud report means too drastic a reduction in the number of councillorswith executive responsibilities-51.   The CCA. would welcome a decision to make education a first-tier respon-sibility and to create additional metropolitan areas.   This would be in accord withthe Associations views on the division of functions and the extension of the two-tier pattern to other heavily populated parts of the country.    The A.M.C., however,could be expected to oppose the extension of the metropolitan pattern, especially when accompanied by a reduction in the functions of metropolitan districts.    TheU.D.C.A. and R.D.CA. would be likely to favour additional metropolitan areas but would probably press for districts to be made smaller.52.   Individual authorities v/ill react according to how they are affected.    Thefollowing paragraphs are based on what is known so far about views on theEedcliffe-Maud report.53-   Birmingham (alone among county boroughs in the West Midlands) and Manchesterhave accepted the principle of a two-tier pattern, with the reservation that they want the districts to have more powers.   Their&apos; support for the metropolitan system could be jeopardised if district functions are reduced, and they could join the ranks of those - Bolton, Bury, Rochdale, Stockport, Birkenhead, Bootle and all the black Country county boroughs - who argue that the metropolitan areas should be broken up into unitary authorities.5^.   Cheshire county council is of course dismembered by the Selnec and Merseysidemetropolitan areas, and only the retention of Cheshire as a separate unit would meet the council&apos;s criticism of the Redclif fe-Maud report.   This is what the CCA.ask for but it would mean that both metropolitan authorities would lose muchterritory which must be planned as an integral part of their areas.55-   The creation of a Central Lancashire metropolitan area would probably notplacate Lancashire County Council.    It would at the least preeumably want thenorth Lancashire unitary area to be included in a two-tier system (a step whichcould almost certainly only be taken as part of a decision to have a two-tier system
everywhere);    and it would very likely continue to insist that though it acceptsconurbation authorities for Merseyside and South East Lancashire there is territorybetween the two in South Lancashire which should belong to a Lancashire countyauthority.56.   Strong opposition to a metropolitan authority can bo foreseen from the county boroughs in Central Lancashire, which Redcliffe-Maud makes the centres of k unitary areas.   Blackburn has expressed complete and wholehearted approval of the Redcliffe-Maud report.   Non-county borough, urban and rural district councils would fare nobetter under a metropolitan than a unitary pattern in Central Lancashire.57.   A West Yorkshire metropolitan authority might help to win over the West RidingCounty Council, though that would be more certain if West and South Yorkshire werejoined in a single metropolitan area.   Of the county boroughs, Leeds, Halifax,Huddersfield, Sheffield, Doncaster and. Wakefield have said they like the unitarypattern.   Barnsley and Rotherham would however gain from becoming the centres of metropolitan districts.580   In West Yorkshire, the present second-tier district councils would gain only if the metropolitan districts were smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud unitaryauthorities;    and it is possible that if this happened the county borough ofDev/sbury might prefer to be the centre of a metropolitan district rather than oneof the main towns in the mid-Yorkshire unitary area.    In South Yorkshire, existingdistrict councils would be likely to welcome the division of the Sheffield unitaryarea into three metropolitan districts.59.   On Tyneside/Wearside, all the chances are that Sunderland would vehementlyoppose a metropolitan area.    Its strong sense of independence from Tyneside - andfrom the rest of Durham - weighed with the Commission in deciding to recommend aWearside unitary authority.   The proposal is also unlikely to be popular withNewcastle, which would almost certainly rather.be the centre of a Tyneside unitaryarea.   The smaller county boroughs would be likely to prefer a metropolitan pattern.60.   A metropolitan area of Tyneside/Wearside would not be what Northumberlandcounty council want.   Their wish is to be combined in a single unit with that partof the conurbation lying north of the Tyne, leaving the part on the other bank toDurham and thus unacceptably splitting the conurbation down the middle.61.   In the Derby/Nottingham area, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire have accepted theCommission&apos;s areas;    and Nottingham county borough favours the unitary principle but would like the areas to be drawn differently.   Derby however is reported to havecriticised the Commission;    and the second-tier authorities would probably estimate that they stood to gain from a metropolitan pattern.62.   Finally, in South Hampshire, a metropolitan area would probably be welcomed by Hampshire County Council (though it would be likely to ask that the area shouldbe identical with the present county), Winchester (if it was the centre of a
metropolitan district) and the Isle of Wight.    Southampton and Portsmouth supportthe unitary pattern.Part VI - ConclusionsDivision of Functions63.    (i)   The Committee considers (paragraph 11) that education should bo a first-tier function in metropolitan areas (the social service departmentsdissenting for  the reasons set out in paragraph 5 of LGR(M)(69)20).(ii)   As a consequence of (i), rating should also be a first-tier responsibility(paragraph 6).(iii)   Housing should be divided between the tiers broadly as proposed by theRoyal Commission with the main executive responsibilities at the districtlevel but with powers at the metropolitan level somewhat stronger than theRoyal Commission proposed for securing effective action overall.   to preserve the credibility of the second tier and for the sake of the generalsystem of local government in the metropolitan areas, no other changes should be made in the distribution of functions proposed by Redcliffe-Maud(paragraphs 12 - 1^).Additional metropolitan areas6k,   (i)   Examination by officials suggests that the most tenable line in the white paper might be to keep to the division of the country between unitary and metropolitan areas recommended by the Royal Commission.    The extension ofthe metropolitan pattern to one of the six areas studied leads on to its application in others and to pressure for further departures from Redcliffe-Maud.    If the metropolitan pattern was applied in all six, it would covernearly half the population of England outside Greater London.    The argumentmight then be heard that if the Redcliffe-Maud proposals can be overturnedto this extent, the whole structure of local government and pattern of authorities had better be re-examined afresh (paragraphs k3 - k3 and ^9).(ii)   If there is to be another metropolitan area, the best case on merits isfound in West Yorkshire (paragraphs 22-2^ and hh-kG).(iii)   The next candidate with most claims for metropolitan treatment is CentralLancashire but it opens the door much wider to pressure for a two-tier system in many parts of the country if not everywhere (paragraphs 25 and(iv)   There is nothing to choose among the other four areas in terms of either the objective merits of the case, for a metropolitan pattern, or thedifficulty of defending the point at which the Government stops (paragraphs26-37 and ^9).
(v)    If no additions are made to the number of metropolitan areas, it is on balance the opinion of all Departments that the Redcliffe-Maud unitary areas should be accepted as they stand (paragraph 3 of LGR(M)(69)22)except for who hold the view that a reduction in the number ofeducation authorities is desirable in certain areas to maintain the quality of the service there (paragraph 21 of LGR(M)(69)19).(Signed)   Mo STEVENSONMinistry of Housing &amp; Local GovernmentWhitehall, S.W.,1.11th November 196917o10c11o 9/69/9O
