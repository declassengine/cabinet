WHITE PAPER ON EUROPERevise of paragraphs. 101 to 1031010       The total effect of the estimates of the costs of entry in respect ofagriculture, community finance, trade and industry, capital movements and invisibles; set out in the preceding chapters cannot be assessed by adding together the estimates of the respective ranges there given.    Theresult &quot; an overall balance of payments cost ranging from about 100 million to about  1,100 million - not only makes no allowance for the dynamic effects but is far too wide to afford any basis forjudgment^  and is positively misleading in that it is inconceivablethat all the elements in the calculation will work in the same direction,whether favourable or unfavourable.    Any resulting overall estimatemust therefore lie well within the extremes of this ranges what this area of greater probability is, depends upon qualitative judgment Inwhich the following main factors must be taken into account.    First,at the upper end of the range, the largest component is the figure ofour theoretical maximum contribution to the Community budgets andthat figure of  670 million substantially overstates this, if only because,as explained in paragraph 97 above, no account could be taken of the bear inon the United Kingdom of the arrangements agreed in principle inDecember, 1969, by the Six for themselves.    Secondly, and thisaffects both ends of the range, it has not been found possible tomake an estimate of the dynamic effects of entry either on industry or on trade because this depends essentially on the vigour of Britishindustry in exploiting the opportunities undoubtedly offered by joining the Community and in its response to greater competition (see chapter HI),    Past experience offers no adequate guide to theadvantages which it would be reasonable to expect in terms of greater efficiency and investment nor therefore of the effects on the United Kingdomss relative competitive position and rateof economic growth which is, however, considered further below0Finally, the conclusion that tho tariff changes would have an adverse effect may well be too pessimistic in the long run0    We shall be gainingtariff advantages in a market - the Community - which in any event is,and will probably continue to be, of increasing importance to us0102o      Nevertheless after allowing for all these qualifications, it is clearthat any assessment of the economic effects of membership of an enlarged community must include a substantial and continuing balance of paymentscost, notably that arising from the common agricultural policy and itsfinancing, which must be set against the substantial economic benefitsexpected from the dynamic effects of membership as well as the anticipated increase in invisible earnings,,    In balancing these considerations the weight of opinion in British industry, wherethe stimuli of greater opportunity and stiffer competition arising in a continental scale market are likely to be directly felt, is clearly
of great importances    The general conclusion in the report of the confederation of British industry is that certainly the unquantifiaolebenefits of membership are likely in the short term to mitigate, andin the long run to exceed, the balance of payments cost.    The balanceof payments cost, however, is only half the story;  the other half is howit is to be met0    It can only be met out of the national resources (GNP)and will involve adjustment of claims cn those resources other than claimspertaining to the balance  of payments.    These are,, in effect, theclaims of domestic consumption and investment, and a reduction hainvestment would sooner or later involve a reduction in the growth of GNP.    The adjustments would fall to be made as the balance ofpayments costs took effect over a transitional period and during thisperiod the GNP should itself be growing,,103,      The question is, therefore, whether the additional balance ofpayments cost expressed as an adjustment of domestic claims on the GNPwould be too large in relation to the rate of growth of GNP0    In the pastdecade the trend rate of growth of GNP has been about 3 per c-ent a year,though Chapter III sets out the reasons for thinking that membership of a wider market would increase that rate of growth;    The estimates set outearlier in this 17hite Paper of the balance of payments cost of membership would involve, at most), an additional claim on the annual rate of growthover a period of a few years of considerably less than 1 per cent of ourGNP.    The GNP of the United Kingdom will certainly be much greater thanit is today, some  39, 000 million a, year, when we hare to meet the full cost of membership.    Even a marginal transfer of resources from domestic to overseas claims on GNP is however by no means painless, and it exercisesa deterrent effect on the rate of growth.    The crucial question is thereforewhether our GNP after taking account of the transfer problem mentionedabove, can be expected to grow more quickly over a transitional period and beyond if we are members of the Community than if we are not.    If itcan., and if the additional growth is greater than the cost of membership,then there would be net economic advantage to us in incurring that cost.-2
&quot;WHITE PAPER ON EUROPERevise of paragraphs 107 and 108107.      This White Paper has attempted to bring up to date the assessmentmade in 1967 of the benefits and costs of membership erf the e.c. in the lighof developments since that time.    In addition to the developments inCommunity economic polic&quot;/ recorded earlier in this papers the economy of the United Kingdom is stronger^ the Six. are now unanimously in favour oiour entry, and the political arguments for closer unity between Britain andthe other countries of western Europe have also become strongerc    the major uncertain factor still is the balance of economic advantageparticularly in the short run,, where the assessments in this paperindicate a wide range of possible consequences of membership, depending on the development of the Communities^ policies over the next few yearsand upon the outcome of negotiations to determine the terms upon which britain might join the Communities? the course of events over the decadeahead cannot be foretold^, either in the Communities or outside themc1080      Failure to reach agreement in negotiations for entry would notnecessarily condemn Britain or the European Communities to political or economic sterility,,    But Europe would have lost another historicopportunity to develop its full economic potentialities in the interests of the welfare and security of its citizens; in that case the world would have losta contribution to its peace and prosperity that, neither Britain nor thecountries of the Exiropean Communities can make separately^,    this white Paper demonstrates the need for negotiations to achieve terms onwhich this opportunity can be seized,
