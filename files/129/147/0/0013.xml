KRAFT W^ITF. PAPER.I - THE ROYAL^CQTr^ISSIOF AND THE ffv? ^STRUCTUPEIntroduction1.     In tho aarly yoars of this Parliament, the G-government decided thatthe structure, organisation and machinery of government at various levelsvrero in need of fundamental roviev.   Among the institutions requiringsue--1 a review was, by common agreement, local government.2..    Accordingly, Royal Commissions with wide terms of reference were established under the chairmanship of Lord Redcliffe-Maud* and LordWheatley respectively to roviov.7 the organisation of local government inEngland and Scotland;   meanwhile tho Government continued with its ownreview of local government in &quot;vales,3.     Later, a further step was taken with the appointment of theCommission on the Constitution, whose terms of reference/ charged it, in considering tho subjects of its own inquiry, to have regard todevelopments in local government organisation.* To consider the structure of Local Government in England, outsideGreater London, in relation to its existing functions;    and to make recommendations for authorities and boundaries, and for functions andtheir division, having regard to the size and character of areas inwhich these can be most effectively exorcised and the need to sustaina viable system of local democracy;    and to report,/ To examine the present functions of the centred legislature and government in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom:To considor, having regard to developments in local government organisation and in tho administrative and other relationships betweentho various parts of tho United Kingdom and to the interests of the prosperity and good government of our people under tho Crown, whether any changes are desirable in those functions or otherwise in present constitutional and economic relationships:To consider, also, whether any changes are desirable in theconstitutional and economic relationships between the United Kingdomand the Channel Islands and the Isle of&quot; Kan.
i      This Hhite paper deals -with the reorganisation of local governmentir Insland and    also, particularly in Parts V, VI and VII, with othermatters which are of United Kingdom, application.   Paragraphs 16 to 18below refer to the position in Scotland and Wales.5. The great mass of evidence to the Radcliffe-Maud Commission showed that an overwhelming body of opinion, both inside and outside localbad boon forced to adopt under the Local Government Act 1958 woro widely recognised to bo inadequate.6.     Then the report of the Royal Commission (Cnnd. 4040) was published on 11th Juno 19&amp;9, the Prime Minister warmly welcomed it, payingtribute, as did the Loader of the Opposition, to the Commission^exhaustive studies and comprehensive recommendations.    The Prime Ministerannounced the Government&apos;s acceptance of the three main principles ofthe report - that a major rationalisation of local government was called for, that a marked reduction in the number of units with executive responsibility was needed, and that the anachronistic division betweentown, and country should bo ended.   He made it plain, however, that theGovernment were not committed to the detailed proposals in the roport.Sinco then, thorough consultations have been held to discover the viewsof all interested partias on the new structure recommended by theCommission;    and here the Government wish to pay tribute to the readiness of local authorities and others to set other tasks aside in the interestsof preparing comments at the earliest possible date.   Tho comments made during these consultations have confirmed what was already clear fromthe evidence to the Commission - the extensive support for far-reachingreforms which will fit local government for the last quarter of this centuryand beyond.1.    While few commentators agreed with the report down to tho lastdetail, there was widespread acceptance of its basic principles.   on every point of substance on which some commentators disagreed with theroport, there were others who expressed equally strong agreement.   an account of the views expressed by local government and other bodies isgiven in Appendix A.Gorieral roactij^ns^to the Sadcliffe-Maud Jt^ort government, boliovod that fundamerTho piecemeal methods which the Lclaments! structural changes wero required.Local Government Commission for England
8.   Tho Government have carefully weighed the views expressed in the consultations and elsewhere, tho proposals put forward by Mr. Senior inhis dissenting memorandum;, and the results of their own studies.   Thereis nc &quot;right solution&quot; to the problem of reorganisation,    whateversolution is chosen must sacrifice some things in the interest of others and some further changes will bo needed from tine to time to match the changing pattern of &quot;work, life, settlements and society.    Itis tho Government&apos;s conclusion that tho -analysis of tho Commission is sound in its broad essentials.   The Commission described the chain ofreasoning which led then to their choice of structure.    This, sot outnotably in paragraphs 6 to l6 of their report, is reproduced forconvenionco in Appendix B.    In tho Government&apos;s judgment, the Commission&apos;proposals provide the best basis for reorga.nisa.tion, though theGovernments conclusions differ from those of the Commission on particular points which are described in the following parts of this paper.9.     Tho Commission proposed that(a) the greater part of England should be organised in &quot;unitary areas&quot;, with populations of not much loss than 250,000 and not much more than 1,000,000, in which a single authority would exercise all local government functions;(b) certain areas, however, whore planning, transportation anddevelopment require authorities which would be- too large forother services, should be organised as &quot;metropolitan areas&quot;in which functions would be divided between two tiers of authority;(c) in the unitary&quot; areas, and in the metropolitan areas wherethe inhabitants wanted them, there should be &quot;local councils&quot;whose most important function would bo to express the viewsof local communities on any natters affecting them;(d) the unitary and metropolitan areas should be grouped into8 provinces, each with a provincial council consisting ofmembers elected by the main authorities together with someco-opted members, and with tho prime task of creating abroad planning framework within which the main authorities would carry out their operational responsibilities.
The Governiaont &apos; s general, views10.   The Government broadly accept this structure (subject to what issaid below about orovincos).    Their proposals differ only on thedistribution of functions in areas whore there are to be two tiers, theapplication of the Commission&apos;s structure in two parts of England andcertain important aspects of the proposals for local councils.1.1,   The Government also endorse the Commission&apos;s view that unless localgovernment is organised to meet the needs of the future, and inparticular organised in units large enough to match the- technical andadministrative requirements of the services which it administers, itspowor must diminish, and with it the power of local democracy.    TheGovernment intend, on the contrary, that it should increase;    and boththe proposed reorganisation of structure and other important proposals in this White Paper are directed to this end.12. The choice of structure is not one of degree, of how far to go.It is a choice between a structure composed of large units - unitaryones, wherever conditions make this feasible - and something closelyresembling what exists today. The G-overnment are in no doubt of the tremendous service which existing local government has rendered to thenation - a service nade possible by the devoted work of thousands ofcouncillors and officers. Equally, they are in no doubt that the systemnow noods fundamental change,13.   The G-overnment speak advisedly of the needs of the future, notmerely of the present.   Wq shall now need a considerable interval forelaborating the scheme and preparing legislation, for Parliamentaryconsideration of the legislation, and for the process of transition.The now orga.nise.tion cannot start functioning earlier than the spring of1974;   and the new authorities will not reach their full effectivenessfor some time after they assume power.    In view of the time, effort anddisturbance which such fundamental changes involve, the new structureshould be designed to last in essentials for many decades.Provinces14.   The work of the Commission on the Constitution must have a directbearing on the form that any provincial machinery might take.   As thePrime Minister foreshadowed in his statement to the House of Commons on11th June, I969, the Government have therefore decided that it would be premature to reach conclusions on this subject until that Commission has reported.   The essential corollary of this decision is that, in the confidential
meantime, the invaluable world of tho Regional Economic Planning Councils,to which tho Government attach great importance, must continue - and indeed take on a new dimension.   Wq have completed the phase of outlineregional strategies;   we aro now entering a pha.se in which we needdetailed regional plans.    For this purpose tho Government intend tomake arrangements to develop tho co-operation between tho Councils andStanding Conferences or other groupings of local authorities for planning purposes, in order to ensure both that thoir aims and policiesaro increasingly harmonised and that adequate moans exist for thepreparation of detailed regional plans.Greater London15.   The Royal Commission&apos;s terms of reference did not include greater london where local government has recently been reorganised under thoLondon Government Act 1963.   While some of the Commission&apos;s proposals(on matters affecting tho election and constitution of local authorities,for instance) have general implications, tho Government aro not proposing to alter the structure or functions of the London authorities.Scotland and Wglesl6.   In considering the structure of local government, some factorsoperate equally throughout Great Britain.    For example, whore towns andthe countryside have become a unity for the activities of localgovernment, tho organisation should not divide them.    On the other hand,differences in tho geography and. history of the throe countries make itinappropriate to try to force tho structure of local government into thesame mould for each.17.   Consultations are taking place on the report of the Royal Commissionon Local Government in Scotland (Cmnd. 4150).   A White Paper on thefuture structure of local government in Scotland will he laid beforeParliament in the spring.18,   The Government published its proposals for the reorganisation oflocal government in Wales in the White Paper of July 19^7 (Cmnd. 3340) .After the Royal Commissions on Local Government in England and scotland had reported, the Secretary of State for Wales decided to makea further review of the geographical counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthto see if a satisfactory pattern could be worked out which would avoid the continued divisions between county boroughs and administrativecounties.   He will report his conclusions to Pa,rliament shortly.
CONFIDENTIALII - THE TTOBK OF THE IlalH AUTHORITIES19.   It will at some -point be necessary to choose a suitable generictern both for the &quot;unitary areas&quot; and the &quot;metropolitan areas&quot;.   In-his White Paper we use the terms chosen by the Commission solelyas a matter of convenience in discussion, and not as permanentlabels.   The paper also uses the tern &quot;main authorities&quot; in the same sense as the Commission, to describe the unitary authorities,metropolitan authorities and metropolitan district councils, i.e. allauthorities except the local councils.The Unitary Areas20.   The Government accept the Commission1s belief in the advantages of making a single authority responsible for all services in aparticular area, wherever geographical and other factors allow.Successful local government depends to a significant cxtont &apos;  -on the ability of authorities to co-ordinate a wide range of functions and services and to develop links between them.   Adoption of theunitary system wherevor practicable will make local governmentstronger, more efficent and more comprehensible to the public.21.   The Government also accept the commission s view that undermodem conditions the unitary areas must cover both town and country.It is not that the interests of town and country are identical.   Butthey are complementary, and the social and economic interdependenceof the towns and the countryside has increased to a point where onlya single authority responsible for both can undertake the planneddevelopment of the main local government services to the maximumadvantage of both.22.   The Government therefore accept, apart from the two major changesdescribed below, the Commission&apos;3 general recommendations both on thedesirability and the size of unitary areas, though they would not wholly exclude the possibility that a few of the unitary areas proposedmay on further examination prove to be too small.The Metropolitan Areas23.   The G-overnment agree, however, that in some parts of the country- notably m certain actual or potential conurbations - the requirementsof land-use planning and transportation demand planning areas of a size and population much larger than are necessary or desirable for someooher services; and that a two-tier system is in these circumstancesunavoidable.
24.   The Commissions proposed division of functions &quot;between the twotiers in metropolitan areas is set out in Appendix C.   The Governmentdissent from this division in only one major respect, namely, education.This they believe should ha entrusted to the upper tier authority.   TheCorxussion preferred the lower tier authority on the grounds thateducation should he administered by the same authorities as the personal social services concerned with children.   There are, however, powerfularguments on the other side.   In general, it is the case that an authority which can command large resources, particularly in specialisedmanpower, can provide a more efficient education service.   In particular,the proposed metropolitan areas contain heavy concentrations ofinstitutions for further and higher education.   These forms of educationmake exceptional demands on the resources of the administering authority,and involve the provision of facilities which have wide implications forthe &quot;environmental services&quot; of planning, transportation, and development.Since students are mobile and catchment areas extensive, a high degreeof coordination is needed.    It is true that under the Government1ssolution there remains the problem of cooperation between the educationauthority with regard to child guidance and educational welfare, and thelower tier authorities in connection with child care;   but this need be no greater than the problem of cooperation in education matters betweenseparate lower tier authorities which the Commission&apos;s solution wouldgenerate.   The choice is a difficult one, and the Government have weighed&apos;.&quot;,rith great care the arguments both of the Commission and of the SeebohmCommittee* for entrusting&apos; education to the sane authorities as-the otherpersonal services.   But they have concluded that the balance of argumentfavours making education the responsibility of the metropolitanauthorities.25.   The transfer of education to the metropolitan authorities requires,in the Government&apos; s view, that they should be the rating- authoritiesin metropolitan areas, since the bulk of expenditure in these areas will now fall upon then.26,   The Government have devoted much thought to the Commission&apos;sproposals about housing.   The Commission proposed that responsibilitiesshould be divided as follows!* Report of the Committee on Local Authority and Allied personal social Services, 1969 (Cmnd. 3703).7
Metropolitan, authority;&apos; &quot;*-t lletfopblitan district councilfa) Metropolitan housing policy (i)      building (within framework, .  ,       ; :   j, of metropolitan policy)(b) building m the interests 01the metropolitan area as a (ii)     house management(iii)   all other housing powercwhole(c) building to ensure fulfilmentox planning policies(d) policy for selection of tenants(e) metropolitan rent policy the Commission were clearly right in believing that the functions listedon the left must be carried out by the authorities responsible for planning, transportation and development;    for they are among the mostimportant ways in which planning is put into practical effect.    It is arguable that the other housing functions should be entrusted to thesane authorities in order to avoid division of responsibility,nevertheless, the Government believe that the Commission were right in deciding that the drawbacks of this division are outweighed by theadvantages of giving the responsibilities on the right to authorities which are also responsible for the relevant personal social services;and they therefore agree in principle with the Commissions proposals.However, they also believe that when these proposals are translated into statutory terms, the power of the metropolitan authorities toundertake building should be widely drawn and should include thepower to supplement or reinforce the housebuilding programmes of thedistrict councils.27.   The Government agree generally with the Commission^ proposals about how the other functions should be distributed   in the metropolitanareas.   In particular, all statutory planning and transport powers shouldbelong, as the Commission recommended, to the metropolitan authorities.Exceptionally, however, there may be one or two activities, where theGovernment will wish to consider the precise allocation in more detail.The national Health Service28.   The Commission welcomed the proposal in the Green Paper*,published while they were still at work, that the administration ofthe hospital, general practitioner and local health services should bebrought together.   They made it plain that they had not taken evidence on the subject, but suggested that consideration should be given tounifying responsibility for the national health service within the new system of local government.   They set out a number of arguments in favourof this course, though they noted the financial and other difficulties.National Health Service:   The Administrative Structure of the medical and Related Services in England and Wales. HMSO 1968.
confidential29,   After full consideration, the Government have decided that suchan arrangement would not he practicable.   However, they endorse theCommission1s view that the unified health service and the local authoritypersonal social services must be closely co-ordinated, and they agreewith the Commission that tho health service should be reorganised onthe basis of the new main local authority areas.   Details of theGovernments revised proposals regarding the administration of the health services in England will be published shortly in a furtherGreen Paper.Special Cases30.   The Government&apos;s conclusions about the services which the Commissiondealt with under the heading of &quot;special cases&quot;, such as the police,are set out in Appendix D to this paper.   These concern the- work ofboth the unitary and the metropolitan authorities.
III   -   THE MAP31.   The Commission proposed 58 unitary areas; and they explained at the^nd of their report what places each would include and why.   They also proposed 3 metropolitan areas with two tiers of administration - on Merseyside,in South-East Lancashire and Cheshire, and in the West Midlands - and 20districts within them.   The Commissions map showing the 58 unitary and 3metropolitan areas is reprinted at the end of this paper.32.   It will be convenient to give the Government&apos;s conclusions about two-tierareas first.Two-tier Areas33.   The Government agree, as they have said above, that where, because ofconcentrations of population, the environmental group of services - that is,planning, transport and development - need to be dealt with on an exceptionallylarge scale, the idea of a single authority for all services must be abandoned.There must be a large authority for some services and several smaller onesfor the rest.34.   They agree that the three metropolitan areas described by the commission should be organised in this way.   They recognise what this will mean for citiesand towns in these areas which have throughout their history been accustomed to manage all their own local affairs.   They regret that in the West Midlandsit means reorganising an area which underwent reorganisation only a few yearsago.   However, the Government believe that the environmental services above allneed the comprehensive development which only a single authority can provide;moreover, joint work by several different authorities inevitably involves too large an intervention by central government.   For the same reason, theGovernment are satisfied that the Commission were right to draw wdde boundariesfor these areas, taking in parts of the surrounding country, though the actualline of the boundaries,in common with other boundary lines, will need to beconsidered in the next stage of consultations.35-   The Government have, however, reached the conclusion that in addition tothe three areas proposed by the Commission the following additional two-tierareas should be created:-West YorkshireAn area formed by combining the Commissions areas No. 7 (Bradford),No. 8 (Leeds), No. 9 (Halifax), No, 10 (Huddersfield) and No. 11(Mid-Iorkshire).10
South HampshireAn area formed by combining the Commissions areas No. 57 (Southamptonand South Hampshire) and No. 58 (Portsmouth, South-East Hampshire and the isle of Wight).360   All five unitary areas proposed by the Commission in West Yorkshire haveinterlocking problems.   There are severe housing problems and, as urban renewalgathers speed, the pressure on land and in particular on the open wedgesbetween the towns will increase.    The pattern of employment in West Yorkshireis changing as the traditional textile industries come to occupy a lessdominant position in the economy of tho area.    It is the Government&apos;s view thatthe allocation of land for housing and industry, the redistribution of popula-tion in relation to new employment, improvements in communications and thecc-ordina.tion of programmes for dealing with derelict land, demand a singleplanning authority for West Yorkshire.37-   In South Hampshire, the present exceptionally fast rate of growth seems certain to accelerate,    It is a very attractive place for new development; and expansion around Southampton and Portsmouth could result in the creation ofa single urban complex.   An authority is needed with full responsibility for planning..South Hampshire as&apos; a whole, able to reconcile large-scale- developmentwith the other interests of the area.38.   It is the Governments view, after studying all the possibilities, thatthe three original areas and the two now added are the only ones where a two-tier system should be adopted in the forthcoming reorganisation.   There are,as the Commission conceded, other areas where a two-tier solution may well be needed in the course of time.   But this will depend on future developments which cannot now be accurately foreseen.   No pattern can be rigid for all time;and the Government propose to ensure that future changes in the structure oflocal government in any particular area can be made without the need for afurther Act.Mstrijct in two-tier areas39.   The allocation of responsibility for education to the metropolitanauthorities does not, in the Government *s view, call for a different pattern of metropolitan districts from that proposed by the Commission.   Districts ofthe general size proposed by the Commission will, in the circumstances of themetropolitan areas, be needed to create effective housing and social service authorities.   There will,, however,, be full opportunity to comment on the pattern and boundaries of the districts during the consultations which will takeplace on the boundaries of all the new local government areas.11
ifOo   These consultations will of course include the pattern of districts in thetwo additional metropolitan areas.   The Government1s present view is as follows:-West YorkshireThere should be five districts, corresponding to the five unitary areas proposed by the Commission.   These are workable sub-divisions, andtheir sizes are suitable.South HampshireThere should be three districts.   One would be the Commission!s areaNo. 57; the second the Commission&apos;s area No. 58, less the Isle of Wight;and the third the Isle of Wight, the last being an exceptionally smalldistrict justified by exceptional circumstances.The unitary areask*\.   Leaving aside detailed boundary questions, on which several authoritieshave already tabled suggestions, the Government&apos;s present opinion is that theunitary areas proposed by the Commission, reduced in number to 51 by theadditional two-tier areas, are of broadly the right size and shape.   However,the door should not be closed on the possibility of joining certain of theunitary areas together, if in the course of further consultation with theauthorities concerned strong arguments for doing so should emerge.   On theother hand the Government see no instance of a unitary area which could be divided into two without making one or both of the parts too small, or dividingtasks which ought to be dealt with as one.12I confidential
IV.   THE LOCAL COUITGILS MS BECEHTRALISED AliHIHISTRATIOI42.   There has been, nuch public debate, some of it sceptical and evencvnical in tone, on the Commission&apos;s proposals for local councils.   TheGovernment believe the basic concept to be of profound importance;   butit must be developed further if such councils are to play their properand effective part in the structure of local government.The purpose of local councils -43.   Tho Commission recommended that in unitary areas (and in metropolitanareas if they were wanted) there should be local councils, elected at the outset for the areas of existing county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and parishes.   These councils would have no statutory duty to provide anyservices; but they would voice the opinions said wishes of their localities,be consulted by the main authorities when any proposal particula-rlyaffected these localities, and have the power to spend money on improvingwhat the Commission called &quot;the amenity and convenience&quot; of their areas.The Commission also proposed that the larger locad. councils should been abled to play a part, according to their resources and with the agreementof the unita.ry authority, in certain of the main local government services.44&quot;   Most commentators, though by no means all, accept that if there areto be large unitary authorities, then there should also be elected bodiesat a more local level.   But the Commissions particular proposals havebeen widely criticised first as not giving local councils a. job challeng-ing enough to attract men and women of calibre, and secondly for appearing to suggest that the local council for a large city, &quot;probably the headquarters of a unitary authority, should have substantially the samefunctions as the council of a small parish.45.   The Government are in no doubt that the basic concept of the localcouncil is valid and important.   The reorganisation of local government proposed in this White Paper will increa.se the size of the main authoritiesand substantially reduce the number of councillors who have the duty of administering services.   Hence the well-publicised danger of &quot;remoteness&quot;,of loss of contact between the citizen and his authority, and of a growing tendency for 1 people to think -of government of all kinds, howeverdemocratically based, as separate from themselves.   This tendency isstrengthened if fewer people have the opportunity of knowing theirelected representatives as individual persons.46.   Moreover the larger authorities now proposed will cover a wide variety of town and country and of different comnunities with differinginterests.   Each of these communities - every town and village - will wish to look after its own interests and to press its own point of view onthe main authority.   In modern society, projects needed for the wider:;;w^n;nyENTIAL
good increasingly have significant local consequences   and local peoplepast have an effective means of articulating their reactions and theirwishes.47,   Hone of this is an argument against the proposed larger units;for these alone correspond with the needs and realities of a more andmore mobile society.   But it is an argument for creating a counterpartto the larger units dealing with the bigger problems! namely, smallerunits of local government to look after the special interests of particulartowns and villages.48.   The Government accordingly agree with tho Royal Commission that local councils embody a &quot;principle that is basic to the new system oflocal government.   But they consider that changes are needed in theConiiission&apos;3 detailed proposals if this new type of council is to bemade fully effective.Their functions49.   First, as the Commission recommended, local councils should have powerto do things, at their own expense, which would make their areas more attractive, convenient and agreeable to live in.   The Commission gaveexoxvples of what they had in mind, which are listed in Appendix E, and theGovernment agree that local councils should have widely drawn powers to dothings of this kind.50.   The revenues of local councils v/ould cone from rates levied in their areas (the demands being sent out by the main authorities at the sane time as their own demands).   As the Commission propose, their capital expenditurev/ould have to be found from within the total allotted for the mainauthority1 s area;   the consent of the main authority would thus be necessary.The Green Paper mentioned in paragraph 6k will discuss the detailedfinancial arrangements between main authorities and local councils.   It naybe that some recurrent expenditure by local councils, for example on suchrevenue-earning activities as marinas, should also require the consent ofthe main authorities, since it could be large enough to be economicallysignificant.   The Government do not, however, think it necessary thatthere should be an equivalent of the limitation in terns of rate-yieldv/hich applies to parishes at present,51.   The Government do not accept the suggestion of the Royal commission that the larger local councils should themselves play a part in theprovision of major services.   The ensuing division of responsibility wouldbe hamful to the services concerned and could only cause confusion,Particularly as the position would vary fron one part of a unitary area toanother,
52,   There must, secondly, he a clear obligation on the mainauthorities to consult local councils about proposals that particularlyaffect the latter areas.   The Government will consider, with the help of the local authority associations, how precisely the right of local councils to be consulted should be defined.   The right must be real,not nominal5 though it is important to ensure that rigid or formalarrangements do not defeat their own objects.53.   Thirdly, local councils should have the right to appoint membersof school governing bodies and management committees for old people&apos;shomes; and arrangements will also be examined for enabling them toappoint members to local employment committees, local sports councils and as wide a variety as possible of other bodies.54.   Fourthly, the Government believe that another important functionca,n be added, namely, that members of local councils should serve ondistrict committees to which the unitary authorities would decentralisesome of their administration.   This is a suggestion made by the CountyCouncils Association and others.   In those services where it was appropriate, decentralisation of this kind would be efficient; and toinclude members of local councils in the committees would add to thecommittees&apos; knowledge of local circumstances and enable more people to take part in administration.   The committees would be committees of the unitary authority and would be staffed by that authority1sofficers.   Members of local councils would serve on them as of right;they would be chosen by the local councils, not co-opted by the main .authority.   What proportion of the committees should come from local councils is a matter for discussion;   but as the committees would becommittees of the main authority they would be bound by the authority1spolicies, and the authority could override a decision which they thoughtcontrary to their policy.   The Government will examine in detail whatrange of local government functions would be suitable fordecentralised administration of this kind.   They will include provisionsabout these committees in their proposals for legislation.Their boundaries55.   The Government agree with the Commission that for overwhelmingpractical reasons local councils must be based initially on the areasof existing local authorities.   It would be wholly impossible to define
new areas for local councils at the sane time as carrying out a radicalreorganisation of the main authorities.   The Government believe, however,that new areas for local councils should be worked out as soon as a the Commission suggested.   There should be no attempt to impose a uniform pattern - indeed, uniformity is ruled out by the infinitevariety created by history, tradition and geography; and full regard should be paid to the wishes of the local inhabitants.56.   In general, there should be local councils throughout the wholeof a unitary area.   Host parishes will no doubt remain as they are now,as will most urban districts and small boroughs;   though the Governmentwould support any voluntary amalgamations of parishes, of urban areasadjacent to each other, and of small towns with their immediatelysurrounding countryside.  (There will in any case need to be groupingof very small local councils for the purpose of appointing members to thedistrict committees mentioned above).   But the main problem is posed,not at this level of size, but by towns with populations of over, andin some cases of much over, 100,000.   Clearly, the inhabitants of a greatcity do not constitute   a community in the sane sense as those of asmall town, though the inhabitants of some sizeable towns may well do so -a resort town, for example, may wish to spend money on local attractionsthat are of concern to the whole town, not only to parts of it.57.   Large towns or cities which are also the headquarters of a mainauthority pose this problem in an extreme form; and it nay be thatin such cases special arrangements will be needed.   But generally theGovernment believe that in large towns in unitary areas, it should befor the existing elected council to decide whether the town should continueto be represented by a single local council, or whether it should be divided up among&apos; a number of local councils, each representing a communitywithin the town.   The unitary authorities will of course be ultimatelyresponsible for the boundaries between local councils within their areas as a whole.53.   Where large towns or cities decide that their areas should be splitinto a number of smaller local council areas (and it is for -consideration whether such smaller areas should have the right to demand a local council),these councils would no doubt partake of the character of neighbourhoodor community councils.     The idea of such neighbourhood councils has attracted growing attention recently; and one or two tentative experimentshave been made.   They might attract a new and different type of electedpossible after tlnain reorganisation, without waiting for five years
representative into local government.   They could he an importantexperiment in (if the phrase is not by now too glib) participatorydemocracy.   And, by giving urban communities the same kind of representation which rural parishes have had since 1894 5   they might bring to an end at this level cdso the artifical distinction betweentown and country which it is a prime object of re-organisation to achieve.59.   The Government will discuss with the local authority associationsthese various questions which arise in attempting to create a pattern of areas properly adapted to the role which local councils should andmust play in the new system.
V.   RELATIONS^ BETWEEJN CENTRAL^ AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT60.   In principle a number of the points in this part of the White Paper are of equal relevance to all parts of Great Britan, but their application to scotland will be considered in the separate White Paper to be published later this year on reorganisation there, raid their application to Wales will be dealt with inriving effect to the proposals in the 1967 White Paper on Local Government in wales.61.   As the Prime Minister made clear in his speech to the Association of municipal Corporations at Scarborough on 17th September 1969, the government believe unequivocably in greater freedom for local authorities within the framework of national policies laid down by Parliament.    They also believe thatthe reorganisation of local government will help towards this end, and is indeeda pre-condition of achieving it.   On the most practical level, the fact of fewerand larger units will reduce    the amount of detailed work which centralgovernment has to do.    With less than half the present number of educationauthorities and less than a tenth in the case of housing, the task of allocating resources becomes much simpler.    And it will be easier for central and local government to exchange information, and so create a more intimatepartnership and a more effective dialogue, in financial and other matters.62.   More fundamentally, the new pattern creates the opportunity of giving localgovernment significantly greater freedom than it has at present.    The government intend to seise this opportunity.   Some technological changes - for example,bigger and better computers - make for increasing centralisation.    It is therefore the more important not merely to get rid of central controls that have becomeobsolete, but, still more, to take tho fullest advantage of the opportunities for decentralisation which the new structure will create.    To this end, thefollowing paragraphs set out the Government&apos;s proposals on the relaxation of(i) financial controls,  (ii) non-financial controls and (iii) control over theway authorities manage their own internal affairs; and (iv) a general power forthe new authorities to take action for the benefit of their areas and inhabitants.(i)   FinancjLal^ Cont1-0Iso3o   The most irksome form of central government control is the control overborrowing, under which in practice the Government&apos;s sanction is needed for thegreat majority of capital projects.   Central government must of course, as theCommission accepted, concern itself with the total of investment, with itsallocation among the major services, and with national standards in those services.   However, control over borrowing in the form which it has taken undersuccessive Governments for many years past is more restrictive and laboriousthan it should be.   The Government therefore intend, with the help and advice of18
local government, to improve this system in two respects   in particular - firstly,by providing for control through programmes, instead of by more detailed methods,for the more important sectors of the major services; secondly, by allowing a significant freedom of decision for local authorities in respect of the remainingservices by way of on unallocated margin of expenditure,   As the Prime Minister hoalready announced, the Government will pursue these means of enlarging the discretion of local authorities oven before local government is reorganised,64.   This is only one aspect of the thorough-going review of local government finance for which reorganisation creates both the need and the opportunity.   this review must, of course, comprehend   taxation levied by local government, to which reference is made below.   Before legislation is prepared, the Government wish toobtain the views of local authorities and others; and they will wish to set out proposals in more deta.il than the Commission were able to do or would be appropriate to the present paper.    They therefore intend at a suitable stage to publish a Green Paper dealing fully with controls, finance and taxation in localgovernment,(ii)   Non--finane pal Controls65.   With controls that have little or no connection With finance, it is easier to see the principles on which the discretion of local authorities should been larged than to work&apos; out their detailed application.    Scattered through thelegislation of a c&amp;trfltity are controls which were appropriate when new functions were being introduced, but which are now clearly obsolete; while other controlsexist which will be inappropriate when all authorities are large and can commandcomprehensive professionol advice.   The same is true of some statutory powers ofMinisters to intervene in ways other than, by exercising routine control: forexample, some powers of enquiry and some default powers.   Administrative means,such as &quot;blanket decisions&quot;, are not always a suitable method of adapting such powers to modern conditions.   A statutory power of intervention is operativeuntil it is removed by Parliament.   To select those powers of intervention which parliament should be advised to remove will require a painstaking examination of provisions in many statutes to see which are obsolete and which may still be needed either to provide for adjudication between authorities and individualcitizens or to enable central government to discharge national responsibilities-The Government intend to undertake this examination in a positive spirit. Indeed,they have already asked the associations to say which controls they think shouldbo removed.
66    In one field, the Government can already be specific    In the Town and country planning Act 1968 Parliament provided, on the Government&apos;s recommendation, forriiscretion for important &quot;central&apos; planning powers to be transferred to local planning authorities; end this deiscretion is now being used to devolve these powers to authorities which ere suitably placed, in the coverage of their areasirid otherwise, to exercise them.   They will be devolved as a matter of course toall the new planning authorities.(iii) Authorities^ijnternal business67.   The Commission, recommended, as did the Committee on Management of LocalG-overnment in still more specific terns, a reduction in the control by centralgovernment over the internal administration of local authorities.    The government accept this recommendation and will put it into effect.   They agree that in generalthe statutory requirements that authorities should maintain separate committees for specific purposes are now obsolete - though to say this does not, of course,imply for a moment that the importance of particular committees has diminished:it means only that the services in question are now thoroughly well established.The same applies, in general, to provisions requiring the assent of Ministers to the choice of officers for certain posts.   The Governmmnt must, however, have regard tothe exceptional considerations which apply to the police, which is a special case inmany ways, and to the Scebohm Committee!s recommendations for the personal social services which will be the subject of early legislation.(iv) A^ general power for local authorities68.   The Commission recommended that the new main authorities should have a general power to spend money for the benefit of their areas and inhabitants.   A power ofthis kind is already available to local authorities under Section 6 of the LocalGovernment (Financial Provisions) Act 1963, but it is limited in each area to the product of a penny rate.   The Commission proposed that this financial limit shouldbe abolished so that the only limit on the use of the new power should be the wishes of the electors and such restrictions     o.s have to be placed on local government expenditure in the interests of national economic and financial policy.o9.   The Government are sympathetic in principle to the Commission&apos;s proposal.There are difficulties, however; for example that un-conditional powers, unrestrictedany financial limit, could lead to wasteful duplication or to local action whichnight conflict with national policy in important fields.20
wyiirivEii i inkOpportunity,.to reduce CiviX Servic^ numbers70.   The creation of fewer authorities, enjoying greater freedom, will be reflected in a reduction in the necessary duties now undertaken by central Government inrelation to local Government.   This will offer opportunities for reducing CivilService numbers in the areas of central Government administration concerned.   Theseopportunities will be vigorously pursued.21
VI.    TAXATION71.   The Commission pointed out the drawbacks to a system under which localauthorities depend for a major part of their revenue on grants made at the discretion of central government, and under which they do not have to defend tothe electorate this part of their expenditure, even though it strongly influencesthe level of central taxation from which these grants are derived.    They drew attention to suggestions which had been made to them for additionalsources of local revenue, but did not discuss their merits or demerits.   Theydid, however, state their belief that rates on property, modernised from time totime, must remain the chief local tax.72.   As was said above, proposals about local revenue   will be put forward ina Green Paper on local government finance generally.    The Government wish tostate now, however, that they have come to share the Commission^ view that for local government of the kind now visualised rates must remain the chief localtax.   The rating system, however, needs to be modernised to make it more generally acceptable, to reduce - for example, through an extension of therebates system - its regressive nature and to make it capable of sustaining itsrole as the principal local tax in the years ahead.    These issues, and thequestion of supplementary local revenue will be fully discussed in the proposedGreen Paper.22
CONFIDENTSVII,. , ELECTOiyjjCONSTITUONAL&apos; -/lND RELIED -M/MRSElectiqns73.   Tho Commission on Local Government in England, recommended that allcouncillors of the now authorities should retire together (instead of a proportion each year as in some authorities at present);    that councillorsof the main authorities and the larger local councils should he elected on the basis of single-member divisions;    and that elections for all themain authorities should be held on tho same day throughout the country.The Government will consult the interested parties on those importantproposals.    They will also consult thorn shout two other matters whichthe Commission thought should be reconsidered but on which they did not make recommendations, namely, whether members of local authorities should sit for terms of four years instead of the present three, and. whetherlocal government elections should be held in the autumn instead of the spring.    The consultations can also embrace other more detailedelectoral issues.Tho .,size of councils74.   The Commission recommended that none of the main authorities shouldhave more than 75 members, and that many should have fewer.    they thought it difficult for very large councils to be &quot;effective instrumentsfor the transaction of public business and in particular for thecontrol of policy&quot;;    and they believed that tho present size of councilsdated from a period when members spent more time on deta.il than is appropriate under modern conditions.   The Government agree with this general reasoning.   But they also attach great importance to the need forconstituencies to be of a Size to respond to electors&apos; &quot;wishes.    they therefore intend, with the help of local government, to study the varying needs of the new authorities before coming to a view on amaximum number of councillors,    Tho &quot;same applies to the size of local councils.Aldermen75.   The Government agree with the Commission that the new mainauthorities and local councils should be composed of members directly elected by the people, and should not include aldermen.    They will consult the authorities concerned about the future of aldermen in greater London.
pi sojaali^catidh761.   As the law now stands, a local government employee is disqualified from sitting on the council which employs him.   But if ho lives outsidethe aroa in which he works, ho may sit on the council for the area inr/hich he resides;    and county council employees can sit on district councils (and vice versa).    The creation of fewer and larger authorities,and many o^ thorn unitary ones, will substantially increase the number oflocal government employees who are debarred from serving on councilsresponsible for statutory services.f First Alternative   777.   Tho Government do not regard as tolerable a general principle ofdisqualification which debars a large and growing proportion of thepopulation from the chanco of becoming members of tho main localauthorities.    Certainly, senior officers of local authorities must remain disqualified since in their case there could be an obvious clash between public and private interest;    and tho police and the firesarvico are in a special position.   But for the great bulk of localgovernment employees, whether teachers or bus-drivers, the present lav/ ondisqualification will come to soon increasingly inequitable.    In theGovernment&apos;s view it should bo changed, and they propose to discuss thomatter in deta.il with the local authority and staff bodies.  Second AlternativeJ77.   Tho Government recognise that the present rules were designed toprevent clashes of interests and loyalties which v/ould damage the workof local authorities and their members.    Such clashes must inappropriate ways and in appropriate cases continue to be prevented infuture.    In the new circumstances referred to in paragraph f6, however,the Government would not regard as acceptable a rigid exclusiveprinciple which would debar a largo and growing proportion of thepopulation from the chance of becoming members of the main localauthorities.    In the Government&apos;s view a /ma-jor/7 liberalization ofthe law on disqualification is desirable, and thoy propose to consultlocal authorities and others concerned about this.78.   The Government are not at present convinced by the arguments whichhave been put forward for paying councillors, or councillors with
specially heavy responsibilities, a salary.   This would raise a major issue of principle, on which there is no agreement within localp-overnmentj the political parties or public opinion generally.   the traditional arguments for local government being unpaid carry great .weight;   and the Government would not propose a change until   and unlesspublic opinion crystallised or it became clear that tho proposedreorganisation was likely to impose a wholly new burden on the time ofcouncillors.79.   On the other hand the present rules about reimbursing expansesincurred on council business, including loss of earnings from ordinaryemployment, are so. drawn that membership of a local authority causesserious financial burden for many councillors.    This is wrong:    nan a,ndv/omen with small incomes ought not, in effect, to ba debarred fromserving in local government because of the hardship it would causo totheir families.    The Government will work out, with the help of advice from local authority bodies, substantial improvements to allowances.Management80.   The Government agree with the Commission that councillors shouldconcern themselves primarily with policy;    that the number of committees is at present often too large;    and that more detail shouldbe delegated to officers.   These and other matters of internal businessshould, as the Commission say, be left to the authorities concerned;there should be a minimum of general rules and plenty of experiment.The Government&apos;s views on central control in these matters have beengiven in Part V of this paper.-^e; ^vojt i ^atipn. ofm complaint s81.   The Prime Minister info me d Parliament on 22nd July 1969 that theGovernment proposed that machinery should be established for investigating complaints of maladministration in the sphere of localauthorities.   This has become the more necessary in the light of the prospective reduction in tho number of councillors responsible for administering services and the growing complexity and range of localautho ri ty admin is tration.82.   The Government have now studied the matter further in preparation for discussions with local government.   They consider that a number of&quot;Local Commissioners for Administration&quot; should be appointed withfunctions closely analogous to those of the Parliamentary Commissioner.
The work may call for some 10 or more Commissioners, each workingindependently in a particular part of the country.83.   The Commissioners should report to local authorities and localelectorates.    It would he constitutionally unsound and destructive oflocal democracy to subordinate them, or require them to report, toParliament or a body or Minister responsible to Parliament, when theywill he dealing with matters on which local authorities are responsible to their electorates.    Their reports on Individual cases and any specialreports which they may make, for example as to remedies, should go tothe councils concerned;   and the public will be entitled to know what they say and, where maladministration has been found, what action the councilproposes.   In short, the machinery should be an essential part of localgovernment, designed to help councillors to ensure that theadministration of their authorities is all that they would wish it tobe;   and tho sanction behind it should be the pressure of local democracy.8Zu.   Complaints should bo routed through councillors.   This is partlyso that councillors can watch, if maladministration is found, to see thata proper remedy is applied, and: still more because there are many ways in which a. councillor can help a citizen in a case where nomaladministration has occurred, for example by drawing his attention tosome benefit for which ho can apply or by pursuing his case with officials.   Tho now machinery is intended to reinforce, not to detractfrom, the work of councillors.35.   Tho administration of the now machinery should bo carried out byan appropriate body which is representative of and draws its funds from local government generally, though this body should bo concerned withadministration only and not with the substantive work of thoCommissioners.&apos; U[&apos;iDtNTIAL
CONFIDENTIALVIII.   BRINGING THE NEW SYSTZK INTO OPERATIONjjcie-Table35.     The Government believe that a Bill to introduce the new system should bebrought before Parliament in the 1971/72 session.   This should define the new areas,lay down the functions of the authorities and provide for the transition.57,     Between the passing of the Act and the date when the new authorities take over their full responsibilities, it will be necessary to settle electoral areas and tohold elections for the new unitary, metropolitan and metropolitan district councils.After being elected, the new councils will come formally into being;    but they will need an interval in which to appoint their chief officers and settle their organisa-tion before taking over their functions from the present authorities, which wouldthen go out of existence.   Much work will have to be accomplished during thistransitional period, but there are obvious and powerful reasons for not prolongingit any longer than is absolutely necessary.   The Government will wish to discuss this aspect of the time-table with local government bodies;    their present view is thatthe new authorities should be elected in 1973 in time to take over from the existing authorities in the spring of 197^-.88.     Changes at the level of local councils will be kept to a minimum during thisperiod.   As has already been said, the present areas of boroughs, urban districts andparishes will need to be adopted initially for local councils.   The Commissionrecommended that the sitting councillors in their areas should constitute the localcouncil until new elections could be held after the new main authorities had assumedfull control.   The Government will consult the local authority associations as towhether this is the most sensible arrangement, or whether elections for local councils should be held shortly before the main authorities take over.General aspects jjf ..th.e- transitional arrangements89.     The Government will lean heavily on the advice and help of members and officersof the present authorities in organising the transition.   They will consult the localauthority associations and other bodies on a wide variety of matters during thepreparation of the legislation and of the orders which will be needed later on more detailed points.   Two particularly important matters, the definition of the boundaries of the new main authorities and their staffing, are discussed below.90.     There will also need to be early and close consultations between the existing authorities in the areas which will form the new units.   Joint committees of these authorities would help to co-ordinate the work which will be needed within their areasin the period up to the final change-over, and would also help the Government toobtain advice on tranoitional matters, including proposals for electoral areas andthe inheritance of public property.27
t^nfijmi boundarieso/l.      The Government will now initiate a second stage of consultations about thep-ittern of areas and their boundaries.    The scope of these consultations and theprocedure for them will be discussed with the associations, but two points shouldbe stressed at the outset.   First, there is much to be done in the time available.Lengthy inquiries based on forensic procedures would not be appropriate; consultationsinuct be full and thorough, and must certainly include public conferences, but theyshould not be too formal.   Secondly, these consultations cannot re-open tho argu-ments about the main structure of local government proposed in the White Paper.Comments will be invited on the boundaries between areas, and some authorities may wish to make alternative proposals as to the exact pattern of units.   But this paper must bo the starting-point for the next stage.92-      The Bill should include proposals for the naming of the new areas.   Namesare important for historical and emotional reasons.    The Government would not intend to adopt the name &apos;Selnec&apos;, for example - a term used by the Commission only as alabel of convenience.   They agree with the Commission that names should be decidedlocally, not centrally, and they will propose means for bringing this about.    Theremust also bo consultations on such matters as the status of towns and cities and civicdignities.   On all these points,it will be the Government&apos;s aim to avoid unnecessarybreaks with history and tradition.Staffing93-      The structural changes proposed and the substantial element of rationalisationin them should make for staff economies.   For example, the number of authoritiesengaged in rate collection will be reduced to one-twentieth the present number. &apos; Thoproposed liberalisation of controls should also enable reductions to be made in thestaff employed in local as well as central government.    On the other hand, not all existing authorities have provided themselves with a fully adequate range of professional staff, especially in the fields of land use and transport planning and the personal social services where expertise is growing constantly.    These andother factors will make any meaningful ex-post-facto comparisons of total numbersquite impossible.   However, councillors and electorates will doubtless be anxiousto ensure that the process of reorganisation does not in itself add to posts,especially where tasks and staff are being divided between two tiers of authority.The Government agree with the Commission that where there is a surplus of senioroificers, it is better to pay compensation for redundancy rather than add to posts;and they will, as the Commission suggested, re-examine the present arrangements for compensation for loss of office bearing in mind, however, that alterations in the terras which apply to local government staff cannot be made without consideringtheir implications for the whole field of public employment.28.
g4.      There is no reason to expect that in general the prospects of officers now in local government will suffer from the reorganisation, bearing in mind the pressure for improved and expanded services and the increasing need for professional skills.Nevertheless the interests of staff must of course be safeguarded.   For thispurpose, and to help the new authorities in staffing themselves, the government propose to sot up a body similar to the London Government Staff Commission.   Earlydiscussions will be held with the staff organisations and the local authority associations on arrangements for establishing the Staff Commission, on the scopeof its work, and on any other arrangements needed for the proper protection ofstaff interests.Other matters95.     A formidable number of other things have to be provided for; this white paper makes no attempt to mention them all.   The setting up of the new structuremeans that detailed arrangements will have to be worked out, among other things,for the transfer of property, for the adaptation of local Acts and for the futurealteration of areas and boundaries.    Studies of all these matters will be put inhand.   Local government reorganisation may also have implications in other fields.Consideration will have to be given, for instance, to the Lieutenancies, to theShrievalties and to the administration of justice (quite apart from the proposals made by the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions^ under Lord Beeching&apos;chairmanship).29* Cmnd.
&apos; g.   CONCLUSIONg6       This White Paper completes the second stage in the work, to which so manyminds are contributing, of preparing the most far-reaching reorganisation of local-government that England has ever seen.   The first stage was the massive labours ofthe Commission.   The essential elements of their report have been studxed through-out the country.   The Government now present their conclusions on these essentials,after weighing all the opinions that have been expressed.   This paper describeshow the Government propose to set in train the next stage of consultations and sotsout the time table which they hope can be followed up to the point when the nowauthorities assume control.   The prospect of reorganisation is already handicappingthe work of local authorities, and must do so increasingly as time goes on.   This is why the Government have pursued this subject with urgency.    It is equally important that the further preparations for legislation should be thorough so that those who in the future live under and serve In local government, will find the new systemsolidly based.97.      The organisation of local government must always be controversial.   many people will differ from the conclusions reached in this White Paper.   The same wouldbo true of any other set of conclusions.   But all must be impressed by the generalagreement that, not withstanding the great achievements of the existing authorities,radical change is overdue.   There is also wide agreement that if local government can be adapted to future needs, and organised in strong units with power to takemajor decisions, then and then only can present trends towards excessive centralisation-tion be reversed, and local democracy resume its place as a major part of the democratic government of the country.
APPENDIX ACOMMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE PROPOSEDBY   THE  ROYAL. commission.     More than 2,000 comments were received on the structure of local government proposed in the Redcliffe-Maud report.   A wide variety of views was expressed butthere was almost universal recognition of the need for radical change.   A shortappendix cannot do justice to all the points that were carefully weighed by theGovernment in the course of consultation and must concentrate mainly on the opinions of the local authorities and their associations.   If, however, another group ofcomments is to be singled out for mention it should perhaps be those of the variousprofessional organisations who are actively concerned in the working of localgovernment and know about its problems from the first-hand experience of their members.   Many of them had reservations about some aspect or other of the structureproposed by the Commission but the general trend of their comments was unmistakablyin favour of reorganisation on the broad basis of the Redcliffe-Maud report.   TheNational and Local Government Officers&apos; Association (NALGO) were also sympathetic to the Commission&apos;s proposals, though they were opposed to the idea of local councils.2.     The local authority associations differed among each other in their reactions.The Association of Municipal Corporations (A.M.C.) and the County councils association (CCA.) were in agreement with the proposal that England should be divided between unitary and metropolitan areas.   But whereas the A.M.C. wantedmore unitary authorities, with a consequent reduction in the size of some unitary areas, the CCA. wanted fewer and thought that wherever possible the populationof a unitary area should be at least 500,000.3.      In the metropolitan areas, the A.M.C. thought that the metropolitan district councils should carry greater responsibility than proposed by the Royal Commissionand should be as nearly as possible the equivalent of unitary authorities.   TheC.C.A., on the other hand, maintained that education should be a function of themetropolitan authorities, not the metropolitan districts; and that the boundaries of the three metropolitan authorities suggested by the Commission should be moretightly drawn around the built-up areas.   The CCA. also took the view that therewere other parts of the country which might benefit from being organised on themetropolitan pattern.^     The Rural District Councils Association (R.D.CA.) and the Urban district councils Association (U.D.CA.) rejected the concept of the unitary authority. Theyargued in favour of dividing services between two tiers of local authorities throughout the whole country.
5,      After their discussions with the Secretary of State for Local Governmentand Regional Planning, the C.C.A., U.D.C.A. and R.D.C.A. issued a joint statement that representatives of the three associations had found a common approach toreorganisation.   The statement suggested that the unitary pattern should bereplaced everywhere by a two-tier system, with fewer functions at the secondtier than in metropolitan areas; that wherever possible, the minimum populationof the first-tier areas should be at least 500,000; and that the population ofthe second-tier areas should normally be 100,000 or more, though the figuremight fall to 60,000 in sparsely inhabited parts of the country.   When their statement was published, the associations were still undecided on the allocation of responsibility for planning and housing.   They had agreed, however, that second-tier authorities would appoint members to district committees of the first-tierauthorities, charged with the local administration of some first-tier functions.6.      The U.D.C.A. was alone among the local authority associations in seeing noplace for local councils or equivalent bodies - even the traditional parish councils - in a new system of local government.   The R.D.C.A. thought that local councils would perform a useful function in rural areas, as parishes do now. TheA.M.C., though doubting the value of local councils for the larger towns, believedthat elsewhere, if there was popular demand for them, they would be a worthwhilepart of the new local government structure.   The Association suggested, too, thatthe larger towns might be broken into smaller areas for the purpose of establishinglocal councils there.7.      The C.C.A., in its initial observations, while accepting that there shouldbe local councils in the new system, considered that they were not on their own asufficient complement to the unitary authorities.   The Association argued thatthe democratic base of the unitary authorities must be strengthened to providewider participation by elected members in the administration of services.   it proposed, among other possibilities, that unitary authorities might decentraliseresponsibility for running services to district committees, which would include members appointed by local councils..8.      The National Association of Parish Councils welcomed the proposals for local councils, considering them an imaginative step forward in the development of the role of the community as part of local government.
The views of individual local authorities on the new structure were broadly similar to those put forward by the associations.   Almost every county boroughoutside the three metropolitan areas proposed by the Commission supported a unitary pattern.   Some county boroughs, especially the smaller, and many non-county boroughs, wanted an increase in the number of unitary areas.   In the threemetropolitan areas, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester accepted a two-tierpattern, though suggesting that more powers should be given to the districts.Most of the other county boroughs in these areas, however, said that they would prefer a unitary system.10,    County councils were almost equally divided between those who supportedunitary authorities and those who preferred a two-tier structure.   Urban and rural district councils, with a few exceptions, wanted a two-tier system through-out the country.11.    Viev/s were also submitted in detail by the Regional Economic planning councils, not only on the proposal for Provincial Councils, but on other mattershaving a bearing on planning at tho regional level.    These views will boparticularly valuable when the time comes to give further consideration to theproblems of planning at that level.confidential
APPENDIX extract from the Report of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England&quot;HOW MAIN CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED6.    In the light of all the evidence presented to us, of our review of the presentpattern and working of local government and of our efforts to foresee the future,we became convinced that there are four basic defects in the existing structure.Together these structural defects seriously reduce, and will increasingly reduce,the chances of ensuring that local government works efficiently and economically,is understood by the citizens who elect it, and holds their interest.   The following are the four basic faults:-(i) Local government areas do not fit the pattern of life and work in modernEngland.   The gap will widen as social, economic and technological changesquicken.(ii) The fragmentation of England into 79 county boroughs and h3 counties,exercising independent jurisdictions and dividing town from country, has madethe proper planning of development and transportation impossible.   The result has often been an atmosphere of hostility between county boroughs and counties and this has made it harder to decide difficult questions on their merits.(iii) The division of responsibility within each county between county council1and a number of county district councils , together with the position ofcounty boroughs as islands in the counties, means that services which shouldbe in the hands of one authority are fragmented among several.   The difficultyof meeting comprehensively the needs of families and individuals is thusgreatly increased.(iv) Many local authorities are too small, in size and revenue, and in con-sequence too short of highly qualified manpower and technical equipment, tobe able to do their work as well as it could and should be done.7.    Partly but not wholly because of these structural faults, and in spite of thedevoted efforts of councillors and officers, there are serious failings in localgovernment&apos;s relationships with the public and with national government :-(i)    The complex local government machinery seems, and often is, irrelevantand therefore impotent in face of the problems that confront people in theirdaily lives, either collectively or as families and individuals.   Hence thefeeling of many people that local government cannot help them and the frequentsense of frustration among councillors and officers.1&quot; There are at present in England 1,086 county district councils, consistingof 227 non-county borough, hk-9 urban district and klO rural district councils.
(ii) Parliament and central government doubt the ability of local governors,within the straitjacket of the present system, to run local affairs.(iii) The variety in size and type of local authorities, and the existenceof several local authority associations reflecting that variety, mean that local government seldom acts effectively as a single body in its dealings with central government.8.    In considering what changes are needed to correct these structural and otherdefects there is one fundamental question.   What size of authority, or range of size, in terms of population and of area, is needed for the democratic and efficient provision of particular services and for local self-government as awhole?9.    After examining each of the main services in turn, we decided that answers to that question must be found by seeking to apply to each part of the country the following general principles :-(i) Local authority areas must be so defined that they enable citizens andtheir elected representatives to have a sense of common purpose.(ii) The areas must be based upon the interdependence of town and country.(iii) In each part of the country, all services concerned with the physicalenvironment (planning, transportation and major development) must be inthe hands of one authority.   Areas must be large enough to enable these authorities to meet the pressing land needs of the growing population, andtheir inhabitants must share a common interest in their environment because it is where they live, work, shop, and find their recreation.(iv) All personal services (education, personal social services, health and housing), being closely linked in operation and effect, must also be in thehands of one authority, as strongly recommended by the recent report of theSeebohm Committee .(v) If possible, both the &quot;environmental&quot; and the &quot;personal&quot; groups of services should be in the hands of the same authority, because the influence of one on the other is great and likely to increase.   Further, concentratingresponsibility for all main local government services in a single authorityfor each area, as in the present county borough, would help to make theidea of local self-government a reality.    Through allocation of priorities and co-ordinated use of resources, a single authority can relate its programme-times for all services to objectives for its area considered as a whole.(vi) Authorities must, however, be bigger than most county boroughs (andall county districts) are at present, if they are to command the resources and skilled manpower which they need to provide services with maximum efficiency.1.   Cmnd. 3703. H.M.S.o. 1968
(vii) The size of authorities must vary over a wide range if areas are to match the pattern of population.   But a minimum population is necessary.   what this should be is a question of great difficulty and we received muchevidence about it.   We concluded that this pointed to a minimum of around250,000.   Though authoritative witnesses would prefer a higher minimum for education - perhaps as high as 500,000 - we did not accept that this was essential.   Moreover, a minimum above 250,000 would be too high to providecoherent and reasonably compact areas in many parts of the country.   It wouldalso be unnecessarily large for the other personal services (the personal social services, health and housing), which must be kept together with education.(viii) At the other end of the scale, authorities must not be so large interms of population that organisation of their business becomes difficult and the elected representatives cannot keep in touch with the people affectedby their policies.   This is especially important in the personal services.There was little evidence to guide us but we concluded that a population ofnot much more than 1,000,000 should be the maximum for the personal services,though much would depend on the social and geographic characteristics ofeach area.(ix) Where the area required for planning and the other environmental servicescontains too large a population for the personal services, a single authorityfor all services would not be appropriate;    and in these parts of thecountry, responsibilities must be clearly divided between two levels, and related services kept together.(x) The new local government pattern should so far as practicable stemfrom the existing one.   Wherever   the case for change is in doubt, tho common interest, traditions and loyalties inherent in the present pattern, and thestrength of existing services as going concerns, should be respected.10.   In considering what the new local government structure should be, we firstconcentrated on the &quot;city region&quot; since this was the idea strongly advocated forthe whole country by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the department1with chief responsibility for English local government .   We examined various possible local government maps of England in turn, and the following pointsemerged:-(i)     The city region idea has value because it takes account of the fact that people are now much more mobile than they were.1*    According to the Ministry&apos;s evidence, a city region &quot;consists of aconurbation or one or more cities or big towns surrounded by a number of lessertowns and villages sot in rural areas, the whole tied together by an intricate andclosely meshed system of relationships and communications, and providing a wide range of employment and services&quot;.-
(ii) Witnesses put forward a variety of possible areas as city regions,ranging in number from 25 to 45 for the country as a whole.   This suggestedthat the city region was not an idea which could be applied uniformly allover England, and in some parts of the country it did not seem to us to fitreality.    In a number of areas it does provide the clue: around the greaturban concentrations of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, and also in areas where a big town is the natural centre for a wide area of surroundingcountryside and smaller towns.   But in others, such as the south west,insistence on the idea of the city region seemed to mean creating artificiallyconstructed areas whose people have no sense of looking to a city centre orof sharing interests peculiar to themselves; and in the south east the idealeads to no clear local government pattern because the influence of Londonovershadows that of other centres.(iii) Many suggested city regions would be so large as to need a secondoperational tier of authorities if local government is not to be too remotefor effective contact between the elected representatives and the people.But many of these second-tier authorities would be too small to find theresources needed for the main local government services; and in any casethe present splitting of personal services which ought to be concentrated in one authority would be reproduced over a large part of the country.11.   We therefore next considered various alternatives to applying the idea ofthe city region to the whole country.   We examined a series of maps illustratingthe other main proposals for a new structure put to us in evidence.    Theseproposals were: a single tier; two tiers of various kinds and sizes; mainauthorities performing most functions but with a level above them, covering a&quot;province&quot;, to perform the rest.   Other maps which our staff prepared for usshowed that the country could be divided into 130 to 140 areas which had some measure of coherence because of internal social and economic ties, but many ofthese areas have populations far too small to enable them to employ the range ofstaff needed for the efficient provision of any of the main services.12.   Meanwhile we had become increasingly convinced by those who emphasised theneed for an organ of community at grass-roots level.   Our conclusion was thatany new pattern of democratic government must include elected local councils,not to provide main services, but to promote and watch over the particular interests of communities in city, town and village throughout England.13-    Our examination of England had also led us to the conclusion that localgovernment, however organised, needs to include a new representative institution
with authority over areas larger than any city region, not unlike the eight areasof the present regional economic planning councils-    This provincial council would handle the broader planning issues, work out provincial economic strategyin collaboration with central government and be able to act on behalf of the wholeprovince.iko    Assuming therefore that whatever arrangements were made for the operationof the main local government services there would be need for complementaryinstitutions &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot;, at the levels of the province and the local community, we decided to re-examine each part of England in turn, apply our general principles and ask ourselves where there are areas in which operationalresponsibility for all local government services can appropriately be concentratedthat is to say, areas which(i) can properly be treated as coherent units for carrying out the &quot;environmental&quot; group of services;(ii) have populations broadly within the range of 250,000 to not much morethan a million, the size that we had concluded would be appropriate forthe efficient performance of the &quot;personal&quot; group of services;(iii) can be looked after effectively and democratically by one council.Where areas existed that met all these three conditions, the argument in favourof one authority for each of them would be decisive.   Elsewhere responsibility would need to be divided between authorities at two tiers; and we recognised thatthis would be necessary where we found that the planning problems of big urbanconcentrations had to be dealt with over areas containing such large populationsthat a single authority would be unwieldy and, for the personal services,remote,,15&quot;     In working out possible boundaries with these alternatives in mind we hadto judge in each case where the balance of advantage lay, by weighing a numberof different considerations, and in particular these three:-(i) The pattern of living - that is to say, the distribution of population and industry and the pattern of travel for employment, shopping, entertain- .ment and other purposes, together with prospective developments likelyto change these facts and modify the social and economic future of thearea.(ii) Democracy and efficiency - the best practicable balance between theneeds of efficiency (in terms of population, geography and resources ofmoney, manpower and technical equipment) and the requirements of effectiverepresentation.(iii) The present pattern of local government.
l6.   It was this survey that resulted in our final conclusions.    It convincedus that over most parts of the country, 58 in all, a single authority should bemade responsible for all services, but that in three metropolitan areas(additional to Greater London) the unit needed for comprehensive planning,transportation and major development was both too large for unitary governmentand large enough to be sub-divided into units suitable for education, the personal social services, health and housing; in each of these three areas thereforeresponsibility for services should be divided between one metropolitan and several large metropolitan district authorities.&quot;14.1.1V70/200

APPENDIX DSERVICES EOR WHICH SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE HLSDEDPolice1      The prevention and detection of crime and the control of traffic requirelarge police forces with adequate resources ana specialised equipment and alarge element of mobility.   The number of police forces outside London hasalready been reduced to 41 :   the number of unitary and metropolitan areas underthe proposals in the White Paper would be 56.   The Government agrees with theRoyal Commission that there should be one police force for tho whole of eachmetropolitan area (including now tho two additional areas) and that in the restof the country, the boundaries of police authorities and unitary areas shouldcoincide.   As the Royal Commission foresaw, however, a number of unitary areas will have to be combined for police purposes, and the Home Secretary will enterinto consultations to enable him to decide which combinations of areas would be most suitable.Fire2.    The Government will decide the areas for the future operation of the fire service after it has considered tho report of the Holroyd Committee.   The report will be published soon.   The committee told the Royal Conimission their view thatthe service should continue to bo provided by local government.Passenger transport autliori^ties3.    The Government accept the recommendation of the Commission that the rnetro-politan authorities for Merseyside, Selnec and the West Midlands, and the unitary-authority for Tyneside, should take over the responsibilities of the passenger transport authorities established under the Transport Act 1968.   The areas ofthe passenger transport authorities will be expanded to coinoide with those ofthe four new authorities.   In the rest of the country, the metropolitan andunitary authorities will assume control of any existing municipal transport undertakings in their areas.T/aterh.    The Royal Commission recommended that the new authorities should take over their predecessor&apos;s water undertakings, sewerage and sewage disposal functions and seats on river authorities.   Water undertakings owned by companies would note ^footed.   In a number of cases however it would not be possible simply totransfer local authority and joint board water undertakings to the new authorities,since the area of operation of many water undertakings overlap many of the new
locol authorities boundaries.   For this reason and because of the possible needfor more far reaching changes in the industry arising from the increasing inter-dependence of water conservation, water supply, pollution control and sewage disposal, the Government considered that a special study was needed.   The central advisory Water Committee was therefore reconstituted to give advice on organisa-tion in those fields.   The Committee&apos;s report should be available in time to betaken into account in the legislation to reorganise local government.National.Parks in England5.    The Eoyal Commission recommended that for each national park there shouldbe a special authority with the sole responsibility of administering the park.This proposal have received considerable support, in particular from the CountrysideCommission.   The Government accept the recommendation and will consult allconcerned on the constitution, functions and staffing of the new national parkauthorities.   In doing so, tho Government will bear in mind the interests of thepeople living in the national parks.   Country parks serve a more local purpose and the Government agree with the Commission that they should be administered by the unitary and metropolitan authorities within v/hose areas they lie.Youth Employment service.    The future of this service is at present under consideration.   TheGovernment expect to receive in the near future a report on the subject from theNational Youth Employment Service.   Further consultations with those concerned will be necessary before any decisions are taken.
