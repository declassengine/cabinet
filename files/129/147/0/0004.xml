tlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC VIA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)8th January, 1Q70COPY N00boCABINETIMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE on local AUTHORITY PERSONAL AND ALLIED SERVICES&quot;&quot;       (SEEBOHM REPORT)&quot;&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Local Governmentand Regional PlannmgI should like to make three points about the proposals In thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services on the implementation of the Seebohm Report (C(70) 3)cTiming2.      Given that the legislation will oblige local authorlfcfcs to appoint a social Services Committee and a department headed by an officer whoseselection will be subject to a measure of Ministerial control., we have todecide on when these obligations should come into force for authorities which are affected to varying degrees by the reorganisation of localgovernment,3,      It is common ground between the other Ministers concerned and myself that the obligations should not be imposed on all authorities at the outset.    There is no reason for delay over authorities in Greater London?but the 124 county councils and county borough councils in England outside london will all be affected by the discussions which will be going on aboutthe boundaries of the future Redcliffe-Maud authorities and the generaluncertainty which councillors and officers will feel about the effect of there organisation on their future    In addition to counties and county boroughsthere are some 30 larger county district councils exercising delegatedfunctions in the fields of health and welfare.    If such delegation schemes are modified or cancelled under the new Seebohm arrangements in advanceof general local government reorganisation, those affected would include some of the staff of these councils also,    The Seebohm Bill could eitheroblige all authorities to adopt the new Seebohm arrangements by 1st April,, 1971 unless they were given a stay by Ministers^  or it couldempower Ministers to impose the obligations on particular authorities bydates Ministers thought appropriate to the circumstances of each authority.
4, The other Ministers concerned favour the former (paragraphs 10-12of C(70) 3), While recognising the attractions of putting on the authoritiesan onus for making a case for delay, I still favour the latter^, becauses-(a) Applications for exemption may involve us in answering questions about boundaries for the new authorities which we should findembarrassing at that point of time.    We shall be better placed to avoid this if we keep the Initiative in our own hands,(b) If we proceed by way of exemptions and the exemptions provee inEngland outside Greater London, to cover mote than half the total,our general obligation will look rather ill-judged,(c) Proceeding by way of exemption clearly implies a tougher line,It Is one thing for central government to ask Parliament to imposee. uniform pattern oh authorities.    It Is another to force the paceagainst the judgment of the executive authorities about what timingis in the best interests of the services.    The latter does not seemto accord with our general attitude about relations with localgovernment.Permanence of statutory controls5,      I should like the Bill to place a specific time limit of, say^five or seven years on the new statutory requirements,    The ministers concerned with the social services would not (paragraph 9 of C(70) 3),Here again I see a risk of our being accused of failing, when it comes tothe point, to give practical effect to our professions about the independence of local government.Repeal of other controls6,      In the draft of the White Paper about the reorganisation of localgovernment, which I shall be circulating, there will be a passage,, on thelines of the Annex to this paper8 explaining that the Seebohm case Isexceptional, and that we shall be proposing the repeal of most other statutory obligations about local authorities1&apos; internal affairs,    I mentionthis now in the hope that at the same time as discussing the Seebohm issueswe can agree specifically that we should propose repeal of present statutory obligations about the appointment of committees or sub-committees? and of ministerial controls over appointments, except those affecting Police (whichis a special case in several ways) and National Park planning committees(which have to Include people drav/n f rom outside local government)? andthat this should be provided for in the Bill about reorganisation,, &apos; TheCommittees involved are those for education, youth employment, finance^,planning, diseases of animals and allotments? the most Important officerappointment Is that of Chief Education Officer,    We need not list them Inthe White Paper, but we should be ready to specify them in discussion.The draft paragraph in the Annex explains that the change has nothing to do with the importance of the servlces0o*2*&quot;
Conclusion70      I invite the Cabinet to agree that?-(a) in bringing the obligations about local authorities?5 organisation forthe Seebohm services into forces we should proceed positively andnot by way of exemptions(b) The BDl should place a time; limit on the statutory obligations inquestion?(c) the White Paper on reorganisation of local government should include a. paragraph on the lines of the Annex to this paper.Storey*s Gate, S0&apos;Wol68th january 1970
AjMEXDRAFT WHITE.^j ER&apos;.^Draft Para graph. .aAqu t J3 controls  oXs^o n   ut ho r i t i e s1 int o r na 1. business..The Commission, and the Committee on Management of LocalGovernment in more specific terms, recommended a reduction in control by central government in the internal administration of localauthorities.   The Government agree that in general the statutory requirements that authorities should maintain separate committees for specific purposes are absolete.   The same applies, in general, toprovisions requiring the assent of Ministers to the choice of officers for certain posts, and to limitations on the freedom of councils to delegate decisions to their officers. An exception which proves the rule is the organisation of the personal social services.    This group of services is fairly new, and for the time &quot;being needs special treatment; and the Government will be recommending Parliament to implement the recommendation of the Seobohm Committee that authoritiesshould he required to establish separate committees for this group of services, and that the appointment of the officers in charge should require Ministerial approval.   When these services are fullyestablished, the need for these provisions will disappear, just as, 51the Government&apos;s opinion, it has already disappeared elsewhere,(except over the Police, which is a special case in many ways, and bodies administering National Parks, which are not ordinary localauthority committees).    To say this does not, of course, imply for a mount that the importance of, for example, education committees hasdiminished: it means that the s services in question are now well established.
