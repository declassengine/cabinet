DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(70) 712th January, 1970CABINETCOMMISSION FOR INDUSTRY AND MANPOWERMemorandixra by the First Secretary of State and Secretary of Statefor Employment and ProductivityFollowing our last discussion on the draft Consultative document on the legislation to establish the Commission for Industry and Manpower(CC(69) 60th Conclusions^ Minute 2), I arranged for the Document, as revised in the light of our discussion, to be shown in the strictest confidence to the Confederation of British Industry (CBL) and to the Chairmen of the major nationalised industries.i.2.      The following paragraphs record the reactions of those to whom wehave shown the draft, and the outcome of further consideration of thepoints outstanding after our last meeting.COPY NO.1.0A-       Informal consultations3.      As agreed^ the draft Consultative Document was sent confidentiallyto the CBI and has been discussed both with the Director-General of the cbi and between the Minister of State and the President of the CBI.Their reactions v/ere generally on predictable lines.4.      They argued that the proposals represented a substantial extensionof the Governments powers to have searching inquiries made into thecommercial activities of individual firms? and the extension of the powers,in the existing Monopolies legislation to a wider range of situations.Although In many ways they preferred the speed and informality of theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) procedures, they expressed concern that the exercise of the Governments powers could be founded onrushed and inadequately informed Reports,    They were clearly particularlyfearful of the possible use of the price control powers (but they had notgrasped the significance of the conditions attached to the use of this power),-1-
50      The President of the CBI went further than these specific objections.He said that the proposals would seen to his members a turning point inGovernment intervention in industrial affairs.    It would appear to the cbi members that the Government was dropping all attempts to control theactivities of trade unions whether in industrial relations or pay claims, andwas instead seeking greater powers to control prices which could only leadto further reductions in industrial Investment.    A policy of this kind couldonly weaken generally the relations between industry and the Governmentwhich had begun to improve.60      I thin];; we must discount to some extent the suggestion that theproposed legislation would seriously damage our relations with industry.The CBI cannot be expected to like any extension of the scope of investigation into whether firms are behaving In a manner contrary to the public interest,and they were bound to express forceful opposition.    At the same time the move towards larger units is continuing strongly and public opinion is boundto be concerned with the implications of this, particularly with the growth of the multi-national company and the suggestion that this should bepositively promoted through a European Industrial reorganisation corporation,,7.      There is of course no way of getting round the fact that we are not including in the legislation any powers to delay implementation of pay settlements, whereas we are continuing the price control powers of the monopolies legislation.    I think however that there are other detailed points which could help to reduce the fears expressed by the C3I.    Tv7e could give further emphasis to the fact that the price control powers are to be exercisedonly in conditions where by definition competition is not fully effective.And we should certainly be able to make provisions on procedures whichwill offer reassurance that firms will be given a full opportunity to dealwith any suggestions that their conduct was contrary to the public interestbefore a Report Is issued.8.      I do not think however that the CBI reactions are such that we shouldchange our basic proposals.    But we should do what we can to frame fchsConsultative Document in terms which will meet as far as possible thepoints of clarification asked for by the GBL9o      Several chairmen of nationalised industries felt that the provisionfor efficiency audits should be so phrased as to make it clearer that present arrangements were being continued? they wished to avoid thesuggestion that it was necessary to take further new powers for yet moresearching inquiry into the affairs of the nationalised industries.    the document will make this clear.2-COMFIDEMTIAL
Bo        Top salaries in the public sector10c      The Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy has now discussed the matter further and has agreed that the legislation should make specific provision for the establishment of a self-reporting Panel within theCommission to review and advise on top salaries in the public sector.    Itis proposed that the Chairman of the Commission for Industry and Manpower(CIM) should be the Chairman of the Panel, together with five members ofthe CIMj selected by the Chairman after consultation with the Secretary ofState, and five additional members? v/ho are not members of the CIM,selected by the Secretary cf Scate after consultation with the Chairman ofthe CIM,    The intention would be that these additional members should beof special standing and experience appropriate to the consideration of matters affecting politically sensitive groups,11,       The groups covered by the Panel would be set out in a schedule tothe legislation and there would be power to add or subtract groups by direction.    The Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy are agreed thatthe consultative document sho\ud describe the coverage of the Panel as including such groups as Ministers, Members of Parliament, Peers (inrespect of payment for Parliamentary duties), the boards of majornationalised industries, senior civil servants and the most highly paidlocal authority officers.    As regards the judiciary, the Committee feltthat it would be in their interest for their salaries to be considered by the panel; but that it would be undesirable to insist on this over the opposition of the judges.    The Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate agreed to takeinformal and urgent soundings among the judiciary and their inclusion canbe reconsidered when the outcome is known,12.      The Committee felt that It was important that the reviews should beat regular intervals and as automatic as possible.    At the same time it isclearly necessary for the Government to be able to exercise some controlover timing as a review held, say, immediately before an election could be embarrassing.    The Committee felt these points could be met if thelegislation were to provide that reviews of the remuneration of the groupsconcerned should be initiated either by the Panel Itself after consultationwith the Secretary of State, or by the Secretary of State after consultationwith the Chairman of the Panel.    The objective would be to have a regularreview of all the groups every four years, with interim reviews for all the groups other than Ministers and Members of Parliament every two years.The first year for a review would be in 1971.13.      I propose that the conclusions of the Committee on the above points should be approved.    The only point not settled by the Committee was theinclusion of the judiciary in the description of the groups to be covered bythe Panel.    I still feel that their inclusion in the PaneFs scope would bedesirable in the judges- own interests provided that informal soundings havenot shown them to be firmly opposed to che idea,
14, If my colleagues approve these suggestions, I propose to includethe following additional paragraph, in the final veision of the consultative document, at the end of the section headed public Services&apos;*&quot;In addition, the Commission acting through a special Panelwill be asked to advise from time to time on the remuneration of such&quot; groups as Members of Parliament, Ministers of theCrown, senior civil servants, the Boards of nationalised industries and the highest paid group of local authority officers&quot;,Co       Elocedures of the Commission15,      At our last discussion the Cabinet agreed that reports should beissued with the authority of the Commission as a whole, and that thosereports need not be unanimous,    &quot;This v/as a change from the proposalsagreed by Ministerial Committee, and it raises a point which was not considered.    The present Monopolies legislation provides for the exerciseof the Governments powers following a report from the monopolies commission only where two-thirds of the Panel appointed for a particular reference find that the behaviour of the firms concerned is contrary to thepublic interest.,    There will certainly be pressure from the CBI to retainthis provision if reports by the new Commission need not be unanimous.But such a provision might in fact lead to a number of cases in which thenecessary two-thirds majority of the whole Commission was not secured,and where therefore it would not be possible to use the powers.    This didhappen in the&apos; case of the bank merger, which was put to the monopolies commission, and there was criticism that the Government put on pressure to stop the merger when the two-thirds majority had not been secured.16.      There are therefore three possibilities?(i) To accept the two-thirds majority provision, recognising thatthere will be cases when a particular finding may not carry a two-thirds majority of the whole Commission and where thepowers will not be usablej(ii) to refuse to renew the two-thirds majority provision, thusincreasing our difficulties with the CBI; or(iii) to reconsider the decision to provide for dissentient views andretain the practice of the NBPI.D.        Treatrnent of overseas assets17.      As was agreed in our previous discussion, there has been further discussion about the treatment of United Kingdom subsidiaries of overseasgroups.    It was proposed that, for the purposes of the assets limit whichis to be included in the legislation, the assets of a group should includechose held overseas (though the activities of a foreign parent company could-4-
not themselves be referred to the Commission):    There may be difficultiesboth in principle and in practice^  but on balance officials of the departmentsconcerned who have reconsidered the matter have concluded that advantages of proceeding In the manner proposed outweigh the disadvantagesD    Nor didthey feel that etich a proposal would be inconsistent with our general view on matters of national jurisdiction,,    I therefore propose to proceed withthe inclusion of overseas assets in the definition of capital employed onwhich the criteria in the 3111 will be based,E,        Local authority rents18.      The Minister of Housing has raised the question whether it wouldbe possible to refer to the Commission matters concerning local authorityrents.    He feels it would probably be better not to include this in theCommission^ field of operation.    I doubt if it is likely that v/e shall want to ask the Commission to look at the level of local authority rents.    Thedifficulty is that we can hardly exclude all local authority charges from theremit of the Commission since this would exclude not only rents but charges for local transport services, water charges, and possibly othei* commercialactivities cf some significance.    We should therefore need to make a specific exclusion of local authority rents.    And this might be politicallythe more difficult since the Minister of Housingrs powers in the new Rent Actlast only for a limited period,    I should, however, be glad of mycolleagues^ views on whether or not specifically to exclude rents frompossible reference to the Commission.Conclusion19.      The preparation of the legislation is now well under way and a Billshould be ready for Introduction In the second half of February,    The need to start formal consultations is now urgent?  indeed one of the points madeby the CB1 was that they should be given the longest possible time to seek the views of their members.    The above paragraphs complete thepreparation of the necessary preliminary work and I propose to issue the consultative Document as soon as possible.    I would propose to put copiesof the Document in the library of the House on 20th January, to send it tothe main interests concerned, and to hold a Press conference to explain the proposals.B,A,C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W,1.12th January, 1970
