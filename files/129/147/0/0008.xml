UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS5 GOVERNMENT)o qCJTOJJ COPY NO._____CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL, HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Seeial services a second Green Paper on the administrative reorganisation of theNational Health Service has been promised for early this year,,    I wouldlike to publish it as soon as possible after the publication of the White paper on the reorganisation of local government, to the contents of which it willbe closely related.2.      The lines on which the reorganisation of the National Health service should take place have been discussed on a number of occasions by the ministerial Committee on Social Services and I have also had confidentialconsultations with representatives of the local authority associations, someof the health service authorities and some of the professional and other workers in the Service, including the British Medical Association.    In thelight of these discussions and consultations I propose that the reorganisationshould be on the lines set out in the following paragraphs.Local government,      The main decision to be reached is whether the reorganisedNational Health Service should be put under local government control.On this, the general view in the Social Services Committee is that it mustbe placed outside local government.    This will be a controversial decisionbecause control by local government would dispose of the criticisms of thepresent system of wholly appointed hospital boards and committees andwould make much easier the necessary co-ordination of the health services with the personal social services that are to remain within local government,Moreover, the Royal Commission on Local Government in England went outof its way to say that the new local authorities would be suitable for controlling the National Health Service,4,      There are, however, two insoluble difficulties, at any rate in the foreseeable future - finance and the doctors.    Formidable additional expenditure would come under local authority control, and even if one could see a way through this difficulty, one is left with the implacable hostilitywhich the doctors have expressed to local authority control.
5.      My confidential- die cuss ions have, moreover, shown that fee localauthority associations themselves do not expect to be given controls    Whatthey really want - and I agree with these points and develop them later inthis memorandum - is that local authorities should appoint a reasonableproportion of the members of the health authorities? that there should be the closest possible collaboration between the local and health authorities;  andthat the dividing line betv/een the services for which the two sets of authorities are responsible should be an acceptable one060      On this footing I take the view that? at least in the foreseeable future,the reorganised National Health Service should not form part jf localgove rnment.Division of functions between National Health Service and social service departments of local authorities7.      The decision not to give administrative responsibility for the national health Service to local authorities means that a boxindary must be drawn forpurposes of administration between those services now provided by local health authorities which as personal health services would fall to betransferred to the new authorities, and those which as personal social services would appropriately pass to the new social service departments oflocal authorities under the Seebohrn Bill,    The Social Services committee agreed the division listed at Annex 1 for the purposes of outside consultations,,8.      The British Medical Association expressed strong views on two points.    They were most anxious that the Medical Officer of Health and his staff should become part of the integrated health service; and tha,t he shouldalso have a statutory responsibility for advising the new local authority onall health matters,,    Secondly they pressed for the new health authorities tohave administrative responsibility for a number of the services which it was proposed to allocate to the social service departments0    They hadparticularly In mind all services for the mentally disordered (with theexception at the junior training centres which are becoming the responsibilityof the education departments),90      There is no difficulty about the first point, as I propose that theMedical Officer of Health and certain members of his staff should betransferred to the new health authority and that he should advise the localauthority on health matters.    The real area of dispute relates to certain ofthe present functions of local health authorities, notably the mental health services,,    This genuine concern on the doctors part is matched by an equalconcern on the part of the social work profession for the unity of the personal social services.    Moreover if the unified health service is not to be localauthority run we shall want to leave as many services as we appropriatelycan in local authority hands.    In fact both professions have to work together and there is certainly scope for agency services on a mutual basis betweenhealth authorities and local government.    It seems clear that the line ofresponsibility should appropriately be drawn in the Bill betv/een those2-
services where the skills required are predominantly medical and thesewhich require predominantly social work skills including residential and daycare in the community.    In terms of the client the distinction lies between those who are able to live in the community and those who either needcontinuous medical care or are not yet ready for life in the community and need residential nursing care under medical supervision.    It would follow, therefore, that the health authorities should be given powers toprovide the &apos;halfway house&quot; type of residential accommodation for the mentally ill and handicapped who are not yet ready for life in the community?and since the borderline here is bound to be somewhat blurred there w.illsin practice, be some concurrency of powers to provide residential accommodation.    Full consultation will be  involved between the twoauthorities in each area on the diagnosis of the needs of individual cases,10. I accordingly now propose that the division of responsibilities shouldbe that set out in Annex 2.Main aims11,       Once firm decisions are reached that the reorganised national health Service should not form part of local government and on where thedividing line should be placed, a framework exists for considering what form the reorganisation itself of the National Health Service should take.While the second Green Paper must make It clear that the firm decisions are not open to reconsideration, the proposals for reorganising theNational Health Service in the context of those decisions would be putforward on the basis that they are open to public discussion and debate.12.      The proposals which in the rest of this paper I suggest should be putforward on this basis seek to secure the following main aims?(a) to create an integrated structure for the National Health Service,running parallel to, and, co-ordinated with the reformed structure of local government?(b) to provide for much more local sharing of responsibility; and toplace day-to-day operational control of the Service as near aspossible to the consumer?(c) in deciding the composition of the authorities, to give the localauthorities and the health professions a due share in themanagement of the Service? and(d) to provide much more effective central control than at present overthe money spent on the Service and to ensure that maximum value is received.
Structure and fuhc^gns13,      At present the Service is administered by a very large number of authorities,    in England alone the hospitals are run by 14 regional hospital Boards (under whom there are 299 Hospital MangemertCommittees) and 35 Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals!  the family practitioner ceiwic.es by 119 Executive Councils;  and the local health authority services by 187 local authorities - the County Councils (withsome delegation to large district councils) the County Borough Councils,and the London Borough Councils,    The boundaries for the three groups of services do not corresponds14,      The first Green Paper of July, 1968 proposed an integration of theseservice s, and suggested that they might be administered by about 40 or 50Area Boards (for England and Wales).    These Area Boards were howeverstrongly criticised as covering too large an area and being too remotefrom local feeling,    To meet this criticism I first considered a two tierstructure with areas smaller than the areas suggested in die first green paper, but with a regional tier above them,    My confidential consultationshave however shown &amp;iat such a structure would still be criticised as beingtoo remote, and would also be open to the criticism of being top-heavy,,Moreover, It would suffer from the disadvantages that caused the redcliffe-Maud Commission to abandon the two tier system of Countygovernment,    I propose, therefore, a simpler structure designed to complement the new unitary authorities.Area health authorities15,      My principal proposal is to establish some 90 area health authoritieto administer the integrated service, whose bounda.r5.es would correspond with these of the unitary areas and metropolitan districts proposed for local government.    My confidential consultations have emphasised the needfor the closest possible collaboration between the new health authoritiesand the new local authorities; this is particularly so in. relation to the personal social services, but it Is also the case in all other fields thatinvolve the public health.    Medical advice should be provided to the localauthority by the staff of the health authority, and social advice to the health authority by the staff of the local authority.    There is a great deal of roomtoo, for collaboration between the health and local authorities in other respects? the bulk supply of goods required by both, and the vise of computers are examples.16.      This close collaboration can be ensured only if the local authority is matched by a single health authority.    There will therefore be one suchhealth authority f or each unitary area and metropolitan district.    The onlydepartures I expect from this rule will be in Greater London, where it will:be necessary to group the areas of two or three London Boroughs in orderto form satisfactory health areas.-4-
17,      The scale of the services administered by most area health authorities would make it necessary to provide for administrative devolution to district management sub-committees.    The local district iswhere the day-to-day management must take place,, and where a districtmanagement body is needed to guide the paid officers and reach decisionsthat these officers cannot be expected co take on their own responsibility.These district committees would need to come into existence on theappointed day for the reorganisation of the National Health Service, andtheir number and areas would be determined by the needs of the health service,    I would, however, expect that there might prove to be asubstantial identity of pattern (though not of boundaries) with &apos;lie proposeddistrict committees of the new unitary local authorities,18,      The aim will be to place a great deal of the day to day work of running the. service at district level.    The districts will not, however,constitute a separate administrative tier? all administrative responsibilitywill rest in the area authority.    It will settle the areas of its constituentdistricts?  it will determine how much can be spent In the various districts(and in so doing will seek to secure a reasonable balance of services)?it will submit to the Central Department annually Its hospital capital programmes and enter into contracts for the schemes included therein,1it will itself plan and see to the execution of smaller capital works such ashealth centres?  it will be the legal employer of all staff including that atdistrict level? and It will have a general responsibility for the efficiency ofthe haalth services throughout Its area, even though their day-to-day administration is carried out by its district committees on its behalf,19. The area health authority will also be the body that establishes a statutory committee to enter into contracts for the provision of services by general medical and dental practitioners, pharmacists and opticians.Regional health councils20,      The size of the new area health authorities - which will bedetermined by the local government pattern and not by the need  of the health service - will make them too small for certain health planning purposes.    I have in mind such matters as the overall planning of hospital and specialist services (including the development and location of highly specialised medical services)?  the organisation of the provision of postgradtiate medical education and of the deployment of hospital medical,dental and scientific staff;  the organisation of staff training where this cannot be effectively organised within the compass of a single area health authority; and1 other functions such as the planning of the ambulance service21.      This points to the need for some 14 to 18 Regional health councilswhose areas would be similar to those of the present Regional hospital boards,    These Regional Councils would continue some of the work(particularly the planning work) of the Regional Hospital Boards,    But they/would  be entirely advisory and would not be placed in authority over the-5-
new area health authorities, which would have a direct relationship withthe Central Department,    Nor would they stand in the way o  theestablishment by the area health authorities of consortia where this seemsto offer the most satisfactory method of dealing with matters of common concern to several authorities.,22,     The relationship of the Regional Health Councils with theprovincial machinery ultimately established in the light of the recommenda-tions of the Redcliffe-Maud Report and. the Crowther Commission on theConstitution will need to be considered in due course.Central department23.     Under my new proposals, the control of the area authorities will beexercised directly by the Central Department,    The Central department will itself allocate money to each authority and approve its budget.    It willcontrol the capital building programme.    It will exercise any necessarymanpower controls.    It will take direct responsibility for supervisingthe efficiency of the services the area authority administers and securing that value is received for the resources allocated to the authority.    Thatthese central controls should be real and effective Is a matter to which I attach the utmost importance.24,       This direct relationship, while it will be strongly opposed in some quarters, particularly by the Regional Hospital Boards, will be welcomed by some parts of the Service, In particular.the teaching hospitals and thelocal health authority and family practitioner services where (unlike mostof the hospital service) there is no tradition of a regional tier.25,     In order to maintain an effective direct relationship with the newhealth authorities, the Central Department will need considerablereorganisation.    In particular there must be greatly strengthenedRegional Offices in the main centres of population to maintain close touchwith the area health authorities.    Centrally and through these regional offices, the Department would employ the professional staff needed for planning and designing, in consultation with the potential users, the hospitals Included in the national hospital building plan.    This will involve no net increase In the number of staff employed In the public sector;indeed the Introduction of a one tier system into the hospital service shouldproduce a net saving.    It will hov/ever involve a substantial Increase inthe number of staff employed by the Central Department,26.     There must also be an influential Central Council with a widelydrawn membership by no means wholly professional, which I would consulton all matters of importance to the National Health Service, Including the deployment of the available resources.    There will be a need for new national machinery to organise training for health service staff.    Therewill also be more importation Into the Central Department of staff fromthe Health Service.
Com^gsitig^1 c^ authorities273     These arrangements for strong control by the central Governmentmake it, in my view, unnecessary to insist on having a majority ofcentrally appointed members on the health authorities;; indeed thearrangements offer a much greater certainty of compliance with government policy than would be the case if one relied on working through appointedmembers.    Authorities with a majority of centrally appointed memberscannot in my opinion be regarded as offering a realistic alternative tolocal government controls it has become clear that to attempt to restrict the representational element of the local authorities, professions and universities to less than a half of the membership of the area authorities would be completely unacceptable,Local authorities28,     This viewpoint has been argued with particular cogency on behalfof the local authority associations on the following groundsi(a) that the social services.. Including the health services, are completely Interdependent, and the local authorities alreadyplay a major role in their provision within policies laid downby the Government?(b) that the changes Introduced as a result of the Royal Commission^report will strengthen local government and equip It to play sucha role even more effectively in the future?(c) that the unification, separately, of the administration of the health services,on the one hand and that of the Seebohm social services on the other will necessarily create difficult operationalproblems at points along the lines of demarcation; but that these will be less serious the greater the participation In the health service of the local authorities who will be running the social services? and(d) tha,t the local authority, being composed of elected members,would reflect the views of the users of the services, as well aspresent an overall local authority view,29.     I propose to concede to the local authorities one-third of the seatson the new area health authorities,,    To those who suggest that this extentof local authority membership is dangerously large, I would point out thatin the scheme that I have outlined I would retain full control over totalexpenditure on the health service and would have available all the presentadministrative controls of advice and guidance, the setting of standards andthe indication of national priorities and, in the last resort, the pov/er of direction.    The area within which the local authority members couldeffectively exert an influence would be in the choice of priorities within theprovision the Government makes available,    I believe this is a role whichelected representatives are particularly well-fitted to fulfil.-7-CO NFS DENTS AL
30,     Finance for the National. Health Service will continue to be provided in the main from central funds.    The local authority associations believethat the identification of the local government members with the interestsof the health seivlce would be greatly aided if there were a contribution,even a small one, from local authority sources.    This suggestion seemsto be worth further consideration, but it might best be pursued In the context of local government finance generally rather than In that of the green Paper on the administrative organisation of the National health service,Pjipfejssijamj3L      I would wish to offer broadly the same representation to the health professions.    The third of the membership allocated to them would be socomposed as to give the medical profession as near a.s possible to the25 per cent share of the total seats which they have traditionally had on some National Health Service authorities and for which they are pressing.The remaining professional seats would be filled by members of otherhealth occupations, particularly dentists, nurses and midwives.Proposal on composition32,     My proposal on the composition of the area health authorities istherefore that the membership should be divided into three roughly equalgroups.    One third, and the Chairman, would be appointed by me; a thirdby the local authorities, and a third by the health professions and universities,33,     In view of the importance of obtaining Chairmen of the necessarymanagerial calibre who can devote sufficient time to the work, I proposethat the Chairman (who would be appointed by me) should receive a part&quot;time salary, at a rate to be settled later.    Unless salaries are introduced in local government (in which case I would want to reopen the matter), allthe remaining members would receive only travelling expenses,subsistence allowances and any attendance allowances paid in localgovernment.34.     The application of these principles to the area health authority would produce a composition on the lines of that given in Annexes,35,     The role assigned to the regional health councils in paragraphs 20and 21 hat considerable implications for the composition.    A substantial number of the members would be appointed by me; the rest v/ould be drawn from the area1 authorities.    Thus each area authority v/ould appoint amember to the regional council (who might well be the Chairman of thearea authority) and the professions v/ould be requested or even required toappoint people who are on the area authorities.    The planning role of the regional council would make the professional and University membershipparticularly important.    The exact size and composition of each regionalcouncil would depend on the number of area authorities in its region.
General35.     I seek the Cablnefs agreement that firm decisions should be taken on the following matters?(a) that the reorganised National Health Service, while closely linked with local government, should not form part of it (paragraphs 3to 6)1 and(b) that the dividing line between the National Health Service and thesocial service departments of local authorities should be as setout in paragraphs 7 to 10037.     I also ask the Cabinet to agree that the reorganisation of the national health Service should be based on the principles set out in paragraph 12;and that the second Green Paper, while making it clear that the decisions in paragraph 35 are firm and not open to debate, should set out theremaining proposals outlined in this paper - without the Government beingfinally committed to them at this stage - as a basis for further publicconsultation and debate against the background of the decisions that will then have been announced about local government reorganisation and theSeebohm Bill,&apos;RoH0So C0Department of Health and Social Security, S.E.1.12th January, 1970i^9-
