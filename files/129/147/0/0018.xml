THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEFOREWORDThe first Green Paper on the National Health Service in England and wales was published by my predecessor in July, 1968 while the Royal Commissionon Local Government in England was still at work. It contained &quot; tentativeproposals ... as a basis for wide public discussion and consultation with representative bodies &quot;. It sparked off a vigorous discussion inside and outsidethe service. Over 400 sets of written comments have been received and 1 have discussed these proposals with representatives of nearly fifty organisations.The Royal Commission has now reported and the Government has announcedits decisions on the future structure of local government in England in theWhite Paper which has just been published. The Government has now alsoleached three firm decisions concerning the health services. First, it has decided,for reasons given later, that the National Health Service will not be administered by local government but by area health authorities directly responsible to me and closely associated with local authorities. Secondly, it has decided on theadministrative boundary which must as a consequence be drawn between theNational Health Service and the public health and personal social services which will continue to be administered by local authorities. Thirdly, it hasdecided that in general the number and areas of the new health authorities mustmatch those of the new local authorities the unitary areas and the metropolitandistricts outside London. On other questions, this paper contains revised proposals for England on which there is now a further opportunity for commentbefore final decisions are taken.The paper does not cover Wales or Scotland. The Secretary of State for wales will shortly be publishing a separate Green Paper. The Secretary of State forScotland is reviewing the proposals in his Green Paper of December, 1968 inthe light of the comments received and the consideration being given to thereport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland.Most of those who commented on the Green Paper of July, 1968 endorsedits central theme the need to weld together the three parts of the health service at every level to form an integrated service. Differing views were expressed aboutthe precise point at which the line should be drawn for administrative purposesbetween the health service and other social services, but all wanted to see close co-ordination between them. There were, however, three strong criticisms of theproposals which were expressed from many quarters. First, the proposal toplace the responsibility for providing health services on 40 to 50 area boardswith no participation of local people below this level would have made theday-to-day running of the health service too remote from the people it servesand would have made it necessary to devolve excessive powers on the officersof the boards. Secondly, many feared that the boards might be dominated bythe hospital service. Thirdly, there was concern that no provision had beenmade for regional planning. On the other hand, many of those who condemnedthe size and remoteness of the proposed boards wanted to see integrated health authorities large enough to take extensive responsibility for the control of local health services.
I accept the argument that in a reorganised health service there must bemore, not less, local participation. This does not, however, make it necessaryto establish further statutory authorities below the area level. The need for local participation can best be met by district committees of the area health authority on which people drawn from the local community and peopleworking in the local health service can contribute to the work of running the districts services. The need to secure close co-ordination between the health and other social services underlies the Governments decision that the number and boundaries of the area health authorities will, in general, be the same as for the new unitary and metropolitan district authorities. Instead of 40 to 50area boards, there will be about 90, including those in London. Finally, I accept the need for planning on a regional basis, particularly on the hospitalfront. I therefore propose to set up 14 or more regional health councils. their main task, and one of major importance, will be to advise me and the area health authorities on the hospital and specialist plans for the regions. Theywill also carry special responsibility for the organisation of postgraduate medical education and exercise other functions appropriate to a body of thiskind. But the maximum authority, consistent with my own responsibility andaccountability to Parliament, will be concentrated at the area level where,through the inclusion of elected local councillors and members of the health professions in the area authorities, representatives of the local communitywill be able to play a full part in the running of the National Health Service.These are the main differences between my proposals and those published inthe earlier Green Paper.This, too, is a Green Paper and apart from the three matters already mentioned upon which firm decisions have been taken the Government isnot yet finally committed to the proposals made in it. Some of the arrangements have yet to be worked out in detail: for example, the functions and constitutionof regional health councils; the relationship between the area health authoritiesand the local authorities in regard to arrangements for sharing or exchangingservices; and the functions of the district committees. Meanwhile, I shallwelcome comments and suggestions both from organisations and individuals.I shall, of course, be discussing the proposals fully with the representatives ofthe staff who would be affected by them.The future of the National Health Service is of vital concern to all whopay for it as well as to all who use it. My main aim in making these proposal is to secure that the total health needs of each individual patient and eachfamily will be met by one integrated health service. The removal of the presentadministrative barriers between the different parts of the service will enableeveryone working at every level of the health service to plan, administer and provide for the comprehensive health needs of every citizen.RICHARD CROSSMANSecretary of State for Social Services

THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW HEALTH service. The National Health Service was built on four fundamental principles.Though the service has not yet achieved all its objectives, these principleshave stood the test of time: (i) The health service should be financed by taxes and contributions paidwhen people are well rather than by charges levied on them when theyare sick; the financial burden of sickness should be spread over thewhole community. In practice, the cost of the service has increasedso rapidly that it has not always been possible to maintain this prin-ciple. But a &quot; free &quot; service in this sense is still right in principle, ftencourages preventive medicine and early treatment, relieves the sickof financial anxiety, and collects the money when people can afford to pay it.(ii) The service should be national in the sense that the same high quality of service, but not a standardised service, should be provided in every part of the country. In the twenty-one years since the National health service was created there has been some (though not sufficient) levellingup of areas which were medically impoverished before 1948. Doctors particularly consultants are now more evenly distributed over thecountry. Although there is still more to be done, specialist services are within reach of all. Hospitals outside the main centres of populationhave been upgraded within the limits set by antiquated buildings.But considerable differences in standards still remain. Further levellingup of resources, particularly of trained staff, is needed especially inthe Midlands and the North to provide the same high quality ofservice all over England. There are also unjustifiable differences between the average standards of care provided for long stay hospitalpatients the elderly, the mentally ill and handicapped and the standards of care provided for short stay hospital patients. In theservices paid for partly from local rates, standards of services alsodiffer because of the differing demands made on local authorities andthe differing priorities they give to their health services.(iii) The service should provide full clinical freedom to the doctors working in it.(iv) The service should be centred on the family doctor team. The general practitioner provides the essential continuity to the health care of each individual and each family and mobilises the services needed. his ability to do so can, however, be limited by the administrative barriersbetween the different parts of the service. Originally it was intended that the different parts of the service would be coordinated in health centres. Until recently these have been slow in developing. There has,however, been a rapid growth of group practice and of attachment ofhealth visitors, midwives and domiciliary nurses to family doctors.2. There have been striking improvements in standards of health during the twenty-one years since the National Health Service was established. The maininfectious diseases which were once the major cause of death of people of
working age have been virtually eliminated as health problems. As a result of the dental services provided under the Act the standard of dental health throughoutthe country has greatly improved. The death of mothers in child birth is sorare that each is made the subject of a special investigation. The proportion ofBritish children who die in the first year of life is among the lowest of allcountries in the world. People in Britain live longer than in most other countries.Subject only to the heavy toll of accidents, most people now live to face thedegenerative diseases of old age. Not all this progress is due to the establishmentof the National Health Service, but much of it must be due to the virtual removalof financial and geographical barriers to the use of health services, and to theincrease in resources which have been devoted to the health service.3. But more could be achieved if the service were not still divided into threeparts. The hospital and specialist services are provided through regional hospital Boards, Boards of Governors and Hospital Management Committees.The family doctor, general dental, ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services are provided through Executive Councils. The local health authorities providematernity and child care, midwifery, home nursing, health visitors, health centres, home helps, ambulances, mental health social work services, after-care,chiropody, vaccination and immunisation, health education and other preven-tive health services. Outside the National Health Service is the school health service provided by local education authorities.4. Local health and education authorities are controlled by elected localauthority members. Hospital authorities are controlled by members many ofwhom are suggested by the professions, local government, the universities,trade unions, voluntary organisations and other bodies. But the final selection of people to serve on hospital authorities is made by the Secretary of state in the case of Regional Hospital Boards and by Regional Hospital Boards inthe case of Hospital Management Committees. The Boards of Governors of teaching hospitals are nominated one fifth by the university, one fifth by the doctors and dentists undertaking clinical teaching, and one fifth by the regional hospital Board in whose region the hospital lies, with the remainder appointeddirectly by the Secretary of State. About half the members of Executive councils are appointed by the professions, a quarter are appointed by the Secretary ofState and a quarter by the local health authority.5. The money which pays for the hospital and Executive Council services is,apart from relatively minor sums paid by patients, raised in taxes and national health Service constributions. It is distributed by the Secretary of State to regional Hospital Boards, Boards of Governors and Executive Councils. Themoney which pays for the local authority health services and the school health service comes (again apart from minor sums paid by patients) from the rates andthe rate support grant.6. The proposed reorganisation of the National Health Service must aim tostrengthen, develop and reinforce the original principles upon which it is based.The proposals in this Green Paper have four main objectives: (i) To unite the National Health Service. Not only must the differentbranches be controlled by the same authority but the separate services must be integrated at the local level.
(ii) To establish close links between the National Health Service and thepublic health and social services provided by local government.(iii) To place the maximum responsibility for administering the national health Service, consistent with national plans and priorities, on area health authorities in which there must be strong local and professionalparticipation, and to involve each community in the running of theservices of its district.(iv) To provide effective central control over the money spent on theservice and to ensure that the maximum value is obtained for it.7. These four aims unification, co-ordination, local participation and effectivecentral control must be achieved if the weaknesses of the present service are to be countered. The reorganised National Health Service should also provide an administrative structure in which ill-health prevention and healthpromotion can be given a fresh and stronger emphasis.
THE CASE FOR UNIFICATION8. The case for unification is now widely accepted. Full co-ordination of theNational Health Service cannot be achieved in a service run by no fewer than168 bodies which are either agents of or regulated by the Secretary of State(119 Executive Councils, 35 Boards of Governors and 14 Regional hospital boards), by 299 agents of the 14 Regional Hospital Boards (Hospital Manage-ment Committees), and finally by 158 local health authorities which have onlya limited responsibility to the Secretary of State.9. Joint planning is obstructed by the sheer number of administrative authorities of varying size serving different populations. The areas from which hospital management Committees or Boards of Governors draw most of their patientsoften cross the frontiers of several local authorities. Few local health authoritiesneed to deal with fewer than three different hospital authorities; some in Londonhave to deal with considerably more. In the case of patients with mental illnessor handicap some hospitals may be located many miles from the local authorityarea from which their patients are drawn. If a Regional Hospital Board tries toact as co-coordinator for its region it can find itself negotiating with as many as20 different authorities, including Boards of Governors of teaching hospitalswhich are not under its jurisdiction. There is one Regional Hospital board which has as many as 13 teaching hospitals in its region.10. The problems of co-ordination have been eased by a variety of liaisonand other committees established for different purposes in different areas.Such committees, however, cannot resolve the problems but can only ease them.If all the co-ordinating committees were established which needed to beestablished, some officers and members would be left with little time for theessential work of running the particular service for which each authority is responsible.11. Two practical consequences result from this multiplicity of authorities.First, they impede the ultimate aim of meeting the needs of individual patients and their families comprehensively. Secondly, the limited resources providedfor the National Health Service are at risk of being wasted or used to less thanfull advantage. For example, at heavy cost the hospital service cares for patientswho could well be treated at home if the right local services were available on alarge enough scale. Many patients are in hospital who could live outside, would prefer to live outside and would fare better outside. In many such cases care athome with the support of the community health services would be the betterand the cheaper solution. At the same time other patients who really need care in hospital make demands on the local authority services while they wait to beadmitted.12. Often the barrier to discharge from hospital is the lack of adequate services for people who would prefer to stay in their own homes. When deciding whatpriority to give to their health services as against the competing needs of their other services, it is clearly difficult for local authorities to take full account ofthe advantages which would accrue to the health service as a whole. It is not surprising that local authorities, faced as they are by many competing needs,
may often not be able or ready to spend money from the rates on caring for patients who are being looked after by the hospital service but could be dis-charged. At present neither the hospitals&apos; resources nor those of local health authorities are used to maximum advantage.13. The administrative divisions of the service make it difficult to secure theflexible use of staff or continuity of relationships for users of the health service.For example, the staff of the maternity unit of a hospital in which a baby hasbeen delivered does not necessarily continue the care of the mother after she isdischarged from hospital. One social worker employed by a local authority maybe helping a patient at home while another with a different employer may help the same patient in hospital. Each has to establish a relationship with the patient; each has to identify the problem of the patient and his family; each hasa different loyalty.14. The tripartite division of the National Health Service gave administrativereinforcement to the evolving trend of separation between general practice and hospital practice. The cleavage between the hospital service and the ExecutiveCouncil services does not help communication between family doctors and hospital doctors. In the hospitals, the doctor and the nurse are employedby the same branch of the health service, but outside, the family doctor under contract with the Executive Council leads a domiciliary team of health visitor,midwife and district nurse, some or all of whom owe ultimate allegiance to alocal health authority; he may also practice from premises provided by theauthority.15. The Royal Commission on Medical Education has recently emphasised theimportant role for general practice in the future but this role cannot be ful-filled unless there is the closest link between medicine practised in and out of hospital. Moreover the family doctor must be provided with the tools to do hisjob and this means full access to pathological, radiological and other diagnosticfacilities which are provided at the hospital but should be regarded as services for the district. Greater mutual confidence and closer co-operation betweenconsultants and family doctors can prevent the unnecessary use of out-patientdepartments. A unified health service will give a new priority to developing theservices provided by family doctors. Neither consultants nor general practitionerscan be self-sufficient: they can only do their work effectively if they do it together.16. Unification is needed to secure the co-ordinated planning of the servicesof each district and the more effective deployment of local resources. But itis also needed to improve team work and ease the problem of communication.If all local health personnel worked within one local service there would be abetter foundation for the provision of integrated health care. In this service thefocus must be not on the particular institutions in which or from which health services are delivered, but on the needs of each patient for which these institutionswere created.17. It is the need to remedy these deficiencies and to meet those needs whichare not at present fully met that dictates the kind of unified service required.The existing division of the service into three parts must be abolished in fact aswell as in name. All decisions on staffing, planning and the deployment of re-sources must be governed by the total health needs of each area. One authority
must be responsible for the National Health Service in each area and it mustadminister the services of each district as a whole. Only if there is a total mergerof hospital and community health services in the administration of both district and area services will resources be efficiently deployed to meet the needs of eachpatient.
AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIESAdministration by local government?18. The Royal Commission on Local Government in England suggested that consideration should be given to the possibility of unifying responsibility forthe National Health Service within the new system of local government. Theyemphasised two main advantages of this proposal. First, they believed that therewas no doubt that democratic control of the health services would be muchmore effectively secured by putting them under the control of local authoritiesdirectly answerable to the electorate and to the citizens at large. Secondly,local authority control would give a better chance of establishing close relation-ships between the health services and the personal social services.19. The Government accepts the force of these arguments but has neverthelessdecided that the course recommended is unacceptable for two main reasons.First, the professions believe that only a service administered by special bodieson which the professions are represented can provide a proper assurance ofclinical freedom. Secondly, the independent financial resources available tolocal authorities are not sufficient to enable them to take over responsibilityfor the whole health service. The scale of the problem can be illustrated thus:central Government expenditure on the National Health Service (about 1,400 million a year) is nearly as great as the present yield of rates, and about three-quarters of the total of present government grants to local authorities.The transfer of financial responsibility would seriously complicate the problem,now being considered by the Government following the Royal Commission^Report, of how to give the new local authorities a degree of financial indepen-dence corresponding to their responsibilities.20. The Government has carefully considered the suggestion of the RoyalCommission that, as a possible alternative to direct local government controlof the National Health Service, the relationship between elected representatives and the passenger transport executives responsible for the day-to-day running of services under the Transport Act 1968 should be examined for its relevanceto the administration of a unified health service. This would not, however,resolve the problem of clinical freedom. Nor would it offer a relevant financialmodel: transport services are largely self-financing. For the health services,the main potential advantages of local government control would not berealised. The less direct the control of health services exercised by localauthorities, the greater the loss of community participation; if health services are to be made responsive to local and indeed individual needs, there must becloser involvement of members of health authorities in the running of health services than is customary in the case of public transport services. Secondly,the co-ordination between the health and personal social services would beharder to achieve if the health services were run by semi-autonomous bodies.Moreover, such bodies would not be accountable in detail for the money theyspent either to the local authorities or to the Secretary of State.
The establishment of area health authorities21. For these reasons, the Government has concluded that the unified national health Service cannot be directly or indirectly controlled by local authorities,and that special area health authorities must be established to administer it.Common areas of administration22. Because of the importance of close collaboration and co-ordination of services, the Government has arrived at the firm view that the new area health authorities must serve the same areas for which the new local authorities willbe providing personal social services the unitary areas and the metropolitandistricts outside London. In Greater London, where the local governmentpattern has already been reorganised, some boroughs are small geographicallyor have special characteristics which make them unsuitable for the separateplanning and operation of health services. The concentration of teaching hospitals in Inner London further complicates the situation. In most cases, therefore, theareas of two or three London boroughs will be grouped to form a single area health authority. But even in London, the areas of the health authorities will comprise whole boroughs: no borough will be divided for health purposes.Proposals for London are set out in Appendix I.23. Though area health authorities will have responsibilities for defined areas,this will not prevent patients from using services outside the boundary of their area authority: they will, for example, be able to receive treatment from a family doctor, dentist, or hospital in an area outside that in which they live. Nor willit mean that an area health, authority cannot administer an institution, such asa hospital annex, which is situated in the area of another authority. Jointarrangements may also need to be made between area health authorities whenthe needs of an individual cannot be met within his own area.Membership24. At present the hospital service is controlled by over 5,000 appointed&quot; volunteers &quot; who give considerable time to this work without payment for it;the ultimate selection of all members of Regional Hospital Boards and boards of Governors is made by the Secretary of State and the ultimate selection of all members of Hospital Management Committees is made by Regional hospital boards. The substantial development of the hospital service during the lasttwenty-one years is to a considerable extent due to the devoted and largelyunacknowledged work of the members of these Boards and Committees.Nevertheless, the system under which they are appointed has been criticised as&quot; undemocratic &quot;. It is said that many hospital authorities are in practicecontrolled by self-perpetuating oligarchies. Members of Hospital management committees, as agents of agents of the Secretary of State, have a particularlyslender democratic basis.25. The new area health authorities must be more clearly representative oftheir areas and of the professions working in the area&apos;s services. The Govern-ment therefore proposes that area health authorities should consist of one thirdof members appointed by the health professions, one third appointed by thelocal authorities and one third plus the chairman appointed by the Secretary ofState. This will introduce a powerful element of local participation and at the
same time help to promote co-ordination with the other services of the area.The Government hopes that local authorities will include among their represent-atives members of their personal social services committees, and others with aspecial interest in services which have a health aspect. The inclusion of membersof education committees in Inner London and the proposed metropolitandistricts where education will be a responsibility of the Inner London EducationAuthority or the metropolitan area authority will need special consideration.26. At present the medical profession holds about a quarter of the places onhospital authorities and half the members of Executive Councils are drawn from the professions. It has also increasingly been the practice to appoint atleast one nurse to each hospital authority. But only in the case of Boards of governors of teaching hospitals have the professions been free to select theirown representatives on hospital authorities. The Government proposes thatthe main health professions, and this includes the dental and nursing professions,should have the right to select their representatives for their third of the placeson the new area health authorities. The local professions must shoulder their share of responsibility for the management of the health services in their area which they so largely provide.27. The chairman and the remaining third of the members would be appointedby the Secretary of State. The intention would be to choose these members for their relevant experience, interest and readiness to devote their energiesto the administration and development of the health service. Where a health authority covers an area which includes a medical school, representatives ofthe appropriate university will also be included in the membership to ensurethat the interests of medical and dental education and research are safeguardedand that related scientific expertise is available. An area health authority mightconsist of 20-25 members.28. In view of the heavy responsibilities which will fall on the chairmen of area health authorities, the Government proposes to pay them part-timesalaries, on a basis to be settled later. The members of the area health authorities would receive travelling expenses, and subsistence and related allowances.The boundary of the National Health Service29. An administrative division has to be made between the National health service and the services which are to remain with local government particularly the personal social services. Health needs and social needs overlap and shadeinto one another; as a result any dividing line cannot fail to create problemsof definition at the border. Many opposing views have been expressed on theprinciples which should determine the frontier. Should provision be made within an integrated health service for social needs which are ancillary to orarise out of medical needs? When the social need is predominant, should themedical need be met as part of a social welfare service? Should services be organised according to the label of the user the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped, the convalescent, the aged, or women needing maternity services ?Or should they be organised according to the skill of the provider?30. Many of those who commented on the first Green Paper argued that unless a wide range of services for social support were brought under the control
of the health authority there would be a damaging split between preventiveand curative medicine, and an insufficient guarantee that personal social services would be provided when they were needed to support the medical services.For example, if the residential and home care services for the mentally ill andmentally handicapped formed part of the personal social services, the processof medical assessment might be neglected. If home help services were provided as part of these social services, they might not be available to prevent admission to hospital or support a policy of early discharge from hospital. Thus needsmight go unrecognised, the care given to individuals and their families wouldbe fragmented and the limited resources available for health and personal social services would not be deployed to the best advantage.31. After carefully considering the contrasting views expressed on thesequestions, the Government has decided that the services should be organisedaccording to the main skills required to provide them rather than by anycategorisation of primary user. Any alternative would involve the establishmentof more than one local service deploying the same skill. Broadly speaking, thedecision is that the health authorities will be responsible for services where the primary skill needed is that of the health professions, while the local authorities will be responsible for services where the primary skill is social care or support.The scarce skills of professional people will be used to greatest advantage if those of each profession are marshalled and husbanded by one agency in each area. Moreover it will more often be possible to provide for users the advantages of continuity of care by one professional worker of any one discipline. Classi-fication of services by skill will also help to enhance professional standards.32. The application of this principle means that the various services making upthe school health service will be brought within the integrated National health service. The services will be provided by doctors, especially paediatricians andgeneral practitioners, dentists, nurses, and others in the employment of, or incontract with, the area health authority. Their close contact with the schools will be maintained. At the same time, the new arrangements will help to securecontinuity in the medical and dental care of children from birth through theirschool days. This continuity will be beneficial whether a child is in good health or has a physical or mental handicap that calls for constant medical supervision and perhaps special educational arrangements. There will be other benefits too, notably a closer association between what is provided as part of theschool health service and what is provided for the child and his family by general practitioners, other community health workers and hospitals. The risk of dupli-cation of services will also be avoided and there will be opportunities for improved efficiency in the use of medical, dental and nursing staff.33. The service will continue to be provided in a manner acceptable to the localeducation authority and its staff. Medical examinations will as now be fitted in with educational requirements. Similarly, there is no reason why the presentgood working relationships between the teachers and the doctors, dentists and nurses should not continue.34. These links need to be supported by suitable administrative arrangements ofthe kinds described later in this Paper.
35. The home help service, on the other hand, will be part of the local authoritysocial services. Even though home helps may often be needed by patients of the health service, the overall assessment of need for a home help is essentially a social rather than a health assessment. In the case of the services for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped, the essential medical diagnosis, treat-ment, assessment and reassessment will be undertaken by the staff of the health authorities in the same way as the assessment and medical management ofassociated physical disabilities. Local authority social services will be respon-sible for providing the adult training centres, though medical assessmentsmay be undertaken in them and also for social work with the mentallydisordered. The area health authorities will be responsible for hospital and hostel services for the mentally ill or handicapped who need con-tinuing psychiatric supervision including those who are being considered fordischarge and need a trial period in a hostel where the practicability of discharge can be further assessed. Residential care for those who are ableto manage without continuing psychiatric supervision will be provided by localauthorities.36. The area health authorities will thus administer the following services:the existing hospital and specialist services;the existing family practitioner services;the following services at present provided by local health authorities:ambulances,epidemiological work (general surveillance of the health of thecommunity),family planning,health centres,health visiting,home nursing and midwifery,maternity and child health care,prevention of illness, care and after care, through medical, nursing and allied services (including chiropody, health education other than its place in the school curriculum and screening),residential accommodation for those needing continuing medicalsupervision and not ready to live in the community,vaccination and immunisation;the school health service.37. The Government will consider further where responsibility for the childguidance service should lie.38. Though the area health authorities would provide services for people whosuffer injury or ill-health however caused and would be responsible for preven-tive health measures of many kinds, they would not have a specific responsibilityfor occupational health. The general arrangements for occupational health
(which are the responsibility of the Department of Employment and Productivityas the Department most closely concerned with conditions of employment) are set out in Appendix II.39. This list of responsibilities should be read alongside those which theGovernment has decided should be exercised by the local authority social services. In addition to the social services at present provided for the elderly,the handicapped and the homeless, and the children^ services, local authorities will be responsible for the following services which are at present provided under health powers: family case work and social work with the sick and the mentally disordered;day centres, clubs, adult training centres and workshops for the above;the day care of children under five, day nurseries and child-minding;the care of unsupported mothers, including residential care;residential accommodation for those who cannot live at home but do not need continuing medical supervision;home helps.40. Local authorities will retain their responsibilities for public health matters.The following public health services will continue to be administered bythem: the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases other than byspecific prophylaxis or treatment;food safety and hygiene;port health;the public health aspects of environmental services;diseases of animals in so far as they affect human health;enforcement responsibilities relating to environmental conditions at workplaces;health education (a power concurrent with that of the health authorities).41. This allocation of responsibilities means that, for a time, Medical Officersof Health will be in charge of departments with more limited responsibilitiesthan they now exercise. These responsibilities will, however, continue to be considerable and in addition they will be closely involved in preparations forthe new health service structure.
COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTExchange of services42. Any line drawn between the health services and the personal social services can scarcely avoid creating difficulties at particular points. There will need tobe close consultation between the area health authorities and the local authori-ties about their respective development plans and about individual difficulties.This will be promoted by the arrangements proposed for local authority repre-sentation on area health authorities; it would be further helped if health authority members were co-opted on to the social services and other relevantcommittees of local authorities. Moreover, each authority would look to theother for advice on subjects on which it has no adviser on its own staff and their officers would regularly consult on matters of common interest and wouldexploit opportunities for joint action where this would be mutually advanta-geous hence the built-in interdependence of these proposals.43. Each type of authority will be able to undertake work for the other. Theremay, for example, be advantages in extending the scope of bulk supply arrange-ments made by the area health authorities or by the local authorities to cover both health service and local government needs. Joint arrangements might alsobe made for vehicle maintenance and for the use of computers. Where localauthorities are sponsoring major developments, for instance new towns, therequirements of the health service might be included as part of such projects.44. These are only a few examples of where partnership might be of benefit.The advantages and practicability of such arrangements would depend on local circumstances and on the needs and resources of the authorities directly concerned. These suggestions, and those relating to staff that are made in thefollowing paragraphs, will be discussed with the professional and local authority associations and other bodies concerned, as part of the consultations on the green Paper. The exact arrangements for the reimbursement of expenditure will also need to be worked out.45. The medical, dental, nursing and midwifery staff and some of the other staff in the health departments of the local authorities would transfer to theservice of the area health authorities. Similarly, the social work staff of thehospital authorities might transfer to the local authorities. The new localauthorities will, however, have a continuing need for medical advice and services and the new health authorities will have a continuing need for socialadvice and services. It is intended that each of the two parallel authorities willprovide advice and services to the other.46. Social workers would be made available by the local authority to serve the hospitals or the community health services centred on the general practitioner.There would be advantages in efficiency, flexibility, career structure and con-discontinuity if social workers who gave a substantial proportion of their time to workin the health service were seconded to the area health authority. At the same timelocal authorities will need medical officers, full-time or part-time, for such work as the examination of people arriving at sea ports and airports. Such staff mightsimilarly be seconded to the local authority. Medical attendance on people in
the care of the local authority, for example, children and old people in hostelsand homes, can continue to be provided by the patients own general practitionerwho would call in specialist help where necessary.47. More generally, local authorities will need health advice in the planning and running of their personal social services, housing and general environmental services and in exercising their statutory responsibilities for public health. the senior officers of the area health authority will be available to give this advice.For example, in addition to medical advice and services, the local educationauthority may need advice and services from the dental and nursing staff of thearea health authority and may need health visitors to help generally with theeducation services and with health education in schools. There will also be a continuing need for close collaboration between the medical staff of the area health authorities and the local authorities&apos; public health inspectors. This willbe particularly necessary for the control of outbreaks of communicable diseaseor food poisoning where the Public Health Laboratory Service will also continueto have an important role. Some outbreaks demand immediate and concerted action by all concerned to prevent the spread of the disease and to treat those already infected. The chief administrative medical officer of the area health authority should be able both to call for information needed for health purposes and to act with the help of family doctors, health visitors and hospital staff andof public health inspectors.48. One possible way for local authorities to meet their statutory requirements and administrative needs would be for them to appoint for their purposes on anhonorary basis medical officers who are in the employment of the area health authority. This would ensure that the staff engaged on local authority healthwork were in the main stream of the health service and at the same time wouldprovide the local authority with a share in the responsibility for selecting thestaff who would serve them.The work of the community physician49. If the proposals in this Paper are adopted, there will be one corps of admini-strative medical staff serving both the area health authority and the localauthority. Most of the present work of the Medical Officer of Health will beincluded in the wider functions of the chief administrative medical officer. Thechief administrative medical officer, in his capacity as chief &quot; communityphysician &quot;, will also work with the local authority on public health and other services where medical advice is needed. As adviser both to the area health authority and to the local authority, the community physician will be able to survey the general pattern of health care, both in the hospitals and in thecommunity, and take a comprehensive view of health needs and health problems.He will be uniquely placed to help his clinical colleagues in the continuousmonitoring of the need for and the outcome of clinical services. This processof medical audit has already been developed to a considerable extent by, forexample, obstetricians and paediatricians and by the use of such new develop-ments as the hospital in-patient enquiry and hospital activity analysis. But therehave not been the local resources or organisation to pursue it more widely.The system recommended in the First Report of the Joint Working Party onthe Organisation of Medical Work in Hospitals (the &quot; Cogwheel,&quot; report) gives
new opportunities for collaboration with the community physician and thecommunity services. In addition, the community physician will continue toexercise the responsibilities of present Medical Officers of Health in promoting the development of the local authority services which are incorporated in the unified health services.50. The community physician will have much greater opportunities for acquir-ing closer knowledge of health hazards as they arise through continuing study of the pattern of illness presenting itself to the health services. This will enable him to make a more effective contribution as the main adviser to the localauthority on the health aspects of all its services.51. Thus there will be four main tasks. First, to develop the quantity and quality of information about health needs and the working of area health services.Second, to act as adviser on the health services to the area health authority.Third, to advise the local authority on the health aspects of all its services andparticularly to give a lead in health education. Fourth, to perform the publichealth duties of the present Medical Officer of Health.52. This description of the role of the community physician is necessarily briefand tentative. It is intended to make a detailed study of the scope and nature ofhis work in a reorganised National Health Service.
CHAPTER 5LOCAL PARTICIPATIONDistrict committees53. The areas of health authorities will vary from about 200,000 population toabout 1,300,000 population. It is essential to ensure that the residents in eachcommunity and the professional staff working in each district can participate in the running of their district health services. The full implications of an integrated service can only be worked out on the ground, on a scale such thatall concerned can participate in decisions affecting their profession or theircommunity. It is therefore proposed that most of the area health authoritiesshould establish district committees. The area served by a district hospital orthe hospitals which are jointly its present equivalent will normally be thethe smallest organisational unit for an integrated health service. closely associated with this hospital will be a varying number of domiciliary healthteams led by groups of general practitioners. The district served by a singledistrict hospital will in many cases be an appropriate unit for a district com-mittee. The precise number of these district committees perhaps 200 or so will therefore be determined by the pattern of the district health services, but where possible they will serve the same districts as the proposed district com-mittees of the new unitary local authorities. Where the area of the health authority is small, it will be able to administer its services satisfactorily withoutany district committees.54. It is proposed that a district committee should consist of a chairman and half the membership appointed by and drawn from the area health authority, and the other half drawn from people living or working in thedistrict who are not on the area health authority itself. The general balance ofits composition would reflect that of the area health authority. The district committees will be served by the officers of the area health authority. There willbe no need for them to have their own separate budgets. No powers will be delegated to -them by statute. Their functions require study but it is intended that the area health authority which establishes these committees will use themto supervise the running of services at the district level, while maintaining itsown general responsibility for establishing priorities and securing the efficiency of the health services throughout its area. The district committee will also serve as one of the channels through which local people can keep the area health authority informed of any problems they encounter with the local health,services. The exercise of these functions will ensure that the area health authority is exposed to the full vigour of local opinion in the professions and of localusers of the health service.Voluntary organisations and voluntary work55. The involvement of people from the local community in the running oftheir services should help to maintain their quality and the public&apos;s under-standing and acceptance of them. But these aims will not be fully achieved if the participation of the community consists only of representation at the committeelevel. There is undoubtedly a much greater potential for the participation of voluntary workers in the health service than has been realised in the past and a
much wider role for the work of voluntary organisations. There are many needsof the sick and handicapped which are better met by voluntary workers thanby paid staff.56. Voluntary organisations have always made an important contribution tothe working of the National Health Service. The unification of the health service will enable their work to be extended. Those organisations which have aimedto help particular types of patient have found the administrative barriers withinthe present service an obstacle to the full achievement of these aims. voluntary service which supports patients both in hospital and in the community willstrengthen the sense of continuity throughout the health service and constitute a further force helping to knit its elements together. The discussions following the publication of the first Green Paper have shown that the voluntary organis-tions are ready to take a fresh look at their activities and to see how far they need to be adapted to work alongside an integrated service.57. Voluntary activity by organisations and by groups, and volunteer projects of many kinds, will receive encouragement and support from the new area health authorities, but the main working links will be with the district com-mittees. Paid organisers of voluntary effort will be employed, for example,to co-ordinate support for a particular hospital; some might be jointly employedby an area health authority and a local authority to co-ordinate voluntaryhelp for the elderly or mentally ill or handicapped both in hospital and in thecommunity. Grants and subsidies paid by the area health authority either from its approved allocation of finance or, where appropriate, from trust andendowment funds will be available to support voluntary bodies which provideand promote services within the general scope of the authority&apos;s responsibilities.58. A special and continuing effort needs to be made to foster voluntary work with long stay patients. Many elderly, mentally ill, mentally handicapped andyounger chronic sick patients risk losing touch with their local community.Some have lost contact with friends and relatives. There is a special need for volunteers to visit and befriend, such patients. Voluntary effort may also be needed to enable relatives and friends to visit when distance or disability makesthis impossible without special help. The greater the participation of the local community in its local health services, the greater the response of the service to the community&apos;s needs and of the community to the serviced needs. Voluntarywork can be an important source for the recruitment of paid staff.59. A number of voluntary bodies provide services on an agency basis for thepresent local health authorities. The hospital car service, for example, isprovided by voluntary organisations to supplement the main ambulance serviceand in some areas, voluntary nursing associations provide agency services.Area health authorities will be empowered to enter into agency agreements andto continue and develop regular arrangements of this kind.
THE ADMINISTRATION OF AREA HEALTH authorities the role of the central Department60. The Secretary of State will be fully responsible for all aspects of theadministration of the health services. Just as he is answerable for the actions ofthe present hospital authorities, so he must be for those of the new authorities.This is inherent in the fact that the great bulk of the finance required, amountingat present to some  1,500 million a year, will be provided from central sources and voted by Parliament. It is the Secretary of State who will allocate theavailable funds to the new area health authorities both on capital and revenue account; and he must be satisfied that the money is spent to the best advantage.The central Department will need to concern itself more closely than in the pastwith the expenditure and efficiency of the administration at the local level.This applies, for example, to the standards of provision to be aimed at and the priorities to be adopted between competing demands. The Department must also ensure a reasonable balance between the main areas and divisions ofexpenditure, and maintain oversight of the value for money secured from the allocations made to the area health authorities. There will be available to theSecretary of State the full range of powers of guidance, and if necessary direction,that is required for this purpose.61. The intention will however be, in accordance with the objective in para-graph 6 (iii), to place on area health authorities the responsibility for administer-ing the health services to the maximum extent consistent with the objective inparagraph 6 (iv) of providing effective central control. To reconcile the objectives means that there must be closer understanding and shorter com-munications between the central Department and the area health authorities.It is for these reasons, among others, that it is proposed that the central Depart-ment should deal direct with the area health authorities, without an interveningtier of authority such as now exists in the hospital service. The Department willalso give greater attention, with the advice of those concerned, to improving theallocation of resources, and to encouraging their most effective use, bearing inmind especially the possibilities of a more rational deployment which will be offered by the integration of the health services.Integrated services under area health authorities62. Provided national priorities are observed and standards of efficiency areattained, effective power will rest with the area health authority to develop and plan its own services within the budget allocated and to link them with thoseof the local authority. All responsibilities for an integrated health service whichcan be economically and efficiently devolved on the area health authorities will be conferred on them. This will include some of the responsibilities at presentexercised by Regional Hospital Boards. Each area health authority will settle the boundaries of its constituent districts and determine what resources shouldbe deployed in each district, and in so doing would seek to secure a desirablebalance between services outside and inside hospitals.63. Area health authorities and their district committees will act as catalystsin &quot;developing new patterns of health services. There can be no standard form
which integration should take at the local level. The aim must be to bringtogether the out-of-hospital services which serve each community while at thesame time creating much stronger links with the district hospital. Where health centres are provided, they will be provided by a health authority upon which the professions have strong representation. Under these new arrangements, more general practitioners may wish to accept this form of practice. But a health centre is no more than a building. It is the basic ideas which underlie it whichare important, and these can be realised or largely realised in other ways. the aim is to co-ordinate local preventive and curative services so as to provideintegrated health care to a community. What is important is not the ownership of buildings but the siting and deployment of services, provided that the variousbuildings in which people work are suited for their purpose.64. There will no doubt be experiments with larger practices which give greater opportunities for individual practitioners to develop their special interest andfor the economical use of a wider range of technical supporting services. Ifoperational units of local authority social services were sited alongside grouppractices or in or near health centres there would be obvious advantages both tothe authorities concerned and to the communities they serve.Statutory committee for the family practitioner services65. The reorganisation of the health services will not detract in any way fromthe present status of family practitioners as independent contractors. Insteadof entering into contracts with Executive Councils as they now do, doctors,dentists, pharmacists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and opticians willenter into contracts with a special committee, which each area health authority will be required by statute to establish. This statutory committee will be directly responsible for securing the provision of the family practitioner services inaccordance with national regulations. It will in general stand in the samerelationship to the independent contractors and the local professionalcommittees as Executive Councils do now. The local professional committees would need to be reconstituted to correspond with area boundaries.66. The composition of the statutory committee will be laid down in legislation or in statutory regulations. It is proposed that it should resemble the composition of Executive Councils and include members appointed by the local professionalcommittees. There will be some common membership of the area health authority and of the statutory committee, and in addition these two bodieswill be served by a common staff.67. The area health authority will be responsible for co-ordinating the family practitioner service with the other services and for planning supporting servicesand health centres, although day to day co-ordination might be at districtlevel. The closer linking of general practitioners and hospitals depends oilthis overall responsibility of the area health authority.68. Under these arrangements, the family practitioners as independentcontractors will not be under the direct control of the area health authority.But there will in practice be substantial integration in the organisation and planning of the services.
Internal organisation69. The main principles which the area health authority would be expectedto adopt in organising its committees and appointing its chief officers andlaying down their departmental duties would be:(i) that the administration of all the health services for which it is responsible is to be unified;(ii) that most of the services provided will depend upon the close colla-boration of the many professions within the service working together in various groups and teams.It follows that the pattern of the organisation should no longer follow the tripartite division into hospital, general practitioner and local authority services.Nor should it be based upon the separate professions within the service. Theorganisation of a unified service should be based primarily upon the variousfunctions which comprise the service. Apart from the statutory committeefor the family practitioner services, any headquarter standing committees should cover all parts of the service. They should be few and should be keptsmall in the interests of efficiency. The main one would no doubt be a finance and general policy committee covering all the various aspects of the service.70. The organisation of the area health authority&apos;s headquarters staff shouldalso be such as would ensure the comprehensive planning and management of services. One of the main functions will be to formulate requirements for health services and to plan their organisation and use. A department wouldbe required to specialise in this work and the skills of both community and hospital services should be represented in it. There are other main functionsthat would require specialised departments. The administrative departments would include a secretariat and a department with personnel as one of its main functions. There would be a financial department. The weight of workon supplies, building and engineering functions would probably call for aseparate department or departments for these purposes.71. Most functions will require close teamwork between several professionsand disciplines. This will be particularly the case in the planning of the organisa-tion and use of services. The core of the team advising the authority on thisfunction must necessarily be its chief administrative medical officer, chiefnursing officer and chief administrative officer, together with the chief financialofficer who will have a special responsibility for giving advice on the financial implications of policies and the efficient and economical use of resources.Other professional staff and senior officers will need to form part of the teamwhen matters covering their responsibilities or departments are discussed.72. General co-ordination of the function of planning the organisation and useof services throughout the authority&apos;s area would be a major responsibility forthe chief administrative medical officer and he would also have immediateoversight of the department specialising in this work. The chief administrativemedical officer would also need to work closely with the chairman of the LocalMedical Committee for the area; and with the chairman (or chairmen) of theMedical Executive Committee (or Committees) established in his area as aresult of the &quot; Cogwheel &quot; report.
73. Co-ordination of most of the activities that do not fall wholly within thescope of this specialised department would be a major responsibility for thechief administrative officer who would also have immediate oversight of thedepartment or departments dealing with administrative matters.74. Some important questions are likely to concern separate professions or groups of professional staff as such and the principal officer for each would berecognised as having a special position for this purpose. These principal officers would be brought into consultation on any matters that closely concerned theirprofession or professional group as such, and they would also have the rightof direct access to the area health authority on such matters.75. The suggestions made about patterns of administration in the preceding paragraphs are necessarily tentative. They will need further study and elabora-tion in the light of the comments on this paper. Any administrative frameworkwhich is established should be sufficiently flexible for changes to be made in thelight of experience.76. The actual working of local arrangements will depend to a considerable extent on the managerial capacity, energy and enthusiasm of the authority&apos;steam of chief officers the lay manager or administrator and the chief nursingofficer as well as the chief medical administrator. The reorganised national health Service will be fortunate in inheriting from Regional Hospital Boards,Boards of Governors, Hospital Management Committees, Executive councils and local health authorities a considerable body of lay administrators and professional staff with long experience and training in management.77. The most important principle which must govern the administration and organisation of the area health authority is the removal of the present barriersbetween the three parts of the service. Both the members and the officers mustview the service which they are administering as an integrated service and base their plans upon the total health needs of the patients for whom the services are provided and of the communities in which they are providing them.Finance78. It is estimated that in 1970/71, the total cost of the health services in England(including the school health service) which it is proposed to include in the newunified National Health Service will amount to about  1,500 million. this includes current expenditure of about  100 million on the services to be trans-ferred from local authorities, of which rather more than half will be providedby central Government through the rate support grant and rather less than halfwill be due to be met from the rates. Finance for the new service will continueto be provided very largely from central funds. It has been suggested, however,that the identification of local authority members with the interests of the health service would be strengthened if there were some continuing contribution from local authority sources. This suggestion, and the appropriate financial adjust-ments between the central Government and local authorities, will need to befurther considered in the light of the arrangements for the future of localgovernment finance generally, on which the Government intends to publish aGreen Paper.
79. The area health authorities will prepare programmes of capital and revenue expenditure for approval by the central Department. In approving programmes,the Department will ensure that a proper balance is maintained between thedevelopment of the hospital services and the development of other services,and that proper account is taken of the needs of medical and dental teaching and research, in view of the obligations of the new authorities towards hospitalsadministered by Boards of Governors or University Hospital management committees. Finance for payments to those in contract to provide the family practitioner services will be provided separately by the central Department.In the long run, it is intended that the basic determinant of area health authoritybudgets will be the population served by the area, modified to take account of relevant demographic variables, underlying differences in morbidity, the characteristics of the capital plant inherited by each authority and any special responsibilities undertaken for a wider area and particularly for the special needs of teaching and research.Trust funds80. The present hospital authorities are trustees of substantial sums which have over the years been given by members of the public for hospital purposes. Itwill be important to continue to respect the local character of these gifts. It istherefore proposed to transfer these trusts to the new area health authoritiesand thus ensure that the funds are still available for use by the authority onpurposes which supplement the centrally financed health services provided forthe people of the area. The area health authorities will be able to accept andto seek fresh gifts in aid of any part of their work, as happens at present. It ishoped that the public of each locality will continue to give generous support to their local health services.81. It will be necessary to consider the question of maintaining any presentlimitation on the purposes for which trust funds may be used. In addition,where funds are held in trust for the support of a particular hospital, the district committees might be associated with their management.82. Representatives of the present Boards of Governors and of other hospital authorities will be invited to take part in discussions on these questions.
REGIONAL HEALTH COUNCILS AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENTRegional health councils83. While the area health authorities are large enough for most health purposes,they are too small for the performance of a number of important functions,particularly those related to the overall planning of the hospital and specialist services including the rarer specialties (such as neurology, radiotherapy,neurosurgery, nephrology and specialised laboratory facilities); the organisationof facilities for postgraduate medical and dental education; the deployment of senior hospital medical, dental and scientific staff; the regional organisationof staff training; blood transfusion services; and the planning of ambulanceservices. To undertake these important tasks, fourteen or more regional healthcouncils will be established. The regions will cover areas similar to those ofthe present Regional Hospital Boards. They will be constructed by groupingthe areas of several area health authorities probably between three and nine.84. The membership of the regional health councils will reflect that of the area health authorities grouped in the region. Each of the area health authorities will appoint at least one member, There will be several members appointed bythe professions, some or all of whom might also be members of area health authorities. The university concerned will also be represented and there will be a chairman and some members appointed by the Secretary of State. The size and composition of each regional health council have been left open at thisstage. They will depend, amongst other things, on the number of area health authorities in the region. The council will have a small but highly expert staffwith experience of hospital planning and other skills needed for its work.85. Similarly, their functions have not been defined precisely. But one of themost important functions will be planning the hospital and specialist services in the region and assessing priorities between competing developments. Ofspecial importance will be the planning of the development and location ofthe rarer specialties. In this work their role will be advisory, both to the central department and to the area health authorities. But in view of their membership,their recommendations will carry great weight.86. To maintain continuity in planning the specialised services in London andSouth-East England, and to maintain the important links between the facilities in central London and the rest of the South-East, there will be four&quot; metropolitan &quot; regional health councils, covering roughly the same areas asthe present four metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards but keeping to thearea health authorities&apos; boundaries. In the central part of these four regions,co-ordination of hospital services is at present achieved through a Joint working group which includes representatives of the four metropolitan regional hospital Boards, the London Boards of Governors, the University of London,the London Boroughs&apos; Association, the Inner London Executive Council, andthe Inner London Local Medical Committee. It has an independent chairmanappointed by the Secretary of State. Under the new administrative structure,a similar co-ordinating body will no doubt be needed, with representatives ofthe four regional health councils, the area health authorities, and probably also the local authorities and the university, and a chairman appointed by theSecretary of State.
87. The organisation of the ambulance service in Greater London (and in themetropolitan areas elsewhere) will need special study.88. Regional health councils will also be responsible to the Secretary of Statefor a number of executive functions now discharged by Regional hospital boards. These might include the running of the blood transfusion service andthe deployment of senior hospital medical, dental and scientific staff. In addition the councils will carry special responsibility for the organisation of post-graduate medical education which will need to be extensively developed in thefuture. Finally, the regional health councils will have a critical role to play in promoting and sponsoring research into the clinical and operational problemsof the health services throughout the region. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in decentralised clinical research supported mainly throughRegional Hospital Boards and Boards of Governors, partly from voluntary and partly from Exchequer funds. This is a particularly desirable development which will need to be fostered by regional health councils with their close links with the scientific resources of the universities and hospitals, including the teaching hospitals. University departments of social medicine, statistics andthe like also provide valuable support for operational studies in the deployment of health services which commonly need investigation on a wider than areabasis. With their responsibilities for planning, and strong representation of area health authorities, the regional health councils will be in a special position to identify the problems which need investigation and to find, with the help of theuniversity, investigators who are equipped to undertake each assignment.89. While they will exercise some executive functions of their own the regional health councils will not supervise or control the area health authorities, whichwill have a direct relationship to the central Department. Area health authorities will also be free to establish consortia with one another or to make jointarrangements with local authorities where these seem to offer the best methodsof dealing with matters of common concern.The central Department90. In order to maintain an effective direct relationship with about 90 area health authorities, the central Department will need considerable reorganisation.There will need to be strengthened regional offices and much more interchange of staff between the area health authorities and the central Department. Thisinterchange will be of benefit to both parties. The central Department will be constantly refreshing itself with doctors, dentists, nurses, administrators andothers with recent knowledge and experience of running health services at thelocal level. Area health authorities will have officers with recent knowledge ofthe priorities established at the centre, of on-going research and of the major policy issues being debated at the centre.91. Certain functions which are at present performed by Regional hospital boards will in future be performed by the central Department particularly the programming, planning and execution of major building schemes. Incompiling the programme of these schemes and in considering the capital programmes of the area health authorities, the Department will take intoaccount the advice given by the regional health councils. Centrally, and in its
regional offices, the Department will employ the professional and other staffneeded for planning and designing and carrying out, in consultation with thefuture users, the major schemes included in the national programme. their services will also be available for the smaller schemes such as health centres for which the area health authorities will be responsible. The central department will also play a more active role in manpower planning and training in con-junction with representatives of health service staff.Central Advisory Council92. To assist him in exercising these enlarged functions, the Secretary of state will establish a new Central Advisory Council with a widely drawn membershipfrom within and outside the professions. The Secretary of State will consult the Council on all matters of importance to the health service including the deployment of available resources.The National Health Service Hospital Advisory Service93. The Secretary of State will maintain contact with the day-to-day problemsof the health service through his Department and its regional offices, throughthe Central Advisory Council, through discussions with chairmen of area health authorities and through the Hospital Advisory Service which is already at work. The latter has two functions specified in its terms of reference:(i) by constructive criticism and by propagating good practices and newideas, to help to improve the management of patient care in individualhospitals (excluding matters of individual clinical judgment) and in thehospital service as a whole;(ii) to advise the Secretary of State for Social Services about conditionsin hospitals in England (and the Secretary of State for Wales aboutconditions in hospitals in Wales.)94. The Hospital Advisory Service will provide a further channel by whichthe difficulties facing hospitals can be brought to the attention of the central department and the Secretary of State. It is in a position to draw together on anational basis the lessons learnt in each hospital, and to convey this information to other hospitals. Every hospital has something it can teach others; everyhospital has something it can learn from others. The Advisory Service shouldfacilitate the communication of ideas between the central Department, thearea health authorities and the hospital wards. Similarly it should encouragecommunication between hospitals, and between hospitals and the community services, including those provided by local authorities, general practitioners and voluntary societies. At present it is concentrating its attention on long-stayhospitals. Its services will eventually be provided for all hospitals in the national health Service.Complaints and a health commissioner95. The vast majority of complaints are at present conscientiously investigated by health service authorities to an extent which is not always appreciated bymembers of the public. Some complainants, however, doubt whether the health service authority, which must itself take responsibility for any mistakes which
have been made, can be expected to undertake impartial investigations. steps are now being taken to introduce more uniform and better publicised procedures for the handling of complaints by hospital authorities.96. In July, 1968, the first Green Paper made a number of tentative suggestions for dealing with complaints, including the possible appointment of a healthcommissioner, or commissioners, to consider complaints not dealt with by the health authority to the satisfaction of the complainant. This suggestion attracteda good deal of comment, mostly favourable but some of it critical.97. In July, 1969, the Prime Minister, when announcing that an ombudsmansystem would be established for investigating complaints of maladministrationin local government, said in regard to the health service that it would benecessary to consider, in consultation with the professional and other interests,the relationship of any health commissioner to the new National Health ServiceHospital Advisory Service, and also other problems of definition, for examplewhere complaints involve clinical matters.98. These consultations will now be undertaken in the light of the generalproposals made in this Green Paper for the future structure of the national health Service.
STAFFING THE SERVICE99. The National Health Service is already one of our largest &quot; industries &quot;.It employs nearly three-quarters of a million people. The quality of the service it provides depends above all else on the calibre of the men and women working in it.100. It will be necessary to ensure that the skill and experience of existing staff are used to full advantage in the new structure. The reorganisation described inthis Paper will involve considerable redeployment of staff now working for thehospital authorities, the Executive Councils and the local health authorities.This must be effected as smoothly as possible, with full consideration of theinterests and circumstances of staff who may be called upon to move. A national staff commission or similar machinery will need to be established at an early stage in consultation with representatives of the staff to undertake this work.The commission will be expected to work in conjunction with any similarmachinery set up in connection with local government reorganisation.101. More generally, skilled control of manpower policy, based on an informedunderstanding of the needs of the service and of the individual, will be essential,especially during the period of transition. A major effort will be needed to intro-duce new training programmes, or adapt existing ones, to prepare staff for workin the new service. Because of the time needed for sufficient staff to completetraining on so large a scale, training courses may have to be started beforemany staff know for certain what posts they will obtain in the new service. the timetable for such training will need close co-ordination with the staff corn-mission^ plans and timetable for the filling of the groups of posts concerned.102. If the proposals in this Paper are adopted, some of the staff of the regional hospital Boards will be invited to work for the new regional health councils,some in the regional offices of the central Department, and some for the area health authorities. Those employed by the Hospital Management Committees,Boards of Governors and Executive Councils and the staff transferred from local health and local education authorities will in general be required by thearea health authorities.103. The rights of transferred staff will be maintained. There will be full con-sultation with all the staff interests concerning the effects of the changes on thestaff themselves including, for example, any superannuation questions that arise.Rates of pay and conditions of service in the new administrative structure willcontinue to be settled through national machinery.104. Early discussions will take place between representatives of staff and of theDepartment and the employing authorities in order to review and define as soonas practicable the effect on staff, and the principles of personnel movement tobe followed and the actions needed if the proposals are finally adopted. well before any actual movement takes place, these matters will come within thescope of the proposed staff commission.105. For an integrated service, the training of staff assumes an added impor-tance. The need for developing postgraduate medical education has already been
mentioned. Of no less importance is the need to extend the education and train-ing facilities available to all other staff throughout the health service. This will ensure that everyone is able to work to his full potential, and will conserve thescarce resources upon which the service depends. The new area health authorities,with the help of the central Department and others with experience and re-responsabilities in this field, will need to make extensive use of existing facilities fortraining and education and develop new facilities where they are required.106. The tripartite division of the health services is reflected in the arrangements which are now made for training staff. The tripartite service has its origins in thehistory of Britain&apos;s health services extending far beyond the creation of theNational Health Service. Earlier patterns of services were developed to meetparticular needs or to establish particular priorities not all of which are stillrelevant today. These patterns have had a major influence on training pro-grammes. The establishment of an integrated health service will make it necessaryto consider how far particular specialised training programmes are still ap-priate, whether existing personnel can with further training undertake widerfunctions and whether new forms of generic training need to be developed. an integrated health service gives opportunities for greater continuity of care of individual patients and a much more flexible deployment of staff. The widepower which will be devolved on area health authorities will give them op-portunities to experiment in new patterns of care and to respond to new needs.107. The proposed organisational changes will create new responsibilities for many people. For example, the responsibilities of the chief medicaladministrator will extend to all branches of the unified health service. Thearea health authority&apos;s chief nursing officer will be concerned with bothhospital and community nursing and midwifery services. The supplies officerwill become responsible for supplies required in all area health authorityactivities. There is likely to be an increasing number of posts with duties in bothhospital and community. Moreover, the unification of all the personal health services in an area under one employing authority will make it easier than now for members of staff to widen their experience; there will be greater oppor-tunities for movement between different fields within the service or for workingpart-time in different branches of it.108. These new opportunities and responsibilities will pose new challengesto the personnel and training branches within the area health authorities. Someforms of training will have to be organised on a scale wider than that of a singlearea health authority. Special arrangements for this will be required. At thenational level, machinery will be needed to organise the training and develop-ment of health service staff, as well as to carry out on a wider basis functionssimilar to those now undertaken by the National Staff Committee for hospitaladministrative and clerical staff and by the National Nursing Staff Committeefor nurses and midwives. The proportion of the serviced total resources of manpower and money which is invested annually in training has been risingsharply; still higher rates of investment will be needed in many areas. And thelarger the investment which authorities make in their employees, the greater the need to husband these valuable assets by personnel policies which keepwastage to a minimum.
CONCLUSION109. There is every reason to believe that both the need for particular health services and the capacity to meet health needs will change rapidly during thenext few decades. No one can predict what precise technological advances inmedicine will come in the future. It is, however, essential that any new structure of the National Health Service should be capable of rapid change and that thesystem of organisation should encourage experiment of every kind. TheGovernments proposals for integrated and decentralised services are designedto provide the flexibility for each local area to respond to change and adapt itsservices to meet it.NOTE:In his Foreword to this Green Paper, the Secretary of State for Social Servicesinvites comments and suggestions on the proposals made in it. These should be sentto the Department of Health and Social Security, Alexander Fleming House,London, S.E.1, not later than the end of May, 1970.
APPENDIX IARRANGEMENTS FOR london. The concentration of population, the location of the major hospitals, the complexity of communications and the smaller geographical size of some of theLondon boroughs as compared with unitary and metropolitan district authori-ties in other parts of England, make it desirable to group the areas of the London boroughs into a smaller number of health areas. An appropriate arrangement might be to establish 5 health areas in Inner London (excluding Greenwich)and 10 to 12 in the rest of London. Each of these would comprise the areas ofone, two or three London boroughs.2. The areas provisionally suggested for the new health authorities in inner london, which would contain all the present London undergraduate teaching hospitals, are as follows: A  HackneyTower HamletsCity of LondonB   CamdenIslingtonC   WestminsterKensington &amp; ChelseaHammersmithD  WandsworthLambethE   SouthwarkLewisham3. The remaining London boroughs might be grouped in 11 areas, as follows: F   GreenwichBexleyG  BromleyH  CroydonI   SuttonMertoriJ   HounslowRichmond upon ThamesKingston upon ThamesK  EalingHillingdonL   HarrowBrentM Barnet   *
N EnfieldHaringeyO  Waltham ForestNewhamP   RedbridgeBarkingHavering4. Whether the area health authorities in London should have district com-mittees, each covering an area corresponding with that of a single borough,will need to be considered in consultation with the interests concerned.5. Consultations on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on medical education are not yet concluded and it is not intended to reach any finaldecision on the administration of the postgraduate hospitals until the futurepattern of postgraduate education in London has been more fully discussed.
APPENDIX IIOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH1. At present, apart from works medical officers, various categories of doctorare engaged on work connected with employment. Medical Inspectors of factories are concerned with the medical aspects of hazards arising in industry;Appointed Factory Doctors carry out the statutory medical examinations,which are required under the Factories Act and Regulations, of young persons and of persons engaged in hazardous trades; doctors are concerned with themedical supervision of persons attending Government Training Centres andIndustrial Rehabilitation Units; and the Regional Medical Service of theDepartment of Health, and Social Security carries out medical examinationsof disabled persons with a view to advising on their fitness for employment.The establishment of the Employment Medical Advisory Service by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity will, however, bring togethermost of these at present unco-ordinated duties into a single organisation.The responsibilities of the new Service will include the work now done by medical Inspectors of Factories and Appointed Factory Doctors togetherwith that carried out in Government Training Centres and Industrial rehabilitation-tion Units. It will also be concerned with any medical problems which arise in connection with employment and as an expert service will be available togive advice and help to anyone needing it.2. So far as the medical examination of young persons is concerned, the presentroutine examinations under the Factories Act will be replaced by a moreselective system concentrating on those young persons in need of medical advice and based on the area health authority&apos;s programmes of medical super-vision of school children. From this, the Employment Medical advisory service will develop procedures for looking after the health of young persons inemployment and giving advice to the Youth Employment Service.3. It is intended that there should be close links between the local authority,the area health authority and the Employment Medical Advisory Service.Local authorities have certain enforcement duties under the Factories Actand the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act and it is clearly essentialthat both they and the area health authority should maintain close links withthe services provided by the Employment Medical Advisory Service. Equally,that Service must work in close liaison with the personal health services toensure that occupational factors are not lost sight of in treatment. The needsof the Employment Medical Advisory Service will be taken into account inthe development of hospital laboratory and other specialist facilities.PRINTED IN ENGLAND FOR HER MAJESTVS STATIONERY office by THE OYEZ PRESSprint division of the solicitors&apos; law stationery society, limitedDd500465 K560 2/70
