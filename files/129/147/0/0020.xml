HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYf3 GOVERNMENT)C(70) 209m February^ 1970COPY NO.6 3CABINETPOST OFFICE FINANCESMemorandum by the Minister of Posts and TelecommumcationsAt their meeting on 24m July, 1969 (CG(S9) 36th Conclusions,.Minute 4(24)) I was invited by the Cabinet to consider the possibility of anincrease in the financial target for Post Office telecommunications fromBj per cent to 9j per cent or higher0    7n agreement with the Post Office andthe Chancellor I have since concluded that there would be many advantages in increasing the target to 10 per cent from 1st October, 1970 which Is themidpoint of the current five-year target period (1963-1969 to 1972-1973),20      I have also had under consideration proposals from the Post office for an Increase In postal tariffs In order to make good forecast losses andto achieve Its financial target of 2 per cent on expenditure over the samefive-year period,,    In discussion on 3rd February (CC(70)  5th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet decided that these two subjects should be considered together,,T eleic ommnznicatiohs3.      In my view, the case for an Increase in the telecommunicationstarget is overwhelming.    This is an expanding business with buoyantdemands and it Is eminently reasonable that the rate of internal financing of Its very large capital investment programme should be increased.    The19 per cent target now proposeds moreover, closely corresponds with thecurrent 10 per cent test discount rate and prevailing rates of Interest.Additionally, there are strong arguments In favour of restraining the demandfor telecommunications services in order to avoid an. excessive demand on resources.4.      When the Cabinet discussed this issue last July it was thought that a sharp increase in connection charges might be a major source of finance for the increased target,   However, on examination the Post Office feel matthey must rely for additional revenue mainly on increased rental chargesCjUe,, quarterly rentals would increase from  4 ( 3.10., 0o shared) to  5( 4 ehared) for residence lines and  6 (S5 shared; for business lines),-It.
These with some increases in connection charges (from a maximum of 20 to  25 though 1 propose to ask them to consider still bigger increases)and in call charges including the imposition of a surcharge on GTD trunkrates at peak times in order to relieve congestion,, would involve broadlyan overall increase in telephone charges of the order of 10 per cent.Details v/ould8 if increases cf this order are approved in principle,, bediscussed first with the Departments concerned; and the proposals wouldmen need to be referred, io the Post Office Usersp National Council whichmust be effectively consulted and its views seriously considered before final decisions are taken,,Posts50      Increases in postal tariffs are politically much less attractive..Because of the impact of increased wages and other costs the Post Officeforecast a significant shortfall on its financial target for Posts/Giro overthe five year period 1968-69 -? 1972-73.    The Post Office, accordingly,proposed to me in October last increases In postal charges,-, the main one being an increase from 4d to 5d for She second class letter service andfrom 5d to 6d for the first class service from August,, 1970c    I prv-ssssdthem to reconsider this in the light of their own studies of the future of the postal services and in the context of the pending pay claim particularly witha view to increasing productivity and operational efficiency,,6o      Having revised their estimates8 Sn fche light of these factors and taking account of the latest trsJ&amp;Xc trends they now ask for increases to 6dand 7dt, i,e* 50 per cent and 40 per cent respectively from Januaryg 197LI think these increases,, which would lead to large profits,, are too steepand favour an increase fco 5d and 6d in January which thereafter would berounded down to 2p and 2-gp on Decimal Day.    I should not expect the public reaction to be too bad0    It has always been recognised that some recastingcf postal tariffs would be inevitable on the introduction of decimalisations,As the service is loss-making now (even before the current wage claimhas been met) rounding down from 4d and 5d is out of the question^    So arise to 2p (4r. 8d) and 2-fp (fid) is virtually inevitable en Decimal Day.    It isthuss in effect^ the minimum change that can be made as well as3 In myvieWp the most to which we should agree-    There are general policyobjections to raising tariffs on Decimal Day itselff hence the proposal tomake the Increases in January9 1971o7.      The Appendix- explains the background on postal tariffs,,    briefly the following are the options available to us,(i) No increase in tariffs,,    This would lead to big deficits andInsuperable difficulties on decimalisation because the existing4d/5d rate does not convert. Rounding down to ifp (3, 6d) and 2p(40 8d) would still further increase fee forecast deficits..cu 2*^

Reference fro Prices asd3r.cornes Board9,       In the ordinary way a reference to the Prices and Incomes Board(PIB) can be expected to satisfy the public about the justification for price increases ands in particular, that all steps have been taken to absorbincreased costs by productivity and. other measures.    Moreover a majortask of prices and incomes policy at the present time is to bring home to people the effects of wage increases on costs and pricese    A PIB report could be the best way of doing this.    In this instance,, however, I do not favour references to the PIB either of postal pay or of telecommuncations and postal tariffs.    The posta?. pay increases proposed are well justified,and I am satisfied that the accompanying productivity agreements are themaximum which can at present be negotiated.    Both the postal and telecommunications businesses&apos;have been thoroughly reviewed by theBoard as recently as 1968 with, in the case of Posts, a supplementaryreview in 1969o    The increases in telecommunications charges are largelyderived from the proposal to increase the target.    The postal tariffincreases which I propose above are virtually the minimum possible.    Theonly effect of a reference to the PIB would therefore be to import delayrpossibly to suggest variations contrary to the Post Officers commercial judgment, and to stimulate controversy.Announce me nts10o      Early announcements are necessary on both Poses and telecommunications to allow the Post Office time to prepare for the increases and3 in the postal case, for a considerable programme oftraining staff for the impact of decimalisation,,    I would propose in thefirst place (after the current wages claim is settled) to announce simplythe Governments agreement to the&apos;raising of the telecommunicationstarget and to say that because of it and of increases in other coststhroughout the business^, the Poet Office would be making proposals shortly to the Users1, Council for increases in both postal and telecommunicationstariffs.    The Post Office would then be left to develop the agreed tariffproposals in detail with the Users1&apos; Council and formally we should not be committed in detail until the Users-5 Council had reported and their views had been folly considered.Conclusion11.       I therefore propose S(a) An increase in the tele communications target from Qj? per cent to10 per cent from 1st October^ 1970.(b) Consequential increases frcm 1st October^. 1970 intelecommunications tariff s9 of the order of 10 per cent overall withsome increases in connection charges but mainly concentrated on rental increases? details to be discussed interdepartmentallyand thereafter referred to the Post Office Userdv National Council.,

APPENDIXPOSTAL TARIFFSWhen postal  charges were  last  increased with  the  introduction ofthe  two-tier rate of 4d and 5d,   the Prices  and Incomes Board(Report No 58 para 202)  expressed a hope  that  they would sufficeuntil  further changes became  inevitable on decimal day in 1971,when probably further increases would be required.    They assumed that average earnings would not  increase at more  than 3-2% perannum,  but  labour costs  for 1968/69 rose by 5j% and in  1969/70by 6%.    The  latest v/ages proposals  indicate a further average increase of about 8%,    Over 70% of  total  costs consists of wages,and therefore the posts  are much subject   to inflation.    Traffictrends have been disappointing.    Thus,   the posts made a smallloss in 1968/69,   and the Post Office would expect further losses on the basis of current  tariffs as  follows:2.      The Post Office had proposed earlier  that  the  two-tier rate should go up from 4d/5d to 5d/6d in August  1970,  becoming2p (4,8d) and 2-^p (6d)   in February 1971,  when decimalisationwould in any case force  some recasting of  tariffs.    Havingreviewed their estimates in  the light of  the current wages claim and the latest traffic  trends,   they now propose  that the  twotiers should be increased to 6d and 7d in January 1971,  changing the next month to 2-jp (6d)  and 3p (7.2d).    The Post Office estimate that a 5d/6d tariff introduced in August would yield a surplusof  24m over the  five-year period (reducing to  7 million if  theintroduction were deferred until November,  or break even ifdeferred until January)  after providing for interest on capital and supplementary depreciation to cover replacement of  fixed* Excluding Giro losses - see para 9Loss over currenttarget period^1968/691969/701970/711971/721972/73  lm 11m 27m 47m 65mFive year total  151mShortfall on target  191m- 1
assets at current costs;  but  it would not yield enough both  tomeet  the financial  target of an extra 2% of  total expenditure (or about  5m a year)  and recover past losses;    The 6d/7d increase inJanuary next would yield a sum of  128m over the target period,with profits at an unprecedented  70m in both 1971/72 and 1972/73.QUANTUM3,      The quantum of  the  increased charges might thus be:-(i)    6d/7d becoming 2-lp/3p (6d and 7.2d);(ii)    5d/6d becoming 2p/2-fp  (4.8d and 6d).4.      I do not favour  (i).    The  increases would be 50% for  thesecond class mail  (actually 100% for  the second weight step becauseof other charges affecting letters between two and four oz. - see para 8)  and 40% for  the first class.    A lOs. book of stamps would cost something  like 14s0  6d.    When the two tiers were introduced,traffic fell by 4% and the loss has not been wholly recovered.Increases of  the order now proposed would be badly received andmight set off a decline in traffic.    The Post Office  themselvesbudget for an initial fall of  10% but they are hopeful of regainingthe lost traffic;  they may be over-sanguine.    The Post Office alsourge  that  the prospect of  financial stability implied by a 6d/7dtariff and the large resultant profits would help to restore theimage and morale of  the postal  services.    Equally it couldstimulate increased claims on the wages front.     In any event,   itcannot be right so substantially  to anticipate  future  inflation.5.      I  therefore favour course  (ii).    The modest change should bring in  150m or more before the end of  the  target period inApril 1973.    If  the efforts of Board and Unions  to increase efficiency and productivity are insufficient in the  time to enablethe Post Office  to cover costs,  recover past losses,  and meet  the2% target over the five year period,   then one could consider,  say we 1972,  whether there should be a further increase.    meanwhile the Post Office would remain under financial pressure to secureimproved working methods.    I would not relieve the Post Office oftheir obligation to earn the 2% target?  the financial prospectswould be further reviewed when the effects of the  tariff changescould be assessed in the  light of experience.TIMETABLE6.      The Post Office are against a November start because it wouldmean increasing overseas&apos;  rates  just at  the  time that overseasChristmas mail  is being posted and would leave the profitable homeChristmas mail,   to bear the brunt of  the public1s reaction.Somewhat similar considerations apply to August when the Poolspromoters, who are well placed to adopt alternative arrangements,are about to commence their major autumn operations,  and thedisturbing effects would persist into the Christmas period.2
7.      By Decimal Day it would have been necessary in any event  to change  the postal rates as  the PIB recognised.    Accordingly,   anincrease of  5d and 6d in January 1971 after  the Christmas mailseason,   to be rounded down the next month  to 2p and 2^p,   shouldcause  the least public reaction and hence  the  least impact on traffic prospects.    I recognise the difficulty in view of decimalpolicy of making an increase so near to Decimal Day,  but the PostOffice could be asked to take space in the newspapers  to explain that this was a genuine increase due  to rising costs,   and thatthere would be a measure of rounding down on Decimal Day.    i therefore prefer a January starting date;  even  though it wouldoss of  extra revenue between August  and January I  should prefer to pick it not by economies.up,   if necessary,  by later price increases ifCONSEQUENTIAL MINOR CHANGES8.      There would be consequential adjustments.    For  inland lettersthe Post Office are proposing  to revert  to a basic weight element of 2 oz with increased tariffs  for  letters above 2 oz.    Parcelsrates would be increased on average by about 15%.mails  their proposals are:-For overseas1Foreign letter rateCommonwealth letter rateFull printed paper rate(5P)6d (2ip)6d (2lp)The yield from these consequential changes has been included inthe above calculations.GIRO9.      The Giro lost  5m in 1968/69,   and if nothing were done  thePost Office would expect  to lose some  38m over  the five year period.    Earlier estimates of growth have proved optimistic.    Ithas been hard to overcome  the public&apos;s  inertia or unwillingnessto offend Bank Managers.    The Post Office have asked mr Whitney Straight (the Deputy Chairman)  to conduct asearching enquiry.    Collaboration with  the Joint Stock Banksoffers one possible avenue of advance,  but it  is premature  to seek to reach conclusions.    If,  however,   the service is  to be continued and it is necessary to inject more money,   then in my view itwould be right to finance it separately and not out of increased prices  for postal  services,- 3 -
