His&apos;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY SS GOVER.NL.iENT)CJTOjJiCOPY NO.921st January^. 19J7QCABINETMemorandum by the Lord Privy;SealWhen the Ministerial Committee on -Local government reorganisation discussed the question of disqualification of localgovernment employees from membership of their authoritiess i expressed concern about the passage on this issue in the draft &quot;white paper (now paragraph 77 in the draft attached to C(70) 13) in view ofmy concern about the implications for the Civil Service of any proposedlegislative changes.    This is a matter of some importance, and I thinkit will help my colleagues if I briefly set out the considerations.?ja      The rules governing the political activities of civil servants are based on the recommendations of the Master man Committee which reported in 1949 (Cmd0 7718 )0    The Service is divided into three groups -the restricted group (Executive Officers and all staff above that level) arebarred from national political activities, but may take part in local politicincluding serving on local authorities with the permission of their departments?  the intermediate group (Clerical Officers, Typistsand analogous grades) may take part in both nation?,.! and local political activities with the permission of their Departments;  staff below this level (Industrial staff, Messengers and minor and manipulative grades)are completely free to engage in political activities without specificpermission,,    Civil servants in the restricted and inter mediate groupsgiven permission to ta.ke part in local politics are expected to act withmoderation and discretion, particularly in matters affecting their own department, and not to involve themselves in matters of political controversy which are of national rather than local significance.The overriding principle which these rules seek to preserve is thatthe Civil Service must at all times be and be seen to bo politicallyimpartial,,30      A major change in the law on disqualification would alter theGovernments general position in this field and would lead to pressure to relax the Civil Service rules, as regards involvement not only in localbut also in national politics.    The National Staff Side have already indicated that they would like to see a relaxation of the rules aboutservice by civil servants on local authorities and that they would be
looking at this in the light of any changes in the position of localgovernment employeesc    It has always been rega.rd.ed as essentialthat no civil servant can stand for Parliament without first resigninghis post; acc.efta.nce that it was right for local government employees to be members of the council that employed them v/ould by analogy raise this fundamental question in regard to the Civil Service (even thoughcivil servants v/ould be debarred from Parliament as office holdersunder the CrownJ1.    My colleagues will also wish to bear in mind theextreme importance that is attached to the political impartiality ofmembers of the Armed Forces who are debarred from ta.ki.ng partin overt political activities,4,      In my view, any changes in the law on disqualification need to be studied with full regard to their effect on the Civil Service.A firm statement in the White Paper that &quot;The Government do not regard as tolerable a general principle of disqualification whichdebars a large and growing proportion of the population from the chance of becoming members of thejpaain local authorities&quot; or that&quot;in the Governments view a.  major/ liberalisation of the law ondisqualification is desirable&quot; would severely restrict our freedomof action,,    I therefore hope my colleagues will agree that the passage in the While Paper should be amended to read as followsi&quot;77.    The present rules were designed to prevent clashes of interests and loyalties which v/ould damage the work of localauthorities and their members.    Such clashes must continueto be prevented in future,,    In the new circumstances referredto in paragraph 76, however, the Government recognise that ageneral principle of disqualification which would debar a large and growing proportion of the population from the chance of becoming members of the main local authorities-is undesirable,,Changes in the law on disqualification may be required and it isthe Government1 s intention to discuss this matter with the localauthority and staff bodies&quot;.Civil Service Departments S,W01,21st January, 1970
