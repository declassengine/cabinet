INFIDENTIALDRAFT WHITE PAPERLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ENGLANDI - THE NEW STRUCTUREIntroduction1.     In the early years of this Parliament the Government came to theconclusion that fundamental reviews of the structure, organisation and machinery of government at various levels were already overdue.   Amongthe institutions which required review in this way was local government2o    Accordingly Royal Commissions with wide terms of reference4 were established under the chairmanship of Lord Redcliffe-Maud andLord Wheatley respectively to review the organisation of local govern-ment in England and Scotland while the Government went ahead with itsown review of local government in Wales.3.    Even while the Royal Commissions were at work, a further step wastaken with the appointment of the Commission on the Constitution, whoseterms of reference^ charged it, in considering the subjects of its owninquiry, to have regard to developments in local government organisation.*To consider the structure of Local Government in England, outsideGreater London, in relation to its existing functions; and to make recommendations for authorities and boundaries, and for functions andtheir division, having regard to the size and character of areas inwhich these can be most effectively exercised and the need to sustaina viable system of local democracy; and to report.^&quot;To examine the present functions of the central legislature and government in relation to the several countries, nations and regions of the United Kingdom:To consider, having regard to developments in local government organisation and in the administrative and other relationships betweenthe various parts of the United Kingdom and to the interests of the prosperity and good government of our people under the Crown, whether any changes are desirable in those functions or otherwise in present constitutional and economic relationships:To consider, also, whether any changes are desirable in the constitutional and economic relationships between the United Kingdom and theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man.
CONFIDENTIALif0    This White Paper deals with the reorganisation of local governmentin England.   The next steps in Scotland and Wales arc referred to inparagraphs &quot;15-17 below.5.     The great mass of evidence to the Redclif fe-J4aud Commission showedhow extensive a body of opinion, both inside and outside local govcrn-raont, considered that fundamental changes were required.   The piecemealmethods that the Local Government Commission for England had been forced to adopt under the Local Government Act 1953 were widelyreorganised as inadequate.6.     When the report of the Royal Commission (Cmnd. 40^0) v/as published on 11th June 19^9, the Prime Minister gave it a warm welcome, payingtribute, in which the Leader of the Opposition joined, to the commissions exhaustive studies and comprehensive recommendations.The Prime Minister announced the Government&apos;s acceptance of the three main principles of the report - that a major rationalisation of localgovernment was called for, that there should be a very marked reductionin the number of units with executive responsibility and that theanachronistic division between town and country should be ended.   he made it plain, however, that the Government was not committed to the detailed proposals in the report and thorough consultations were held to discover the views of all interested parties on the new structurerecommended by the Commission.   The comments made during consultationshave confirmed what was already clear from the evidence to theCommission - the overwhelming support for far-reaching reforms thatwill fit local government for the daunting tasks in front of it.7.    Not many commentators agreed \tfith the report down to the lastdetail: but acceptance of its principles was widespread.   On virtuallyevery point of substance on which some commentators disagreed with thereport there were others who expressed equally strong agreement.   an account of the opinions received is given in Appendix A.
80    The Government have carefully weighed all the views expressed inthe consultations, the proposals put forward with such force and con-viction in the dissenting memorandum by Mr. Senior and the results oftheir own studies.   There is no &quot;right solution&quot; to the problem of reorganisation.   Whatever solution is chosen must sacrifice some tilingsin the interest of others and changes in it will be needed from time totime to keep it up to date with the changing pattern of where peoplelive and work and with technological advance.   It is the Government1sconclusion that in its essentials the report of the Royal Commissionstands.   The Commission described the processes of thought which ledthem to their choice of structure.   Their chain of reasoning, set outnotably in paragraphs 6 to 16 of their report, is reproduced for con-venience in Appendix B.   In the Government&apos;s judgment, the Commission&apos;sproposals provide a much better basis for reorganisation than any ofthe alternatives and though the Government&apos;s conclusions differ fromthe Commission&apos;s on certain points, they are not points of principle.The- Commission&apos; s_ jaroposals9.     The Commission proposed that(a) the greater part of England should be organised in &quot;unitary areas&quot; with populations not much less than 250,000 and not much more than 1,000,000 in which a single authority would exercise all local government functions;(b) exceptionally, places where planning, transportation anddevelopment need authorities which would be too large forother services should be organised as &quot;metropolitan areas&quot;in which functions would be divided between two tiers of authority;(c) in the unitary areas, and in the metropolitan areas wherethe inhabitants wanted them, there should be &quot;local councils&quot;the most important function of which would be to make knownthe views of local communities on any matters affecting them;
V-i?\J*iiX y 1 Ihj^^ i^I 1 8^%&amp;ai(d)   the unitary areas and metropolitan areas should be groupedin 8 provinces, each with a provincial council consisting ofmembers elected by the main authorities and some co-optedmembers, their chief task being to create a broad framework for the exercise of the main authorities1 operationalresponsibilities.The Government&apos;s general jljsws10.   The Government&apos;s detailed proposals differ from the Commission&apos;sonly on the distribution of functions in areas where there are to be two tiers, the application of the Commission&apos;s structure in two partsof England and certain important aspects of the proposals for local councils.   These differences are described at the appropriate points in the following parts of this paper.11.   Unless local government is organised to fit the needs of thefuture, and in particular organised in units that are large enough to match the technical and other requirements of the services that theyadminister, its power will diminish.   The Government intend that thepresent reorganisation should give local government noro power and influence.12.   The choice of structure is not one of degree, of how far to go.It is a choice between a structure composed of largo units - unitaryones, wherever conditions make this feasible - and something more closely resembling what exists today.   The Government1s consideredchoice is the former.13.   The Government advisedly speak about the needs of the future, notmerely the present.   The new organisation cannot start functioningearlier than the spring of 197^: the interval is needed for elaboratingthe scheme and preparing legislation; for Parliamentary considerationof the legislation; and for the process of transition.   The new authorities will not reach their full efficiency until some years
after they assume power.   The new structure must be designed to lastin essentials till the year 2000 and beyond.Pro vine ejs14.   The Government intend to keep an open mind at present on the pro-posals for organising local authorities in provinces.   Machinery willbe needed to carry out at the provincial level tasks of the kind theCommission described, but though the Government has always made clearthat the reorganisation of local government proper will not be delayed until the findings of the Commission on the Constitution arc known,the work of that Commission has an obvious bearing on the form thatany provincial machinery should take.   As foreshadowed by the PrimeMinister in his statement to the House on 11th June 1969, theGovernment has decided that it would be premature to reach conclusions on this subject until the Commission has reported.   The essentialcorollary of this decision is that, in the meantime, the valuable workof the Regional Economic Planning Councils, to which tho government attach great importance, must be carried forward.   Arrangements will bemade for developing the co-operation of the Economic Planning Councilswith local authorities and Standing Conferences or other associations of local authorities for planning purposes, in order to ensure thattheir aims and policies are increasingly co-ordinated and harmonisedwith each other.Scotland andL Wales15* In considering the reorganisation of local government, some factoroperate equally throughout Great Britain. For example, where towns andthe countryside have become a unity for the activities of local govern-ment, the organisation should not divide them. On the other hand the differences in the geography and history of the three countries make itwrong to try to force local government organisation into the same mouldfor each.
16.   Consultations are taking place on the report of the BoyalCommission on Local Government in Scotland, under the chairmanship ofLord V/heatley (Cmnd. Vl^O).   A White Paper on the future structure oflocal government in Scotland will be laid before Parliament in the spring.17.   The Government published its proposals for the reorganisation oflocal government in Wales in the White Paper of July 1967.   After theRoyal Commissions on Local Government in England and Scotland had reported, the Secretary of State for Wales decided to make a further review of the geographical counties of Glamorgan and Monraouth to seeif a satisfactory pattern could be worked out which would avoid thecontinued divisions between county boroughs and administrative counties.He will report his conclusions shortly.
180     The Government accept the Commissions conclusion on theadvantages of making a single authority responsible for all services in a particular area, wherever geographical and other factors make this possible.   Successful local government will depend increasinglyon the ability of authorities to co-ordinate a wide range of functions in furtherance of the objectives they have set out to achieve, andon developing links between services-   Adoption of the unitary systemwherever possible will make local government stronger, more efficient and more comprehensible to the public *19.     Modern conditions require that the unitary areas should cover both town and country.   The point is not that the interests of town and country are identical but that they are complementary and that theirsocial and economic interdependence has increased to a point where onlya single authority responsible for both can undertake the planneddevelopment of the main local government services to the maximumadvantage of the dwellers in town and country.   The Government agreebroadly with the Commission about the size of the unitary areas,although a few of the unitary areas proposed by the Commission may on further examination prove to be on the small side20.     It will, of course, be necessary to choose a suitable genericterm for the &quot;unitary areas&quot; as well as for the &quot;metropolitan areas&quot;:for the time being the Government use in this paper the terms chosen by the Commission as a matter of convenience in discussion, and not as permanent labelso   The Government also use the term &quot;main authorities&quot;in the same sense as the Commission, to describe the unitary authoritiesmetropolitan authorities and metropolitan district councils, i.e. allauthorities except the local councils.The Metropolitan Areas21 o     The Government agree that in some parts of the country therequirements of land-use planning and transportation point towards
unitary areas with much larger populations than are necessary orreasonable for some other services; and that a two-tier system is inthese circumstances unavoidable.22o     The Commission&apos;s proposed division of functions between the twotiers in metropolitan areas is sot out in Appendix Co   The government propose that in such areas education should be entrusted to the uppertier authority.   The Commission preferred the lower tier authorityso that education could be administered by the same authorities asthe personal social services concerned with children.,   There are,however, powerful arguments on the other side.    In general it is truethat an authority which can command large resources, particularly inspecialised manpower, can provide a more efficient education service.In particular the metropolitan areas contain heavy concentrations ofinstitutions for further and higher education-    These forms of educationmake exceptional demands on the resources of the administering authority and involve the provision of facilities which have wideimplications for the &quot;environmental services&quot;, planning, transportationand development,   Since students are mobile and catchment areasextensive, wide coordination is needed;    It is true that the problemof cooperation between the education authority and the lower tierauthorities in connection with the children of families needingspecial help remains, but this need be no greater than the problemof cooperation between lower tier authorities in education matters which the Commission^ solution would generate.,   The choice is a difficult one, and the Government have weighed with great care thearguments in the Commission^ report and that of the Seebohm Committee*for entrusting education to the same authorities as the other personal services, but they have concluded in favour of making education theresponsibility of the metropolitan authorities.*Report of the Committee on Local Authority and Allied personal social Services, 1969 (Cmnd. 3703)
CONFIDENTIAL23.     The transfer of education to the metropolitan authorities means,in the Government&apos;s view, that they should be the rating authoritiesin metropolitan areas, as the bulk of expenditure there will fall on them.2^.     The Commission^ proposals about housing have given the Governmentsome hesitation.   The Commission proposed that responsibilities shouldbe divided as follows:Metropolitan authority Metropolitan district council(a) metropolitan housing policy (i)     building (within framework of metropolitan policy)(b.) building in the interests ofthe metropolitan area as a whole (ii)   house management(c) building to ensure fulfilment       (iii) all other housing powersof planning policies(d) policy for selection of tenants(e) metropolitan rent policy the Commission were clearly right in believing that the functionslisted on the left must be carried out by the authorities responsiblefor planning, transportation and development: they are among themost important ways in which planning is put into practical effect.It is arguable that the other housing functions should be entrusted to the same authorities, to avoid division of responsibility.   TheGovernment&apos;s conclusion is that the Commission are right in believing that the drawbacks of this division are outweighed by the advantages of giving the responsibilities on the right to authorities responsiblefor the relevant personal social services; and they agree in principlev/ith the Commission&apos; s proposals.   However, they also believe that when these proposals are translated into statutory terms the power of themetropolitan authorities to undertake building should be widely drawn,and should include power to supplement or  re inforce the housebuildingprogrammes of the district councils.25.     The Government agree generally with the Commission^ proposals about how other responsibilities should be distributed in the
metropolitan areas.   All statutory planning and transport powers mustbelong, as the Commission recommended, to the metropolitan authorities.There are one or two instances, however, where the Government wish toconsider the precise allocation of functions in more detail.The National Health Service26.     The Royal Commission welcomed the proposal in the Green Paper*,published while they were still at work, that the administration ofthe hospital, general practitioner and local health services should bebrought together.    The Commission made plain that they had not takenevidence on the subject, but suggested that consideration should begiven to unifying responsibility for the national health service withinthe new system of local government.   They set out a number of arguments in favour of this course of action though they appreciated thefinancial and other difficulties.27.     After full consideration the Government have decided that suchan arrangement would not be practicable.    They endorse the Commission&apos;view, however, that the unified health service and the local authoritypersonal social services must be closely co-ordinated, and agree withthe Commission that the health service should be reorganised on thebasis of the new main local authority areas.   Details of theGovernment&apos;s revised proposals regarding the administration of the health services in England will be published shortly in a furtherGreen Paper.Special Cases28.     The Government&apos;s conclusions about the services which theCommission dealt with under the heading of &quot;special cases&quot;, such asthe police, are set out in Appendix D to this paper.   These concern thework of both the unitary and the metropolitan authorities.*National Health Service:    The Administrative Structure of the medical and Related Services in England and Wales.   HMSO 1968.
Ill   -   THE MAP29.     The Commission proposed 58 unitary areas; and explained at theend of their report what places each would include and why.   Theysimilarly set out proposals for 3 &quot;metropolitan areas&quot; with two tiersof administration, on Merseyside, in South-East Lancashire and Cheshireand in the West Midlands; and for 20 districts in them,,   TheCommission&apos;s map showing the 58 unitary and 3 metropolitan areas isreprinted at the end of this paper.30.     It is convenient to give the Government&apos;s conclusions about two-tier areas first.Two-tier Areas31.     The Government agree, as they have said above, that where,because of concentrations of population, the environmental group of services - that is, planning, transport and development - ought to bedealt with on a large scale, the ideal of a single authority for all services must be given up.   There must be a large authority for some services and several smaller ones for the rest.32.     They agree that the three &quot;metropolitan areas&quot; described by theCommission ought to be organised in this way.   They recognise what itwill mean for cities and towns in these areas which have throughout their history been accustomed to manage all their own local affairs.They regret that in the West Midlands it means reorganising an area which underwent reorganisation only a few years.ago.   However, theenvironmental services above all need.the comprehensive and imaginativedevelopment which only a single authority can provide; and joint work by several different authorities is inevitably coupled with too large a part being played by central government.   For the same reason, theGovernment are satisfied that the Commission were right to draw wideboundaries for these areas, taking in parts of the surrounding country,though the actual line of the boundaries needs to be considered in thenext stage of consultations, in common with other boundary lines.
33.     The Government have reached the conclusions that in addition tothe three areas proposed by the Commission the following additionaltwo-tier areas should bo created:-West YorkshireAn area formed by combining the Commission&apos;s areas No. 7(Bradford), No, 8 (Leeds), No. 9 (Halifax), No. 10 (Huddersfield)and No. 11 (Mid-Yorkshire).South HampshireAn area formed by combining the Commissions areas No. 57(Southampton and South Hampshire) and No. 58 (Portsmouth,South-East Hampshire and the Isle of Wight).3^.     The Commission made it clear that their choices were reachedafter considerable study: and they set out (pages 77, 79? 193i 296and 297) their reasons for not including the two areas that theGovernment now propose.   The Government&apos;s reasons for differingare these.35-     Though the population of West Yorkshire is not so concentratedas the population in the Commission&apos;s three areas, the Government are convinced that the area needs to be planned as a whole.   Between now and the end of the century it will see great changes.    Its industries are changing and its towns are being redeveloped.   The encouragement and location of new employement needs to be considered in conjunctionwith the solutions to the bad housing conditions from which so muchof West Yorkshire suffers.   This process of transformation, and changesin communications to fit it, ought to be planned and supervised by asingle authority.     Secondly, it is a part of the country whereeducation can be managed by a single authority with great advantage.Its boundaries would embrace the greater part of the present area ofthe West Riding in addition to the county boroughs of Bradford, Leeds,Halifax and Huddersfield, and, since the Government propose, in
CONFIDENTIALmetropolitan areas, to entrust education to the metropolitanauthorities, it would provide an education authority of great strength in this part of the country,360     In South Hampshire, the Government&apos;s difference from theCommission is, they believe, essentially one of timing.   This area is growing exceptionally fast; there is every reason to expect itsgrowth to continue, and indeed to accelerate .   The Government believethat there is a real danger of mistakes being made and opportunitiesmissed unless a single authority can from the outset of the new localgovernment system have full responsibility for planning the developmentof the whole area.37o     The Government have reached the firm conclusion, after studyingall the possibilities, that the three original areas and the two nowadded are the only ones where a two-tier system should be adopted inthe reorganisation which is about to take place.   There are other areas, such as Mid-Lancashire, which the Commission found a difficultpart of the country, where two tiers may well be needed in the courseof time, but whether and when this happens will depend on developmentsthat cannot now be accurately foreseen.   It is the Government&apos;intention, however, to ensure that subsequent changes in the reorganised structure of local government in any particular area canbe me.de without the need for a further ActoDistricts in two-tier areas380     The Government do not think that allocation of responsibilityfor education to the metropolitan authorities calls for a differentpattern of districts from that proposed by the Commission.   They takethe view that districts of the general size proposed by theCommission will be necessary, in the circumstances of the metropolitanareas, for effective housing and social service authorities.   Therewill of course be full opportunity to comment on the boundaries ofthe metropolitan districts during the consultations which will takeplace on the boundaries of the new local government areas.CONFIDENTIAL
39.     The Government will also seek advice about the division of thetwo additional areas.   Their present opinions are as follows:-West YorkshireThere should be five districts, corresponding to the fiveunitary areas proposed by the Commission.   These are workablesub-divisions, and their sizes are suitable.South HampshireThere should be three districts.   One would be theCommission&apos;s area No. 57; the second the Commission&apos;s areaNo. 58, less the Isle of Wight; and the third the Isle of Wight,the last being an exceptionally small district justified byexceptional circumstances.The unitary areas^0.     Leaving aside detailed boundary questions, on which severalauthorities have already tabled suggestions, the Government&apos;s presentopinion is that the unitary areas proposed by the Commission, reducedto 51 in number by the additional tv/o-tier areas, are of the right size and shape.   However, the Government do not think that the door shouldbe closed on the possibility of joining some of the unitary areastogether, if in the course of further consultation with theauthorities concerned strong arguments for doing so emerge.   On theother hand they see no instance of a unitary area which could be divided into two without making one or both of the parts too small,or dividing tasks which ought to be  dealt  with as unities.
IV.    THE LOCAL-COUNCILS AND DECENTRALISED ADMINISTRATIONif1.   There has been much public discussion and questioning of the concept of local councils.   Further work is required to convert theCommission&apos;s proposals into a form that will make local councils an effective part of the local government structure, as the Government issure that they will prove to be.The purpose..,of--lpc-al councils42.   The Royal Commission recommended that in unitary areas, andwherever they were wanted in metropolitan areas, there should be local councils, elected at the outset for the areas of existing county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and parishes.   Local councils wouldnot have a statutory duty to provide any services but they would voicethe opinions and wishes of their inhabitants, be consulted by themain authorities when any proposal particularly affected them and havethe power to spend money on improving what the Commission called&quot;the amenity raid convenience&quot; of their areas.   The Commission also proposed that the larger local councils should be able to play a part,according.to their resources end with the agreement of the unitaryauthority,   in some main local government services.43. There has been a considerable body of opinion in support of theview that if there are to be unitary authorities then elected bodiesat a more local level are also necessary. The Commission&apos;s detailed proposals have, however, been criticised for not giving local councilsa good enough job to attract people of calibre. They have also been attacked for apparently suggesting that the local council for alarge city, probably the headquarters of a unitary authority, shouldhave the same functions as the council of a small parish.
Ijif.   The proposed organisation of local government involves asubstantial reduction.in the number of people who can serve thecommunity as members of authorities with the duty of administeringservices.   There is admittedly here a danger of &quot;remoteness&quot;, of lossof contact between the citizen and the authority, and a risk ofincreasing the tendency for people to think of government of all kinds,however democratically based, as separate from themselves.   this tendency is strengthened if fewer people have the opportunity ofknowing their elected representatives as individual persons.k%   These risks are inherent in organising local government in unitsthat correspond \vith the realities of an increasingly mobile society;they cannot be wholly avoided but they can be reduced.    A necessarycounterpart of the inevitable concentration of responsibility for services in many fewer authorities must be the inclusion, in the new structure, of elected councils to look after the special interests ofparticular places and serving a different purpose from the countyborough, borough end district councils of today.^6.   In modern society, projects needed for the general goodincreasingly have significant local effects.   The detailed ways inwhich they are worked out can make- a great difference to the benefit or harm they do to particular localities, and the people who livethere must have an effective means of making known their reactionsand wishes.4?.   The Government accordingly agree with the Royal Commission that local councils embody a principle that is basic to the new system oflocal government.   They consider, however, that changes are needed inthe Commission&apos;s detailed proposals to meet points which have arisen inthe consultations which the Government have had with interested parties and during further consideration inside Government.
Their fmictions48.   In the Government&apos;s view, the Royal Commission were right tosay that local councils should have the power to do things, at theirown expense, which would make their areas more attractive and convenient to live in;    the Commission indicated some of the things that local councils might provide and these are listed in Appendix E.   Localauthorities - including parish councils - already have a general power,too, enabling them to spend money for the benefit of their areas andtheir inhabitants.   This is a useful provision and local councils will need a similar power to spend money on improving the appearance oftheir areas and on projects of local benefit.    The extent of thispoxtfer will be considered during the discussions with the local authority associations referred to in paragraphs 68 and 69 below.4-9.   The revenues of local councils would come from rates leviedin their areas (the demands being sent out by the main authorities atthe same time as their own demands).   As the Commission say, their capital expenditure would have to be found within the.total allottedfor the main authority&apos;s area:    this means, of course, that the consentof the main authority would be necessary.   The Green Paper mentionedin paragraph 63 will discuss the financial arrangements between mainauthorities and local councils.    The Government think that somerecurrent expenditure by local councils, for example on such revenue-earning activities as providing seaside marinas, should also requirethe consent of the main authorities, since it can.be large enough tobe economically significant.   They do not,however, think it necessarythat there should be an equivalent of the limitation in terms of rateyield which applies to parishes at present.
30.   The Government do not agree with the suggestion made by theRoyal Commission that the larger local councils should themselves play a part in the provision of major services.    The division ofresponsibility would be harmful to the services concerned and would cause confusion, particularly as the position would vary from one part of a unitary area, to the next.51.    There must be a clear obligation on the main authorities to consult local councils if they are to be able to bring the opinions of their communities to bear on proposals that particularly affectthem.   The Government will consider, with the help of the localauthority associations, how the right of local councils to be consulted should be defined,   ^hey are inclined at present to thinkthat rigid, formal arrangements may defeat their own objects.32.   Local councils should have the opportunity of appointing membersof school governing bodies, management committees for old people1shomes, and as wide a variety as possible of other bodies.53-   The Government believe that another important function can beadded, namely, that members of local councils should serve ondistrict committees of the unitary authorities; and they have accepted the suggestion made by the County Councils&apos; Association andothers that the reconciliation of functional efficiency with localparticipation will bo assisted by the decentralisation of administra-tion from the unitary authorities to such committees.   This will beprovided for in the reorganisation legislation.   District committees would be committees of the unitary authority and would be staffed bythat authority&apos;s officers.   Members of local councils would.serve on them as of right: they would be chosen by the local, councils, not co-opted by the main authority.   What proportion of the committees would come from local councils needs more study; but as the committees would be committees of the main authority they would be bound by theauthority&apos;s policies, and the authority could override a decision
VtfV/ro r I UEIN E IALthey thought contrary to their policy.    Tne Government look ondistrict committees   as on important concomitant of the concept oflocal councils, and will examine in detail what range of localgovernment functions would he appropriate for decentralisedadministration hy them.    In the planning field, control of development is suitable for decentralised administration of this kind.Their boundariesjk.   The Government agree with the Commission that on practicalgrounds alone, local councils must be based at the start on the areasof existing local authorities.   It would not be possible to definenew areas for local councils at the same time as carrying out the radical reorganisation of the authorities responsible for services.The Government think, however, that new areas for local councils should be worked out as soon as possible after the main reorganisation,without waiting for five years as the Commission suggested.   Thereshould be no   attempt to impose a uniform pattern, and full regard should be paid to the wishes of the local inhabitants.55*   In general, there should be local councils throughout the wholeof a unitary area.   Most parishes will no doubt remain as they are now and so, too, will most urban districts and boroughs, though theGovernment would welcome voluntary amalgamations of parishes and clsoof urban areas that are adjacent to each other and are now adminis-tered by separate councils.    The Government would favour, too, someamalgamations of smell towns with their immediately surroundingcountryside.   But the main problems   are posed, not at this levelof size, but by towns with populations of over 100,000.    Clearly, theinhabitants of a great city do not constitute a community in thesame sense as those of a small town but the inhabitants of somesizeable towns may well do so; and a resort town, for example, may wish to spend appreciable sums on local attractions that are of concern to the whole toivn, not only to parts of it.
CONFlDiNYEAL56. The towns where the headquarters of the main authorities arelocated will be a special case, where special arrangements may benecessary.57.   The Government will discuss with the local authority associationsthese end other questions that arise in creating a pattern of areasadapted to the purposes that local councils will serve in the new system, including the Commission&apos;s proposal that local councils should be set up in metropolitan areas where people want them.58.   The Government incline to the view that in a large town it willhave to be for the existing elected council to decide whether thetown should continue to be represented by a single local council orwhether it should be divided among a number of local councils, eachrepresenting a community within the town.   Where the latter occursthe local councils would be more in the nature of neighbourhood orcommunity councils.   Such a development could bring a new anddifferent iype of elected representative into local government and could also prove an important experiment in participatory democracy.Neighbourhood councils would give the small communities that oftenreally make up towns the same kind of representation in the localgovernment system that people living in the country have had since189^ through their parish councils end would bring to an end, at this level too, the artificial distinction between town and country whichthe reorganisation of local government will abolish in theadministration of services.
V., JgLATIOKS BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT59.     The reorganisation of local government in larger units will by itself reduce the amount of work that central government has to do.Where central government performs a distributive function, forexample in allocating resources for capital investment, it willhave many fewer authorities to deal with than now - less than halfthe present number in the case of education and less than a tenthin the case of housing.   Moreover, the reduction will make it easier for central and local government to exchange information, and sobring about a closer partnership and moro effective discussions, in financial and other matters.60.     More fundamentally, the new pattern of authorities will open the way to giving local government much greater freedom than at present.Some technological changes - for example, bigger and better computers -make for increasing centralisation.   It is therefore all the moreimportant to get rid of central controls that have become obsoleteand, still more, to take the fullest advantage of the opportunities for decentralisation which the new structure will create.   Thefollowing paragraphs set out the Government&apos;s proposals about(i) financial controls, (ii) non-financial controls, (iii) controlover the way authorities manage their own internal affairs and (iv)a general power for the new local, authorities to take action for thebenefit of their areas and inhabitants.61 .     The Government opened discussions with the local authority associations on the subject of controls in the light of the recommenda-tions of the Committee on the Management of Local Government.   Theyhave more recently asked the associations to specify, in the furtherlight of the Commission^ report, the ways in which they think the discretion of local authorities should be enlarged after reorganisation.
The associations&apos; answers will help the government in studying the subjects dealt with below.Central, controls(i)   Financial62.   The most irksome form of central government control is controlover borrowing, which in practice takes the form of the Government&apos;ssanction being needed for the great majority of capital projects.Central government must, as the Commission accepted, concern itself with total investment, with its allocation among the major servicesand with national standards in those services.   However, control overborrowing in the form which it has taken under successive Governments,for many years past is more restrictive and laborious than it need be.   The Government is at work, and will be seeking the help of localgovernment, on ways to improve the system, essentially by providingfor control through programmes, instead of more detailed methods,for the more important sectors of the major services; and by allowingconsiderable freedom of decision for local authorities over the restby way of an unallocated margin of expenditure.   Indeed, as the PrimeMinister has announced, the Government are seeking moans of increasingthe discretion of local authorities even before local government isreorganised.63.   This is only one part of the thorough-going review of localgovernment finance for which the reorganisation creates both thenecessity and the opportunity..   This review must comprehend, of course,taxation levied by local government, on which some conclusions ofthe Government are recorded below..   Before legislation is prepared,the Government wish to obtain the views of local authorities and others,which means setting out proposals in more detail than the commission were able to do or would be appropriate to the present paper.   they intend at a suitable stage to publish a Green Paper dealing fully withcontrols and with taxation.
CONFIDENTIAL64..   One allied matter is the system of audit.   This has a closerelationship with the proposals for greater devolution.   Moreover, itbears on an objective which the Government are pursuing of reducingeffort spent by Government Departments and local authorities onaccounting transactions between them.(ii)   Non^fIjmncial.65.   With controls that have little or no connection with finance, itis easier to see the principles on which the discretion of localauthorities should be enlarged than to work out their application.Scattered through the legislation of a century there are controls that were appropriate when new functions were being introduced but are nowobsolete; and others will be inappropriate when all authorities arelarge and command comprehensive professional advice.   The same maybe said of some statutory powers of Ministers to intervene in other waysthan exercising routine control: for example, some powers of enquiry and some default powers.   Administrative means, such as &quot;blanketdecisions&quot;, cannot always be used to fit the use of such powers tocontemporary conditions (as the Government have done, for example,by giving councillors who are council tenants a general dispensationunder the rules governing the position of councillors who have apecuniary interest in a subject under debate).   Until a statutory power of intervention is removed by Parliament it isoperative.   To choose the powers of intervention which parliament should be advised to remove when reorganisation takes place will mean a painstaking examination of provisions in many statutes to see whichare obsolete and which will still be needed either to provide foradjudication between local authorities and individual citizens or toenable central government to discharge national responsibilities.66.   In one field the Government can already be specific... In theTown and Country Planning Act 1968 Parliament provided, on theGovernment&apos;s recommendation, discretion for important planning powers
to be devolved to local authorities; and this discretion is now being used to devolve them to authorities which are suitably placed, in the coverage of their areas and otherwise, to exercise them.   They willbe devolved as a matter of course to all the now planning authorities.(iii) hut ho ri ties&apos; int e rnal^ Jbai s ine s s .67.   The Commission, and the Committee on Management of LocalGovernment in more specific terms, recommended a reduction in control by central government in the internal administration of localauthorities.   The Government agree that in general the statutory requirements that authorities should maintain separate committees for specific purposes are obsolete (though to say this does not imply for a moment that the importance of, for example, educationcommittees has diminished: it means that the services in question arenow well established).   The same applies, in general, to provisionsrequiring the assent of Ministers to the choice of officers forcertain posts.   They must, however, have regard to the specialconsiderations which apply to the police, which is a special casein many ways, and to the Seebohm Committee&apos;s recommendations for the personal social services which will be the subject of early legislation.(iv) A general power for local authorities68.
General70.   It should be added that the freedom of local authorities doesnot depend only on the contents of the Statute Book.   It dependsalso on the way in which Ministers in successive administrationsinterpret and apply the powers given them,   In the last resort it depends on the extent to which the public and its representatives in Parliament, and organs of public opinion, wish to bring pressure to bear on local authorities through Ministers or by parliamentary debate or enquiry by Select Committee, rather than through themachinery of local democracy.   The health of local decooraoy calls for restraint in appealing from it to central apparatus.
71. &apos; TAXATION71.   The Commission pointed out the drawbacks of local authoritiesdepending for a major part of their revenues on grants made at the discretion of central government; and of the fact that though thelevel of central taxation from itfhich these grants are derived is strongly influenced by local authorities&apos; expenditure, localauthorities do not have to defend to the electorate this part of their expenditure.   They drew attention to suggestions which had been madeto them for additional sources of local revenue, but   did not discuss their merits or demerits.   They did, however, state their belief thatrates on property, modernised from time to time, must remain thechief local tax.72.   As is said above, proposals about local revenue will be putforward in a Green Paper on local government finance generally.   Inadvance of that, however, the Government have come to share theCommission&apos;s opinion that for local government of the kind nowvisualised rates must remain the chief local, tax subject to improvementto make them more generally acceptable, and particularly toimprovements in the rebates system to reduce their tendency to takea higher proportion of small incomes than large ones.   Any other sources of local revenue must be supplementary.
VII. ELECTORAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND RELATED MATTERS73.   In principle a number of the points in this part of the white paper are of equal relevance to all parts of Great Britain, but their application to Scotland will be considered in the separate White paper to be published later this year on reorganisation there, and their application to Wales will be dealt with in giving effect to the proposals in the 19&amp;7 White Paper on Local Government in Wales.Elections7^.   The Royal Commission on Local Government in England recommendedthat all councillors of the new authorities should retire together(instead of a proportion each year as in some authorities at present);that councillors of the main authorities and the larger local councils should be elected on the basis of single-member divisions; and thatelections for all the main authorities should be held on the same daythroughout the country.   The Government will consult the bodies concerned on these important proposals.   They will also consult themabout two other matters which the Commission thought should be recon-sidered but on which they did not make recommendations, namely, whethermembers of local authorities should sit for terms of four years insteadof the present three, and whether local government elections should beheld in the autumn instead of the spring.The size of councils75&quot;   The Commission recommended that none of the main authorities shouldhave more than 75 members, and that many should have fewer.   they thought it difficult for very large councils to be &quot;effective instrumentsfor the transaction of public business and in particular for thecontrol of policy&quot;;   and they believed that in the present system the size of councils dated from a time when members spent more time on thedetails of their authority&apos;s work than in modern conditions they oughtto do.   The Government agree with this reasoning.   On the other hand the
need for constituencies to be of a size to respond to electors&apos; opinionsmust also be taken into account.,   The Government agree broadly with theCommission^ conclusions, but they would prefer to study, with the help of local government, the varying needs of the new authorities ratherthan to conclude on a maximum number at this stage-   The same applies tothe size of local councils-Aldermen760   The Government agree with the Commission that the new mainauthorities and local councils should be composed of members directly elected by the people, and should not include aldermen.   They will consult the authorities concerned about the future of aldermen in greater London.Disqualification77.   As the law now stands a local government employee is disqualified from sitting on the council which employs him.   But if he lives outsidethe area in which he works, he may sit on the council for the area inwhich he resides;    and county council employees can sit on district councils (and vice versa).   The creation of fewer and larger authorities,many of them unitary authorities, will increase the number of localgovernment employees who are prevented from serving on councilsresponsible for statutory services.780   The Government cannot accept as tolerable a general principle ofdisqualification which would debar a large and growing proportion of thepopulation from the chance of becoming members of the main localauthorities.    It will be necessary, of course, for senior officers oflocal authorities to remain disqualified as in such cases there could bean obvious clash of public and private interest.   And the police are ina special position too.   In the Government&apos;s view, however, a major change in the law on disqualification is required and it is their intention to discuss this matter in detail with the local authority and staff bodies.
Expenses of councillors79.   Everyone, no matter what his walk of life or type of occupation,should have an equal chance of serving his fellow citizens as acouncillor, without having to worry whether he will be out-of-pocket asa result.    The present rules about reimbursing expenses incurred oncouncil business, including loss of earnings at employment, mean that membership of a local authority is a serious financial burden for manycouncillors.    The Government are determined to ensure that whateverlegitimate allowances are necessary should be paid to encourage people,from the widest possible range of background and representing all sectionsof the community, to participate in local government.    This will become an even more important consideration in the new pattern of largeauthorities carrying heavy responsibilities and the Government will consult the local authority associations and the Greater London Oouncilon the measures that are necessary-80.   The Government are not convinced by the arguments which have beenput forward for paying councillors, or councillors with especially heavyresponsibilities, a salary.   This would be a great change to make; andthe traditional arguments for service in local government being unpaidhave great weight.   They believe that the question should be consideredby the government of the day two or three years after the new authoritieshave assumed control, in the light of the improved system of allowances and the way in which the calls on councillors1 time and their respon-sibilities have by then developed. .Management81.   The Government agree that councillors should concern themselvesprimarily with policy;    that the number of committees is at present apt to be too large; and that more work should be delegated to officers.These and other matters of internal business should, as the Commissionsay, be left to the authorities concerned: there should be a minimum of
general rules and plenty of experiment.    The Government&apos;s view on central control in these matters are given in Part V of this paper.The investigation of complaints82.   The Government have studied further, in preparation for discussions with local government, the machinery which, as the Prime Minister told the House on 22nd July 1969, is to be established for investigatingcomplaints of maladministration in the sphere of local authorities.They believe this to be called for by the prospective reduction in thenumber of councillors, coupled with the increasing complexity ofadministration.83.   They consider that a number of &quot;Local Commissioners for administration&quot; should be set up, with functions closely analogous tothose of the Parliamentary Commissioner..   The work may call for some 10or more Commissioners, each working independently in a particular partof the country.84.   The Commissioners should report to local authorities and localelectorates.    It would be constitutionally unsound and destructive oflocal democracy to subordinate them, or require them to report, toParliament or a body or Minister responsible to Parliament, when theywill be dealing with matters on which local authorities are responsible to their electorates.   Their reports on individual cases and any specialreports they may make, for example about remedies, should be sent tothe councils concerned, and the public will be entitled to know what they say, and where maladministration has been found to know what action thecouncil proposes.   In short, the machinery should be an essential partof local government machinery itself, designed to help councillors toensure that the administration of their authorities is all they would wish it to be; and the sanction behind it should be local democracy.85.   Complaints should be routed through councillors, partly so thatcouncillors can watch, if maladministration is found, to see that a
proper remedy is applied, and still more because there are a great manyways in which a councillor can help a citizen where no maladministrationhas taken place, for example by drawing his attention to some benefithe can apply for or by pursuing his case with officials of the authority.The new machinery is intended to reinforce and not to detract from thework of councillors.86.   The administration of the new machinery should be carried out byan appropriate body, representative of and drawing funds from localgovernment generally, but this body should be concerned with administra-tion only and not with the substantive work of the Commissioners.
VIII.... BRINGING THE NEW SYSTEM INTO OPERATIONTime-Table87.   The Government think that a Bill for introducing the new system should be brought before Parliament in the 1971/72 session.    This shoulddefine the new areas, lay down the functions of the authorities and provide for the transition.88.   Between the passing of the Act and the date when the new authoritiestake over their full responsibilities, it will be necessary to settleelectoral areas and hold elections for the new unitary, metropolitan and metropolitan district councils.   After being elected the new councilswill come into being, but they will need an interval in which to- appointtheir chief officers and settle their organisation before taking over their functions from the present authorities, which would then go outof existence.   A great deal of work will have to be fitted into thistransitional period, but there are obvious reasons for not prolongingit any longer than is absolutely necessary.   The Government will want,to discuss this aspect of the time-table with local government bodies,&apos;but their present belief is that the new authorities should be electedin the spring of 1973 and take over from the existing authorities inthe spring of 197^-89o   Changes at the local council level will be kept to a minimum duringthis period.   As is said above,   the present areas of boroughs, urban districts and parishes will need to be adopted for the time being; theCommission recommended that the sitting councillors in their areas would constitute the local council until new elections could be held after thenew main authorities had assumed full control.   The Government will consult the local authority associations on whether this would be theright arrangement or whether elections for local councils should be holdshortly before the main authorities take over.
General aspects of the transitional arrangements9O0   The Government will need to lean heavily on the advice and help ofmembers and officers of the present authorities in organising thetransitiono   They will be consulting the local authority associations and other bodies on a wide variety of matters during the preparation oflegislation and of the orders which will later be needed on more detailedaspects.   Two particularly important matters, the definition of the boundaries of the new main authorities and their staffing, are treatedbelow.91.   There will also need to be early and close consultations between theexisting authorities in the areas which are likely to form the new units.Joint committees of these authorities would make for co-ordination ofwork within the areas between now and the final change-over, and would help the Government to obtain advice on transitional matters, includingproposals for electoral areas and the inheritance of public property.Areas and boundaries92.   The Government will now initiate a second stage of consultationsabout the pattern of areas and their boundaries.   The scope of the consultations and the procedure for them will be discussed with the associations, but there are two points which the Government would liketo stress from the start.   First, there is much to be done in the time.Lengthy inquiries based on forensic procedures would not be appropriate;consultations must be full and thorough, and must certainly include publicconferences, but should not be too formal.   Secondly, these consultations should not include re-opening arguments about the new structure of localgovernment.   Comments will be invited on the boundaries between areas and some authorities may wish to make alternative proposals as to the pattern of units; but the ground made in the last six months must notbe lost;   and this paper will be the starting-point for the next stage..
93.   The Bill ought to include proposals for the naming of new areas-Names are important;    there is no intention of adopting ISeinec&apos;, forinstance - a term used by the Commission only as a label of convenience..The Government agree with the Commission that names ought to be decidedlocally, not centrally, and will work out means for ensuring that full account is taken of local opinion..   There will also need to beconsultations on such matters as borough status and civic dignities. Onall these points, it will be the Government&apos;s aim to avoid any unnecessarybreaks with history and tradition.Staffing9^.   Seeing that there is bo much rationalisation in the structuralchanges, they ought to make for savings of staff in local government.For example the number of authorities collecting rates will be dividedby 20.   Again, less effort will be consumed on discussions with departments of central government.    (The greater freedom enjoyed by localgovernment, and the reduction in the number of authorities, will also have their effects on the staffing needs of Government Departments.) Onthe other hand not all of the present authorities have provided themselves with the same range of professional staff, especially for administeringland use and transport planning and the personal social services, v/hereexpertise is constantly growing.   Moreover it would be surprising if bythe time the new authorities have taken over, Parliament had not added tothe tasks of local government.   These factors, together with the transferof responsibility for part of the health service, will prevent comparisonsof total numbers.   However, councillors and electorates will no doubt be anxious to see that the process of reorganisation itself does not add to posts, especially where tasks and staff are being divided between twotiers of authority.   The Government agree with the Commission that wherethere is a surplus of senior officers it is better to pay compensationfor redundancy than to add to posts, and will study the present
arrangements for compensation for loss of office, as the Commissionsuggested.    But alterations in the terms that apply to local governmentstaff cannot be made without considering their implications for thewhole field of public employment.95.   There is no reason to expect that the prospects of officers now in local government will suffer generally from the reorganisation, bearing that mind the pressure for improved and expanded services and the increasingneed for professional skills.   However, measures v/ill naturally be needed to safeguard the interests of staff.   For this purpose and to help thenew authorities in staffing themselves, the Government propose to setup a body similar to the London Government Staff Commission.   Earlydiscussions will be held with the staff organisations and the localauthority associations on arrangements for establishing the StaffCommission and the scope of its work, and also on any other arrangementsneeded for the proper protection of staff interests.Other matters96.   A formidable number of other things have to be provided for.    Theadoption of local Acts is one example.   Consideration will also have tobe given to the administration of justice (quite apart from the proposal,cade by the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions* under LordBeeching&apos;s chairmanship)   and to the Lieutanancies.* Cmnd. if 153
CONFIDENTIALix.   CONCLUSION97.   This completes the second stage in the work, to which so many mindsare contributing, of preparing the most far reaching reorganisation oflocal government that the country has seen.    The first stage was themassive labours of the Commission.   The essential elements of theirreport have been studied throughout the country; and the Government nowpresent their conclusions on these essentials, after weighing as bestthey can the opinions that have been expressed.   The progress which hasbeen made has been due to the readiness of local authorities and others to set other things aside so as to study and start preparing comments on the report as soon as it was published.   This paper described how theGovernment propose to set in train the next stage of consultations. it also sets out the time table the Government hope can be followed up tothe point when the new authorities assume control.   The prospect of reorganisation is already handicapping the work of local authorities,and is bound to do so increasingly as time goes on.   This is why theGovernment wish to see all speed made that is consistent with seeking toevolve legislation which those who in the future live under it and serve under it in local government will find to have been far-seeing andpainstaking.98.   The organisation of local government is always controversial.   TheGovernment do not doubt that many people will differ from the conclusionsthey have reached.   The same would be true of other conclusions-   Butthey have been struck by the general agreement - not withstanding thegreat achievements of the existing authorities - that change is overdue.There is clearly also wide agreement that if local government is organised to fit future needs, in strong units with power to take major decisions,present trends can be reversed; that people will increasingly think ofthe work of their local authorities as something that they themselvescan influence by their votes at local elections and in other ways; andthat local democracy will regain its place as a major part of the democratic government of the country.
(XMiSBES ON TEDS! STRUCT^-Pim)SEDBY TEE BOYAL commission    More than 2,000 comments were received on the structure of local government proposed in the Redclif fe-Maud report.   A wide variety of views was expressed butthere was almost universal recognition of the need for radical change.   A shortappendix to the White Paper cannot do justice to all the points that were carefullyweighed by the Government in the course of consultation and must concentrate cacinHgron the opinions of the local authorities itflcT their associations.   If, however, anothergroup of comments is to be singled out for mention it should perhaps be those ofthe various professional organisations who are actively concerned in the working oflocal government and know about its problems from the first-hand experience of their members.   Many of them had reservations about some aspect or other of the structureproposed by the Commission but the general trend of their comments was unmistakablyin favour of reorganisation on the broad basis of the Redclif fe-Maud report.2.  The local authority associations differed among each other in their reactions.The Association of Municipal Corporations (A.M.C.) and the County councils association (CCA.) were in agreement with the proposal that England should be divided between unitary and metropoliitn areas.   But whereas the A.M.C. wantedmore unitary authorities, with a consequent reduction in the size of some unitary areas, the CCA. wanted fewer and thought that wherever possible the populationof a unitary area, should be at least 500,000.7j.   In the metropolitan areas, the A.M.C. thought that the metropolitan district councils should carry greater responsibility than proposed by the Royal Commissionand should be as nearly as possible the equivalent of unitary authorities.   TheCCA., on the other hand, maintained that education should be a function of themetropolitan authorities, not the metropolitan districts; and that the boundaries of the three metropolitan authorities suggested by the Commission should be moretightly drawn around the built-up areas.   The CCA. also took the view that therewere other parts of the country which might benefit from being organised on themetropolitan pattern.li-   The Rural District Councils Association (R.D.C.A.) and the Urban district councils Association (U.D.CA.) rejected the concept of the unitary authority.    Theyargued in favour   of dividing services between two tiers of local authorities throughout the whole country.
5    After their discussions with the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning, the C.C.A., U.-.D.C.A. and E.D.C.A. issued a joint statement that -representatives of the three associations had found a common approach toreorganisation.   Hie statement suggested that the unitary pattern should be2?ccd everywhere by a two-tier system, \/ith fewer functions at the secondtier than in metropolitan areas; that wherever possible, the minimum populationof the first-tier areas should be at least 500,000; raid that the population ofthe second-tier areas should normally be 100,000 or more, though the figureri-ight fall to 60,000 in sparsely inhabited parts of the country.   When their statement was published, the associations were still undecided on the allocation of responsibility for planning end housing.    They had agreed, however, that second-tier authorities would appoint members to area committees of the first-tierauthorities, charged with the local administration of some first--tier functions.6.  The U.D.C.A. was alone among the local authority associations in seeing noplace for local councils or equivalent bodies - even the traditional parish councils - in a now system of local government.    The P.CCA. thought that local councils would perform a useful function in rural areas, as perishes do now.    TheA.H.C., though doubting the value of local councils for the larger towns, believedthat elsewhere, if there was popular demand for thorn, they would be a worthwhilepart of the new local government structure.   The Association suggested, too, thatthe larger towns might bo broken into smaller areas for the purpose of establishinglocal councils there.?.  Lac C.C.A., in its initial observations, while accepting that there should belocal councils in the new system, considered that they were not on their own asufficient complement to the unitary authorities.    The Association argued thatthe democratic base of the unitary authorities must be strengthened to providewider participation by elected members in the aclministration of services.    it proposed, among other possibilities, that unitary authorities might decentraliseresponsibility for running services to area committees, which would include members appointed by local councils.3J The National Association of Parish Councils welcomed the proposals for local councils, considering them an imaginative stop forward in the development of the role of the community as part of local government.
%   The views of individual local authorities on the new structure were broadly similar to those put forward by the associations.   Almost every county boroughoutside the three metropolitan areas proposed by the Commission supported a unitarypattern.   Some county   boroughs, especially the smaller, and many non-county boroughs, wanted an increase In the number of unitary areas.   In the threemetropolitan areas, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester accepted a two-tierpattern, though suggesting that more powers should be given to the districts.Host of the other county boroughs in these areas, however, said that they would prefer a unitary system.10.   County councils wore almost equally divided between those who supported unitaryauthorities and those who preferred a two-tier structure.   Urban and rural district councils, with a few exceptions, wanted a two-tier system throughout the country.11.   Views were also submitted in detail by the Regional Economic Planning Councils,not only on the proposal for Provincial Councils, but on other matters having a bearing on planning at the regional level.   These views will be particularlyvaluable when the time comes to give further consideration to the problems of planning at that level.I
APPENDIX extract from the Report of the RoyalCommission on local Government in England&quot;HOW MAIN CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHEDg     In the light of all the evidence presented to us, of our review of the presentpattern and working of local government and of our efforts to foresee the future,we became convinced that there are four basic defects in the existing structure.Together these structural defects seriously reduce, and will increasingly reduce,the chances of ensuring that local government works efficiently and economically,is understood by the citizens who elect it, and holds their interest.   The following are the four basic faults:-(i) Local government areas do not fit the pattern of life and work in modernEngland.   The gap will widen as social, economic and technological changesquicken.(ii) The fragmentation of England into 79 county boroughs and 4-5 counties,exercising independent jurisdictions and dividing town from country, has madethe proper planning of development and transportation impossible.   The result has often been an atmosphere of hostility between county boroughs and counties and this has made it harder to decide difficult questions on their merits.(iii) The division of responsibility within each county between county council1and a number of county district councils , together with the positron ofcounty boroughs as islands in the counties, means that services which shouldbe in the hands of one authority are fragmented among several.   The difficultyof meeting comprehensively the needs of families and individuals is thusgreatly increased.(iv) Many local authorities are too small, in size and revenue, and in con-sequence too short of highly qualified manpower and technical equipment, tobe able to do their work as well as it could and should be done.7.    Partly but not wholly because of these structural faults, and in spite of thedevoted efforts of councillors and officers, there are serious failings in localgovernment&apos;s relationships with the public and with national government :-(i)    The complex local government machinery seems, and often Is, irrelevantand therefore impotent in face of the problems that confront people in theirdaily lives, either collectively or as families and individuals.   Hence thefeeling of many people that local government cannot help them and the frequentsense of frustration among councillors and officers.1- There are at present in England 1,086 county district councils, consistingof 227 non-county borough, 449 urban district and 4-10 rural district councils.1
(ii) Parliament and central government doubt the ability of local governors,within the straitjacket of the present system, to run local affairs.(iii) The variety in size and type of local authorities, and the existenceof several local authority associations reflecting that variety, mean that local government seldom acts effctively as a single body in its dealings with central government.o.    In considering what changes are needed to correct these structural and otherdefects there is one fundamental question.    What size of authority, or range of size, in terms of population and of area, is needed for the democratic and efficient provision of particular services and for local self-government as awhole?9.    After examining each of the main services in turn, we decided that answers to that question must be found by seeking to apply to each part of the country the following general principles:-(i) Local authority areas must be so defined that they enable citizens andtheir elected representatives to have a sense of common purpose.(ii) The areas must be based upon the interdependence of town and country.(iii) In each part of the country, all services concerned with the physicalenvironment (planning, transportation and major development) must be inthe hands of one authority.   Areas must be large enough to enable these authorities to meet the pressing land needs of the growing population, andtheir inhabitants must share a common interest in their environment because it is where they live, work, shop, and find their recreation.(iv) All personal services (education, personal social services, health and housing), being closely linked in operation and effect, must also be in thehands of one authority, as strongly recommended by the recent report of theSeebohm Committee .(v) If possible, both the &quot;environmental&quot; and the &quot;personal&quot; groups of services should be in the hands of the same authority, because the influence of one on the other is great and likely to increase.   Further, concentratingresponsibility for all main local government services in a single authorityfor each area, as in the present county borough, would help to make theidea of local self-government a reality.   Through allocation of priorities and co-ordinated use of resources, a single authority can relate its programme-times for all services to objectives for its area considered as a whole,(vi)Authorities must, however, be bigger than most county boroughs (andall county districts) are at present, if they are to command the resources and skilled manpower which they need to provide services with maximum efficiency.Cmnd. 3703. H.M.S.O. 1968
(vii) The size of authorities must vary over a side range if areas are to match the pattern of population.,   But a minimum population is necessary..   what this should be is a question of great difficulty and we received muchevidence about it.   V/e concluded that this pointed to a minimum of around250,000.   Though authoritative witnesses would prefer a higher minimum for education - perhaps as high as 500,000 - we did not accept that this was essential.   Moreover, a minimum above 250,000 would be too high to providecoherent and reasonably compact areas in many parts of the country.   It wouldalso be unnecessarily large for the other personal services (the personal social services, health and housing), which must be kept together with education.(viii) At the other end of the scale, authorities must not be so large interms of population that organisation of their business becomes difficult and the elected representatives cannot keep in touch with the people affectedby their policies.   This is especially important in the personal services.There was little evidence to guide us but we concluded that a population ofnot much more than 1,000,000 should be the caximum for the personal services,though much would depend on the social and geographic characteristics ofeach area.(ix) Where the area required for planning and the other environmental servicescontains too large a population for the personal services, a single authorityfor all services would not be appropriate;   and in these parts of thecountry, responsibilities must be clearly divided between two levels, and related services kept together.(x) The new local government pattern should so far as practicable stemfrom the existing one.   Wherever   the case for change is in doubt, the common interest., traditions and loyalties inherent in the present pattern, and thestrength of existing services as going concerns, should be respected.10.   In considering what the new local government structure should be, we firstconcentrated on the &quot;city region&quot; since this was the idea strongly advocated forthe whole country by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the departmentwith chief responsibility for English local government .   We examined various possible local government maps of England in turn, and the following pointsemerged:-(i)    The city region idea has value because it takes account of the fact that people are now much more mobile than they were.1-    According to the Ministry&apos;s evidence, a city region &quot;consists of aconurbation or one or more cities or big towns surrounded by a number of lessertowns and villages set in rural areas, the whole tied together by an intricate andclosely meshed system of relationships and communications, and providing a wide range of employment and serivces&quot;.
(ii) Witnesses put forward.a variety of possible areas as city regions,ranging in number from 25 to ^5 for the country as a whole.   This suggestedthat the city region was not an idea which could be applied uniformly allover England, and in some parts of the country it did not seem to us to fitreality..   In a number of areas it does provide the clue: around the greaturban concentrations of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, and also in areas where a big town is the natural centre for a wide area of surroundingcountryside and smaller towns.   But in others, such as the south west,insistence on the idea of the city region seemed to mean creating artificiallyconstructed areas whose people have no sense of looking to a city centre orof sharing interests peculiar to themselves; and in the south east the idealeads to no clear local government pattern because the influence of Londonovershadows that of other centres.(iii) Many suggested city regions would be so large as to need a secondoperational tier of authorities if local government is not to be too remotefor effective contact between the elected representatives and the people.But many of these second-tier authorities would be too small to find theresources needed for the main local government services; and in any casethe present splitting of personal services which ought to be concentrated in one authority would be reproduced over a large part of the country.11.   We therefore next considered various alternatives to applying the idea ofthe city region to the whole country.   We examined a series of maps illustratingthe other main proposals for a new structure put to us in evidence.   Theseproposals were: a single tier; two tiers of various kinds and sizes; mainauthorities performing most functions but with a level above them, covering a&quot;province&quot;, to perform the rest.    Other maps which our staff prepared for usshowed that the country could be divided into 130 to ikO areas which had some measure of coherence because of internal social and economic ties, but many ofthese areas have populations far too small to enable them to employ the range ofstaff needed for the efficient provision of any of the main services.12.   Meanwhile we had become increasingly convinced by those who emphasised theneed for an organ of community at grass-roots level.    Our conclusion was thatany new pattern of democratic government must include elected local councils,not to provide main services, but to promote and watch over the particular interests of communities in city, town and village throughout England.13-    Our examination of England had also led us to the conclusion that localgovernment, however organised, needs to include a new representative institution
with authority over areas larger than any city region, not unlike the eight areasof the present regional economic planning councils,.    This provincial council would handle the broader planning issues, work out provincial economic strategyin collaboration with central government and be able to act on behalf of the wholeprovince.Ik.    Assuming therefore that whatever arrangements were made for the operationof the main local government services there would be need for complementaryinstitutions &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot;, at the levels of the province and the local community, we decided to re-examine each part of England in turn, apply our general principles and ask ourselves where there are areas in which operationalresponsibility for all local government services can appropriately be concentrated;that is to say, areas which(i) can properly be treated as coherent units for carrying out the &quot;environ-mental&quot; group of services;(ii) have populations broadly within the range of 250,000 to not much morethan a million, the size that we had concluded would be appropriate forthe efficient performance of the &quot;personal&quot; group of services;(iii) can be looked after effectively and democratically by one council.Where areas existed that met all these three conditions, the argument in favourof one authority for each of them would be decisive.   Elsewhere responsibilityv/ould need to be divided between authorities at two tiers; and we recognised thatthis would be necessary where we found that the planning problems of big urbanconcentrations had to be dealt with over areas containing such large populationsthat a single authority would be unwieldy and, for the personal services,remote.15*    In working out possible boundaries with these alternatives in mind we hadto judge in each case v/here the balance of advantage lay, by weighing a numberof different considerations, and in particular these three:-(i) The pattern of living - that is to say, the distribution of population and industry and the pattern of travel for employment, shopping, entertain-ment and other purposes, together with prospective developments likelyto change these facts and modify the social and economic future of thearea.(ii) Democracy and efficiency - the best practicable balance between theneeds of efficiency (in terms of population, geography and resources ofmoney, manpower and technical equipment) and the requirements of effectiverepresentation.(iii) The present pattern of local government.5
l6o   It was this survey that resulted in our final conclusions.    It convincedus that over most parts of the country, 58 in all, a single authority should bemade responsible for all services, but that in three metropolitan areas(additional to Greater London) the unit needed for comprehensive planning,transportation and major development was both too large for unitary governmentand large enough to be sub-divided into units suitable for education, the personal social services, health and housing; in each of these three areas thereforeresponsibility for services should be divided between one metropolitan and several large metropolitan district authorities.&quot;14.1.1V70/200

APPENDIX DSERVICES FOP WHICH SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY be needed IN THE NEW SYSTEMpolice\,     The prevention and detection of crime and the control of traffic require largepolice forces with adequate resources and specialised equipment and a large element of mobility,,   The number of police forces outside London has already been reduced toVl, fewer than the 56 unitary and metropolitan areas there will be in the new system,,The Government agrees with the Royal Commission that there should be one police force for the whole of each metropolitan area (including now the two additional areas) andthat in the rest of the country, the boundaries of police authorities and unitary areas should coincide.   As the Royal Commission foresaw, however, a number of unitary areas will have to be combined for police purposes, and the Home Secretary will enterinto consultations to enable him to decide which combinations of areas would be mostsuitable.Fire2.     The Government will decide the areas for the future operation of the fire service after it has considered the report of the Holroyd Committee.   The report willbo published soon.   The committee told the Royal Commission their view that theservice should continue to be provided by local government.Passenger transport authorities3.      The Government accept the recommendation of the Commission thatthe metropolitanauthorities for Merseyside, Selnec and the West Midlands, and the unitary authorityfor Tyneside, should take over the responsibilities of the passenger transport authorities established under the Transport Act 1968.   The areas of the passenger transport authorities will be expanded to coincide with those of the four new authorities.   In the rest of the country, the metropolitan and unitary authoritiesvail assume control of any existing municipal transport undertakings in their areas.Waterk     The Royal Commission recommended that the new authorities should take over their predecessor&apos;s water undertakings, sewerage and sewage disposal functions andseats on river authorities.   Water undertakings owned by companies would not beaffected.   In a number of cases however it would not be possible simply to transferlocal authority and joint board water undertakings to the new authorities, since thearea of operation of many water undertakings must necessarily overlap many of thenew local authorities boundaries.   For this reason and because of the possible needtor more far reaching changes in the industry arising from the increasing interdepen-taice of water conservation, water supply, pollution control and sewage disposal,the Government considered that a special study was needed.   The Central Advisory
Water Committee was therefore reconstituted to give advice on organisation in thosefields.   The Committee&apos;s report should be ava-ilaiae in time to be taken into account in the legislation to reorganise local government.National Parks5.     The Royal Commission recommended that for each national park there should bea special authority with the sole responsibility of administering the park.   TheGovernment accept the recommendation and will consult   all concerned on theconstitution, functions and staffing of the new national park authorities.   In doinggo, the Government will bear in mind the interests of the people living in thenational parks.   Country parks serve a more local purpose and the Government agreewith the Commission that they should be administered by the unitary and metropolitanauthorities within whose areas they lie.
