UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)G(70) .6 COPY NO, ___________12th January, 1970CABINETSALARIES OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Lord ChancellorThere has been no Increase In the salaries of the higher judiciarysince 1st April, 1966, when the Judges&apos; Remuneration Act, 1955 came intoforce.    When the salaries of Permanent Secretaries and other higher civil servants were increased on 1st July last year In accordance with therecommendations for staged Increases in salary made by the standing advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the plowden committee), corresponding increases were made in the salaries of thelower judiciary, but nothing was done at that time for the higher judiciary.I do not think that we can any longer postpone giving the High Court judges and othei members of the higher judiciary an increase In salarycorresponding to that which the higher Civil Service and the lower judiciaryreceived last year,,2,      Ever since 1957 the salaries of the lower judiciary have been linked with the salaries of related grades in the higher Civil Service and have moved in step with the latter.    This procedure has worked smoothly aridhas enabled increases in judicial salaries to be made at reasonable intervalsand without political controversy even where, as in the case of the county court judges and the metropolitan magistrates, salary increases are madeby statutory order requiring the approval of both Houses of Parliaments30      It has been suggested that the salaries of the higher judiciary, as ofall other classes of the judlc.la.ry, should in future come up for reviewregularly by the proposed Special Panel of the Commission for Industry and manpower,    As I told my colleagues at the meeting of the ministerial committee on Industrial Policy on the 19th December, I see serious difficulties in the way of this proposal, but I undertook to consult the judges in confidence about it and 1 hope to be in a position to report the result c&amp;my soundings when this proposal Is considered by the Cabinet,,    but whatever may be done in the future about the salaries of the higher judiciary,i do not think we ought any longer to delay in giving the judges an increasein salary comparable to that which the higher civil servants received last july.    There is now a strong feeling among the judges that their salaries-1-
have been allowed to fall seriously out of line with those of permanent secretaries,    Moreover, the result of Increasing the salaries of the lowerjudiciary, while leaving those of the higher judiciary untouched, has meant that the salaries of the High Court Judges have been severely depressed by comparison with those of the county court judges and other classes of thelower judiciary, at a time when the High Court Judges are having toundertake an ever&quot;increasing burden of work.4,      I recognise that there are difficulties about Increasing the salaries of the higher judiciary at the present time, owing to uncertainties as to theextent of the responsibilities of the proposed Special Panel of theCommission for Industry and Manpower, and as to what is to happen aboutstages 2 and 3 of the increases In salary recommended by the plowden committee,    It may be said that we ought not to do anything for the judgesuntil these uncertainties have been resolved and until we are In a better position to see what the relationship ought to be between the higher judiciary and the top ranks of the Civil Service,    But I think this would be most unfair to the judges and I have no doubt at all that it would lead to considerable ill-feeling among them.    In my view we ought without delay to give the higher judiciary an increase in salary equivalent to the stage increase which the higher Civil Service received last July, taking for thispurpose the relationship which obtained immediately before the 1st Julywhen a High Court Judge was paid O0s 000 and a Permanent Secretary 8,600*    This would mean an increase of some  1,400 in the salaries ofthe High Court Judges and corresponding Increases in the salaries of othermembers of the higher judiciary,,5,      Legislation is no longer required in order to Increase the salaries of the higher judiciary because for the first time the Judges&apos; RemunerationAct, 1965 made it possible to increase these salaries by means of anOrder in Council, which requires to be approved by resolution of bothHouses of Parliament,    The corresponding Orders which have been madeon severa,! occasions since 1957 In the case of the county court judges andother classes of the lower judiciary have, as I have said, encountered llctleor no opposition.,    I see no reason why the position should be different inthe case of the higher judiciary if It Is represented that the increases are directly related to the corresponding increases in salary given to the higher civil servants last year.    We have In any event got to face the fact that,even if the judges* salaries were in future made subject to review by theSpecial Panel, it would still be necessary for any increases to be subject to parliamentary control so long as these salaries are charged on the consolidated Fund.u6.      E my colleagues agree to these proposals, consequential increases will no doubt be necessary in respect of the higher judiciary in Scotland andNorthern Ireland, for which the Secretary of State for Scotland and I arere spe ctively re sponsible *g;House of Lords, S.W.1.9th January, 1970
