THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OP THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEFOREWORDThe first Green Paper on the National Health Service inEngland and Wales was published by my predecessor in July 1968while the Royal Commission on Local Government in England was still at work.    It contained &quot;tentative proposals ...... as abasis for wide public discussion and consultation with representative bodies&quot;.    It sparked off a vigorous discussioninside and outside the service.   Over hOQ sets of written commentshave been received and I have discussed these proposals withrepresentatives of nearly fifty organisations.The Royal Commission has now reported and the Governmenthas announced its decisions on the future structure of localgovernment in England in the White Paper which has just been published.   The Government has now also reached three firm decisions concerning the health services.   First, it has decided,for reasons given later that the National Health Services willnot be administered by local government but by area health authorities directly responsible to me and closely associatedwith local authorities.    Secondly, it has decided on theadministrative boundary which must as a consequence be drawn between the National Health Service and the public health and social services which will continue to be administered by localauthorities.   Thirdly, it has decided that in general the number and areas of the new health authorities must match those of thenew local authorities - the unitary areas and the metropolitandistricts outside London.   On other questions, this paper containsrevised proposals for England on which there is now a further3.
opportunity for comment before final decisions are taken.The paper does not cover Wales or Scotland.    The Secretaryof State for Wales will shortly be publishing a separate green paper.   The Secretary of State for Scotland is reviewing theproposals in his Green Paper of December, 1968 in the light ofthe comments received and the consideration being given to thereport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland.Most of those who commented on the Green Paper of July 1968endorsed its central theme - the need to weld together the threeparts of the health service at every level to form an integratedservice.   Differing views were expressed about the precise point at which the line should be drawn for administrative purposesbetween the health service and other social services but all wanted to see close co-ordination between them.   There were however threestrong criticisms of the proposals which were expressed from many quarters.   First the proposal to place the responsibility for providing health services on kO to 50 area boards with noparticipation of local people below this level would have made theday-to-day running of the health service too remote from the peopleit serves and would have made it necessary to devolve excessivepowers on the officers of the boards.   Secondly, many feared that the boards might be dominated by the hospital service.   Thirdly, therewas concern that no provision had been made for regional planning.On the other hand many of those who condemned the size andremoteness of the proposed boards wanted to see integrated health authorities large enough to take extensive responsibility for thecontrol of local health services.I accept the argument that in a reorganised health service theremust be more, not less, local participation.   This does not, however,
make it necessary to establish further statutory authorities belowthe area level.   The need for local participation can be best met by district committees of the area health authority on which peopledrawn from the local community and people working in the local health service can contribute to the work of running the district&apos;services.   The need to secure close co-ordination between the health and. other social services underlies the government&apos;s decision that the number and boundaries of the area health authorities will, in general, be the same as for the new unitaryand metropolitan district authorities.    Instead of hO to 50 area boards, there will be about 90, including those in London.Finally, I accept the need for planning on a regional basis,particularly on the hospital front.    I therefore propose to setup lk or more regional health councils.   Their main task, and oneof major importance, will be to advise me and the area health authorities on the hospital and specialist plans for the regions.They will also carry special responsibility for the organisationof postgraduate medical education and exercise other functionsappropriate to a body of this kind.   But the maximum authority willbe concentrated at the area level where elected local councillorsand members of the health professions can serve on their area health authorities.   These are the main differences between my proposals and those published in the earlier Green Paper.The three questions upon which the Government has taken firm decisions are set out above.    I would welcome comments and suggestions on the other proposals both from organisations and individuals.   The future of the National Health Service is of vital concern to all who pay for it as well as to all who use it.I shall be discussing the proposals fully with the representativesof the staff who would be affected by them.5.CONFIDENTIAL
My main aim in making these proposals is to secure that thetotal health needs of each individual patient and each familywill he met by one integrated health service.   The removal ofthe present administrative barriers between the different partsof the service will enable everyone working at every level ofthe health service to plan, administer and provide for the comprehensive health needs of every citizen.RICHARD GROSSMANSecretary of State for Social services.
CHAPTER 1THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW HEALTH service.      The National  Health Service was built on four  fundamental principles.    Though the service has not  yet achieved all   itsobjectives,   these principles  have  stood  the  test of  time:-i.      The health service  should be financed by  taxes and contributions paid when people are well  rather  thanby charges  levied on them when  they are  sick;   thefinancial  burden of  sickness should be  spread overthe whole  community.     In practice,   the cost of   theservice has  increased so rapidly  that   it has notI  always been possible  to maintain this principle.But a &quot;free&quot;  service  in this  sense  is  still  right in principle.     It  encourages preventive medicineand early treatment,   relieves  the  sick of  financialanxiety,   and collects  the money when people canaf ford  to pay i t.ii.      The service  should be national   in the sense  thatthe same high quality of  service,   but not  astandardised service,   should be provided  in every part of  the country.     In the twenty-one years sincethe National Health Service was created there hasbeen some  (though not   sufficient)  levelling up of areas which were medically  impoverished before 1948.Doctors  - particularly consultants  - are now moreevenly distributed over  the country.    Although  thereis still   far  to go,   specialist  services are within reach of all.    Hospitals outside  the main centres of population have been upgraded within the  limits  set by antiquated buildings.    But  considerable differences in standards  still  remain.    Further  levelling up of resources,  particularly of  trained staff,   is needed -especially  in the Midlands and  the North  -  to providethe same high quality of  service all  over England.There are also unjustifiable differences between  theaverage standards of care provided for  long stayhospital  patients  -  the elderly,   the mentally  illand handicapped  - and  the  standards of care providedfor  short   stay hospital  patients.     In the  servicespaid  for partly  from local rates,   standards of   servicesalso differ because of  the differing demands made on local  authorities  and  the differing priorities  they give  to  their health service.iii.      The  service provides  full  clinical  freedom to  the doctors working  in  it.iv.      The service  is  centred on the  family doctor  team.The general practitioner provides  the essentialcontinuity   to the health  care  of  each  individual and each  family and mobilises  the services needed.7
His ability  to do  so  can however be  limited by  theadministrative barriers between  the different  partsof  the  service.    Originally  it was  intended that  thedifferent parts  of   the service would be coordinatedin health centres.    Until  recently these have beenslow  in developing.     There has however been a rapid growth of  group practice and of attachment of healthvisitors,  midwives and domiciliary nurses   tofamily doctors.2.     There have been  striking  improvements  in standards of healthduring the  twenty-one years since  the National Health Service was established.     The main  infectious diseases which were  once   the major  cause of death of  people  of working  age  have been virtuallyeliminated as health problems.     As  a result   of   the  dental   services provided under  the Act  the standard of dental  health  throughoutthe country has  greatly  improved.     The death of mothers   in childbirth is so rare  that  each is made  the  subject  of  a specialinvestigation.     The proportion of  British children who die  inthe first year of  life  is  among the  lowest  of all  countries  inthe world.     People   in Britain  live  longer   than  in most  othercountries.    Subject  only  to the heavy  toll  of  accidents,  most people now  live  to  face  the degenerative diseases of old age.Not all   this progress   is due   to  the  establishment  of   the national health Service,   but  much of   it must  be due   to   the  virtualremoval  of money and geographical  barriers   to   the use of  health services and  the  increase  in resources which have been devotedto the health service.3.     But more could be ahieved  if  the  service were not   stilldivided  into  three parts.     The&apos;hospital  and specialist  services are provided  through Regional Hospital Boards,  Board of governors and Hospital Management Committees.    The  family doctor,   general dental,  ophthalmic and pharmaceutical  services are providedthrough Executive Councils.    The local health authorities providematernity and child care,   midwifery,   home nursing,   healthvisitors,  health centres,   home helps,   ambulances,  mental  healthsocial work services,   after-care,   chiropody,  vaccination andimmunisation,  health education and other preventive health services.    Outside  the National Health Service  is  the  schoolhealth service provided by local  education authorities.4.     Local  education and health authorities are controlled byel ected local  authority members.    Hospital  authorities are controlled by members many of whom are suggested by  the professions,   local  government,   the universities,   trade  unions,voluntary organisations and by other bodies.    But  the finalselection of people  to  serve on hospital  authorities  is made bythe Secretary of  State   in  the  case  of Regional  Hospital  boards and by Regional Hospital  Boards  in the case of hospital management Committees.    The Boards of Governors of  teaching hospitals are nominated one  fifth by  the university,   one fifth8.
by the doctors and dentists undertaking clinical  teaching andone  fifth,   by  the Regional Hospital  Board  in whose region thehospital   lies,  with   the  remainder appointed directly by  theSecretary  of State.    About   half   the members  of  Executive councils are appointed by  the  professions,   a quarter are  appointed by  theSecretary of  State and a quarter by  the   local  health authority.5.      The money which pays  for  the hospital  and Executive Councilservices  is,   apart   from relatively minor  sums paid by patients,raised in taxes and National Health Service contributions.It is distributed by  the Secretary of State  to Regional  hospital boards,  Boards of Governors and Executive Councils.    The money which pays  for  the local  authority health services and  theschool health service comes  (again apart  from minor  sums paidby patients)   from the rates and  the rate  support grant.6,      The proposed reorganisation of  the National  Health Servicemust aim to strengthen,  develop and reinforce the  originalprinciples upon which  it   is  based.     Thus   the proposals   in  thisGreen Paper have  four main objectives:-i.      To unite the National Health Service.    Not  onlymust  the different branches be  controlled by  thesame authority but  the  separate  services must beintegrated at  the  local  level.ii.      To establish close links between the National  health service and  the public health and  social  services provided by  local  government.iii.      To place  the maximum responsibility  for administering the National Health Service consistent with nationalplans and priorities on area health authorities  inwhich  there must be strong local and professionalparticipation and  to   involve  each community   in  the running of  the services of  its district.iv.      To provide more effective central  control  than atpresent over  the money spent on the  service and  toensure  that   the maximum value  is  obtained for  it.7.      These four aims  - unification,   co-ordination,   localparticipation and stronger central  control  - must be achieved ifthe weaknesses of  the present health service are  to be overcome.The    reorganised health  service should also provide an administrative structure  in which ill-health prevention and health promotion can be given a fresh and stronger  emphasis.9.
CHAPTER 2THE CASE FOR UNIFICATION8.      The case for unification  is now widely accepted.    full co-ordination of   the National Health Service cannot be achieved in a service run by no fewer  than  168 bodies which are eitheragents of  or regulated by  the Secretary of State  (119 executive councils,   35 Boards of Governors and  14 Regional Hospital Boards)by 299 agents  of   the  14 Regional Hospital Boards   (hospital management Committees)   and finally by  158  local health authorities which have  only a  limited responsibility  to the Secretary of State.9.     Joint  planning  is  obstructed by  the  sheer number of administrative  authorities  of  varying  size  serving differentpopulations.    The areas  from which Hospital Management committees or Boards  of Governors draw most  of  their patients often cross the frontiers  of  several  local authorities.    Few  local health authorities need  to deal with fewer  than  three different hospita 1authorities:     some  in London have  to deal with considerably more.In the case  of   the care of patients with mental  illness  orhandicap some hospitals may be  located many miles from the  localauthority area  from which  their patients  are drawn.     If a regional hospital Board  tries  to act as co-coordinator  for  its  region  it  can find itself negotiating with as many as  20 different authorities,including Boards of Governors  of   teaching hospitals which are not under its  jurisdiction.    There is  one Regional Hospital board which has as many as  13  teaching hospitals  in  its region.10.    The problems  of  co-ordination have been eased by a variety of liaison and other committees established  for different purposes in different areas.    But  these committees  cannot  resolve  theproblem,   they can only ease  it.     If  all   the co-ordinatingcommittees were established which needed  to be established,   someofficers  and members would be  left with  little  time  for  theessential work of  running  the particular  service  for which each authority is responsible.11.     Two practical consequences result  from  this multiplicityof authorities.    First,   they  impede  the ultimate aim of meetingthe needs  of  individual patients and  their  familiescomprehensively.    Secondly,   the  limited resources provided for  theNat ional Health Service are at risk of  being wasted or used  to less than full  advantage.    For example,   at  heavy cost  the hospital service cares for patients who could well  be  treated at home  ifthe right  local  services were  available on a  large enough scale.Many such patients are  in hospital who could  live  outside,  would prefer  to  live outside and would fare better  outside.     In manysuch cases  care at home with  the support  of  the community health services would  also be  the better and  the cheaper solution.    Atthe same  time other patients who really need care  in hospitalmake demands on  the  local authority  services while they wait   to beadmitted.10.
12.,      Often  the barrier   to discharge  from a National health service hospital  is  the  lack of  adequate  services  for people whowould prefer  to stay  in  their own homes.    When deciding whatpriority  to give  to  their health services as against  the competing needs  of   their other services,   it   is clearly difficult for local  authorities  to take full account of  the advantages which would accrue  to  the health service  as a whole.     It  is not surprising  that  local authorities,   faced as   they are by manycompeting needs,  may often not be able or ready to spend money from the rates  on caring for patients who are being  looked afterby the hospital  services  but could be discharged.    At presentneither  the hospitals1   resources nor  those of  local health authorities  are used  to maximum advantage.13.    The  administrative divisions  of   the  service make  it  difficultto secure  the  flexible use  of  staff or continuity of  relationshipsfor users  of   the health service.    For example,   the staff  of  the maternity unit  of a hospital   in which a baby has been delivereddoes not necessarily continue  the care of  the mother after she  isdischarged from hospitals.    One social worker employed by a  localauthority may be helping a patient at home while another with adifferent  employer may help  the same patient   in hospital.    Eachhas  to establish a relationship with the patient;   each has   to identify  the problem of  the patient and his  family;    each has adifferent  loyalty.14.    The  tripartite division of   the National Health Service gaveadministrative reinforcement  to  the evolving  trend of  separationbetween general practice and hospital practice.    The cleavagebetween  the hospital  service and  the Executive Council  servicesdoes not help  communication between family doctors and.hospital doctors.     In  the hospitals,   the doctor and  the nurse are employedby the  same branch of  the health service,   but  outside,   the  family doctor under contract with  the Executive Council   leads adomiciliary  team of health visitor,  midwife and district nurse,some or all of whom owe ultimate allegiance  to a  local health authority:    he may also practice from premises provided by theau thor i ty.15.    The Royal Commission on Medical Education has  recentlyemphasised  the  important  role for general practice  in  the  futurebut  this  role  cannot be  fulfilled unless  there  is  the closestlink between medicine practised  in and out  of hospital.    moreover the family doctor must be provided with  the  tools  to do his  joband this means  full access   to pathological,   radiological and otherdiagnostic facilities which are provided at   the hospital  but should be regarded as  services for  the district.    Greater mutual confidence and closer co-operation between consultants and familydoctors can prevent  the unnecessary use of  out-patientdepartments.    A unified health service will  give a new priority to developing  the services provided by  family doctors.    Neitherconsultants nor general practitioners can be  self-sufficient:they can only do their work effectively  if   they do  it  together.11.
16.    Unification  is needed  to secure  the co-ordinated planning of the services  of  each district  and  the more effective deployment of local  resources.    But   it  is also needed  to improve  team workand ease  the problem of communication.     If  all  local healthpersonnel v/worked within one  local  service  there would be a betterfoundation for the provision of  integrated health care.     In  this service  the focus must be not  on  the particular  institutions  inwhich or from which health services  are delivered,   but  on  the needsof each patient  for which  these  institutions were created.17.    It  is  the need  to remedy  these deficiencies and  to meet  thoseneeds which are not  at present  fully met which dictates  the kindof unified service which  is required.    The  existing division ofthe service  into  three parts must be abolished  in fact  as well  asin name.    All decision on  staffing,  planning and  the deployment of resources must be governed by  the  total  health needs  of  each area.    One authority must be responsible  for  the National health service  in each area and  it must  administer  the  service of  each district as a whole.    Only  if  there  is a  total merger of  hospital and community health services   in  the administration of  bothdistrict and area services will  resources be efficiently deployedto meet  the needs of each patient.
CHAPTER 3AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIESCASE FOR ADMINISTRATION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT18.    The Royal Commission on Local Government   in Englandsuggested that  consideration should be given to  the possibilityof unifying responsibility for  the National Health Servicewithin  the new system of  local  government.    They emphasisedtwo main advantages of   this proposal.    First,   they believedthat  there was no doubt  that  democratic control  of   the health services would be much more effectively  secured by putting them under  the control  of  local authorities directly answerable to the electorate and  to the citizens at  large.    Secondly,   localauthority control would give a better chance of  establishing closerelationships between  the health services and the personal social  services.19.    The Government  accepts  the force of  these arguments but has nevertheless decided that  the course recommended  isunacceptable for two main reasons.    First,  the professions believethat  only a service administered by  special bodies on which the professions  are represented can provide a proper assurance ofclinical freedom.    Secondly,  the independent financial  resources available to local authorities are not  sufficient to enable  themto take over responsibility for  the whole health  service.    Ifthe rate support  grant were increased by the sum of  about  1,400million which the central  government pays for  the health services,local authorities would become too heavily dependent  on centralgovernment  finance.    As a result  it would no longer be possiblefor the central government  to confer  on  the new local  authorities the wide measure of independence which is  essential  if   localgovernment   is  to be infused with a new vitality.20.    The Government has  carefully considered  the suggestion of  theRoyal Commission that,  as a possible alternative  to direct  localgovernment  control  of   the National Health Service,   the relationship between elected representatives and the passenger transport  executives responsible    for  the day-to-day running of services under  the Transport Act  1968 should be examined for  itsrelevance to the administration of  a unified health service.This would resolve neither of   the two main problems of  clinicalfreedom and independent  finance.    Moreover  it would largelyprevent  the main potential advantages of   local  government control13.
from being realised.    The  less direct  the control  of  health services  exercised by local authorities,   the greater  the lossof community participation;     if health services are to bemade responsive to  local  and indeed individual needs,   theremust be closer  involvement  of members of health authoritiesin the running of health services than is  customary in thecase of public  transport   services.    Secondly,   the co-co-ordination between  the health and personal  social services would be harderto achieve  if   the health services were run by semi-autonomousbodies.    Moreover,  such bodies would be directly accountablefor the money they spent  neither  to the local  authorities nor to the Secretary of  State.    Financially there  is no analogy with transport  services which are  largely self-finaneing.21.    For  these reasons  the Government has  concluded  that  the unified National Health Service cannot  be directly or indirectlycontrolled by local authorities,  and that  special area health authorities must be established  to administer  it.THE BOUNDARY OF THE HEALTH SERVICES22.    This decision gives  the question of  the boundary betweenthe National Health Service and the services which are to remain with local  government  - particularly the personal  social services - a  greater  importance.    Health needs and social needsoverlap and shade  into one another;    as a result any dividing  linecannot fail  to create problems  of definition at  the borderline.Nevertheless an administrative division has  to be made and many   -opposing views have been expressed on the principles which should determine  the frontier.    Should provision be made within an integrated health service for  social needs which are ancillaryto or arise out  of medical needs?    When the social need  ispredominant,   should the medical need be met as part of a social welfare service?    Should services be Organised according to thelabel of  the user - the mentally ill,  the mentally handicapped,the convalescent,  the aged,  or women needing maternity services?Or should  they  be organised according to  the skill  of  the provider?23.    Many of  those who commented on the first Green Paper argued that unless a wide range of  services  for  social  support    were brought under the control of  the health authority there would bea damaging split between preventive and curative medicine,  and aninsufficient guarantee that personal  social  services would beprovided when they were needed to support  the medical   services.    Forexample,   if  the residential and home care services  for  the mentally ill  and mentally handicapped formed part  of  the personal social  services,   the process  of medical  assessment might beneglected.     If  home help services were provided as part  of  these
social  services,   they might not  be available to prevent  admission to hospital  or  support  a policy of  early discharge from hospital.Thus needs might  go unrecognised,   the care  given to  individuals and their  families would be fragmented and  the limited resources available for health   and personal   social   service would not be deployed  to the best advantage,24. After carefully considering the contrasting views  expressed on these questions,   the Government has decided that  the  services should be organised according to the main skills  required  toprovide them rather  than by any categorisation of  primary user&apos;.Any alternative would  involve the establishment  of   more  than onelocal  service deploying the same skill.    Broadly  speaking,   thedecision  is  that  the health authorities  will  be responsible for services  where  the primary skill needed  is that of   the health professions,  while the local authorities will  be responsible for services where the primary skill   is  social  care or  support.    Thescarce skills of professional people will  be used to greatestadvantage if  those of  each profession are marshalled and husbandedby one agency in each area.    Moreover  it  will more  often bepossible  to provide  for users  the advantages  of  continuity of care by one professional worker of any one discipline.Classification of  services by skill will  also help  to enhanceprofessional  standards.25.    The application  of  this principle means  that  the various services making up the  school health  service will be brought within the  integrated National Health Service.    The  services willbe provided by doctors,  especially paediatricians and  general practitioners,  dentists,  nurses,  and others  in the  employment  of,or in contract with,   the area health authority.    Their close contact with the  schools will be maintained.    At  the same  time,the new arrangements will help to  secure continuity  in the medical and dental  care  of children from birth through their  school  days.This continuity will  be beneficial whether a child  is  in goodhealth or has a physical  or mental handicap  that  calls  for constantmedical  supervision and perhaps  special  educational  arrangements.There will be other benefits  too,  notably a closer association between what  is provided as part  of   the  school health  service and what  is provided for  the child and his family by general practitioners,  other  community health workers  and hospitals.    Therisk of  duplication of  services will also be avoided and  therewill be opportunities  for  improved efficiency  in the use  of medical,dental and nursing staff.26.    The  service can continue  to be provided  in a manner acceptable to the local  education authority and its  staff.    Medicalexaminations will  as now be  fitted in with educational  requirements.Similarly,   there  is no reason why the present  good workingrelationships between the  teachers and  the doctors,  dentists and nurses  should not  continue.
27.    These  links need to be  supported by suitable  administrative arrangements  of   the kinds described  later in this Paper.28.    The home help service,   on the other hand,  will be part  ofthe  local  authority  social  services.    Even though home helpsmay often be needed by patients of  the health  service,   the  overallassessment  of  need for a  home help  is  essentially a social  ratherthan a health assessment.     In the case of  the  services  for  the mentally ill  and mentally handicapped,   the essential medicaldiagnosis  treatment  assessment  and reassessment will be undertaken by the staff  of  the health authorities  in the same way as  the assessment  and medical management  of associated physicaldisabilities.    Local  authority social  services will be responsiblefor providing  the adult   training centres,  though medicalassessments may be undertaken  in them and also for  social  work with the mentally disordered.    The area health authorities willbe responsible  for hospital and hostel   services for  the mentally ill  or handicapped who need continuous medical  supervision -including those who  are being considered for discharge and need a trial period  in a hostel  where  the practicability of dischargecan be further assessed.    Residential  care for people who are ableto manage without  continuous medical  supervision will be providedby local  authorities.29.    The area health authorities would  thus administer  thefollowing services:the existing hospital and specialist  services the existing family practitioner  services the following services at present provided by local healthauthor i t i es:1ambulances,epidemiological work (general  surveillance of  the health of   the community),family planning,health centres,health vi s i t ing,home nursing and midwiferymaternity and child health care,prevention of   illness,  care and after care,   throughmedical,  nursing and allied services  (includingchiropody,  health education,   - other  than its placein the  school  curriculum - and  screening),residential accommodation for  those needing continuousmedical  supervision and not  ready  to live in thec ommun i t y,vaccination and  immunisation,
the school  health service.30.    The Government  will consider further where responsibilityfor the child guidance service should lie.31.    Though  the area health authorities would provide services for people who  suffer  injury or  ill-health however caused andwould be responsible for preventive health measures of manykinds,   they would not have a specific responsibility foroccupational  health  (other  than for  their  own employees).    Thegeneral arrangements  for  occupational health  (which are theresponsibility of  the DEP as the Department most  closely concernedwith conditions of  employment)  are  set  out  in Appendix I.32.    This   list of responsibilities  should be read alongside  thosewhich the Government  has decided should be exercised by the  localauthority social  services.     In addition  to  the  social  services, atpresent provided for  the elderly,   the handicapped and  thehomeless,  and  the children&apos;s  services,   local  authorities will beresponsible for  the following  services which are at present provided under health powers:family case work and social work with the sick and  the mentally disordered;day centres,  clubs,  adult  training centres and workshopsfor  the above;/^the day care of^ children under  five,  day nurseries and child-minding^/the care of unsupported mothers,   including residentialcare;residential accommadation for those who cannot live at home but donot need continuous medical supervision;home helpsj17.
33.    Local   authorities will   retain  their  responsibilities  for public health matters.    The  following  public health services will  continue  to be administered by them:-the prevention of  the spread of  communicable diseasesother than by  specific prophylaxis or  treatment;food hygiene and safety;port  health;the health aspects of    environmental   services  such ashousing  and  sewerage;diseases  of  animals   in  so   far as   they affect  humanhealth;enforcement responsibilities relating  to environmentalconditions  at  work places;health education  (a power  concurrent with that  of  the health authorities).34.    This means that  for a time, Medical  Officers of Healthwill be  in charge of departments with more  limitedresponsibilities  than  they now exercise.    These  responsibiliteswill however continue  to be  considerable and  in addition  theywill be closely  involved  in preparations  for  the new health service  structure.COMMON AREAS OF ADMINISTRATION35.    Because of  the  importance of  close  collaboration andco-ordination of  services  the Government has arrived at  the firm view that  the new area health authorities must   serve thesame areas for which the new local   authorities will  beproviding personal   social   services  -  the unitary areas andthe metropolitan districts outside London.    In Greater Londonwhere the local  government pattern has already beenreorganised  some boroughs are  small  geographically or have special   characteristics which make  them unsuitable for  the separate planning and operation of health services.    the concentration of  teaching hospitals  in Inner London furthercomplicates  the  situation.     In most  cases,   therefore,   theareas of two or three London boroughs will  be grouped  to  forma single area health authority.    But  even in London,   the areasof all   single health authorities will   comprise whole boroughs:no borough will  be divided for health purposes.    Proposals  for london are  set out   in Appendix  II.13.
36.    Though area health authorities will  have responsibilities for defined areas,   this will  not prevent  patients  from usingservices outside  the boundary of  their authority:     they would,for example,  be able  to  receive  treatment  from a family doctor,dentist,  or hospital   in an area outside  that  in which they live.Nor would  it mean  that  an area health authority could notadminister an  institution,   such as a hospital  annex,  which wassituated  in  the area of another authority.    Joint  arrangements may need  to be made between area health authorities when theneeds of an  individual   cannot be met within his own area.MEMBERSHIP37.    At  present  the hospital   service  is  controlled by over ,000 appointed &quot;volunteers&quot; who give considerable  time tothis work without  payment   for  it:   the ultimate  selection ofall members of Regional Hospital Boards and Boards of Governorsis made by the Secretary of State and the ultimate  selection of all  members of Hospital Management Committees  is made byRegional Hospital Boards.    The substantial  development  of  thehospital  service during the  last  twenty one years  is  to aconsiderable extent  due  to  the devoted and largelyunacknowledge work of   the members of  these Boards and committees.    Nevertheless,   the  system under which they are appointed has been criticised as &quot;undemocratic&quot;.     It   is  saidthat many hospital  authorities are  in practice controlled by sel f-perpetuating oligarchies.    Members of hospital management Committees,  as agents of agents of  the Secretaryof State,  have a particularly  slender democratic basis.38.    The new area health authorities must be more clearlyrepresentative of  their areas and of the professions working in the area1s  services.     The Government  therefore proposes that health authorities  should consist of one  third of members appointed by the health professions,  one third appointed bythe  local  authorities and one  third plus  the  chairman appointedby the Secretary of State,    This will   introduce a powerfulelement  of  local   participation and at  the same  time help topromote  co-ordination with the other services of  the area.The Government hopes  that  local  authorities will   include amongtheir representatives members of  their personal   social services committees,  and others with a special   interest   in services which have a health aspect.    The  inclusion of membersof education committees  in Inner London and  the proposedmetropolitan districts where ecucation will  be a responsibilityof the metropolitan area authority or the Inner LondonEducation Authority will  need  special   consideration.19.
39.    At present  the medical  profession holds about  a quarterof  the places on hospital  authorities and half  the membersof Executive Councils are drawn from the professions.     It  hasalso increasingly been the practice to appoint at  least onenurse to each hospital  authority.    But  only in the case of boards of Governors of  teaching hospitals have the professionsbeen free  to select  their own representatives on hospital authorities.    The Government  proposes  that  the main health professions,  and  this  includes  the dental  and nursingprofessions,   should have  the right   to select  theirrepresentatives for  their third of  the places on the new area health authorities.    The local  professions must  shoulder their share of  responsibility for the management  of  the health services  in their area which they so  largely provide.40.    To this partnership of  elected representatives and representatives from the health  service  the government proposes  to add one  third of members,  plus  the chairman,appointed by  the Secretary of State.    This gives  room for members without necessarily a local  authority or health profes-sion background who are  interested  in and ready to devotetheir energies  to  the administration and development  of  the health service.    An area health authority might  consist of20-25 members.    Where a health authority covers an area which includes a medical   school,   the Government proposes to addrepresentatives of  the appropriate university to ensure thatthe interests of medical  and dental  education and researchare safeguarded and that related scientific expertise  is available.41.    In view of the heavy responsibilities which will  fall onthe chairmen of area health authorities,   the government proposes to pay them part-time salaries on a basis  to besettled later.    The members of  the area health authorities would receive  travelling expenses,   subsistence allowances  and related allowances.STATUTORY COMMITTEE FOR THE FAMILY PRACTITIONER SERVICES42.    The reorganisation of  the health  services will not detractin any way from the present  status of  family practitioners as independent  contractors.      Instead of  entering  into  contracts with Executive Councils as  they now do, doctors,  dentists,pharmacists,   ophthalmic medical  practitioners,  and opticianswill enter  into contracts with a special   committee, which each area health authority will be required by statute to establish.This statutory committee would be directly responsible  forsecuring  the provision of  the  family practitioner services  inaccordance with national&apos;  regulations.       It would  in generalstand in the same relationship to  the  independent  contractors and the  local  professional  committees as Executive Councils donow.      The local  professional   committees would be reconstitutedto correspond with area boundaries.20.
43.    The area health authority will  be responsible  forco-ordinating the  family practitioner  service with  the other services and  for planning  supporting services and health centres,although day to day co-ordination might  be at  district  level.The closer  linking of  general  practitioners and hospitals depends on this overall  responsibility of  the area authority.44.    The composition of   the statutory committee would be  laiddown in legislation or  in statutory regulations.     It  is proposedthat  it  should resemble  the composition laid down for executive councils and would include members appointed by  the  localprofessional  committees.45.    Under  these arrangements,   the  family practitioners as independent  contractors would not be under  the direct control  ofthe area health authority.    But  there would in practice be substantial   integration in the organisation and planning of  theservices,   as  there would be  some common membership of  the area health authority and of  the  statutory committee,   and in additionthese two bodies would be served by a common staff.DISTRICT COMMITTEES46.    The areas of health authorities will  vary from about200,000 population to about  1,300,000 population.     It  is essentialto ensure  that  the residents  in each community and  the professionalstaff working in each district  can participate  in the running oftheir district health services.    The  full   implications of an integrated  service can only be worked out on the ground,   on a scale such that  all  concerned can participate  in decisions affecting  their profession or  their community.     It  is  therefore proposed that most of  the area health authorities  should establishdistrict committees.    The  smallest  organisational unit  for an integrated health  service  is normally  the area served by a district hospital  or  the hospitals which are  jointly its presentequivalent.    Closely associated with this hospital will  be avarying number  of domiciliary health  teams led by groups ofgeneral practitioners.     The district  served by a single districthospital will   therefore  in many cases be an appropriate unit  fora district  committee.    The precise number  of  these district committees   - perhaps 200 or  so - will   therefore be determinedby the pattern of  the district health services, but where possible they will  serve  the  same districts as  the proposed district committees of  the new unitary  local  authorities.    Where  the area authority  is  small,   it would be able satisfactorily  to administerits services without any district  committees.47.    It  is proposed that a district committee  should consist ofa chairman and half  the membership appointed by and drawn fromthe area authority,   and the other half drawn from people livingor working  in the district who are not on the area health authority  itself.    The general balance of  its composition(including  the professional  element) would reflect  that of  thearea health authority.    The district  committees wi11  be served by the officers of  the area health authority.    There will  be no need for them to have  their own separate budgets.    No powers will21 .
be delegated to them by  statute.    Their exact powers requirestudy.     It  is however  intended  that each area health authority will use  these committees  to  supervise  the running of  services at the district  level,  while maintaining  its own general responsibility  for establishing priorities and securing  theefficiency of  the health services  throughout  its area.    Thedistrict committee would also serve as one of  the channelsthrough which local  people can keep the area health authorityinformed of any problems  they encounter with  the local health services.    The exercise of  these  functions will  ensure that  thearea health authority  is  exposed  to  the full vigour of  local opinion in the professions and of  local users of  the health service.22.
INTEGRATED SERVICES UNDER AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIES48    The Secretary of State will be responsible to parliament for the actions of each health authority just as he is atpresent answerable for the actions of the hospital authorities.Under the new arrangements it is he who will allocate themoney to the area health authorities,  providing a local serviceand he must be satisfied that it is spent to the best advantage.Since there will be no regional authorities other than the regional Health Councils,  the central Department will need to concern itself with the expenditure and efficiency of theauthorities at the local level more closely than in the past.This applies to both capital and revenue expenditure, and withinthe latter, to the allocation of resources between the maindivisions of expenditure.    There will be available to theSecretary of State the full range of powers of guidance, and ifnecessary direction,  that can at present be exercised over thehospital authorities.49    Provided national priorities are observed and standards of efficiency are attained,  effective power will rest with thearea health authority to develop and plan its own services which the budget allocated and to link them with those of thelocal authority.    All responsibilities for an integrated health service which can be economically and efficiently developed onthe area health authorities will be transferred to them.    Thiswill include some of the responsibilities at present exercised by Regional Hospital Boards.    Each area health authority willsettle the boundaries of its constituent districts and determine what resources should be deployed in each district, and in so doing would seek to secure a,desirable balance between servicesoutside and in hospitals.50    Area health authorities and their district committees will act as catalysts In developing new patterns of health services.There can be no standard form which integration should take atthe local level.    The aim must be to bring together the out-of-hospital services which serve each community while at the sametime creating much stronger links with the district hospital.Where health centres are provided,  they will be provided bythe health authority upon which the professions have strongrepresentation.    Under these new arrangements,  more general practitioners may wish to accept this form of practice.    But ahealth centre is no more than a building.    It is the basic ideaswhich underlie it which are important, and these can be realisedor largely realised in other ways.    The aim is to co-ordinatelocal preventive and curative services so as to provide integratedhealth care to a community.    What is important is not the ownership of buildings but the siting and deployment of services,provided that the various buildings in which people work aresuited for their purpose.51     There will no doubt be experiments with larger practices which give greater opportunities for individual practitionersto develop their special interest and for the economical use ofa wider range of technical supporting services.    If the operationalunits of local authority social services were sited alongsidegroup practices in or near health centres there would be obviousadvantages both to the authorities concerned and to the communities they serve.23._ CONFIDENTIAL
THE ORGANISATION OF AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIES52. The main principles which thebe expected to adopt in organisingits chief officers and laying downwould be:i.  that  the administration which  it   is  responsiblearea health authority wouldits committees  and appointingtheir departmental duties  :of  all  the health services  for is  to be unified;ii.  that most  of  the services provided will depend upon the close collaboration of   the many professions within theservice working  together  in various  groups and teams.It follows  that   the pattern of  the organisation should no longerfollow the  tripartite division  into hospital,  general practitioner and  local  authority services.    Nor should  it bebased upon the separate professions within the service.    Theorganisation of  a unified service should be based primarilyupon the various functions which comprise the service.    Apartfrom the statutory committee for the family practitionerservices,  any headquarter standing committees should cover all parts of  the service.    They  should be few and should be keptsmall  in the  interests  of  efficiency.    The main one would no &apos;doubt be a finance and central  policy committee covering allthe various  aspects  of the service.53.    The organisation of  the area health authority&apos;headquarters  staff  should also be such as would ensure  the comprehensive planning and management  of  services.    One of  themain functions will  be to formulate requirements  for health services and to plan their organisation and use.    A department would be required  to specialise  in this work and  the skills ofboth community and hospital  services  should be represented  init.    There are other main functions  that would requirespecialised departments.    The administrative departments would include a secretariat  and a department with personnel  as oneof its main functions.    There would be a financial department.The weight  of work on supplies, building and engineeringfunctions would probably call  for a separate department  ordepartments  for these purposes.54.    Most  functions will  require close teamwork between severalprofessions and disciplines.    This will be particularly  the casein the planning of   the organisation and use of  services.    Thecore of  the team advising the authority on this  function mustnecessarily be  its  chief  administrative medical  officer,  chiefnursing officer and chief administrative officer,  together withthe chief financial  officer who will have a special responsibility  for giving advice on the financial  implications of policies: and the efficient  and  economical use of  resources.Other professional staff  and senior officers will need  to form part  of  the  team when matters  covering their responsibilities  ordepartments are discussed. &apos;24.
55.    General  co-ordination of  the function of planning theorganisation and use of  services  throughout   the authority&apos;s  area would be a major responsibility for the chief administrativemedical officer and he would also have  immediate oversight  ofthe department  specialising in this work.    The chiefadministrative medical  officer would also need to work closely with the chairman of  the Local Medical Committee for  the area;and with the chairman  (or chairmen)  of  the Medical ExecutiveCommittee   (or Committees)   established  in his area as a resultof the First Report  of  the Joint Working Party on theOrganisation of Medical Work in Hospitals   (the &quot;cogwheel&quot;  report).56.    Co-ordination of most  of   the activities  that do not  fallwholly within the scope of  this specialised department would bea major responsibility for  the chief  administrative officer whowould also have  immediate oversight of  the department ordepartments dealing with administrative matters.57.    Some important  questions are  likely to concern separateprofessions or groups of professional  staff  as  such and  theprincipal  officer for each would be recognised as having aspecial position for  this purpose.    These principal officers would be brought  into consultation on any matters  that  closely concerned  their profession or professional  group as such,  andthey would also have the right  of direct  access  to  the area health authority on such matters.58.    The suggestions made about patterns of  administrative in thepreceding paragraphs  are necessarily  tentative.    They will need further study and  elaboration in the  light of  the comments onthis paper.    Any administrative  framework which  is  establishedshould be sufficiently flexible for changes  to be made  in thelight of  experience.59.    The actual working of  local arrangements will depend  to aconsiderable extent  on the managerial  capacity,  energy and enthusiasm of  the authority&apos;s  team of chief officers  - the lay manager or administrator and the chief nursing officer as wellas the chief medical  administrator.    The reorganised national health Service will be fortunate  in inheriting  -  from regional hospital Boards, Boards of Governors, Hospital management committees, Executive Councils and  local  health authorities   - aconsiderable body of  lay administrators and professional  staffwith long experience and training  in management.60.    The most  important principle which must  govern theadministration and organisation of  the area health authority isthe removal  of   the present  barriers between the  three parts  ofthe service.    Both the members and the officers must view theservice which they are administering as an  integrated service andbase their plans upon the total  health needs of  the patientsfor whom the services are provided and of  the communities  inwhich they are providing them.25.
FINANCE61.    It  is  estimated that  in 1970/71  the total  cost  of  the health services  in England   (including the school health service)which it  is proposed  to  include  in the new unified national health Service will  amount  to about   150O million.    this includes  expenditure of about   100 million on the services  tobe transferred  from local  authorities,  of which rather morethan half will  be provided by central Government  through therate support grant  and rather  less than half will be due to bemet  from the rates.    Finance for  the new service will  continueto be provided very largely from central  funds.    It  has beensuggested however that  the  identification of   local  authoritymembers with the  interests of  the health service would be strengthened if  there were some continuing contribution from local authority  sources.    This suggestion will be pursued  in the context of  local  government  finance generally on which theGovernment  propose to  issue a Green Paper shortly.26.
62.    The area health authorities will prepare programmes  ofcapital  and revenue expenditure  for approval  by the central department.       In approving programmes,   the Department would ensurethat a proper balance  is maintained between  the development  ofthe hospital  services and the development  of  other services,  andthat proper account  is given to  the needs of medical and dentalteaching and research,   in view of  the obligations  of  the new authorities  towards hospitals administered by Boards of Governorsor University Hospital Management Committees.      Finance  for payments  to those in contract  to provide  the family practitionerservices would be provided separately by the central Department.In the long run,   it   is  intended that  the basic determinant of area health authority budgets will be  the population served by the area,modified to take account  of  relevant  demographic variables,underlying differences  in morbidity,   the characteristics of  thecapital plant   inherited by each authority and any special responsibilities undertaken for a wider area and particularly forthe special needs of  teaching and research.630    The present hospital authorities are  trustees of  substantial sums which have over the  years been given by members of  the public for hospital  purposes.       It will be  important  to continue  to respect the local  character of   these gifts.       It  is  therefore proposed totransfer these  trusts  to  the new area health authorities and thusensure  that  the  funds are  still available  for use by the  authority on purposes which supplement  the centrally financed health services provided for  the people of   the area.      The area health authorities will be able  to accept and to  seek fresh gifts  in aid of any part of  their work.       It  is hoped  that  the public of  eachlocality will  continue  to give generous  support  to their  local health services.64.    It will be necessary to consider  the question of maintainingany present  limitation on  the purposes  for which trust  funds maybe used.       In addi t ion, where funds are held in trust  for  thesupport  of  a particular hospital,   the district  committees might be associated with their management.65.    Representatives of  the present Boards of Governors and ofother hospital  authorities will be  invited to take part  in discussions on these questions.CO-ORDINATION AND COLLABORATION66,    Any line  drawn between the health  services and  the personal social  services  is bound  to create disagreements on particular cases.      These difficulties can only be resolved by close co-operation.      This is most  likely to be  secured  if each authority looks  to  the other for advice on subjects on which  ithas no adviser on its own staff and  if   the officers of each authority regularly consult  on matters  of  common interest and are constantly exploiting opportunities  for joint action where  thiswould be mutually advantageous  -  hence  the built-in interdependenceof these proposals.27.
67,    There may,   for example,  be advantages  in extending  the  scopeof bulk supply arrangements made by the  health  service or by  thelocal authorities  to cover both health service and localgovernment needs.      Joint arrangements might  also be made  forvehicle maintenance and for the use of computers.      Where  localauthorities are  sponsoring major developments,   for  instance new towns,   the  requirements  of  the health service might be  included as part of  such projects.      These are only a few examples  of wherepartnership might  be of benefit.      The advantages and practicability of such arrangements would depend on local  circumstances and onthe needs: and resources  of  the authorities directly concerned.These broad suggestions will be  discussed with the professional  andlocal authority associations  and other bodies concerned,  as partof  the consultations on the Green Paper.68.    The  exact  arrangements  for  the reimbursement of expenditure will need to be worked out.69.    On the Appointed Day,   the medical, dental,  nursing andmidwifery staff and some of  the other staff  in  the health departments of the local authorities will transfer  to the  service of  the health authorities.      Similarly,   the  social work staff  of  hospital authorities will  transfer  to  local  authorities.      The new  localauthorities will,  however,  have a continuing need for medical advice and services and the new health authorities will have a continuing need for social advice and  services.       It  is  intended that each of  the  two parallel  authorities will provide advice and services  to the  other.     In addition each type of authority will beable to undertake work for the other.70.    Medical  attendance on people  in the  care of  the  localauthority,   for example children and old people  in hostels  andhomes,  can continue  to be provided by the patient&apos;s own general practitioner who would call  in specialist help where necessary.Social workers would be made available by the  local  authority toserve the hospitals or  the community health service  centred on thegeneral practitioner.      There would be advantages  in efficiency,flexibility and career structure and continuity if  social  workers who gave a substantial  proportion of  their time  to work in the health service were attached  to  the area health authority.Similarly,   local  authorities will need medical  officers,   full-time or part-time,   for  such  jobs as  the examination of people arriving at sea and airports.      Such staff might also be attached to thelocal authority.71.   More generally,   local authorities will need health advice  inthe planning and running of  their personal  social  services,housing and general  environmental  services and in exercising  their statutory responsibilities for public health.      The  senior officersof the area health authority will  be available  to give  this  advice,for example,   in addition to medical advice and services,   the  localeducation authority may need advice from the chief  dental  officer and chief nursing officer of   the area health authority and may needhealth visitors  to help generally with the education services andwith health education  in schools.      There will  be  a continuing need28.
for close collaboration between the successors  to the medical officers of Health and public health inspectors.      This will be particularly necessary for example  for  the control  of  outbreaks ofcommunicable disease or food poisoning where  the Public HealthLaboratory Service will also continue  to have an  important  role.Some outbreaks demand immediate and concerted action by allconcerned to prevent  the  spread of  the disease and  to  treat   those already infected.      The chief administrative medical  officer of  thearea health authority must be given the necessary authority both to call for information needed for health purposes and to act withthe help of family doctors,  health visitors and hospital  staff andof public health inspectors.72.    One possible way for local authorities  to meet  their statutory requirements and administrative needs would be  for  them to appointfor their purposes on an honorary basis medical officers who are  inthe employment of  the area health authority.      This would ensurethat the  staff engaged on local  authority health work were in themain stream of  the health service and at  the  same  time wouldprovide the  local authority with a share  in the responsibility forselecting  the  staff who would serve  them.THE WORK OF THE COMMUNITY PHYSICIAN73.    If  the proposals  in  this Paper are adopted,  most  of  thepresent work of  the Medical Officer of Health will be   included  inthe wider functions  of a medical  officer  -  the &quot;community physician&quot;who will form part of  the medical  administrative  team of  the area health authority but who will also work with the  local  authority on public health and other services where, medical advice  is needed. Asadviser both to the area health authority and to  the  local authority the community physician will be able  to survey the  general pattern of health care,  both in the hospitals and  in the community,  and take a comprehensive view of health needs and health problems.      Hewill be uniquely placed to help his clinical colleagues  in the continuous monitoring of  the need for and the outcome  of  clinicalservices.      This process of medical audit has already been developed  to a consierable  extent by,   for example,  obstetriciansand paediatricians and by the use of  such new developments as  theHospital   In-Patient Enquiry and hospital  activity analysis.      Butthere have not been  the  local  resources or organisation to pursueit more widely.      The &quot;cogwheel&quot;  system of  organisation of medicalwork in hospitals  gives new opportunities  for collaboration withthe community physician and the community services.       In addition,the community physician will continue  to exercise  the  responsibi1i-ties of present Medical Officers of Health  in promoting  thedevelopment of  the  local  authority services which are   incorporated in the unified health services.74.   The community physician will have much greater opportunities for acquiring closer knowledge of health hazards as  they arisethrough continuing study of   the pattern of   illness presenting  itself29-
to the health services.      This will enable him to    make a more effective contribution as  the main adviser to the  local  authority on the health aspects of all  its  services.      Thus  the communityphysician will have four main  tasks.      First,   to develop  thequantity and quality of   information about health needs and  theworking of  area health services.      Second,   to act as adviser on the health services  to the area health authority.      Third,   to advise the local authority on  the health aspects of all  its services andparticularly to give a  lead  in health education.      Fourth,   to perform the public health duties of  the present Medical Officer ofHealth.75.    This description of  the  role of  the community physician  is necessarily brief  and tentative.       It  is  intended to make a detailed study of  the scope and nature of his work in a reorganisedhealth service,   including his place  in the medical administrative  teamemployed by the  area health authority,,319.
CHAPTER 4VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS AND VOLUNTARY WORK76.   The involvement of people from the local community in the running of their services should help to maintain theirquality and the public *s understanding and acceptance of them.But these aims will not be fully achieved if the participation of the community consists only of representation at thecommittee level.    There is undoubtedly a much greaterpotential for the participation of voluntary workers in the health service than has been realised in the past and a much wider role for the work of voluntary organisations.    There are many needs of the sick and handicapped which are better met by voluntary workers than by paid staff.77.   Voluntary organisations have always made an important contribution to the working of the National Health Service.The unification of the health service will enable their workto be extended.    Those organisations which have aimed to helpparticular types of patient have found the administrativebarriers within the present service an obstacle to the fullachievement of these aims.    Voluntary service which supportspatients both in hospital and in the community will strengthen the sense of continuity throughout the health service andconstitute a further force helping to knit its elementstogether.    The discussions following the publication of thefirst Green Paper have shown that the voluntary organisationsare ready to take a fresh look at their activities and to see how far they need to be adapted to work alongside an integrated service.78.   Voluntary activity by organisations and by groups, andvolunteer projects of many kinds, will receive encouragement and support from the new area health authorities, but the mainworking links will be with the district committees.    Paidorganisers of voluntary effort will be employed, for example,to co-ordinate support for a particular hospital; some mightbe jointly employed by an area health authority and a localauthority to co-ordinate voluntary help for the elderly ormentally ill or handicapped both in hospital and in thecommunity.    Grants and subsidies paid by the area health authority - either from its approved allocation of finance or,where appropriate, from trust and endowment funds - will beavailable to support voluntary bodies which provide and promote services within the general scope of the authority1sresponsibilities.79.   A special and continuing effort needs to be made to fostervoluntary work with long stay patients.   Many elderly, mentally ill, mentally handicapped and younger chronic sick patients risklosing touch with their local community.    Some have lost contact31.
with friends and relatives.    There is a special need for volunteers to visit and befriend such patients.    Voluntary effort may also be needed to enable relatives and friends to visit when distanceor disability makes this impossible without special help.    Thegreater the participation of the local community in its local health services, the greater the response of the service to thecommunity&apos;s needs and of the community to the service&apos;s needs.Voluntary work can be an important source for the recruitment ofpaid staff.80.   A number of voluntary bodies provide services on an agencybasis for the present local health authorities.    The hospitalcar service, for example, is provided by voluntary organisations to supplement the main ambulance service.    In some areas, theSi John Ambulance Association, the British Red Cross society and other nursing associations, provide agency services inadddition to their many other activities.    The new health service authorities will be empowered to enter into agencyagreement and to continue and develop regular arrrangements ofthis kind.32.
CHAPTER 5REGIONAL HEALTH COUNCILS AND CENTRAL DEPARTMENTRegional Health Councils81.     While the area health authorities are large enough for most healthpurposes, they are too small for the performance of a number of importantfunctions, particularly   those related to the overall planning of thehospital and specialist services - including the rarer specialties (suchas neurology, radiotherapy, neurosurgery, nephrology and specialisedlaboratory facilities); the organisation of facilities for postgraduate medical and dental education; the deployment of senior hospital medical,dental and scientific staff; the regional organisation of staff training;blood transfusion services; and the planning of ambulance services.   Toundertake these important tasks, fourteen or more regional health councilswill he established.   The regions will cover areas similar to those of thepresent Regional Hospital Boards.   They will be constructed by grouping theareas of several health authorities - probably between three and nine.82,     The membership of the regional health councils will reflect that ofthe area health authorities grouped in the region.   Each of the area health authorities will appoint at least one member.   There will be several members appointed by the professions, some or all of whom might also be members of area health authorities.   The university concerned will also be representedand there will be a. chairman and some members appointed by the Secretary ofState,   The size and composition of each regional health council have been left open at this stage.   They will depend, amongst other things, on themunber of area health authorities in the region.   The council will have asmall but highly expert staff with experience of hospital planning and otherskills needed for its work.83.     Similarly, their functions have not been defined precisely.   But oneof the most important functions will be planning the hospital and specialist services in the region and assessing priorities between competing developmentOf special importance will be the planning of the development and location ofthe rarer specialties.   In this work their role will be advisory, both to the
central Department and to the area health authorities.   But in view of their membership) their recommendations will carry great weight.84.     To maintain continuity in the planning of the specialised services inLondon and South-East England, and to maintain the important links between thefacilities in central London and the rest of the Souih-East, there will be four1 metropolitan1 regional health councils, covering roughly the same areas asthe present four metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards but keeping to thearea health authorities&apos; boundaries.   In the central part, of these four regions,co-ordination of hospital services is at present achieved through a JointWorking Group which includes representatives of the four metropolitan regional hospital Boards, the London Boards of Governors, the University of London,the London Boroughs&apos; Association, the Inner London Executive Council, andthe Inner London Local Medical Committee.   It has an independent chairmanappointed by the Secretary of State.   Under the new administrative structure,a similar co-ordinating body will no doubt be needed, with representativesof the four regional health councils, the area health authorities, and probably also the local authorities and the university, and a chairman appointed by theSecretary of State.8S.     The organisation of the ambulance service in Greater London (and inthe metropolitan areas elsewhere) will need special study.36.     Regional health councils will also be responsible to the Secretary ofstate for a number of executive functions now discharged by Regional hospital boards.   These might include the running of the blood transfusion service andthe deployment of senior hospital medical, dental and scientific staff.   Inaddition the councils will carry special responsibility for the organisationof postgraduate medical education which will need to be extensively devolped in the future.   Finally, the regional health councils will have a criticalrole to play in promoting and sponsoring research into the clinical and.operational problems of the health services throughout the region.   In recentyears there has been a rapid increase in decentralised clinical researchsupported mainly through Regional Hospital Boards and Boards of Governors,
part iv from voluntary and partly from Exchequer funds.   This is a particularly desirable development which will need to he fostered by regional healthcouncils with their close links with the scientific resources of the universities.University departments of social medicine, statistics and the like also providevaluable support for operational studies in the deployment of health services which commonly need investigation on a wider than area basis.   With their responsibilities for planning, and strong representation of area health authorities, the regional health councils will be in a special position to identify the problems which need investigation and to find, with the help ofthe university, investigators who are equipped, to undertake each assignment.87.     While they will, exercise some executive functions of their own the regional health councils will not supervise or control the area health authorities which will have a direct relationship to the central Department.Area health authorities will also be free to make joint arrangements with localauthorities or establish consortia where these seem to offer the best methodsof dealing with matters of common concern.The Central Department88.      In order to maintain an effective direct relationship with about 90area health authorities, the central Department will need considerablereorganisation.   There will need to be strengthened regional offices and much more interchange of staff between the area health authorities and thecentral Department.   This interchange will be of benefit to both parties.The central Department will be constantly refreshing itself with doctors,dentists, nurses, administrators and. others with recent knowledge and experienceof running health services at the local level.   Area, health authorities vailhave officers with recent knowledge of the priorities established at the centre,of on-going research and of the major policy issues being debated at the centre,^9*    1 Certain functions which are at present performed by Regional hospital boards will in future be performed by the central Department - particularly the programming, planning and execution of major building schemes.   Incompiling the programme of these schemes and in considering the capital programmes of the area health authorities, the Department will take into
account the advice given by the regional health councils.   Centrally, andin its regional offices, the Department will employ the professional andother staff needed for planning; and designing and carrying out, in consultationwith the future users, the major schemes included in the national programme.Their services will also be available for the smaller schemes such as health centres for which the area health authorities will be &quot;responsible.   Thecentral Department will also play a more active role in manpower planning andtraining in conjunction with representatives of health service staff.Central Myigo  y Cpunoi 190,     To assist him in exercising these enlarged functions, the Secretaryof State will establish a new Central Advisory Council with a widely drawnmembership from within and outside the professions.   The Secretary of state will consult the Council on all matters of importance to the health serviceincluding the deployment of available resources.The National Health Service Hospital Advisory Service91.     The Secretary of State will maintain contact with the day-to-dayproblems of the health service through his Department and its regional offices, through the Central Advisory Council, through discussions withchairmen of area health authorities and through the Hospital Advisory service which is already at work.   The latter has two functions specified in its termsof referencesi   by constructive criticism and by propagating good practices and new ideas, to help to improve the management of patient care in individual hospitals (excluding matters of individual clinicaljudgement) and in the hospital service as a wholesii  to advise the Secretary of State for Social Services aboutconditions in hospitals in England (and the Secretary of State for wales about conditions in hospitals in Wales.)92.     The Hospital Advisory Service will provide a further channel by whichthe difficulties facing hospitals can be brought to the attention of thecentral Department and the Secretary of State.   It is in a position to drawtogether on a national basis the lessons learnt in each hospital, and to
convey this information to other hospitals.   Every hospital has something itcan teach others; every hospital has something it can learn from others.   TheAdvisory Service should facilitate the communication of ideas between thecentral Department, the area health authorities and the hospital wards.Similarly it should encourage communication between hospitals, and betweenhospitals and the community services, including those provided by localauthorities, general practitioners and voluntary societies.   At present itis concentrating its attention on long-stay hospitals.   Its services will eventually be offered to all hospitals in the National Health Service.Complaints and a Health Commissioner93.     The vast majority of complaints are at present conscientiouslyinvestigated by health service authorities to an extent which is not alwaysappreciated by members of the public.   Some complainants, however, doubt whether the health service authority, which must itself take responsibilityfor any mistakes which have been made, can be expected to undertake impartialinvestigations.   Steps are now being taken to introduce more uniform and better publicised procedures for the handling of complaints by hospital authorities.94.     In July 1968, the first Green Paper made a number of tentativesuggestions for dealing with complaints, including the possible appointmentof a health commissioner, or commissioners, to consider complaints not dealt,with by the health authority to the satisfaction of the complainant.   Thissuggestion attracted a good deal of comment, mostly favourable but some of itcritical.95-     In July 1969, the Prime Minister, when announcing that an ombudsmansystem would be established for investigating complaints of maladministrationin local government, said in regard to the health service that it would benecessary to consider, in consultation with the professional and other interests,the relationship of any health commissioner to the new National Health ServiceHospital Advisory Service, and also other problems of definition, for examplewhere complaints involve clinical matters.
96.     These consultations will now be undertaken in the light of thegeneral proposals made in this Green Paper for the future administrationof the National Health Service.
CHAPTER 6STAFFING THE SERVICE97,   The National Health Service is already one of our largest &quot;industries.It employs,, nearly three-quarters of a million people.   The quality of theservice it provides depends above all else on the training and calibre ofthe men and women working in it.   The importance of developing postgraduate medical education has already been mentioned.   Of no less importance is theneed to extend the education and training facilities available to all other staff throughout the health service.   This will ensure that everyone is ableto work to his full potential, and will conserve the scarce resources uponwhich the service depends.   The new area health authorities, with the help of the Department and others with experience and responsibilities in this field, will need to make extensive use of existing facilities for training and education and develop new facilities where they are needed,98,   The tripartite division of the health services is reflected in thearrangements     which are now made for the training of staff.   The tripartiteservice has its origins in the history of Britain&apos;s health services extendingfar beyond the creation of the national Health Service,   Earlier patterns of services were developed to meet particular needs or to establish particularpriorities not all of which are still relevant today.   These patterns havehad a major influence on training programmes.   The establishment of an integrated health service will make it necessary to consider how far particularspecialised training programmes are still appropriate9 whether existingpersonnel can with further training undertake wider functions and whethernew forms of generic training need to be developed.   An integrated health service gives opportunities for greater continuity of care of particularpatients and a much more flexible deployment of staff.   The wide power which will be devolved on area health authorities will give them opportunities to experiment in new patterns of care and to respond to new needs.39..
99,   The proposed organisational changes will create new responsibilities for many people.   For example, the responsibilities of the chief medicaladministrator will extend to all branches of the unified health service.The area health authority8 s chief nursing officer will be concerned with both hospital and community nursing and midwifery services.   The suppliesofficer will become responsible for supplies required in all area health authority activities.   There is likely to be an increasing number of postswith duties in both hospital and community.   Moreover, the unification ofall the personal health services in an area under one employing authority will make it easier than now for members of staff to widen their experience?there will be greater opportunities for movement between different fieldswithin the service or for working part-time in different branches of it.100,   These new opportunities and responsibilities will pose new challengesto the personnel and training branches within the area health authorities.Some forms of training will have to be organised on a scale wider than thatof a single area health authority.   Special arrangeiaents for this will berequired.   At the national level, machinery will be needed to organise thetraining and development of health service staff, as well as to carry outon a wider basis functions similar to those now undertaken by the national staff Committee for hospital administrative and clerical staff and by theNational Nursing Staff Committee for nurses and midwives.   The proportionof the service&apos;s total resources of manpower and money which are investedannually in training has been rising sharply? still higher rates of investmentwill be needed in many areas.   And the larger the investment which authoritiesmake in their employees, the greater the need to husband these valuableassets by personnel policies which keep wastage to a minimum,101,    The reorganisation described in this Paper will involve considerableredeployment of staff now working for the hospital authorities, the executive councils and the local health authorities.   This must be effected as smoothlyas possible, with full consideration of the interests and circumstancesof staff who may be called upon to move0   A national staff commission or similar machinery will need to be established at an early stage in consultationwith representatives of the staff to undertake this work.   The commission will be expected to work in conjunction with any similar machinery set up40.CONFIDENTIAL
in connection with local government reorganisation.102.    More generally skilled control of manpower policy, based on aninformed understanding of the needs of the service and the indivudual willb6 essential, especially during the period of transition.   A major effort will be needed to introduce new training programmes, or adapt existingones, to prepare staff for work in the new service.   Because of the timeneeded for sufficient staff to complete training on so large a scale,training courses may have to be started before:-many staff know for certainwhat posts they will obtain in the new service a   The timetable for suchtraining will need close co-ordination with the staff commission&apos;s plans and timetable for the filling of the groups of posts concerned.103.    The rights of transferred staff will be maintained.   There? will be full consultation with all the staff interests concerning the effects of the changes on the staff themselves, for example, on any superannuation questions that arise.  Hates of pay and conditions of service in the new administrative structure will continue to be settled through national machinery.104*    If the proposals in this Paper are adopted, some of the staff of the regional Hospital Boards will work for the new regional health councils,some in the regional offices of the central Department, and some for thearea health authorities *105*    Early discussions will take place between representatives of staff and of the Department and the employing authorities in order to review and define as soon as practicable the effect on staff, and the principlesof personnel movement to be followed and the actions needed, if the proposals are finally adopted.   Well before any actual movement takes place, thesematters will come within the scope of the proposed staff commission.41.
CHAPTER 7CONCLUSION106.    There is every reason to believe that both the need for particularhealth services and the. capacity to meet health needs will change rapidlyduring the next few decades.   No one can predict what precise technologicaladvances in medicine will come in&quot; the future.   It is, however essential thatany new structure of the National Health Service should be capahle of rapidchange and that the system of organisation should encourage experiment ofevery kind.   The Gfovernment&apos; s pro4^ejsals for integrated and decentralisedservices are designed to provide /flexibility for each local area to respond to change and adapt its services to meet it.MOTS;In his Foreword to this Green Paper, the Secretary of State for social services invites comments and suggestions on the proposals made in it.These should be sent to the Department of Health and Social Security,Alexander Fleming House, London SET, not later than 30 April 1970*42.
CONFIDENTIALOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH APPENDIX Ii.      At present various categories of doctor are engaged on workconnected with employment.   Medical Inspectors of Factories are concernedwith the medical aspects of hazards arising in industry; Appointed FactoryDoctors carry out the statutory medical examinations of young persons andof persons engaged in hazardous trades required under the Factories Actand Regulations; doctors are concerned with the medical supervision ofpersons attending Government Training Centres and Industrial RehabilitationUnits; and the Regional Medical Service of the Department of Health and social Security carries out medical examinations of disabled persons witha view to advising on their fitness for employment.   The establishment ofthe Employment Medical Advisory Service by the Department of employment and Productivity will however bring together most of these at presentunco-ordinated duties into a single organisation.   The responsibilities of thenew Service will include the work now done by Medical Inspectors of factories and Appointed Factory Doctors together with that carried out in government training Centres and Industrial Rehabilitation Units,   It will also be concerned with any medical problems which arise in connection with employment and as an expert service will be available to give advice and help to anyone needing it,2.     So far as the medical examination of young persons is concerned, thepresent routine examinations under the Factories Act will be replaced by amore selective system concentrating on those young persons in need of medical advice and based on the health authority&apos;s programmes of medical supervision of school children.   From this, the Employment Medical Advisory Service will develop procedures for looking after the health of young persons in employment and giving advice to the Youth Employment Service.43-
3,     It is intended that there should be close links between the localauthority, the area health authority and the Employment Medical advisory service.   Local authorities have certain enforcement duties under the factories Act and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act and it isclearly essential that both they and the health service authority shoiddmaintain close links with the services provided by the Employment MedicalAdvisory Service.   Squally, that Service must work in close liaison withthe personal health services to ensure that occupational factors are notlost sight of in treatment.   The needs of the Employment Medical advisory service will be taken into account in the development of hospital laboratoryand other specialist facilities.44.
THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR LONDON   - APPENDIX II1,     The concentration of population, the location of the major hospitals,the complexity of communications and the smaller geographical size of someof the London boroughs as compared with unitary and metropolitan districtauthorities in other parts of England, make it desirable to group the areasof the London boroughs into a smaller number of health areas.   An appropriatearrangement might be to establish 5 health areas in Inner London (excludingGreenwich) and 10 to 1? in the rest of London.   Each of these wouldcomprise the areas of one, two or three London boroughs.2.     The areas provisionally suggested for the new health authoritiesin Inner London, which would contain all &quot;the present London undergraduateteaching   hospitals, are as followsi-A    HackneyTower HamletsCity of London3    CamdenIslingtonC    WestminsterKensington &amp; ChelseaHammersmithD    WandsworthLambethE    SouthwarkLewisham3.
