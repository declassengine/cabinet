WHITE PAPER ON europe.  INTRODUCTIONBackgroundHer Majesty&apos;s Government decided on 2nd May, 1967, to make anapplication under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome for membership of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.), and parallel applications for membership of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) andEURATOM. The Governments decision was debated by both Houses ofParliament, and at the end of a three-day debate in the House of commons the decision was approved by a majority of 426, one of the largest majoritiesin a vote in the House of Commons in peacetime. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentthereupon applied for membership of the Communities on 10th May, 1967.2. The Prime Ministers statement on the Governments decision was presented as a White Paper (Cmnd. 3269) which set out the reasons underlying the decision to apply for membership of the Communities, and the issues whichit would be necessary to resolve during the negotiations for that purpose.On the economic side, the White Paper spoke of &quot; the long-term potential for europe, and therefore for Britain, of the creation of a single market of approaching 300 million people, with all the scope and incentive which thiswill provide for British industry, and of the enormous possibilities which an integrated strategy for technology, on a truly Continental scale, can create &quot;.On the other side of the account Parliament was also informed that, while allcalculations were necessarily extremely speculative, the effect of adopting the eec&apos;s common agricultural policy as it stood might be to bring abouta rise in the cost of living of 2^-3^ per cent (reflecting a 10-14 per centrise in the cost of food) and to create a cost to the balance of payments of between  175 million and  250 million a year. The overall cost to the balanceof payments of entry, including the agricultural element, was estimated torequire the redeployment of resources from present home use to exports,or to import substitution, of the order of about  100 million each year overa period of perhaps five years.3. The political reasons for applying for membership of the european communities were summarised in the White Paper as follows: &quot; But whatever the economic arguments, the House will realise that . . . the Governmentspurpose derives above all from our recognition that Europe is now faced withthe opportunity of a great move forward in political unity and that we can and indeed we must play our full part in it. We do not see European unityas something narrow or inward-looking. Britain has her own vital linksthrough the Commonwealth, and in other ways, with other continents. So haveother European countries. Together we can ensure that Europe plays in world affairs the part which the Europe of today is not at present playing. For aEurope that fails to put forward its full economic strength will never havethe political influence which I believe it could and should exert within theUnited Nations, within the Western Alliance, and as a means for effecting a lasting detente between East and West; and equally contributing in everfuller measure to the solution of the workPs North-South problem, to the3
SECRETneeds of the developing world.&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatevents since the statement was made, and particularly the outcome of the summit Conference of the Six on 1st and 2nd December, 1969, reaffirm the validity of the statement.4. Following approval by Parliament of the Governmenfs decision toapply for membership of the Communities, the then Foreign Secretary on 4th July, 1967, made a statement on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government tothe Council of the Western European Union (Cmnd. 3345), in which, afterelaborating the political and economic and industrial reasons indicated above which underlay Britain&apos;s application to join the Communities, he set out the issues which Britain would seek to deal with in the course of negotiationsfor entry into the Communities. The major issues included the inequitableburden which the then existing financial arrangements for agriculture would place on Britain; the need for a transitional period or periods to permit a gradual adaptation to the circumstances of an enlarged Community; the need to make provision for the interests of the developing countries and territorieswhose economies are dependent on the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement;and the need to make provision for New Zealand&apos;s dairy products. on 4th December, 1969, the Prime Minister in the House of Commons confirmed that this statement by the Foreign Secretary remained the basis for our negotiations for membership.5. In December 1967 the Council of Ministers of the european communities failed to reach the unanimity necessary under the Communitytreaties to return a reply to Britain&apos;s application for membership. her majesty&apos;s Government decided nevertheless to maintain their application, andit was discussed at each meeting of the Council of Ministers of the european communities in the ensuing two years. Finally, at the meeting of the member states of the European Communities on lst-2nd December, 1969, itwas agreed to open negotiations between the Community and the states whichhad applied for membership, and it was also agreed that the essentialpreparatory work by the Community would be undertaken with the least possible delay and in a most positive spirit. At the same time it was made clear that this preparatory work would be completed at the latest by themiddle of 1970 and that negotiations with Britain and the other candidatecountries could open immediately thereafter.Developments since 1967 affecting the position of the United Kingdom6. In view of the prospect of negotiations for membership of theCommunity later this year, this White Paper seeks to assess, so far as possible,the major economic consequences of membership of the e.c.. The political implications were set out in the White Paper (Cmnd. 3269) referred to above,and the legal and constitutional implications of membership in a White Paper(Cmnd. 3301) published in May 1967. Since the Governmenfs decision toapply for membership and the Parliamentary debates on it of May 1967,there have been important developments in the position of Britain and theCommunity. So far as Britain is concerned, the cost of entry into theCommunity has been somewhat increased by devaluation, but on the otherhand there has been a very substantial improvement in our balance ofpayments and in the competitive strength of our economy.   An external4
deficit of over  400 million in 1968 ( 250 million after adjustment forEuro-currency borrowing to finance outward investment) has been converted into a surplus in 1969 likely to turn out around  300 million (and nearly 100 million more after the Euro-currency adjustment), with good prospects of continuing improvement. New developments in, inter alia, the control ofpublic expenditure and the money supply, and much modernisation ofindustry, have increased the stability and strength of the economy.7. In the Community, apart from the substantial completion of theremoval of internal tariff and other barriers to trade within the Community,there have been several major developments since 1967 which require a newassessment of the economic consequences for Britain of membership of theCommunity. First, the common agricultural policy has come under reviewbecause of its rising cost. In addition, temporary arrangements have hadto be made to meet the situation following the changes in the parities of theFrench franc and the German mark. A fuller account if these developmentswill be found in this White Paper&apos;s chapter on agi&apos;     jre and food.8. The second major development is that at their meeting on19th-22nd December, 1969, the Council of Ministers of the Communitiesreached agreement in principle on new financing arrangements for theCommunity budget, which are of great significance in three ways. First,after 1970 they would increasingly provide the Community for the first time with its &quot; own resources &quot;, Lie., the proceeds of the Community&apos;s agriculturallevies, tariffs and taxes from which to finance expenditure on agricultureand certain non-agricultural items. Second, these arrangements when finally agreed would be changeable only by unanimous vote: as such theirconsequences would be one of the major items in the negotiations forenlargement of the Community. Third, the introduction of &quot; Communityresources &quot; would be accompanied after 1974 by an extension of the budgetarypowers of the European Parliament. These arrangements, which had notbeen finalised when this White Paper was printed and which are more fully described in Chapter II, are very complex, so that assessment of the effect of their implementation is bound to be precarious even formember countries, quite apart from the additional uncertainty of the changes which would have to be negotiated to provide for the United Kingdom andthe other applicants to become members.9. The third major development in the Community springs from the summit meeting of the Six on 1st and 2nd December, 1969. In addition tothe decisions in principle on agriculture and Community financing, the Sixresolved to intensify, through harmonisation of economic policies, theCommunity&apos;s progress towards economic and monetary unification; and alsothe development of common programmes of technological advance, and ofa common social policy. They instructed their Ministers of Foreign affairs to study the best ways of achieving progress towards political unification,within the context of enlargement of the Community. The broad objectivestowards which these policies are directed in the economic, monetary,technological, social and political fields are consistent with those indicatedin the statement made on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in 1967 insupport of their application for membership of the Communities.5
Limitations on assessments of the economic effects of membership10. The foregoing outline of some major developments since 1967 inour position and that of the Community provides the background necessaryfor an assessment of the economic effects of membership of the Community.It is clear from even so summary an account of these developments that a comprehensive, reliable and quantified assessment of the economic effects of membership, starting say in the early 1970s and building up during thatdecade, is quite impracticable. Not only are the areas of uncertainty already mentioned very large, but the technical problems of making comprehensive and realistic estimates of the effects of membership are equally formidable.It is equally impracticable to make reliable estimates of the situation inwhich we should find ourselves in the latter part of the 1970s if this country were not to join the Community. It should be emphasised that it is that future situation, some years ahead, and not our position today, which wehave to try to compare with our position as a future member, if theeffects are to be fairly assessed.11. Any assessment of the economic effects of membership must therefore be in large measure qualitative. Nevertheless, in so large an issue,it is necessary to make such quantitative estimates as can be made, and toset these in the perspective of a general assessment of the likely effects of membership on the economy as a whole. The following chapters seek to do this in the sectors where significant economic effects may be expected,that is:(i) agriculture and food;(ii) trade and industry;(iii) capital movements and invisible trade.The effects of the removal of barriers to trade in coal and steel have beentaken into account in the chapter on trade and industry, but otherwisethis White Paper is not concerned with the ECSC or EURATOM. the basic assumptions made are constant throughout the estimates. It is assumed that in each case the effects of membership will not have their full impactuntil the second half of this decade and no allowance is made for the effectof negotiations on the terms of entry. These estimates must be treated with caution for the general reasons given above and particularised in eachchapter, but they do point to the direction and magnitude of certain effects,which in the concluding chapter are set in perspective in the overall assessmentthere attempted.6
II.  AGRICULTURE AND FOODIntroduction12. This chapter examines the ways in which adoption by the UnitedKingdom of the eec&apos;s common agricultural policy would affect ouragriculture, the cost of our food, and our balance of payments. For thispurpose it is assumed that the Irish Republic, Denmark and Norway wouldalso join the e.c. and adopt the common agricultural policy at the sametime as ourselves.13. An outline of the common agricultural policy and of the effects of adopting it was provided in a White Paper published in May 1967,entitled &quot; The Common Agricultural Policy of the European economic community &quot; (Cmnd. 3274). Much of that paper still holds good, includingits account of the basis and development of the common agricultural policy,and its detailed comparison of arrangements in the e.c. and in the UnitedKingdom for individual commodities. There have, however, been subsequentdevelopments in the e.c. and the United Kingdom which must be takeninto account.Recent agricultural developments in the United Kingdom14. Since the publication of Cmnd. 3274 the Government have continued their policy of selective expansion for home agriculture and there have beenincreases in the guaranteed prices for a number of products, particularly for cereals and beef cattle. There has been no basic change in the UnitedKingdom system of agricultural support, although for eggs it has beendecided to phase out the guarantee arrangements and move to a basicallyfree marketing system. However, the picture as regards the effects onproducer prices, food prices and the balance of payments of adopting theEECs common agricultural policy is now rather different from what it wasin 1967, partly because of the devaluation of sterling in November 1967,and partly because of the rising cost of the common agricultural policy.The extent to which the picture has changed is indicated in the relevantsections of this chapter.Recent agricultural developments in the EEC15. A number of regulations and directives have been adopted whichelaborate and extend the operation of the common organisation ofagricultural markets. Broadly speaking the main change since 1967 is thatthe single market stage has now been achieved for cereals, beef cattle,pigmeat, milk and milk products, eggs and poultry and rice. The EECstarget prices have remained at the same level over the last three years,except for some small increases for barley, maize and rice. The changein the United Kingdom exchange rate means, however, that e.c. prices are now higher in sterling terms than they were before.16. As the common organisation of markets for each product has beencompleted, the cost of supporting prices through market intervention and export subsidies has been transferred from national governments to theCommunity.   Community expenditure on agriculture has increased very7
rapidly in recent years as can be seen from Table 1,* because of theincreased coverage of commodities under the common policy, the higher proportion of eligible expenditure being met by the Community&apos;sAgricultural Fund rather than national Exchequers, and the development ofsurpluses within the Community. Expenditure from the Guarantee Sectionof the Fund is estimated at  831 million for 1968-69, compared with 154 million for 1966-67. Expenditure from this section is now considerably higher than was anticipated; in January 1967, for example, the Commissionestimated 1968-69 expenditure at  572 million. Roughly a third of theexpenditure is on cereals, and another third on milk and milk products;a full breakdown by commodities is contained in Table 2. expenditure from the Guidance Section of the Fund on the structural improvement ofagriculture has been subject since July 1967 to a limit of  119 million.This makes a total estimated liability for expenditure from the Fund in1968-69 of  950 million. A breakdown of receipts by member countries is given in Table 3.TABLE 1Expenditure from European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund(Fonds Europeen d&apos;Orientation et de Garantie Agricole)1966-67 to 1968-69  million1966-67 1967-68 1968-691.

SECRET17. The method of financing the Fund in 1969 was that member statespaid in to the Guarantee Section 90 per cent of the proceeds of theirlevies on imports of agricultural products from non-Community countries.In addition, sugar producers in member countries contributed a speciallevy on the excess of their sugar production over their national quotas.The remainder of the Guarantee Section and the whole of the GuidanceSection were paid for by budgetary contributions from the Governments of member countries according to an agreed percentage scale or &quot; fixed key &quot;roughly proportional to each country&apos;s gross national product; the scale used and the amounts contributed in 1968-69 are shown in Table 4.TABLE 4Contributions to Agricultural Fund by Country, 1968-69  million (figures in brackets show percentages of total)	Guarantee Section				Import	Budgetary	Guidance	Total	leviesC)	contribution	Section	Belgium and Luxembourg	37	38   (8-3)	10	85   (9-0)Germany.........	102	143 (31-2)	37	282 (29-7)France     ......	47	147 (32-0)	38	232 (24-4)Italy        .........	124	93 (20-3)	24	241  (25-4)Netherlands       ......	62	37   (8-2)	10	109 (11-5)Total       ......	372	458 (100-0)	119	950(100 0)0) Includes special levy on sugar production.Source: e.c. Official Journal No. L 36 of 12th February, 1969.18. In December 1969 the members of the Community agreed inprinciple on a new system of financial contributions for the future. For 1970the whole cost of the Agricultural Fund would be met from nationalExchequer contributions according to the following fixed key:per centBelgium    ..................       8&apos;25n 28-france      ..................31 -7Germany   ..................     JItaly ..................     Z1 30-2Luxembourg        ...............Netherlands ...      - - - 1035From 1971 new arrangements would come into force for financing not onlythe Agricultural Fund, but also certain non-agricultural expenditure. Itis not however yet clear precisely what non-agricultural items of Community10
expenditure would be covered by the arrangements. Under these arrangements, from 1971 to 1974 levies on agricultural imports would be handed over by member countries, together with an increasing proportionof customs duties on all goods. The amount of customs duties handed overwould be equal to the difference between a &quot; reference amount&quot; and theamount of levies handed over. In 1971 this &quot; reference amount&quot; would be50 per cent of the total levies and customs duties collected by each state and,in the following years 62  per cent, 75 per cent and 87^ per cent successively.10 per cent of the sums handed over would be refunded to member states tocover collection costs. The balance of expenditure would be met by members from national budgets according to the fixed key shown below:per centBelgium     ............     ......       68France        .................. 32&quot;6Germany     .................. 32Italy..................... 20&apos;2Luxembourg ...............       0-2Netherlands......From 1975 onwards all levies and customs duties would be handed over(less 10 per cent to cover collection costs) and in the place of the budgetarycontributions the balance would be met from contributions from member states corresponding at the most to a 1 per cent value added tax. All theabove would be subject to the over-riding provision that in the years 1971to 1974 no country&apos;s proportion of total contributions to this expendituremight rise by more than 1 per cent above or fall by more than \\ per centbelow its previous year&apos;s proportion. For the years 1975 to 1977 theseannual limits would be 2 per cent in either direction^19. Finally, during the past year certain changes in international exchange rates have had a significant effect on the operation of the common agricultural policy. The common prices for each member country are derived, accordingto the official exchange rate, from the prices expressed in Community unitsof account. When therefore the French franc was devalued in August 1969,the prices of products subject to the common agricultural policy would automatically have risen to the benefit of French farmers, and when theGerman Government revalued the mark in October 1969, their prices would automatically have fallen to the detriment of farmers there. These suddenchanges in farm prices were not acceptable to the Governments concerned,and special measures were devised whereby the French for a period of twoyears may impose a tax on agricultural exports to other member states andgrant subsidies on imports from them; while the Germans for a period of four years may compensate their farmers by means of tax adjustments and direct subsidies. Thus the full application of the common agricultural policyis temporarily abated for these two members of the Community.* For the purposes of calculating the German share after 1970, their agriculturepercentage in 1970 would be deemed to be 31-5 per cent.11
Euture developments20. The assessment of the effects of adopting the common agricultural policy depends on a forecast of how the common policy will develop withinthe present Community; what adjustments would be necessary to it onenlargement of the Community; and how United Kingdom food productionand consumption would respond to the new conditions. All these matters are subject to much uncertainty.21. Within the Community discussions are currently being held on thefuture shape of the common agricultural policy. The application of thepolicy at the relatively high prices for some products agreed by the membersof the Community has contributed to a marked increase in agricultural production. As Table 5 shows, the Community now has in many cases a higher degree of self-sufficiency than before the common policy was introduced. For wheat, sugar, rice, cheese and butter, production withinthe Community has moved from a position in the early 1960s where it was ata lower level than consumption, to one of excess over consumption withinthe Community. This development of surpluses has caused expenditure from the Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Fund to rise very considerably,since the disposal or storage of excess supplies is carried out at the Fund&apos;sexpense. If present production trends continue, the cost of dealing withsurpluses will become still greater.TABLE 5Self-sufficiency of the Six in principal farm products	1962-63 and	Commodity	1963-64	1967-68	(average)		(per cent)	(per cent)Wheat      ...............	99-5	112-5Feed grain ...............	77-1	78-6Total cereals (excluding rice)     ......	86-3	91-1Rice (husked)      ............	79-0	100-8White sugar        ...     .........	98-7	104-6Vegetables...............	102-4	102-5Fresh fruit (excluding citrus fruit)	91-3	89-9Citrus fruit...............	43-9	not availableBeef and veal      ............	90-3	88-8Pigmeat (including bacon)        ......	99-2	100-0Poultry meat       ............	91-4	97-8Mutton, lamb and goat meat    ......	92-3	84-2Eggs...     ...............	94-4	97-1Cheese      ...............	980	102 -7(l)Butter	99-5	111-10)Oils and fats       ............	38-5	41-8(&apos;) Provisional figures.Source: Economic Union and Enlargement: the European Commission^ revised opinionon the applications for membership frcm the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and norway, October 1969.12
22. Various proposals have been put forward within the Community fordealing with these problems, in addition to arrangements recently agreed for encouraging the slaughter of surplus dairy cows. The Commission has submitted a Memorandum on the Reform of Agriculture in the european economic Community (the &quot; Mansholt Plan &quot;), containing a set of economicand social measures intended to bring about major structural changes. among other things, it suggests taking certain land out of agricultural use, easingthe retirement of farmers, and helping those remaining in agriculture toimprove their efficiency. These suggestions would involve considerable expenditure from the Guidance Section of the Fund as well as from nationalExchequers. At the same time the Commission has put forward proposalsfor reducing the prices of certain products under the common agricultural policy, with the aim of correcting the imbalance between supply and demand.If implemented, these proposals could be expected to lead to a reductionin expenditure from the Guarantee Section of the Fund. Table 6 gives the Commission^ estimates for the cost until 1975 of each section of theFund, with and without the application of the Mansholt Plan. It shows alsoa more recent reported estimate by the Commission, based on the applicationof part only of the Mansholt Plan together with certain proposals oncommodity prices recently submitted to the Council. Other suggestions forreforms of various kinds have come from individual members of thecommunity. No decisions have yet been taken on these matters, but at theirSummit Meeting at The Hague in December 1969 the Six affirmed their desire to press on with efforts to ensure a better control of agricultural production making it possible to limit budgetary charges.TABLE 6Estimates of expenditure from Agricultural Fund by the Six, 1970-75A.

The adoption by the United Kingdom of the e.c. arrangements for agriculture would lead to large changes in prices for producers and consumers of food here. The magnitude of some of these changes would be so great compared with previous experience that it is difficult to make areliable forecast of the response to them in terms of production and consumption.24. Apart from these inherent uncertainties, there are also the possible consequences of adaptation of the common agricultural policy on enlargement of the Community. In the statement to the Western European Union inJuly 1967 (Cmnd. 3345) the Government set out the main questions in thefield of agriculture which it wished to discuss with the Community beforeentry. This statement referred not only to considerations affecting Britishproducers, consumers and the balance of payments, but also to our obligations to Commonwealth sugar producers and to the special problems of NewZealand. Unlike the uncertainties described above, however, these are essentially matters for negotiation with the Community, and no allowance for modifications to take account of these problems has been made in thisassessment.Method of assessing effects of adopting the common agricultural policy25. It is clear that any assessment of the effects of adopting the common agricultural policy must depend upon a whole range of assumptions and besubject to a substantial range of possibilities. This is true of the likely effect14
on food prices discussed in paragraphs 27-30 below; it is even more true ofthe likely effects on agricultural production and trade which are discussed in paragraphs 31-37. The effects on production and consumption, togetherwith higher import prices, will determine the effect on our import bill for food. This is one element in the direct balance of payments cost of adopting the common agricultural policy. The other element is the net contribution we must make to the Community&apos;s Agricultural Fund; this is discussed in paragraphs 38-43. The breakdown between these two effectsis to some extent arbitrary, since the calculations in each sector cannotbe considered in isolation. Outside the field of food and agriculture, thereis also the effect on imports and exports resulting from the impact on industrial costs of the rise in food prices.   This is dealt with in Chapter III.26. Two points deserve emphasis. An attempt to assess the effects of adopting the common agricultural policy is an attempt to compare what might happen if we became a member of the Community with what might happen if we did not. Thus, although not related to a specific future year, the assessment allows for a period of time to elapse during which the necessary adjustments could take place. Secondly, the assessment assumes that, ifwe became a member, we should adopt the common agricultural policyessentially as it stands. This is a simplifying assumption which carries noimplications whatever as to the changes which might be agreed upon in negotiations for our entry.Effects on food prices, consumption and the cost of living27. Food prices in the e.c. are higher partly because of the differentmethod of support for agriculture and partly because producer prices under thecommon agricultural policy for most farm products are set at higher levelsthan in the United Kingdom. Adoption of the common agricultural policy would involve a rise in food prices for most items through the impositionof levies on imports from non-Community sources and paying Communityprices for imports from other members. The change in the system of support would involve a substantial reduction of Government expenditureon agriculture, which in 1968-69 amounted to about  315 million of which about  125 million was in respect of direct price support to farmers. this reduction in Government expenditure would however be accompanied by areduction in net Government revenue through payments to Community funds,for instance through the transfer of the proceeds of import duties.28. The precise effect on food prices at the retail level is difficult to predict as it would depend on the extent to which distributive and retailmargins changed as a result of the higher first-hand prices. United Kingdomretail food prices would not necessarily be the same as those in anotherCommunity country, since as can be seen from the examples in Table 7, thereis within the Community at present quite a wide variation of prices. Thisis due to differences in the quality, composition and presentation of products and in the efficiency of the processing and distributive industries. On thebasis of the present price differentials at the wholesale stage, and making certain assumptions about distributive and retail margins, the retail price index for food might be 18-26 per cent higher than it would otherwise havebeen and this would result in a 4-5 per cent increase in the cost-of-living index.15

It is of course possible to vary the assumptions inherent in thiscalculation. The estimates published recently by the CBI* which rely upondifferent assumptions about the likely course of prices in the United Kingdom,whether or not we were members of the e.c., and about the effects of entryon distributive and retail margins, show generally somewhat smaller percentage increases in the cost of living. Given the surplus situation within theCommunity, it might well happen that the gap between present e.c. prices and world prices would tend to narrow. If that came about, or if distributiveand retail margins increased less than expected, then the increase in food prices attributable to the adoption of the common agricultural policy wouldbe less. The estimate of the rise in food prices given in paragraph 28 thereforeprobably represents the most that is likely to occur. The rise would of course be spread over a period of years with the full effect only being felt at the endof a transitional period and it would be associated with all the other various factors which normally influence the cost of living.* &quot; Britain in Europe: A Second Industrial Appraisal&quot;, Confederation of BritishIndustry, December 1969.16
30. What the effect of an 18-26 per cent rise in retail prices would be onthe pattern of consumers&apos; food purchases is difficult to predict as the increases for some products would differ markedly from those hitherto experienced.In the main the changes would consist of a switch from one food product toanother, and spread over a period of years would result in food consumptiongoing up more slowly than it otherwise would have done. It is estimated thatthe adoption of the common agricultural policy would cause overallexpenditure on food (allowing for changes in the pattern of consumption) tobe 15-22 per cent higher than it would otherwise have been. In 1967 thecorresponding estimate was 10-14 per cent, and the difference is mainlyattributable to the change in the relationship between United Kingdom andEEC prices caused by the devaluation of sterling.Agricultural prices and production31. The prices at present received by producers in e.c. countries for mostfarm products are higher than in the United Kingdom and it is expected thatour producer price levels overall would rise significantly if the common agricultural policy were adopted as it stands.32. In assessing the production response to the price changes, account has to be taken of a number of other factors. There is the uncertain futureof some production grants under e.c. regulations on state aids to agricultureand there is the increase in the cost of animal feedingstuffs resulting fromthe higher cereal prices, a factor of particular importance to pig and poultryproducers. And, of course, the significance of particular price levels variesover time depending on farming costs and efficiency; on how farmers&apos;responses are influenced by their assessment of future prospects; on thedevelopment of new techniques of production; and on the limits imposed by climate and the quality of land. Moreover, the amount of the responsein terms of production naturally depends on what level production has reached at the time the price changes are introduced.33. Taking all these factors into account, it is only possible to indicate a range with a &quot; lower &quot; and &quot; upper &quot; estimate of the possible responseof production to these higher prices. But on the assumption that UnitedKingdom prices would be increased over a transitional period by the amountnecessary to eliminate the present gap between them and the e.c. prices,the overall effect might be to increase the volume of total agricultural production (net of feed and seeds used) by between 3 and 10 per cent above what it would otherwise have been. Although farmers&apos; total revenue wouldalso be increased appreciably, this would be partly offset by increases in production costs, particularly for feedingstuffs as already described. Farmers&apos;net income would nevertheless be higher than it would otherwise have been,although its distribution between commodities, types of farm and areas ofthe country would differ greatly.34. These estimates assume that producer prices in the United kingdom would rise from their current levels by the extent of the present differencebetween United Kingdom and e.c. prices. But, in the event, the relationship between United Kingdom and e.c. prices could be somewhat different bythe time we had adopted Community prices. Given the pressure of surpluses17
in the e.c., it is possible that the gap between their prices and ours wouldnarrow. It is also possible, although much less likely, that the price gapwould widen. For illustrative purposes therefore an assessment has beenmade of the possible changes in production if the gap were 5 per cent wider than now when we adopted e.c. prices; and also if the gap were to narrowby 10 per cent. With a wider price gap it is estimated that the volume ofproduction might increase by between about 5 and 15 per cent depending,as before, upon whether the production responses were less or morefavourable. With a smaller price gap, the overall level of production mightbe marginally higher or lower than it would be outside the Communitydepending upon whether the production response was greater or less.Effects on trade in agricultural products35. The changes in prices and in production and consumption of food would have consequences for the overall import bill for food and feedingstuffs.This is the first main element in the calculation of the balance of paymentscost of adopting the common agricultural policy. Estimates of the changesin the United Kingdom import bill on various assumptions are given inTable 8. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the degree of response to higher retail prices, the calculations of the change in the import bill and ofthe levies collected on imports from third countries are based on an &quot; upper &quot;-and &quot; lower&quot; estimate of changes in consumption. The estimates shownsuggest that the change in the food import bill could range from a reductionof  85 million to an increase of  255 million, depending on the response ofUnited Kingdom production and consumption, and the relationship between united Kingdom and e.c. prices.TABLE 8Estimated change in United Kingtfcm feed imports and estimated levy receipts  million	Larger change in consumption		Smaller change in consumption		Food importsC)	Levies	Food importsC)	LeviesPresent difference in prices 1,   Upper production response ... 2.

36. These figures do not include the value of the import levies whichwould be imposed by the United Kingdom under the e.c. agriculturalsystem. Estimates of these are given separately in the table for each of thepossible outcomes for the import bill. The amount of the levies is particularly difficult to forecast because they are charged only on imports from non-Community countries; certain assumptions therefore have to be made about the changes in the source of food imports. In effect, these leviesrepresent an additional charge on the cost of importing food, since underthe e.c. system the levy proceeds would be paid over into Communityfunds; the implications of this are dealt with in the next section of this chapter.37. The estimates given above of the changes in the import bill are intended to take account of the possibility of offsetting changes in exportsof agricultural products. Compared with food imports, these exports areof course small, and half of their value is represented by exports of alcoholicand other drinks. If the United Kingdom becomes a member of theCommunity, other members would remove the tariffs and levies to which united Kingdom exports are at present subject, and the United kingdom would do the same as regards imports from the Community. The sffect onour exports of manufactured foods would depend on much the same considerations as apply to industrial exports generally and this has therefore been taken into account in the next chapter. Direct exports of certainagricultural commodities and of fish could be stimulated but a large net increase is not expected, since additional exports of products in which weare not self-sufficient would be likely to bring about a corresponding increasein imports.Contribution to the Community Agricultural Fund38. In addition to the effect on the import bill, which is considered in the immediately preceding section, the other agricultural element in thecost to the balance of payments is the amount of the net contribution by theUnited Kingdom to the Agricultural Fund.39. The future cost of the Agricultural Fund depends not merely onthe course of world and e.c. prices, but on decisions which have yet tobe taken on the Mansholt Plan and on market reforms, which in turn will affect the balance between agricultural production and consumption. these decisions will determine not only the future level of expenditure on marketsupport and on schemes for structural reform, but also how far they willbe financed out of Community or national funds. The enlargement of theCommunity will itself increase the claims upon the Agricultural Fund, anadditional cost which will be offset by reduced payments on marketintervention or export subsidies to the extent that the enlarged Communitycan absorb commodities currently in surplus. The e.c. Commission hasestimated that expenditure on agriculture by the enlarged Community might in a few years&apos; time amount to  1,560 million (3,750 million UA) if present policies continue and  1,750 million (4,200 million UA) if the reforms proposedin the Mansholt Plan are adopted. These estimates, the detailed basis ofwhich has not been disclosed by the Commission, clearly depend uponcertain assumptions about the extent to which the surplus problem is brought under control, and the extent to which any structural expenditure is borneby Community funds.19
40. The amount we would be likely to get back out of this agriculturalexpenditure would probably be relatively small; perhaps of the order of 50 million to  100 million depending on the way the common agricultural policy developed.41. The method of financing Community expenditure on agricultureand certain non-agricultural items which was agreed in principle by the Sixin December 1969 is described in detail in paragraph 18 above. The essential features of this agreement are that the contribution to agricultural expenditureof each member state for 1970 was fixed as a percentage of the total sum required. For subsequent years, individual member states would be requiredto subscribe 90 per cent of the levies collected on agricultural imports; anannually increasing proportion of import duties up to a maximum of 90 percent by 1975; and after 1975 any balance required would be provided by contributions corresponding at the most to a 1 per cent value added tax.There is, however, a further provision that, subject to unconditional paymentof levies, the proportion of this expenditure paid for by each individual member state should not rise by more than 1 per cent or fall by more than-5 per cent as compared with the previous year from 1971-74; or rise orfall by more than 2 per cent annually from 1975-77.42. Thus, the main determinant of the proportionate contribution of individual members would be likely to be the percentage share of agriculturalexpenditure which in December 1969 was agreed in principle for each ofthem for 1970. It is of course impossible to say at what level our sharewould have been fixed if we had then been a member. In the circumstances the best that can be done is to indicate as a form of ready reckoner what our contribution might have been to the Agricultural Fund in 1970, and in subsequent years, if we had been a member and our share, within a community of Ten instead of Six, had been set at respectively 15 per centor 20 per cent. This is done in the following table which relates thesepercentages to the Agricultural Fund which is assumed to rise from, say, 1,250 million in 1970 to  1,600 million in 1977. As explained in paragraph 18,it is not yet clear what non-agricultural expenditures would be covered bythese arrangements but they would seem unlikely to increase our annual contribution by more than about  15 million.TABLE 9  millionYearSize ofAgricultural FundUnited Kingdom contribution (to nearest 10 million) assuming share in 1970 of:15 per cent 20 per cent197019711972197319741975197619771,2501,3001,3501,4001,4501,5001,5501,600190 250200 260210 280220 290230 300240 320250 340270 35020
We estimate that 90 per cent of United Kingdom agricultural levies might bring in about  150 to  200 million by the late 1970s; 90 per cent of UnitedKingdom customs duties might by then be about  240 million; and the yieldcorresponding to a 1 per cent value added tax could, depending on the coverage, range up to about  230 million. Since 90 per cent of a member country&apos;s levy income must be paid to the Community, it will be seen that,if the United Kingdom had been a party to the agreement reached in theCommunity in December 1969, her annual contribution to the Community&apos;budget could not have been less than  150 million (equivalent to 90 per cent of our lower estimate of levy income). The above figures also show that on thesame basis there would have been a theoretical upper limit to Britain&apos;contribution of about  670 million. In practice, our contribution wouldhave been fixed within narrower limits by the percentage share agreed for us,and for other members of the Community, in the recent financial settlement.43. For the purposes of illustration, we have attempted to show on various assumptions what the cost of the common agricultural policy mighthave been for the United Kingdom if we had been a party to the recentagreement by the Community on agricultural financing. But of course we werenot, and in the negotiations it will be necessary, not only to settle our startingcontribution to the Fund, but also to settle the transitional arrangements under which we approach paying our full share of the recently agreedCommunity financing arrangements which will, as we have seen, be changingfrom year to year.Net effect on the balance of payments44. Taken together, the trade effects and the financial charges described in the paragraphs above represent the net effect on the balance of payments of adopting the common agricultural policy. When this calculation was madein 1967, it was estimated that the net cost to the balance of payments wouldbe  175- 250 million annually. The net cost is now likely to be greaterthan this, partly because of the effects of the devaluation of sterling andpartly because of the greatly increased cost of the European AgriculturalFund. The preceding sections of this chapter have attempted to describe the elements which have to be taken into account in making an assessment ofthis kind and the reasons why a number of alternative assumptions can andmust be made in relation to many of them; and to indicate some of theorders of magnitude which attach to them. It is clear that a very wide range of estimates is possible, although the extreme assumptions at eitherend of the spectrum could not be regarded as realistic since they would depend on all factors operating in the same direction. In practice it ismuch more likely that the outcome would result from a combination of factorssome more favourable than others. But in the crucial area of our financial contribution to the Fund, there is just not a sufficient basis, in advance of negotiations, for making reliable assumptions either about its cost or our share of it. The present members of the Community have made it clear thatthey wish to bring the cost under control, but the implementing decisions havenot yet been taken. They have reached agreement in principle on arrangements for meeting the cost, but their application in a reasonable and equitable way to our situation must be a matter for negotiation, as hasalways been recognised.21
III.   TRADE AND INDUSTRYTrade and industry in the Common Market45. The Treaty of Rome provides for the progressive establishment of aCommon Market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.It contemplates the evolution of common policies for agriculture, transport,foreign trade, regional development and for consultation and collaborationon economic and social matters. This chapter is concerned with Communitypolicies directly affecting trade and industry.46. A Customs Union was completed by the e.c. on 1st July, 1968.It involved the complete abolition (other than in exceptional circumstances) of tariff and quota restrictions between the member states, and the replacement of the national external tariffs of the member states by a Common external tariff (CET) which is applied against imports from all third countries except those having preferential arrangements with the Community.47. The growth and pattern of the foreign trade of the e.c. over the10 years since the Community was formed is compared in Tables 10 and 11below with the United Kingdom pattern.48. Both the CET and the United Kingdom tariff will be progressively reduced as a result of the &quot; Kennedy Round &quot; tariff agreements reached in the gatt, and the comparison which follows relates to the situation as it will be after full implementation of these reductions which is due from 1st January,1972. The duties on most raw materials are zero in the CET, as in the UnitedKingdom tariff; examples are raw wool and cotton, most metallic ores,unwrought copper and tin, natural rubber and most unprocessed hides andskins, many of which are important Commonwealth exports. A few materials of major importance such as aluminium, lead, zinc and newsprint, are dutiableunder the CET* (currently at rates between 4-5 per cent and 9-0 per cent),but are subject to zero or very low duties in the United Kingdom: and certainmaterials are dutiable here but not under the CET. The bulk of the lattercategory are, however, materials of which most of our imports enter duty free from the Commonwealth Preference Area. Examples are asbestos and coirfibre. In the agriculture and food sectors, duty free imports from theCommonwealth Preference Area represent a considerable part of our totalimports. In certain cases, Commonwealth supplies which are at presentallowed into this country duty free would become subject to quite a high rateof duty under the CET, for example mutton and lamb and bananas (CETcurrently 20 per cent).* Under certain circumstances, member states may be authorised to import specifiedquantities of a product at a duty lower than prescribed in the Common External Tariff.These tariff quotas, which are reviewed periodically, cover only a small proportion of community imports.22

49. In the range of semi-manufactures and finished manufactures, thereare certain sectors where the general level of the duties is significantly differentas between the United Kingdom tariff and the CET. Duties on machinery andmost chemicals are higher in the United Kingdom, as well as those on clocksand watches, optical and photographic equipment, musical instruments andmany kinds of precision instruments. But on the other hand the current UnitedKingdom tariff on plastics is lower, although this may be brought more in line with the CET as a result of the Kennedy Round agreements. For the rest, the levels of the two tariffs are broadly similar.50. In addition to establishing a Customs Union, the e.c. has beendeveloping a common approach to trade policy to govern its commercial relations with the rest of the world. The Six have negotiated as a unit intariff negotiations, in relation to the GATT agreement on anti-dumping andin negotiating trade agreements with several countries. Further developmentstowards the establishment of a common commercial policy by the e.c. areexpected to follow after the end of the Treaty of Rome transitional period which expired at the end of 1969.51. Progress in implementing other provisions of the Treaty affectingindustry and trade has been less rapid. However, agreement has been reached on the introduction throughout the Community of a common system of valueadded taxation though not yet on uniform rates. Workers from member countries are free to take up employment in any member state and enjoyappropriate social security benefits wherever they are employed. Limitedprogress has been made in removing legal obstacles to the establishment and operations of companies across frontiers within the Community. Otherdevelopments are under consideration, including legal provision for the incorporation in any member state of &quot; European companies&quot; enabled to operate throughout the Community. The preparation of a oommon legalsystem for patents throughout the Community is being pursued at present, in parallel with international discussions (in which the United Kingdom andother European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries are participating) onthe establishment of a wider European Patent Convention. In the field of regional policies, there is broad similarity between the objectives of the member states and those of the United Kingdom although the emphasis on inducementsand concessions accorded to industries in areas of above average unemploymentvaries from country to country. The formulation of a common transport policy for rail, road and inland waterway transport has proceeded slowly andis still far from completion, and no steps have been taken towards extendingit to sea or air transport.United Kingdom industry in an enlarged Community52. For industry and trade, the main consequences of United kingdom membership of an enlarged Community would be that we should then form part of a Customs Union of up to 300 million people stretching from scotland to Sicily and from the Irish Republic to the borders of Eastern Europe.Within this vast area, industrial products would move freely without tariffor quota restrictions as soon as any transitional period had been completed.And over the years ahead it would be the intention to convert this customs union into a full economic union by the progressive alignment and25
harmonisation of commercial policy, i.e., trading relations with third countries;of economic and fiscal policy; of company and patent law; of standards for industrial products, including specifications for public sector purchasing;and generally of the whole structure of law and practice within which industry would operate.53. The creation of such an enlarged and integrated European market would provide in effect a much larger and a much faster growing &quot; home market&quot; for British industry. It would provide the stimuli of much greater opportunities and competition than exist at present or would otherwiseexist in future. There would be substantial advantages for British industry from membership of this new enlarged Common Market, stemming primarilyfrom the opportunities for greater economies of scale, increased specialisation,a sharper competitive climate and faster growth. These may be described as the &quot; dynamic&quot; effects of membership on British industry and trade.We have not found it possible to measure the likely response of Britishindustry to these new opportunities nor, therefore, the effects on our economic growth and balance of payments. On the other hand we should have tomake changes in our tariffs and food prices in order to join the Community andthe net effect of these changes would be disadvantageous to British industry.These may be described as the &quot; impact&quot; effects of membership. We have found it possible to make a rough estimate of the possible cost to the balanceof payments of these impact effects.54. We have already seen in Chapter II that membership would leadto an increase in United Kingdom food prices to Community levels and accordingly to an increase in our cost of living. It has been estimated thatthe maximum increase which would be likely to occur if we joined theCommunity would involve the index of retail prices rising over a transitional period by about 4 to 5 per cent more than it otherwise would. * this additional increase in the cost of living spread over a transitional period ofsome years could raise the future level of wage settlements somewhat above what it otherwise would be and any consequent increases in industrial costs would of course adversely affect our competitive position.55. It has also been argued that the requirements to harmonise thesystems of indirect taxation of the member states would affect the costof living here. But whether this would do so would depend not onsystems, but on rates and coverage, and on the extent to which existingindirect taxes were modified. It is not possible therefore to make anyquantitative assessment of the effect in the United Kingdom.56. At present we enjoy special preferential trading relationships withthe Commonwealth Preference Area, EFTA and the Irish Republic. If wemoved into a new enlarged Community, these existing trade relationshipswould be affected to our disadvantage. In the new circumstances, subject toany special arrangements made in the course of negotiations, we shouldgenerally apply the CET against imports from third countries, including theCommonwealth,  and  we  could  hardly  expect  that  all  our  existing* The index of retail prices has risen by 34 per cent between January 1962 and december 1969.26
Commonwealth preferences would be maintained indefinitely. We stand to lose the tariff preference over the Six which we now enjoy in the Irish republic and in EFTA countries. Finally, we should of course gain duty free entry for our exports to the Six and we should concede it on imports from them.Thus, in exchange for the new preferential position we should enjoy behind the CET in the enlarged Community, we should expect to lose most of our existing preferences. But in order to make a true comparison of our situationinside and outside the Community some years hence, it is necessary totake into account the probability of continuing erosion of preferences inthe Commonwealth and the possibility of new preferential tradingarrangements between the Community and some of our trading partners.It is relevant in this connection that a number of Commonwealth countriesin Africa have found it to their advantage in recent years to give tariff preferences, to our disadvantage, to the Six.57. Finally, in considering the disadvantages of membership for industryand the economy, we must recognise that if the total burden on our balanceof payments as a result of membership became excessive we might find that we were unable to pursue economic policies which enabled the fullbenefits of membership to be realised. Since such an outcome would beas contrary to the interests of the Community as of the United Kingdom,the Government would expect to find its avoidance a common aim of allconcerned with the negotiations.Effects on United Kingdom visible trade58. The effects of the tariff and cost changes would depend on theresponses to these changed conditions of exporters and their customersthroughout the world. Any attempt to measure what these responses mightbe and what effect they would have on our trade can only be based on past experience, including the recent experience of devaluation. The degreeof the response in flows of trade to a given change, say a decline in tariffsor in relative cost levels, depends partly on the ability of supply industries to respond to the increased opportunities for profitable sales, and partly onthe extent to which lower prices call forth increased demand. The elasticitiesused for the purpose of the estimates which follow allow for both kinds ofresponse, and allowances are also made for some degree of absorption by united Kingdom and foreign suppliers of tariff and cost changes. Inevitablythere must be great uncertainty about the degree of response. Higher and lower values have been taken for the response elasticities for both imports and exports. For imports it is assumed that, given a change of 1 per centin prices arising from changes in tariffs or costs, the response in the quantityimported would be between ^ per cent and \\ per cent. For exports theassumption is that the response to a 1 per cent change in prices would be a quantity change between \\ and 2\ per cent. The assumption about the response of suppliers to tariff changes is that those faced with a tariff change to their advantage would absorb one-quarter of the change. This would increase their unit profits and it is assumed that a 1 per cent increase inunit profits would lead to a I per cent increase in the volume exported onthe lower assumption for elasticities and to a 1 per cent increase on thehigher assumption. Suppliers faced with a tariff change to their disadvantage27
are assumed to react competitively by cutting their prices to the extent ofone-quarter of the change. These assumptions imply a fairly modest degreeof response by both buyers and sellers.59. Using these elasticities it is possible on the basis of a number ofother assumptions to make some very rough quantitative estimates of theeffects of the cost and tariff changes described in paragraphs 54 and 56 on thevalue and pattern of United Kingdom visible trade in the mid-1970s. The table below sets out in summary form these rough estimates of the effects on united Kingdom exports and imports on the higher and lower assumptions about elasticities.TABLE 12Summary of Impact Effects on the Balance of Trade in Items other than Food  million at 1968 pricesLower Elasticities       Higher ElasticitiesExports      ......... -75 -175Imports*     ......... -50 -100Balance of Trade...... -125 -275* Increase in imports shown as -.60. These estimates do not purport to evaluate the total net effect onour trade of joining the e.c.. In order to arrive at them, it has been necessary to make a whole series of assumptions about the future course of world trade over the next five years or so and to adopt highly over-simplifiedassumptions about the effect and timing of a complex series of tariff and costchanges on the wide range of goods entering into our foreign trade. Each ofthese assumptions can be little more than an informed guess which may bevery wide of the mark. The actual situation in the mid-1970s will befundamentally affected by the relative development of the economies of themain industrial countries during the intervening years and this in turndepends on a wide range of factors which it is impossible to predict. It isparticularly important to bear in mind that the estimates shown in Table 12relate to a total flow of United Kingdom trade which by the middle of the decade is expected to be about 25 per cent greater than it is now and to beof the order of  18,000 million valued at 1968 prices. The significance of thefigures showing the effect on the visible trade balance will therefore be relatively less than it would be today. Furthermore, these estimates onlydeal with the impact effects. For the reasons given in paragraphs 54 and 56these effects are bound to be on balance adverse. No corresponding estimatescan be made of the dynamic effects of membership but the next section ofthis chapter discusses these in qualitative terms and sets out the reasonsfor believing that providing United Kingdom industry responds vigorouslyto the opportunities there will be substantial benefits to set against the adverseimpact effects.28
The benefits for United Kingdom industry and trade of membership of an enlarged Community61. The main consequence of membership for British industry is, as wehave seen, that the &quot; home market&quot; will be several times larger than our existing home market, including EFTA. And the new home market willbe a more rapidly growing one than the present home market. If we join the Community, companies will be able to plan their sales and investmenton the basis of a prosperous home market of approaching 300 million people.62. The dismantling of tariffs within the present Community and themaintenance of a moderate common tariff against the rest of the world have resulted, as might be expected, in a particularly rapid increase inintra-Community trade. This trade multiplied four times between 1958 and1968, from  2,800 million to nearly  11,000 million. By comparison, UnitedKingdom exports to the Community over this period increased only 2\times, even though the Community was our biggest single export marketduring this period. The following table shows the rate of growth of exportsby individual member countries to their Community partners in comparisonwith their exports to the world.TABLE 13Exports by e.c. countriesAverage Annual Percentage Growth Rate of Exports 1958-1968	To other	To Rest of	e.c.

The United Kingdom share of e.c. imports of manufactures inthe same period fell from 10-6 per cent to 71 per cent.63. The market we should be joining is not only larger but growingsubstantially more rapidly than ours. As shown by Table 14 below, from1958-67 the annual rise in the gross national product (g.n.p.) per headaveraged 2\ per cent in the United Kingdom compared with 4 per cent inthe Community.29

The more rapid growth in the e.c. compared with the UnitedKingdom is also indicated by the fact that between 1958 and 1967 industrial production in the Six rose by 68 per cent, in the United Kingdom by 37per cent. Table 15 compares the development of output in certain industries in the United Kingdom and the e.c. over this period.65. There were and still are a number of factors at work encouragingfaster growth in the Community than in the United Kingdom. More workersleaving agriculture for industry; the advantages of post-war rebuilding of major industries with new machinery and the latest technologies; and generallya significantly lower proportion of g.n.p. expended on defence, though the gap has been narrowing over the last few years. Nevertheless it seems highlyprobable that the creation of the Community itself generated a faster rateof growth through greater specialisation and greater competition than the economies of the Six member countries would have separately enjoyed andthat, apart from the likely beneficial effects on growth of the enlargement of the Community, an enlarged Community would in any event continueto grow faster in future than the United Kingdom or EFTA on their own.30TABLE 14

The creation of this very large and fast growing home market willprovide greater opportunities and greater competition for British industry.The rapid development of intra-Community trade is a reflection of growinginternational specialisation, and the need for United Kingdom industry toparticipate fully in this was a theme which found a considerable amountof support in the recent industrial assessments made by the economic development Committees of the National Economic Development Councilin analysing medium-term prospects. It is of course true that the wideningof the field of competition will stimulate the industries of other member countries as well as those of the United Kingdom, but for the e.c. countriesthis would be a further phase in a process to which they have been subjectedfor a number of years, and the future rate of growth of the enlarged community may not be exceptionally high by e.c. standards. On the otherhand, for the United Kingdom the new market would be a stimulus and anopportunity on a quite different scale from that provided by EFTA and witha rate of growth which could also be expected to be substantially higher thanin EFTA. In this connection, it is of interest to note that, when the prospectof British membership was before industry in the early 1960s, there were indications of a much more significant increase in interest and activity on thepart of British than of Community industry. A study of the trade trends in1960-63 shows that the proportion of United Kingdom exports going to the eec increased perceptibly.67. Moreover, a faster growing market will provide British industry with opportunities, which it has not shared with the rest of Western Europesince the war, for a sustained high level of investment in new plant and31
equipment. Such investment would serve to improve our competitive position,not only in relation to the Six, but also to the rest of the world. Theeconomic position of Belgium in the 1950s had features in common withthat of the United Kingdom. Over the period 1953-60 the annual average rate of growth of g.n.p. was 2-9 per cent in Belgium and in the UnitedKingdom. But over the period 1960-67 the rate of growth in Belgium had more or less caught up with the faster growth rates of her fellow members in the European Community: Belgium&apos;s average over this period was 4-6 percent compared with 3-0 per cent for the United Kingdom, and this highergrowth rate was achieved with a net surplus on the current Belgian balanceof payments over the period as a whole. This experience will not be directlyapplicable to the United Kingdom. Only time would show the response ofBritish industries to the new opportunities and greater competition whichin turn would determine the extent of the long-term benefits to the UnitedKingdom growth rate and balance of payments. But an increase of 1 percent in our g.n.p. would be equivalent in the mid-1970s to something approaching  500 million a year at present prices.68. Inward investment into the United Kingdom. Linked with thequestion of growth is the degree to which the United Kingdom will in futureattract overseas investment particularly from the United States. In additionto its benefits to the reserves, this has been of considerable benefit to theUnited Kingdom economy in several ways; in providing jobs (particularlyin development areas), in its contribution to exports and in the dissemination of technology and management techniques. If the United Kingdom remainedoutside the Community, it is likely that American investment in the Sixwould be stimulated at the expense of the much smaller and less rapidly growing United Kingdom market. If on the other hand the United Kingdomentered, it is likely that we would attract substantially more Americaninvestment to this country than if the United Kingdom remained outside.The fact that net additional American investment in this country in 1968totalled  246 million shows that the stakes are high.69. Protecting United Kingdom trade interests. Apart from these factorsof growth and investment, there remains the question of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s ability to protect its economic interests if it remained outside theCommunity. Since the formation of the European Economic Community,the United Kingdom&apos;s position in international trade negotiations has beenweakened because a country&apos;s bargaining power depends largely on the size of its market, and ours is now relatively small compared with the community and the United States. We might find ourselves in the position of seeingarrangements governing international trade negotiated in the main by others-in particular the European Economic Community and the United States.On the other hand, as a member of an enlarged Community, we should share in the bargaining strength of the biggest trading bloc in the world and have an important voice in determining how that strength was used.70. High technology industries. So far, the effects of membership on british industry have been considered as a whole. But the future of theso-called high technology industries in the rest of Western Europe just asmuch as in the United Kingdom depends decisively on whether or not itproves possible to create an enlarged Community.32
71. Approaching one half of manufacturing output of the United Statesand Western Europe is in industries which rely heavily on advancedtechnologies such as engineering, electrical and electronics, chemicals.These have been arjd still are fast growing sectors in most developed countries. Their growth depends on a number of factors marketing andrate of innovation for example besides research and development (R and D)which nevertheless play a most important role. The very high expenditure on research and development in these industries is illustrated in table 16.This expenditure on R and D is accompanied by high risks and rapidoutdating of products.72. In this very important matter, European industry suffers from threerelative disadvantages:(a) the support that is given in the United States, both directly and indirectly, by the large scale of Government expenditure on R and Dis far more massive than is practicable in Europe;(b) national markets in Europe even the Community as it is at present are too small to generate the financial and other resources needed forthe adequate growth of such industries, particularly in competition with the United States. Even the enlarged Community&apos;s gross national product would fall short of that of the United States;*(c) the larger the company and its financial resources, the greater its capacity to incur substantial expenditure on R and D; in this sense,there is a certain threshold linked with the size of the company. Thethreshold may be quite small for some highly specialised producersbut, in general, Western Europe suffers seriously from lack of companies of a sufficient size to be able to command R and D resources on the scale required to compete effectively with the United States.In an enlarged Community there would be the opportunity, because of thelarger market, for European firms, British and Continental, to grow to thepoint where adequate R and D expenditure became profitable and practicable in fields where today it is not.73. This does not of course mean that technological co-operation inEurope as it exists is impossible. In the defence field there have been somesuccesses and the recent agreement on the gas centrifuge is an indication of what can be achieved on civil projects when the economic viabilitycan clearly be established. But on the whole the record has been disappointing. More generally, a beginning has been made on studies of possible future technological co-operation in Europe, through the working group of the Community&apos;s Medium-Term Economic Policy Committee,under the chairmanship of Professor Aigrain. Proposals have been made bythis Group for new co-operative European studies and research in the fields of computers, communications, surface transport, metallurgy, meteorology,* g.n.p. at market prices, in United States dollars (&apos;000 million)1964 1965 1966 1967United States ...      642-8 696-3 760-5 803-9United Kingdom       93-0 100-1 106-1 109-3EEC    ......      279-5 302-3 323-5 341-0Source: OECD National Accounts of OECD Countries 1958-67.33

oceanography and pollution. As a result of this initiative, leadingmanufacturers of computers in the United Kingdom and other european countries have already begun discussions amongst themselves aboutconcerting their ideas for the development of advanced computers. TheUnited Kingdom amongst other European nations has been invited to be associated with the further development of the proposals by the working group and we have gladly accepted.74. But such co-operation can only be fully productive within an enlarged economic union, for the goal is not co-operation for its own sake,but the opportunity over a period to build European enterprises on acontinental scale and thus for Europe to hold its own in future industrialdevelopment with the United States and the Soviet Union. And in all this-the record of the United Kingdom in technological development entitles usto hope and the rest of Europe to expect that our role will be a prominent one.75. Company size and monopoly. The benefits of membership of an enlarged Community will by no means go only to large companies in Europe.The opportunities for successful specialisation by the small entrepreneur shouldbe greater in a larger and more competitive market. Technological innovationin the United States, particularly in the new and more speculative fields,has often been supported by very small industrial enterprises. But successfulcompetition with the United States in the high technology industries of thefuture will increasingly depend on the existence of at least some West Europeancompanies of comparable size to their United States counterparts. Atpresent, most of the largest companies in the United Kingdom and in therest of Western Europe are much smaller than their United States competitors(see Table 17). The existence of an enlarged Community can be expectednot only to provide the environment in which European companies wouldbe able to grow in size and in command of resources, but also an environmentin which companies of such size would be acceptable. Within the UnitedKingdom, for example, it is necessary for the Government to weigh theadvantages of the economies of scale and concentration of resources offered by a prospective merger against the possible dangers of a monopoly or nearmonopoly situation which might result. Within an enlarged Community, theposition would be different. What would be a monopoly situation within theUnited Kingdom would not necessarily remain one when the United Kingdomformed part of a larger market to which French and German companies would have duty-free access. Similarly, mergers and consortia acrossEuropean national boundaries need not be incompatible with the preservation of a competitive situation.35

Conclusion76. The probable effects on industry and trade of entry into the EECmay be summarised as follows. On the one hand, there are the impact effects.The increase in wage-levels following the rise in food prices would tend toreduce the competitiveness of our industrial producers and this, combined with the tariff changes involved in membership, would affect both exports and imports in directions damaging to the balance of payments. A very rough estimate of the adverse effect of these two factors on trade in the mid-1970s is that it could be of the order of  125- 275 million. If tothis was added an excessive balance of payments burden arising from theacceptance of the eec&apos;s agricultural arrangements, defensive policies mightbe enforced on the United Kingdom Government which would restore thebalance of payments position at the cost of damaging the growth of industry&apos;smarket in the United Kingdom.77. On the other hand, there are the dynamic effects resulting from membership of a much larger and faster growing market. This would openup to our industrial producers substantial opportunities for increasing exportsales, while at the same time exposing them more fully to the competition ofEuropean industries. No way has been found of quantifying these dynamiceffects but, if British industry responded vigorously to these stimuli, theywould be considerable and highly advantageous. The acceleration in therate of growth of industrial exports could then outpace any increase in therate of growth of imports, with corresponding benefits to the balance ofpayments. Moreover, with such a response, the growth of industrial productivity would be accelerated as a result of increased competition andthe advantages derived from specialisation and larger scale production. Thisfaster rate of growth of productivity would, in turn, accelerate the rate of growth of national production and real income.78. Finally, it must be remembered that the comparison which we are seeking to make is between our position as members of an enlarged community and our position if we remained outside it in the mid-1970s.During that period the preferences which we at present enjoy might well havebeen further eroded and our general trading interests prejudiced bydevelopments over which we should not have been able as non-members to exercise so much influence.37
IV.   CAPITAL MOVEMENTS AND INVISIBLE TRADECommunity obligations and safeguards79. Under the Treaty of Rome and the two existing Directives on capital movements, member states must authorise both inward and outward transfersfrom and to other member states at the official rate of exchange (or at ratesshowing no &quot; marked and persistent differences&quot;) for direct investment,quoted portfolio investment, real estate and a number of transactions ofa personal character. (Direct investments are those where the investor playsa direct part in the running of the enterprise in which he has a stake.Portfolio investment means the acquisition of securities quoted on a stock exchange.) In addition, companies resident in one member country butowned by residents of another must be allowed to borrow in the country of residence on an equal footing with resident-owned companies.80. Certain articles of the Treaty provide that protective measures maybe taken by a member state, subject to the approval of the appropriateCommunity bodies, in order to safeguard its balance of payments in times of crisis or in cases where movements of capital threaten the properfunctioning of its own capital market. This indicates that there is a measureof flexibility in this field, which should be borne in mind in considering the assessment below. The Treaty also provides for a member state to take measures to avoid leaks of capital to third countries through other member states with different exchange control policies.United Kingdom practice81. Restrictions at present operated through exchange control in respectof United Kingdom investment in e.c. countries safeguard the balance ofpayments. Under existing exchange control rules, the normal methods of financing direct investment in the e.c. are the ploughing back, within limits,of part of the earnings of subsidiaries and other related companies in Europe,and the use of foreign currency borrowing. The financing of direct investment by transfer from the United Kingdom at the official rate of exchange is permitted only, within certain limits, for oil investment and, in other cases,where the prospective balance of payments return meets a stringent criterion.Financial institutions may be permitted to borrow foreign currency to financeportfolio investment in foreign currency securities but purchase of suchsecurities is permitted otherwise only in &apos;&quot; investment currency &quot;, that is, the proceeds of sale of other resident-owned foreign currency securities, on whicha substantial premium is normally payable. Access to official exchange isnot allowed for the acquisition of private houses in e.c. countries and thereare restrictions on other personal capital transfers.Assessment: some special factors82. The method used to assess the effects of United Kingdom membership of the e.c. on inward and outward capital movements has been to take account of the possible pattern of capital flows in the mid-seventies on the assumptions that the United Kingdom was to remain outside the e.c., and was38
to maintain its present exchange control rules (which would depend in practice on the development of the balance of payments situation); and then to consider how that pattern might change if the United Kingdom were a member of the eec, at the end of a transitional period.83. There are differences between this assessment and those for agricultureand trade. Flows of capital have a different kind of effect upon the balanceof payments from changes in the trade account. An adverse effect upon thecurrent account involves a permanent cost to the balance of payments; a netcapital outflow for investment also involves an immediate cost to the balanceof payments, but it creates assets abroad, and promises a future flow of receipts in the form of earnings. Moreover, investments, especially portfolioinvestments, are from time to time realised, producing balance of paymentsbenefits.84. A second difference is that the volume of capital flows is more volatilethan the trend of payments on trade account. Large individual directinvestments, in either direction, occur irregularly. The volume and directionof flows of portfolio investment are influenced by many factors, including thestate of confidence in relative prospects for different economies and currencies.Direct investment85. Total United Kingdom outward direct investment has been rising,and is almost certain to continue to do so. The proportion of the totalinvested in the e.c. has also been increasing over recent years. membership of the e.c. would remove the present incentive to invest in other eec countries in order to overcome the tariff barrier, but the e.c. proportionof total United Kingdom direct investment abroad would be likely to risefurther with increasing trade and with the process of industrial rationalisationas, for example, United Kingdom firms sought economies of scale throughmergers with their European partners.86. Of the increased flow of outward investment to the e.c., a sizeableproportion would probably continue to be financed as now by foreign currency borrowing, which avoids a net cost to the balance of payments, orby share exchanges, with equivalent effect. However, a larger proportionthan at present would probably be financed from retained earnings or with official exchange, both at a cost to the balance of payments.87. Some increase may reasonably be assumed in the flow from otherEEC countries of direct investment into the United Kingdom. But allowancemust also be made for possible increased borrowing in the United kingdom market by e.c. companies resident here, which implies a smaller capitalinflow than would otherwise have been the case.Portfolio investment88. Changes in the flows of portfolio investment are extremely hard to assess. Predictions about United Kingdom demand for foreign securitiesdepend on views about the state of confidence in the economies concerned,and hence in the stock markets, both at home and abroad. In circumstancesfavourable to such investment the potential cost to the balance of payments of additional United Kingdom portfolio investment in other e.c. countries39
could be substantial in any given year. In other years there might be netdisinvestment, producing a benefit to the balance of payments on a quitesignificant scale. It seems reasonable also to make some allowance for anincrease in e.c. portfolio investment in the United Kingdom.Personal capital89. There would be a continuing cost to the balance of payments asa result of allowing free access to official exchange for some personaltransfers, including in particular the purchase of private houses in eec countries. There would also be a large once-for-all item in this category.Under present United Kingdom rules, after the initial allowance of  5,000,emigrants are permitted to transfer their assets with official exchange only after a period of four years, although they do not necessarily do so even then. Under the e.c. rules, they would be allowed to transfer them allwithout delay though again they would not necessarily do so. For practical reasons, the relaxation of exchange control rules for emigrants&apos; assets couldnot be confined to emigrants to e.c. countries.Inward investment90. The United Kingdom balance of payments might benefit from increased inflow of direct and portfolio investments from outside theCommunity to this country. The United Kingdom could become an increasingly attractive country in which to invest. This inflow would offsetin some measure the adverse effects on the balance of payments of the transactions considered above.Invisibles91. There should be a valuable expansion of our invisible earnings asa result of membership. In the field of insurance, for example, the eec countries have legislation which in one way or another discriminates againstnon-e.c.-insurers in contrast to the United Kingdom where there is nosuch discrimination. Membership should, therefore, provide British insurerswith better access to other e.c. member countries than they have at presentand this is particularly important since the e.c. is expected to try toremove governmental restrictions so as to create a common market for insurance.92. More generally, the contribution of the City of London should bringbenefits not only to the United Kingdom, but to the other members of the eec as well. The City can offer a wide range of financial and commercialservices not only insurance, but also banking, shipping, merchanting,commodity markets and portfolio management which is unrivalled outsidethe United States. With greater awareness of the diversity and sophisticationof these facilities both we and our future partners can expect to gainincreasing advantage.93. As Community regulations now stand, United Kingdom membership of the e.c. would not require any changes in Government regulations orpolicies directly concerning invisibles either in the United Kingdom or inEEC countries. Receipts of interest, profits and dividends (IPD) derivedfrom overseas investment would clearly depend on how membership affected40
the volume and direction of investment flows. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 85-87, United Kingdom membership is likely to result in anet outflow of private capital to e.c. countries, which would bring overtime a corresponding increase in earnings on IPD account.Conclusion94. Compliance with the requirements of the present Directives underthe Treaty concerning capital movements must be expected in a typical yearto involve a sizeable cost to the United Kingdom balance of payments,compared with the situation which would obtain if the present UnitedKingdom exchange control rules were maintained unaltered. The cost wouldvary however according to circumstances which cannot usefully be predicted.In some years it could be substantial, in others negligible or even turn intoa modest gain. To the extent however that continued improvement in our balance of payments position may be expected to lead to some easementof the present United Kingdom exchange control rules, the effects ofsuperimposing the obligations of membership on top of this would bereduced. In addition there should in any case be an improvement ininvisible earnings as a result of membership.41
V.   OVERALL ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSIONOverall economic assessment95. The economic effects of entry into the Community comprise first theconsequences of adopting their common agricultural policy and of making ournet contribution to the Community budget, which at present mainly coversexpenditure on financing that agricultural policy. Second, the effects on industry and trade resulting from membership of an enlarged Community.Third, the effects on capital movements and invisible trade.96. The effects of the common agricultural policy on future Britishagricultural production, food consumption and hence on imports are to some limited extent predictable, but the changes both in price levels and in supportsystems involved in moving to the common agricultural policy are so radicalthat past experience can provide only a limited guide. In Chapter II it issuggested that the change in the cost of our food imports as a consequenceof entry (excluding levies payable on them) could range from a reduction of 85 million to an increase of  255 million a year. This range was obtained by making alternative assumptions about the differences between UnitedKingdom and Community prices and about the responses to them by Britishfarmers and consumers. It is further estimated that the maximum increasein retail food prices which would be likely to occur if we joined theCommunity would be in the range of 18-26 per cent, involving acorresponding increase of 4-5 per cent in the cost-of-living index. This risewould take place progressively over a period of years and the full effect wouldbe felt only at the end of a transitional period.97. Our gross contribution to the Community budget is calculable only within the purely theoretical and extremely wide range of  150- 670 million a year given in Chapter II. Where in that range our contribution might liedepends partly on the growth of total Community expenditures and partly on the rules for the division of contributions between countries the effect ofwhich on the United Kingdom cannot be estimated because we were not members of the Community in December 1969 when agreement in principle was reached by the existing members on individual percentage keys, whichwould govern their share of contributions (see paragraph 18). Nor can we estimate what we might receive by way of payments from the various sectionsof the Community budget as Community policies develop; it is suggested in chapter II that United Kingdom receipts from the operation of the common agricultural policy might amount, in very round figures, to  50- 100 million annually depending on the way the policy developed.98. The effects of entry on United Kingdom industry and trade arepartly what may be called impact effects, which are measurable, and partlydynamic effects, which are not. The distinction between these two is onlypartly one of timing since both impact and dynamic effects build up over a transitional period though the latter will probably take longer to reach theirpeak.  Essentially the impact effects are those which arise in given underlying42
conditions of supply and demand, i.e., those prevailing at the time of entry,from the reactions of producers, traders and consumers to the tariff changes and the consequences of higher food prices for wage levels. There are somedata, albeit imperfect, on which to base estimates of the impact effects. Thedynamic effects on the other hand consist in changes in the underlyingconditions of supply and demand arising from the opportunities forrationalisation, large-scale investment, and more rapid technologicalimprovements in producing for a wider and faster growing market, and fromthe pressure for greater efficiency and reduction of unit costs to meetcompetition within that market. There are very little data on which to baseestimates of the effect of these changes which will clearly affect the wholeof the economy.99. The best estimate we can make of the impact effects is that ourvisible trade balance in goods other than food might be adversely affectedto the extent of  125- 275 million a year. Even this estimate has inevitablyto be based on considerable over-simplification and on assumptions open tolegitimate questioning, as explained in Chapter III; and the impact wouldbuild up gradually over the years of a transitional period in which thedynamic industrial and trade advantages of membership would also be atwork.100. Chapter IV describes what would be involved in the adoption ofthe Community Directives affecting capital movements and concludes thatthe consequence of their adoption might be a sizeable cost to the UnitedKingdom balance of payments in a typical year but one which it is impossibleto quantify. As Community regulations now stand, membership of theCommunity would not require any changes in Government regulations orpolicies affecting invisible trade. It is reasonable to expect an expansion ofour invisible earnings as a result of membership but it is not possible toestimate the extent of the increase.101. The addition of all the above figures giving a range of about 100 million to  1,100 million does not take us far in measuring the costto our balance of payments of membership of an enlarged Community. Inthe first place, the addition of the extremes of the various ranges will not givea realistic result in practice. Secondly, the largest component is the figure for our theoretical maximum contribution to the Community budget and that figure of  670 million substantially overstates this cost, if only because, as explained in paragraph 97 above, no account could be taken of the bearing onthe United Kingdom of the arrangements agreed in principle in December 1969by the Six for themselves. Thirdly, it has not been found possible to make an estimate of the dynamic effects of entry either on industry or on tradebecause this depends essentially on the vigour of British industry in exploitingthe opportunities undoubtedly offered by joining the Community and in itsresponse to greater competition (see Chapter III). Past experience offers no adequate guide to the advantages which it would be reasonable to expectin terms of greater efficiency and investment nor therefore of the effects onthe United Kingdom&apos;s relative competitive position and rate of economic growth. But the dynamic effect is considered further in paragraph 104below. Finally, the conclusion that the tariff changes would have an adverse43
effect may well be too pessimistic in the long run. We shall be gainingtariff advantages in a market the Community which in any event is, andwill probably continue to be, of increasing importance to us.102. Nevertheless after allowing for all these qualifications it is clearthat membership of an enlarged Community would be likely to involve asubstantial and continuing balance of payments cost arising from the common agricultural policy: and the impact effects on trade in industrial productsare also likely to be adverse. On the other hand the benefits of the dynamiceffects are not quantifiable.103. But the balance of payments cost is only half the story: the otherhalf is how it is to be met. It can only be met out of the national resources(g.n.p.) and will involve adjustment of claims on those resources other thanclaims pertaining to the balance of payments. These are, in effect, theclaims of domestic consumption and investment, and a reduction in investment would sooner or later involve a reduction in the growth of g.n.p. the adjustments would fall to be made as the balance of payments costs took effect over a transitional period, and during this period the g.n.p. shoulditself be growing. The question is therefore, whether the additional balanceof payments cost expressed as an adjustment of domestic claims on the g.n.p.would be too large in relation to the rate of growth of g.n.p. In the pastdecade the trend rate of growth of g.n.p. has been about three per cent a year, though Chapter III sets out the reasons for thinking that membership of a wider market would increase that rate of growth. The estimates set outearlier in this White Paper of the balance of payments cost of membership would involve, at most, an additional claim on the annual rate of growthover a period of a few years of considerably less than one per cent of our g.n.p.The g.n.p. of the United Kingdom will certainly be much greater than itis today, some  35,000 million a year, when we have to meet the full costof membership. Even a marginal transfer of resources from domestic to overseas claims on g.n.p. is however by no means painless, and it exercisesa deterrent effect on the rate of growth, as the history of the last two years has shown. The crucial question is therefore whether our g.n.p., after taking account of the transfer problem mentioned above, can be expectedto grow more quickly over the transitional period and beyond if we are members of the Community than if we are not. If it can, and if theadditional growth is greater than the cost of membership, then there wouldbe net economic advantage to us in incurring that cost.104. This is clearly not a question to which any calculations could givea precise mathematical answer. The answer depends on many incalculablefactors, but particularly on the outcome of negotiations and on the dynamiceffect, i.e., the response of British industry to the stimulus of competition and to the opportunities of a larger integrated market. As already indicated, the more vigorous this response the greater the benefit to thebalance of payments and the greater the increase in the rate of growth ofour g.n.p. out of which the net cost of entry must be made good. All past experience and the consensus of informed opinion in industry leads to the expectation that the increase in g.n.p. would be greater if we were in theCommunity than if we were outside it.  How much greater, it is impossible
to estimate: this must remain a matter of judgment. As noted inthe preceding paragraph, it would need only a slightly greater increase considerably less than one per cent annually over a period of a few years to offset any probable cost of entry and leave us with a net gain. All that can now be said is that there seems to be a reasonable likelihood of sucha net gain provided that the cost is not unduly high; what the cost willbe can be ascertained only in the course of negotiation. It will then be for parliament to decide. In the words of the statement published in the white paper of 2nd May, 1967 (Cmnd. 3269): &quot;On the economic arguments eachhon. Member will make his own judgment of the effect on exports and imports, on industrial productivity and investment. Equally, every hon.Member must make his own judgment of the economic consequences ofnot going into the Community and, in an age of wider economic groupings,of seeking to achieve and maintain viability outside.&quot;Conclusion105. This paper has been concerned with the economic consequences of membership of the e.c.. When Parliament debated the question in 1967, itwas recognised that the economic balance was a fine one and that in the shortterm there would be some economic disadvantages. Parliament acceptedthen that the long-term economic advantages, and even more the political advantages of British membership of the European Communities weredecisive. On this basis Parliament approved, by an overwhelming majority,Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision to seek membership. In this white paper a detailed account has been given of possible ranges of the costs of entry: and the more favourable and longer term economic considerations havebeen described, with an explanation why they are, inevitably, even lesssusceptible of statistical calculation than the shorter term adverse effects.106. It is not possible to calculate the full economic consequences of notentering the European Communities, in terms of being both excluded from and in competition with an increasingly integrated European economy, onour doorstep, and several times the size and probably faster growing than ourown. Nor has this White Paper attempted to set out the political case for membership.107. The Government consider that the assessments in this White Paperconfirm the judgments made in 1967. It is also the view of the Government,as stated in paragraph 3, that nothing has happened since 1967 to invalidatethe judgment then taken that the balance of political advantage transcendsthe short and long run economic considerations. The uncertain factor isthe balance of economic advantage particularly in the short run, where theassessments in this paper indicate a wide range of possible consequences of membership, depending on the development of the Communities&apos; policiesover the next few years and upon the outcome of negotiations to determine the terms upon which Britain might join the Communities: the course ofevents over the decade ahead cannot be foretold, either in the Communitiesor outside them.45
108. Failure to reach agreement in negotiations for entry would notcondemn Britain or the European Communities to political or economicsterility. But Europe would have lost this historic opportunity to developits full economic potentialities in the interests of the welfare and security ofits citizens; in that case the world would have lost a contribution to its peace and prosperity that neither Britain nor the countries of the european communities can make alone. This White Paper demonstrates the need for negotiations so that this opportunity may be seized.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office310477  Dd. K    1/70
