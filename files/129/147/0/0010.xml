DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVES.NIv.iENT)CiTOllO13th January, 1970,COPY NO.CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL1ALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for, scotland i know that my colleagues recognise the difficulties likely to result from specific pledges on the future National Health Service (NKS)structure being given in England and Wales before decisions on similartopics can be announced for Scotland.    Some differences of structure andadministrative practice are inevitable and indeed desirable.    There are,however, a number of issues where different policies on the two sides ofthe Border would clearly be difficult to justify.    The most important such issues are the composition and method of appointment of the main newhealth authorities, on which it is clear that any important concessions in England will establish a pattern which Scotland will be expected tofollow.2.      On the general issue of principle, I remain convinced that, sincethe Secretary of State will be responsible for the overwhelmingpreponderance of the finances of the NHS and will have to answer on the floor of the House for the efficiency of the Service, there isa clear prima facie case for establishing the new health authorities as his appointed agents.    This could be reconciled - as at presentwith regional hospital boards - with a statutory obligation to ensurethat a proportion of members come from a specified background orprofessional discipline; but this would still leave the Secretary ofState substantial freedom to choose the people he thought best ableto run the Service efficiently on his behalf.3,      I know there is considerable support for the view that, either on merits or as a matter of practical politics, it is not necessary to try to sustain a situation in which all health authority members wouldbe appointed by the Secretary of State, and I have therefore mentionedthis principle only to emphasise that even if we permit some directappointment of members by local authorities and the NHS professionsthere is no reason why this should be carried so far as to undermine the agency relationship,,    Ministers should not be placed in, theposition of appearing to be directly responsible for the actions of bodies of which they have not appointed a majority of the members,I am therefore unimpressed by any arguments that direct outsideappointments should equal or outnumber the members appointed bythe Secretary of State.CO N Fl DE NT! AL
40       Moreover, at the tactical level I think there arc strong arguments against going so far in the forthcoming English Green Paper as has beensuggested (one-third appointed by the Secretary of State, by the localauthorities and by the professions)^    Publication of such a proposal will set the irreducible minimum that the interests will contemplate,and all the arguments and pressure will be directed to diminishingstill further the Secretary of wState&apos;s share.    For example, the localauthorities would doubtless think 40 per cent or 50 per cent better thanthe one-third proposed?  and once the principle of a majority for theSecretary of State lias been abandoned it is difficult to offer any convincinargument why he needs one-third of the places as opposed to a quarter ora fifth.5;      To summarise, therefore, my view is that both on grounds ofprinciple and of expediency there is everything to be said for avoidingan unduly positive commitment on this matter in the second Green Paper,From the Scottish point of view this would have the added advantage of leaving the subject open for the separate discussions which v/ill have tobe held with the Scottish interests,W.R.Scottish Office, S.Tv7.L13th January, 19V0CO N FIDE NTS AL
