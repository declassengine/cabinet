COPY NO.CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEMemo random. by the^ chief^S secret e^tajTreasu:The Secretary of State for Social Services proposes in C(70) 8that we should decide firmly and announce now that control of the health Service should not be transferred to local government.     I agree that such a transfer is not feasible in the immediate futureat least.     The corollary is that we, the central Government, willcontinue to be responsible for finding by far the greatest part ofthe finance, and to be fully answerable to Parliament and the electorate, for the administration of the Service at all levels.We cannot shift this responsibility partly on to someone else,however much we might wish to do so;   and this is why I disagree with one of the main aims of the National Health Service (NHS; reorganisationas proposed by the Social Services Secretary - namely, giving to local interests a bigger share of the responsibility for running the Service,2,    I believe moreover that the way in which the Social ServicesSecretary proposes to translate this aim into practice, via area boardswith a membership of as many as 20-22 composed as to about two-thirds of delegates of special interests, would result   in confusion of thelines of responsibility and encouragement of pressure blocks withinthe administration, to the detriment of rational priorities and efficient management.3.    I certainly agree that it will be important to secure close co-operation between the Health Service and local government, and thata necessary and valuable contribution to Health Service managementshould be provided by doctors and other members of the health-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
nrofessions.     But it does not follow from this that delegates of localauthorities and the health professions should constitute one-third eachof the membership of MS management, that almost a half of that membershipshould be drawn from the medical and other professions, and that members appointed by the Secretary of State, with no special interests, should bein a very small minority.4,     The task of running the MS in the field is a formidable one,involving as it does the disbursement of over 5 per cent of the national income on a complex set of activities with an unceasing problem of priorities in matching demands with available resources.     I thereforewelcome the developments envisaged by the Social Services Secretary tobring the central Department into closer contact with the management inthe field;   this is very desirable, irrespective of other changes, inorder to give greater assurance that national priorities will be broughtto bear locally.     But there will always remain an immense task for the operational management in determining relative local priorities and in securing the best value for the expenditure entrusted to the managementby us, on the taxpayer&apos;s behalf.     If mistakes are made;, then not onlydoes the Health Service suffer, but resources are pre-empted which mightbetter have been used for other services.     The principles of accountablemanagement should, if anywhere in the public service, be brought pre-eminently to bear in this area;   but the first principle   of accountablemanagement is to ensure that operational control is devolved, through a clear chain of responsibility, to persons chosen for their ability forthe task.5.     I conclude that the bodies entrusted with the management of the MSought to be as small in size as possible, with a view to encouraging a sense of corporate responsibility;   that to the greatest extent possibletheir members should be appointed by the Secretaries of State, so as to minimise confusion over the lines of responsibility;   that members withsome special interest (e.g. doctors) should not total more than 25 percent of the whole;   and that if we are to make provision for delegates of particular organisations, then (as has previously been accepted by ministers collectively) the number of such delegates must total less thana majority.-2-
6.     It may be that we should be wise, in any event, to avoid spellingout in the revised Green Paper on NHS reorganisation a precisespecification for the composition of the managing authorities.     To doso might encourage the local authority associations and the british medical Association to regard our specification as a base from which topress for more.     But I consider it essential that the revised G-reenPaper should state firmly the principle that composition and methods of appointment should be geared to the fact of continuing central Governmentresponsibility and the need for as objective and effective managementas possible.J.D.Treasury Chambers, SJI.1,13th. January 1970-3-
