DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(70).5 COPY NO.     uCABINETPAY QE SCHOOL-TEACHERS IN ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Secretary of State fori Education and ScienceMeeting, of ffie Burnham Committee on 5th JanuaryUsing the discretion given me by the Prices and Incomes Committeeon 31st December (PX(69) 28th Meeting, Item l), I told the ssanagementpanel of the Burnham Committee that I would raise no objection to an offer to the teachers of, or equivalent to,  85 per annum overall.    The panelmade such an offer without prejudice, in the form of  100 up to a salary of  1,000, tapering to  80 at  1, 285,    The teachers rejected this offeras wholly unacceptable in both form and amount, insisting that their 135 flat rate claim must be met virtually in fullc    The Chairmanruled for arbitration (which would be on the open offer at the equivalent of  75) and is asking the First Secretary to appoint an arbitral bod]raThe teachers said that they would take no part in arbitration.The Strikes,2,      The National Union of Teachers have launched a. programme for.?tnightJs strikes, beginning on 12th January in some 350 schools with,000 teachers.    The National Association of Schoolmasters is doingsimilarly in another 100 schools or so,    Some of the other associationsmay join in     Only about 2 per cent of schools will be involved at any onetime, but the cumulative effect must be serious educationally and will bringus, and the employers, under mounting political and public pressure.Arbitration3,      We shall not know for certain that the teachers will use their power to frustrate arbitration until they reject the First Secretary^request for their list of nominations for the arbitral body.    She andI are planning the tactics with a view to inducing the teachers toco-operate, if at all practicable (which I doubt), or, if not to showingup their intransigence,,    I hope that we can do something presentationallyto meet some of their objections to arbitration under me present statutoryarrangementso    There is however one point on which I must trouble mycolleagues,,
40      One of the teachers&apos; objections is that, under the Remuneration of teachers Act, the Government can, if it gets a resolution from both Housesthat national economic circumstances justify it, set aside an arbitral award and impose Its own settlement.    This &quot;two resolutions procedure&quot; has never been invoked, and could hardly be unless arbitrators made anabsurdly generous award at a specially difficult time,    I propose thatwe should be ready to undertake in advance not to invoke it on this occasion.    This would demonstrate our wish to do what v/e properlycan to help the teachers, and, if they still remained adamant, theirunreasonableness.    Some Press comment is already showing signsof deploring their attitude to the statutory arbitration arrangements.The National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)5,      The discussion at the Prices and Incomes Committee showedgeneral support for a. structural and comparability reference to the nbpi on teachers3 pay against the 1971 and later negotiations?  sucha reference would be consistent with paragraph 96 of Cmnd, 4237,It is true that the Burnham management panel had proposed a structuralreview in or outside the Burnham Committee, and would prefer the former,but the teachers insist that their present claim must be settled first.    Intime Burnham may embark on its own review, and may possibly produce a useful result,    But this must be uncertain, and we cannot delay a reference to the NBPI, if it is to be of use against 1971, until the resultof any Burnham review is known,    An NBPI report could not in any case be implemented except through Burnham, and, when available, could befed into any review undertaken there,6,      I would see the structural reference as of school-teachers&apos; salariesbut as covering also broad relativities with (but not structure of) collegeteachers (but not dons)0    Scotland could be included if the Secretary ofState so wished, but I do not see this as essential.    There are no liveissues of relativities-across the Border, the two systems are very different, the Scottish Committee corresponding to Burnham has itsown structural review - against 1970 - in progress, and the NBPI hasalready reported on Scottish teachers,7,      I therefore seek my colleagues5 agreement that the First secretary and I are justifiee to make a structural and comparability reference against1971, on the basis set out in paragraph 6, when we judge the moment tobe rights    The reference should be made soon, but the exact timing must depend on developments in the next week or two,8,      A long-term reference of this kind however willnot help to get the teachers back to work, indeed rather the contrary, because they are strongly opposed to the NBPI,    So if, as I expect, the First secretary and I fail to bring the teachers to arbitration, we shall be at an impasse,Already I am being widely urged to ,sintervene!l and the clamour will grow,,The only action I can see within our own control is to substitute the NBFIfor the arbitral body by combining a structural reference with a short-term reference on the extent of the interim increase which the teachersshould be given, in the light of the new White Paper, in April, 1970,
90      There are difficulties about this.    The teachers would not like it0The Board would in effect be asked to act as arbitrator I this is not its proper function,,    The Board!s recommendations could be implementedonly through the Burnham machinery following a voluntary resumption of negotiations,,    If Burnham could not reach agreement on the basis of theBoardfs report, the report itself would have to go before arbitrators, whichmight be eraoarrassing.    The Board could not be expected to make a first report inside two to three months, during which the strikes continue,,Finally, the Board might recommend smaller increases than the manage&quot;ment have already offered (or none);  this again would be an embarrass-ment and unlikely to lead to a resumption of work and of negotiation.10,      I do not therefore suggest a shot t-term reference as a  /articularlydesirable expedients    It would be something of a gamble, but at best itwould provide a possible way forward in an otherwise intractable situation,I feel strongly that we cannot afford to appear inactive or lacking ininitiative over what is likely to be a period of several months of an extremely uncomfortable situation,,    If my colleagues have alternatives to suggest, I shall be very gl?.d to have them.    Otherwise 1 feel bound to invite them to agree on a contingent basis that, if the teachers continue torefuse to participate in arbitration, the First Secretary and I may have authority to make a short-term reference against !970j if and when itappears to us that any purpose v/ill be served by so doing.Summary11,       I invite my colleagues to agree that the First Secretary and Ihave authority, if and when we judge the moment to be right, to.&quot;(a) Give an undertaking that we will not seek on this occasion to invoke the two resolutions procedure to set aside any award whicharbitrators may maize (see paragraphs 3 and 4 above),(b) Make an early structural and comparability reference to the nbpi against 1971 of school-teachers&apos; salaries on the basis set out inparagraph 6 above,(c) If arbitration is frustrated, make a short-term reference to the nbpi to advise on the interim increase justified under the White paper for school-teachers in April, 1970 (see paragraphs 6-10 above),.11  . .     -     :.        -     .E.W.S.Department of Education and Science, W, L,9th January, 1970-3-
