pOCUIviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;---- gjC(67) 89 COPY NO.___31st May, 1967CABINETLEASEHOLD REFORM B3.LLMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the ProblemI regret that I have to trouble the Cabinet with an important question which has arisen during the passage of the Leasehold reform bill and on which the Ministerial Committee on Rent, Land and leasehold reform have been unable to agree.2.       The Bill as introduced (and the White Paper (Cmnd. 2916) confinesthe right to enfranchise to qualified leaseholders of houses the rateable value of which does not exceed the Rent Act limits ( 400 in London, 200 elsewhere).    In Standing Committee the limit was removed, bya majority of 38-1.     This seriously alters the balance of the Bill.     Thereare theoretically four possible courses to take:(a) To leave the Bill as amended.(b) To restore the Rent Act limits.(c) To insert higher limits.(d) To provide for properties above the Rent Act limit a right toenfranchise at the market value of the freeholders interest but no rightto a 50 year extension of lease (which the Bill provides for propertybelow the limits) thus depreciating the value of the freeholder&apos;s interest.Relevant Considerations3.       The Committee accept the view of the Minister of State, Ministryof Housing and Local Government, that simply to restore the Rent Actlimits is politically impossible.     The Rent Act limits have some logicaljustification because they define the properties whose value to the landlordhas already been depreciated by the creation of the 1954 Act of thestatutory tenant.     Once they are abandoned there is no logical justification for any higher figures that might be chosen.     The Committee therefore considered that for practical purposes the choice lay between leaving theBill as amended and course (d) - enfranchisement at the current market value of the freeholder&apos;s interest.
4.       Table A annexed to this memorandum shows that there are 8,431otherwise qualified properties above the Rent Act limits.    Table Billustrates the extent to which the inclusion of these properties in thebenefits of the Bill alters its character.     The Cabinet accepted, though some of us only with difficulty (CC(66) 7th Conclusions, Minute 2) ameasure which admittedly had confiscatory elements, in that it involved a considerable transfer of value from the freeholder to the leaseholder.We thought this could be justified in the context of the advantage whichthe leasehold system gives the landlord as against the small man,    Mostof the properties concerned are small - the removal of the limits addsonly about 1 per cent to the qualified total;  but it brings in relativelywell-off leaseholders who have no moral claim to the large financialgains which enfranchisement will bring them.     Columns 6 and 12 of table B, which relates to actual houses, show the gains which theleaseholders of the more valuable properties will make where theunexpired term of the lease is relatively short - e. g, for a payment to the freeholder of  1,815, the leaseholder of a property with rateable value of  630 will gain  11,935;  for a property of  1, 097 rateable valuethe figures are a payment of  10,000 for a gain of  32,000.    some members of the Ministerial Committee consider that such gains (whichwill not be subject to capital gains tax) are indefensible.    If the lease-holder had to pay the market value of the freehold, however, hispayments in these two cases would be respectively  8,100 and  28, 000,which would give him some, but not an excessive, benefit,5.       The Minister of State does not feel able to accept market value for properties above the Rent Act limits on the ground that we haveresisted Opposition attempts to tie the compensation to market value for all properties affected by the Bill including those below the IbentAct limits.conclusion.       The Cabinet are asked to decide which of the.courses radicatedin paragraph 2(a)*(d) should be adopted.R.H.S. C.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,31st May, 1967COhJ F! DE MTIAL
