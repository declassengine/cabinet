III - TteJBffiEEg. gOS^ILXTSESHOSPITAL EXPENDITURECapital ( 10m. - 27m. saving)7*    Needs.   It is estimated that about 30 per cent of the existing472,000 hospital beds are over 100 years old and that 60 per cent date fromthe last century.   The average age of   a   hospital bed today is about70 years.   Thus a considerable part of present hospital accommodation isacknowledged, medically and administratively as inadequate for the practice of modern medicine.8.    The current programme.   The ten year Hospital Plan envisages thecapital expenditure of some  1000m. between 1966 and 1975.   About a fifth of this is required to keep pace with the increase and shift in population.The remainder will mainly be needed to replace or improve existing hospitals,fceoause capital expenditure between 193S and about 1955 was minimal and thebacklog of obsolescence so great, this programme will just about preventthe average of hospital beds from increasing,but will not suffice to reduoe it.9.    The present planning figures for capital expenditure on N.H.3. hospitalsW* as follows:-1S&amp;7/68     1 968/9     1 969/70     1 970/71 m*  m.  m.  m.85.2 94.3        103.3        112.310, Over the period 1967/68 to 1970/71, the current programme should enable some 200 major schemes to be started to a total value somewhatgreater than  350m.;   in addition, some  100m. would be spent on minorschemes.11.   There is no easy or convenient way (comparable, for example, with&quot;aohool places&quot;) of expressing the product of this investment.   The cost ofa hospital bed with all its supporting services varies substantiallyaccording to the type of hospital.   The average cost of a district general hospital bed is  8000 -  9000, with, for example, mental illness
hospitals,which are relatively simple in their requirements, costing less, and complex teaching hospitals costing substantially more than this figure.   Theaverage cost of   a   bed in all hospitals is some  10,000.   The limited capital resources available have to be spread widely between a large number of competinghospitals.   Consequently, although an average  10,000 might buy one fully supported hospital bed, in practice the constituent supporting services oftenhave to be provided in stages and not necessarily at the same hospital.   Onehospital might add or replace the ward unit.      itself,      another   the operatingtheatres or the   diagnostic departments, and yet another the staff residences,catering, laundry, etc.   As a very rough guide, acoepting that the average cost per bed of  10,000 will be disbursed in this way, and allowing for theinescapable replacement of short lived plant and equipment   and  forpatching up buildings awaiting replacement, the expenditure of some  450m.notional(paragraph 10 above) might yield   a/ equivalent of   35,000/ !i ),000 beds withtheir supporting facilities.   Most of these would be replacing existingaccommodation rather than adding to the total of beds in use.12,  Value for money.   Every effort is being made to make available resourcesgo as far as possible and to obtain the maximum value for money.   The system of cost allowances for the major elements in any hospital project (covering roughlytwo/thirds of the cost of each project) has been held steady without any increase   sinoe April, 1963.   Under the new hospital procedures attention isnow being directed to the cost of elements not covered by these allowances(e,g. communications - including liftsj environmental engineering services,such as air conditioning;   high rise building; abnormal foundations; externalworks (roads, landsoaping, etc.)).   In addition, as part of the Department&apos;sown development programme, two utility district general hospitals using theaaximuo of standardised components are being designed and built which aim atcost of getting reductions/up to  3,000 a bed without unacceptable reductions in standards of oedioal care.     But these projects will not mature in time to produce generalreductions in cost in the period under review.13*  Reductions.   The immediate and long-term need for investment in the hospital service is such that as a natter of priorities the Health Departments woulddtprsoato any part of the reduction falling en the hospital building programme,tat within the teas of the Be view capital expenditure is in effeot tho only area in which there is any significant room for manoeuvre without abandonment ofentire services.    Thus,the range of reductions considered bslev, (fron 9$ in
14.   Because the programme consists, to a large extent, of schemes whioh take up to five years to complete, the bulk of expenditure in any one year is onschemes in progress and this, for practical purposes, is not amenable toadjustment.   The manipulation of expenditure in any one year can only be by adjvsb-ing the starts of new sohemes, and expenditure on these does not reach its maximum rate until the second or subsequent years.   If any significant change is to be made in the level of expenditure in a particular year, action must therefore be started two or three years in advance, and the total effect ismuch greater than in the single year.   The effects, and  further action tocontrol the outturn of expenditure, will spill over into the following years.15.   There are a number of ways in which the reductions in capital expenditurein 1970/7&quot;! could be made, but the examples chosen for illustration in theattached table are those which disturb as little as possible the building programme, avoid upsetting clinical priorities and minimise abortiveexpenditure except ia so far as some additional patching up expenditure wouldbe called for on buildings at present scheduled for replacement./see attached Table/16.   The effect of these reductions on the present planning figures shown inparagraph 7 is as follows:1967/68 nuPlanning figures 85.2Reductions (range)Reduced level (range) 85.217.   It would not be possible to defer any patohing up or plant replacementschemes.   Reductions in the size of the main programme would thus be almostentirely at the expense of major schemes providing new beds (either additionalor replacement).   It is estimated that the effect on the notional 35 - 40,000beds to be started under the current programme in the four year period,1967/68 - 1970/71 (paragraph 11) would be as follows:1968/69	1969/70	1970/71 a.	 m.	 m.94.3	103.3	112.33-0	12-5	27-1091-94.3	91-98	85-102Alternative A, through i6% in Alternative B to 25$ in Alternative C) are substantially greater than the target figure of 7^ per cent.

While the schemes which would be deferred have not been identified, theeffect of deferment on the start of individual hospital projects can be illustrated.   Some projects are of such high    priority that they would not be deferred even under Alternative C (e.g. Nottingham Teaching Hospital).   but under Alternatives C or B it would not be possible to avoid deferring a largenumber of schemes of great    local importance and concern such as St. Thomas&apos;Hospital, district general hospitals at Chester, Wolverhampton, Stockton-on-Tees,Yeovil, Basingstoke, Kettering, Rhyl^, etc., as well as hospitals for the mentally subnormal, and numerous smaller schemes, e.g. maternity and geriatricunits, of   great  importance locally.   Under Alternative A the effect would bemore on the minor sohemes than on the major, named, schemes.   Precise startingdates for schemes have no^leen announced, but Hospital Boards have been given the P.E.S.C. period and in some c ases deferments would be publicly obviouswhere they represented departures from the published Hospital Plan (whichannounced&quot;schemes which it is hoped to start&quot; up to 1969/70).expenditure figures for planning purposes up to (and more tentatively beyond)

Revenue ( 10m. saving) 5 63ll,  Revenue expenditure on N.H.S. hospital services provided by Regional hospital boards and Boards of Governors is by far the largest single element in the block,aaounting to around one-half of the total of  ]*447m. in 1967/68.   The presentforecasts are as follows:-1967/68_1968/69     1969/70     1970/7!      l?7j/72Forecasts 712.5        731.2        753.1 779*5        807.7(percentage rate     (2f*) (2f*) (3%) (3&amp;)of growth)The present annual rate of growth is thus about  ]9m., of which nearly two-thirds,about  12m. ia 1967/68, is to meet the revenue oonsequenoes of capital schemesnow coming into eommissioa.   The latter element, although it is largely inescapableonce the capital schemes have been set in hand^also represents a real improvementia the standard of care that can be provided in new buildings.   The remainder is available for all other non-capital developments.   In 1970/71 , a similar proportion,or nearly  1 ?So, would be absorbed by the revenue consequences of presently plannedallcapital schemes, leaving  1 Om. for/ other developments *20. Considerable efforts have been made to improve the &quot;productivity&quot; of existing facilities.   lor example, in the ten years to 1965? the number of pathology unitshandled per technician has risen by 1&amp;%S and the number of units per head of population ay 122&amp;   Over the same period the average length of stay has beenreduoed (without increase in the number of beds) by kO% in medical departments and20% ia surgical departments.   There has been an increase in the total number of&quot;discharges and deaths&quot; - i.e. in-patient eases treated - from about 3.6m. toWSfflp or by about 32% in a period when the total population has risen by about 7%*While expenditure per patient week has been increasing with mere intensive care,the average 00st of treating a patient in an acute non-teaohing hospital has fallen by just over 5$ in real terms between 1957/58 and 1965/66.  Tory broadly, therefore,it could be said that the i nor ease in productivity has kept paoe with the increasein population, so that tho increase in total expenditure in real terms year by year has represented a real improvement in the amount of medical ears provided,this has not resulted in any reduction in hospital waiting lists, which stand atpresent around 500,000 and are tending to rise.   Waiting lists are however not a/reliable
Salaries and Wages 500Provisions and Clothing 54Drugs, Dressings &amp; Applianoes 53Fuel, light, etoe 37Maintenance &amp; Repairs 29Other 40713The lion&apos;s share is taken by expenditure on staff.   A considerable number of studies are at present in progress to examine the possibility of economising in manpower(particularly on the nursing side.   On present forecasts, manpower is howeverirpeoted to rise from a total of 538,300, including 241,000 nurses, in 1967/68to 593,500 including 274*300 nurses by 1st April, 1971.The effects of a22. / reduction of  1 Om. in 1970/71 oan be illustrated in a number of ways, e.g.:-(a) in the orudest form, as the average cost of treating an in-patientin an acute hospital is just over  70, it could be regarded as thecost of treating 140,000 patients;(b) it could be regarded as the cost of some 12,740 nurses, or 38^ of the forecast increase between now and 1st April, 1971;(c) it could mean a reduction of ^ in the present level of expenditure on maintenance, repairs and renewals - which has not yet overtakenthe backlog of suoh work estimated at  13m. in 1964/65*JJ.  Alternatively, it con be considered as a reduction in the real increase in expenditure available for the development of the service,   To offset areduction of  10m. in 1970/71 would require the percentage rate of increase to be out baok to an average of just over 2,6% - rather below the 1967/68 growth rate -for the next throe years.   The reductions.in capital expenditure described in thepovious section would produce acme consequential reductions in the extra ourrentO0&apos;t they would generate but much of this would mature outside the period underr*rieff.  Even assuming the highest rate of reduction of capital expenditure of 27m.reliable expression of the value being obtained from the service beoause of the&quot;iceberg&quot; effect;   as soon as one layer of medical needs has been dealt with another layer comes into view.2ls  The breakdown of the 1967/68 level of expenditure into its main heads is as
tosent &quot;Basic&quot;prcentage increase p.a.^iuotionsPiuoed levelfroentage increase p.a.1967/68	1968/69	. 1969/70 ,	1970/71	1973/72712.5	731.2	753.1	779.5	807.7		3%	3^S	3&amp;S-	-	3	10	16712.5	731.2	750.1	769.5	791.7	2t 	2.6%	2.6%	2370/if in 1970/71 (alternative A), the result would be that the approximate 1%[liable in 1967/68 for developments other than the additional running oosta ofschemes would be reduced to about      in 1970/71; and to a slightly lowerIrcentage on alternatives B or C.   This is not sufficient to allow the total volume(afeeut 0.$^)service to rise at as high a rate as the forecast increase/in total population,though it might be able to do so with further inoreases in productivity.   But aghe: vate of increase is needed to keep paoe with population ohanges;   for example,numbers of the elderly and the very young, whioh make a significant contributionthe case load of hospitals, are rising more rapidly than the population as a whole.I9re would therefore be little if any room for the gradual qualitative increase ine standard of service provided by hospitals which has so far absorbed a part of thefilial increase for developments, and maintenance of buildings and equipment would be of the first heads of expenditure to be reduced.   It would be difficult - onstandstill onedical and political grounds - %&amp; impose a/ through lack of money/any newevelopmenta of medical treatment which emerged up to 1970/71; and to make room for themt would be necessary to curtail other parts of the service, resulting in furtherbears of maintenance, lowering of feeding standards qs   actual reductions in theevel of existing services.   Two such recent developments are haemodialysis in oasesf renal failure and oervioal cytology screening, the total oost of which, ifprovided for all those who on present information might benefit from them, could leadweatualo/annual expenditure of the order of  10m. and  2m. respectively, thus requiringubatantial increases in expenditure over the next few years if they are to be fullyeveloped.   Further possibilities are already appearing, for example, cardiac surgeryor the very young and the prevention of haemolytic disease in the newborn;others  may well appear in the next few years.The reductions for other years have been oalculated on the basis of aOiittantgrowth rate throughout the period, adjusted to make some allowance for revenue savings resulting from the deferment of capital schemes.   The pathExpenditure would thus be modified as follows :-
25*   If a saving of  10m. ware to be achieved in 1970/71* only        5minor variations of this revised progression are practicable.To maintain the present progression up to 1969/70 and to limit the out to  10m. in 1970/71 alone would leave  16.4m. availablein that year for all developments, of which rather over  14m.would be required for the revenue cost of capital schemesmaturing in the year, even allowing for a reduction in capitalexpenditure reaching  27m. in 1970/71.   The remaining  2m* wouldbe insufficient to allow for the additional cost in a full year of developments taking place in 1969/70, other small improvements in medioal and diagnostic procedures and techniques, and theincreased oost of staff pay increments, and would make no provisionat all for increases in the level of service to match populationincreases or for the now medioal developments.   A very severe blowwould be dealt to the programmes of training which are being developed at all levels and which need urgently to be accelerated(see Seotion IV, para.
Local Health and welfare 5 67(a)Capital ( 6m saving)26.   In 1967/68 the allocation of local authority capital expenditure on health and Welfare Services is as follows.-  million(l)     Health Centres .. 1,1(2)     Centres and Hostels for the mentally disordered .. 5.2(3)     Centres for the younger physicallyhandicapped and the elderly .. 1.1(4)     Homes for the younger physicallyhandicapped .. 0.4(5)     Homes for the elderly .. 11.6(6)     Other services e.g. ambulancestations, maternity and child welfare clinics .. 3*823.2(7)     Capital expenditure met from L.A.revenue funds and not subject to central loan sanction .. 5*428.627,    The total reflects a reduction of nearly  3 million in the expenditureplanned for 1967/68 before the cuts announced in July, 1966.     This follows aout of nearly  7 million-in the expenditure planned for 1966/67 as a consequence of the six months deferment of certain- projects decided by theGovernment in July, 19^5*     Thus over those two years nearly  10 million ofplanned capital investment in local authority health and welfare services hasalready been foregone, about l&amp;fo of the investment originally planned forthese years.28*   The total &quot;basic&quot; Forecast for 1970/ 71 is  39&apos;lm. of which about 33 million would be controlled by loan sanctions to be issued in I969/7O(the remainder being capital met from revenue).     Precise forecasts for individual services are not available since final allocations are decided from year to yeo,r within the framework of the 10-year forward plans which areregularly submitted by local authorities.     These plans are not alwaysrealistic in the short-term but over a period of years they provide a broad/indication
indication of the level of provision which the local authorities thinkreasonable to meet the unmet needs in their localities.     paragraphs$ -\Jbelow indicate what might be provided within the present P.E.S.C. basicforecast and - where possible - the comparison with what the localauthorities have said they would like to do by 1971 in their most recentten-year plan.29*   Health Centres    These provide premises for general practice andclinic facilities for local authority health services associated with them.They constitute an important factor in the efficient organisation ofgeneral practice and associated local authority staff, and present policyis to give them overall priority.     34 centres exist today and 230 areenvisaged by 1971 in the 10-year plans.     But recent evidence indicates that proposals are likely to come forward for substantially more centresthan this.     It costs on average about  40,000 to build a health centre,and at the present basic forecast rate of expenditure 215 more might becompleted by 1971 with a further 70 under construction.Before the Mental Health Act, 1959,33*   Centres and hostels for mentally disordered. / local authority services for the mentally disordered were very limited in scope and theyhave still a very long way to go.     Capital expenditure of about  850 isrequired for each new place in a centre and  2,500 in a hostel.     At thepresent basic forecast rate of expenditure the number of places intraining oentres for children would rise from 22,500 at present to 23,800by 1971j in oentres for adults from 19,500 to 31,000, and in hostels from,500 to 7?300.     This would allow places per thousand of the population to rise by 1971 from O.47 to O.57 for children&apos;s centres, O.41 to 0.6lfor adult centres and 0.09 to 0.15 for hostels.     It is not yet possible tosay what ratios are required to meet the full need which continues to growas for example new techniques in training the mentally sub-normal develop.In their ten-year plans local authorities have made their own interimassessments but few authorities expect to satisfy the need as they nowsee it before 1976, except in relation to training centres for children/where
where the 28,800 places in 1971 provided for in the basic forecast isvery close to the total need as assessed by local authorities, (thoughmany existing places which are not really satisfactory, e.g. inchurch halls, would not have been replaced).     By 1976 localauthorities plan a total of 37*400 places in centres for adults, a ratio of 0.71 per thousand population and 16,500 in hostels, a ratio of 0.32per thousand.    But it is apparent that the real need is substantially greater since within these totals some authorities plan no provision atall under one or the other head, a substantial number plan less than thecurrent national average ratio and the great majority plan less than thecurrent provision of the more forward looking authorities.     In the basic forecast   the Ministry have given some priority to expenditure onthese services in order to promote care of the mentally disordered inthe community and thus to avoid unnecessary hospital care at greater cost.But they consider that even if the pace of development in the basicforecast were maintained throughout the 1970&apos;s adequate levels of provision would be unlikely to have been achieved before 1980.31.   Centres for the younger physically handicapped and the elderly.     Thenumber of centres now is 1540 and the present basic forecast rates ofexpenditure would permit of an increase of 120 to a total of 1660 by 1971at a cost of about  35*000 per centre.     This is substantially less thanlooal authority forecasts for 1971 - about 1910 centres or 1 centre per26,500 of the population - and would certainly leave a considerable unmetdemand.in many areas.     The indications from reports by the Ministry&apos;sprofessional staff are that even where provision is made at significantlyhigher ratios than 1 to 26,500 needs are not yet fully met.32.   Homes for the younger physically handicapped.     There are at presentsome 80 homes with 7,200 places, and present forecast expenditure wouldprovide by 1971 a further 20 homes with 700 places at a cost of  3*000per place.     Assuming no replacement building, this would raise thenumber of places per 1000 of the population aged between 16 and 64 from.23 only to 0.24, an increase which is well below local authority planlevels and which would leave unmet need.
33. Homes for the elderly. These at present absorb about half of the totalof loan sanctions available.   Three main factors are involved - an existingshortage of accommodation, the annually increasing number of the elderly inthe population, and the urgent need to replace outworn and wholly unsuitableex-Publio Assistance Institutions with some 25.000 places.   The present numberof places is about 92,000 or 16 per lOOOpopulation over 65.   The looal authorityplans would provide an average of 20 places per thousand elderly by 1971 andthe Ministry consider this a reasonable minimum ratio.   This would call for130,000 places by 1971* an increase of 38,000 places.   The looal authoritiesalso propose replacement of at least half of the obsolete buildings by 1971.say 12,000 places giving a total requirement of 50,000 places.   The basioforecast rate of expenditure, at a cost of  2,500 per place, would provideonly 23,000 places by 1971 and allowing for only one-third of these places as replacements, the total number of places in 1971 would be 107,000, a ratio of only about 16.8 places per thousand population over 65.34.   Local authority health and welfare capital expenditure is at present planned to inorease by  2.1m a year to a total of  59.1m in 1970/71 (and 41.2m. in 1971/72) or an inorease of      declining slightly in the later years.   A cut of  6m in 1970/71 (operated through curtailment of loan sanctionsin 1969/70) would bring the investment level for 1970/71 down to  1.8m belowthe level currently planned for 1968/69 (in respect of which lists of provisional approvals for loan sanctions during the current year 1967/68have already been issued).   It would be equivalent to cancelling about15$ of the planned programme for that year.35.   It is not possible to say precisely how a cut of  6m would be distributed between services; it would pose difficult questions and would depend onpriorities at the time.   If it were spread proportionately across the fieldit would mean some 1050 fewer new places in centres and hostels for the mentally disordered (300 in children&apos;s centres, 600 in adult centres, 150hostel places); 1200 fewer places in homes for the elderly; and 100 fewerplaesa in homes for the younger physically handicapped.   In practioeproportionate reductions on the smaller heads of expenditure may be undulydifficult and if as well the present priority for health centres were maintained so that instead of a reduction in planned expenditure it was permitted to rise with the expected growth in demand, the  6m out wouldbe likely to fall more than/proportionately
proportionately on homes for the elderly - up to, say, 1600 places foregone.It is unlikely that the reduction in new places for the mentally disorderedcould be less than the 1050 quoted above.     Both these heads react on hospitalprovision since both forms of expenditure provide facilities calculated toreduce demand for hospital beds whioh are substantially more expensive to service.36.    As oapital projects in this field generally take only about a year tocomplete and there are no binding forward commitments a cut of  6m in 1970/71would not necessarily have implications for policy after that year.     It wouldbe possible as an alternative to spread the  6m cut over several years, e.g.to make cuts of  lm,  2m and  3m in 1968/69, 1969/70 and 1970/71(or 1969/70, 1970/71 and 197l/72) respectively, leaving a reduced growth rate ofabout  lm a year or 3$ declining.     The end effeot in loss of services would be just the same.     It is also technically possible to make the total cut shallower(less than  6 million) or much deeper, e.g. progressive cuts of  2m,  4m,  6m and 8m over the years 1968/69 to 1971/72 inclusive - a total Out of  20m - whichwould mean virtually no growth in capital expenditure over the whole period.     Inthe latter case the resulting deficiencies in the service would be very severesince the effects would increase in direct proportion - on a  20m total, areduction of e.g. some 5000 new places in old people&apos;s homes and some 4000places in centres and hostels for the mentally disordered.37. fe) Revenue ( 6m saving)Local authority revenue expenditure on health and welfare services is broadly as followsi-1966/67 m home nursing 30Home helps 16Care of mothers and young children 14Prevention of illness,care and aftercare 5Mental health 16Ambulances 24Other health services 2Homes for the elderly 39Welfare Servioes for the handicapped 7Administration etc 9,Total I62
38.    The effect of reducing the planned rate of increase in 1970/71 by  6mand phasing it in 1969/70,(the earliest possible year since the R.S.G.settlement for 1968/9 has already been concluded.)

There is no way whereby the Department oould ensure that a particularreduced rate of increase would be applied to current expenditure on looalhealth and welfare services   even if there were it is difficult to forecasthow a reduction of this kind would be applied - different looal authorities would hold back under different heads.40.    If capital were cut by  6m in 1970-1 this itself would permit revenuesavings rising to about  lm by 197l/72 (about half of this being servicing ofthe capital loans), but on the assumption that the revenue reduction of  6m wouldbe carried through to 197l/72 also as part of a Government decision to lower the rate of support to local authorities generally, the main impact might beexpected to fall on the staffing of the domiciliary services - home nurses,health visitors, home helps, sooial workers for the handicapped and the elderly -all of which are under great pressure in many areas and likely to remain sounder presently planned revenue allocations.     One would expect that theinduction would show itself in lower levels of recruitment ofthis staff?possibly in postponement of bringing some oapital equipment (such as old people&apos;s homes) into use?   limited use of the proposed new powers to be conferred on looal authorities such as family planning and the promotion of the welfare of the elderly?   and an unwillingness to undertake the proper trainingof ambulance staff and of the staff of residential homes.
41*     It is not possible to quantify this effect at all closely as betweenthe various services.     But net revenue expenditure expressed per unit ofstaff is about  1,250 for both health and welfare services;   the overall averagedirect salary cost is about  870.     A reduction of  6m in revenue expenditure would therefore probably represent a reduction of some5000-6000 staff and their associated services from the planned increaseof about 33,000 (1967^8 to 197^72).42.   It would be possible to aim at acrosa-the-board reductions of greater or lesser severity in local authority revenue expenditure over the whole range of their services and thus probably to produce more or less than a  6meffect on local health and welfare services.     But a deeper cut than  6mwould probably require a change in the statutory machinery of central government support for local authority expenditure.

There is little dataon numbers of consultations but the overall average per head of the population isprobably about five;   for children under 16 it is probably near this averagewhereas for those over 65 it is probably about seven.45- As a theoretical possibility the free service could be withdrawn entirely;   butin practice arrangements would then have to be made for providing or paying for thetreatment of at least the indigent and perhaps also such categories as the elderly,children, maternity patients, and emergencies, and this would leave a residual costof probably well over half the present bill.     Legislation would be needed and a radical change in the whole concept of the N.H.S. involved.46. It would not be practicable to separate off part of the general medical service for continued free provision, e.g. for treating serious as opposed to more trivialcomplaints. Impracticable distinctions in kind and in degree would be involved andin any case the family doctor is the patient&apos;a normal first point of contact and theaeriousiess of the complaint could not be assessed until after the consultation hadtaken place.47. What could be done is to impose a charge on users of the service.     The simplestmethod would be a charge per consultation.    Suoh a charge would also have to beaPPlied to hospital outpatients.    There would almost certainly have to be someexemptions or arrangements for repayment.     Classes to be considered for exemption
light be retirement pensioners (15$ of the population), expectant and nursing   r njothere (2$), ohildren under 16 (25$), and perhaps the ohronic sick  (2$ - 3$).Ihere would also have to be refunds to those on Supplementary Benefit.    The yield from auoh a charge is outside the scope of this paper, but there would be someconsequential reduction in gross public expenditure, and this is illustrated in the table in paragraph JHI below.    The arguments against a oharge are that it would bedeterrent to seeking medical advice and treatment and an encouragement to self-jedication.    There would have to be machinery for checking the collection of ohargesthe doctors, which they would probably strongly resent.    On the other hand, the argument in favour of a oharge is that it might^deter some unnecessary use of theservice and reduoe the doctors&apos; workload which has been one of the causes of therecent difficulties with the general practitioners.Pharmaceutical ServicesII, All drugs prescribed by doctors are provided free to patients.     The basicforecast is given belowi-Cost ( m)No.of pre-scriptionsAverage cost(1967 survey prices)1967/68	1968/69	1969/70	1520/11	152.0	157.2	162,4	167.6	173.0260m	264m	268m	272m	276m11/ld	11/3&amp;1	1l/6d	11/sJd	1l/l1dJ. The average cost per head of the population is about  3*     If patients had toay the full cost of their drugs under private arrangements, however, a greatburden - running in extreme cases to hundreds of pounds - might be imposed on theseriously ill at the time of greatest need.50. Three possibilities ares-(a)   Abolition of the service (after legislation) would, as for the family doctor services, need to be aocompanied by exceptionsfor hardship and probably for speoial categories such as the elderly,the young, etc.     The resulting saving might be of the order of  80m./(b)
(b) To limit free provision to a list of &quot;life-saving&quot; drugs.     Forexample, expenditure on simple analgesics and antacids aloneamounts at present to some  5m - and it is arguable that expenditure of this kind could reasonably be borne by all except the indigent.     There is however, a risk that anysaving would be reduced by doctors prescribing costly drugs(on the &quot;free&quot; list) unnecessarily in order to save expense totheir patients.(c) To limit the prescribing of doctors to a list based on thestandard works of reference - excluding proprietaries regardedas clinically of doubtful value or for which a cheaper unbrandedstandard formulation would be a clinically acceptable substitute.A system of this kind is operated in New Zealand and in a numberof European countries - including the Netherlands, Belgium,Norway and West Germany - but general experience seems to be thatcost per head is not noticeably lower.     Direot comparisons arevery difficult but an I.L.O. study published in 1959 suggestedthat European expenditures expressed as a proportion of incomeper head were greater than in this country and on a directcomparison in 1963/64 New Zealand costs per head were higher thanin this country.      The saving if it were introduced here istherefore very speculative;   it might conceivably come up to, say, 1 OsuThe course at (a) above would be very radical.     Those at (b) and (c) would provokestrong opposition from the doctors as a limitation on their clinical freedom andtheir ability to prescribe under the Service what they believe to be best fortheir patients.51.  A quite different possibility is the re-introduction of a prescription charge.This would seem the most practicable alternative if quick action is required, sinoeit would require regulations but not fresh legislation.     As with the consultationcharge, the yield is outside the direot scope of this paper but there would be a saving in gross public expenditure from the deterrent effect depending on the level/of oharge
of oharge and the ohoioe of exempt categories.    If the latter oovered all the 5 7 7groups noted earlier, i.e. old, young, maternity and ohronio sick , about 50 percent would be exempted.    Machinery for auoh wide soale exemptions which providedreasonable safeguards against abuse would be difficult to devisej   and a system ofrefunds, though minimising abuse, would be cumbersome and costly of staff.Possible Savings (say,  15m)52, There is a considerable range of ohoioe.    The table below indicates theon gpeds and servicesreductions in gross publio expenditure/from various possibilities.     For the purposeef the charges themselves of the summary, the yiell/haa been ignored, and a midway figure of  15m has been shown as the reduction in gross expenditure from 1970/71 (because of the need for legislation for the consultation chargei   the prescription oharge could be donesooner) *Exemptions for. - ^	1 Supplementary Benefit Recipients only	S.B., old. chronio sick	S.B., old, chronio sick, maternity, children.2/6d per prescription form	7-12    (15)	5-10 (1T-12)	3- 8 (7-8)2/6d per prescription item	20-25      (25)	13-18 (17-20)	8-13 (11-14)2/6d per g.p. consultation	Up to 10(20-25)	Up to 7(15-18)	Up to 5(10-12)Notes   The main figures in the table are.an estimate of the deterrent effect,the figures in braokets are the/yield of the oharge.    The total savingwould be the sum of these two.    The figures are all very speculativebecause the effects of charges on consultation frequencies and pre-scribing habits cannot be foreseen with any accuracy 5   and because there is very little data about the habits of the proposed exempt classes.If higher charges were levied the yield would increase in broad proportion butthe deterrent effect would not necessarily do so.Dental Service ( 38m saving)53* The basic forecast cost of this service, net of charges, is as follows.1262/68    1968/69    1262/22   1222/11   .1971/72Cost ( m)      72.6        73.8        75.1 76.8        78.7lesscharges      11.9 12.2 12.4 12.7 12.net cost       60.7 61.6 62.7 64.1 65.no. ofdentists   10430       10430       10460       10540       10650

An alternativelould be to increase the present treatment charge from  1 to 30s. or to  1 plus 25$of any extra oost, and to increase the charge for dentures from  5 to, say,  6,^in increase in the basic treatment charge would tend to discourage people fromvisiting the dentist regularly and keeping their teeth in good order (from thispoint of view the proportionate charge would be the better of the two)&apos;, and apartfrom the yield (about  3-4*0 which is outside the soope of this paper, the saving ingross public expenditure resulting from the higher charge would be minimal.Ophthalmic Service ( 10m saving)55,   The basic forecast cost of this service, net of charges, is as follows.-	1967/68	1968/69	1969/70	1970/71	1971/72Cost ( m)	20.5	20.7	21.2	21.6	22.less charges	8.0	8.1	8.3	8.4	8.6Net oost	12.5	12.6	12.9	13.2	13-4No. of sight tests	6.5m	6.65m	6.8m	6.95m	7.1m56. The net cost in 1967/68 is made up principally of  6m for sight-tests and 6.1m for dispensing lenses and spectacles.     The cost of providing the lenses andspectacle frames themselves is broadly covered by the charges (except for children -W.4m).    A third or more of the population wear glasses.    Nearly everyone who needsglasses has an N.H.S. sight test and the great bulk of them have N.H.S. lenses, butover half prefer to buy frames privately, rather than use the N.H.S. range.    Theoriginal intention was that the N.H.S. eye service should eventually operate fromthe hospitals, the present service through ophthalmic opticians being provided asan interim measure!   but the suitability of the present arrangements as a permanentPart of the N.H.S. was quickly accepted and it has been the intention to formalise thede facto position by amendment of the N.H.S.

This increase has not yet been announced or implemented.59-   Hitherto the nutritional evidence has suggested that the children who arelikely to be nutritionally vulnerable to a rise in the price are among those infamilies with four or more children, or three children under five (an expectantmother is counted for this purpose as a ohild under five).

IV    * 5% DETAILED POSSIBILITIES g ;GENERAL63.   The proposals in this part of the paper relate to:-(a) the hospital services.(b) local authority health and welfare services.(c) training, research and development and other programmes.64.   The Departments aim is to achieve a balance between the pressing need to provide a modern hospital service and, through expenditure on localauthority and central government services, to meet more fully the special needs of the young, the elderly and the handicapped; and in this way help them carry on usefully in the community, without recourse to more expensive hospital services.65. The hospital service the main expenditure would be on the hospital service.   The HealthDepartment&apos;s aims are to increase as repidly as practicable the scale ofexpenditure on hospital building, in order to improve the rate of replacement of (and to reduce wasteful expenditure on patching up) old,inadequate and wrongly sited hospitals; and to match this with a more adequate expenditure on hospital running costs, at the same time doingsomething towards improving standards in older hospitals which will still have to be maintained for a considerable period, even with an acceleratedcapital programme.66. Local authority health and welfare servicesProgress would be made in overtaking the backlog in provision of places in old people&apos;s homes, including replacement of ex-Public AssistanceInstitutions, and places for the mentally disordered.   Substantially morehealth centres would be built.   These proposals come next in importance tothose made for the hospital service;   they are highly important in themselves, but, this apart, by meeting more fully the special needs ofthe elderly and the handioapped, they could be said to achieve by selectiveand economical methods more effective provision for these classes thanunselective cash benefits.
67.   Training, research and development and other services 582Proposals are made in this section to catch up with the opportunitiespresenting themselves for harnessing computers to the health services;to make progress in programmes for the disabled and modern hearing aids;and to step up further training for staff.   In all these fields, thereis a clear recognition that the attention already being paid to securingvalue for money must be maintained and increased, as the results of the many studies now in progress come to fruition.   The needs for economy in manpower are equally clearly recognised and important contributions areexpected from increased automation and intensified research anddevelopment and training programmes.HOSPITAL EXPENDITURECapital (- 27m. -  10m. - addition)68.   Needs.   Section III of the paper explained that it was estimatedthat about 30 per cent of the existing 472,000 hospital beds are over100 years old and that 60 per cent date from the last century.   Theaverage age of a hospital bed today is about 70 years, and the need to provide a network of modern hospitals, well-sited to serve the presentand expected concentrations of population, is regarded as urgent.69.   The present programme.   Section III of the paper explained that about a fifth of the capital expenditure of some  1,000 m. between1966 and 1975 envisaged in the ten year Hospital Plan was required tokeep pace with the increase and shift in population; and that theremainder would mainly be needed to replace or improve existing hospitals.Because capital expenditure between 1938 and about 1955 was minimal andthe backlog of obsolescence so great, this programme will just aboutprevent the average age of hospital beds from increasing, but will mt suffieeto reduce it.70.   Provision for an increased programme is governed by the practicalpossibilities for extending the programme rather than by the need whichwould justify even greater increases.   The bulk of expenditure in any .one year is on schemes in progress, not readily amenable to adjustment.Significant alterations oan be achieved only by adjusting the starts ofnew schemes.   Since expenditure in the year of start (and, for the largerschemes, in the subsequent year) i3 well below the maximum rate, a significant increase in expenditure in a particular year, eg.   1970-71,/would require
would require the starts of many schemes to be advanced by one or two        5 83years.   This would increase expenditure prior to 1970-71 and, because there would be more schemes in progress, in the immediately subsequent year.71.   As a basis for illustration, the 3ame range of possible 1970-71increases as was considered earlier for possible decreases has been chosen.There are an almost infinite number of combinations of value of schemes andperiod of bringing forward of starts that would give the increases to be illustrated.   One combination for each such increase is shown in thefollowing table, in which the balance between major and minor schemesis deliberately weighted in favour of the former, since they are of greater long term value.(See attached Table).72.   This table takes account also of the bringing forward of starts whichwould be necessary after 1970/71, both to avoid a hiatus in the programmeof starts and to prevent a falling off in the levels of expenditurefollowing 1970/71.73.   The effect of these increases on the present planning figuresis as follows: 1967/68        1968/69        1969/70        1970/71 m.  m.  m.  m.Planning figures 85.2 94.3 103.3 112.3Additions (range) - 0-1 5-8 10-27Increased level (range) 85.2 94.3-95 108-111 112-13974.     Since the effect of any increases in the size of the programme would be concentrated on large schemes and not on patching or additional plantreplacement, there would be an increase in the number of new beds andsupportingservices (mainly replacement).75.     As explained in Section III, there is no easy or convenient way(comparable, for example   with &quot;school places&quot;) of expressing the product of this investment.   But using the rough guide of Section III, it wasdeduced that work to be started under the present programme in thefour-year period 1967-68 to 1970-71 represented a notional equivalent of 35-40,000 beds with their supporting facilities.   Applying these arguments to the increases suggested above, it can be deduced that ofthose notional 35-40,000 beds, the following number would have theirstarts brought forward within the period:/Alt ernative

The numbers for which starts would be required to be brought forward for the illustrated increases in 1970-71 is markedly larger than thedeferments shown in Section lUfor equivalent decreases.   The reason isthat a large part of increased expenditure in 1970-71 would have to beachieved by bringing forward major schemes so as to start in 1970-71.Since expenditure on such schemes would be at a comparatively low ratein the year in question, large numbers would be involved.77.    Again, the schemes which would be brought forward have not been identified but the list would comprise large important schemes such asdistrict general hospitals, as well as hospitals for the mentally subnormal,and numerous smaller schemes, e.g. maternity and geriatric units, ofgreat   importance locally.    In some cases, the bringing forward of startswould be publicly obvious, where they represented departures from the published Hospital Plan (which announced &quot;schemes which it is hoped to start&quot; up to 1969/70).

/Itggapjtal- Revenue ( 21b. additien)fQ,    Revenue expenditure en the services provided by Hospital Boards amountsto about half the total of the block in 1967/68.    As shewn in paragraph 84 below,the present animal rate of increase is about  19m; of this nearly two-thirds,or about  12m. is to meet the revenue consequences of capital schemes nowcosing into commission, leaving about  7m., or about 2$ of the total amount available in 1967/68, for all other developments of the services.   In 1970/71, asimilar proportion of the additional sum available (nearly  17m.) would be absorbed by the revenue consequences of presently planned capital schemes,leaving about  10m., or 1)3$ of the total amount available, for non-capitaldevelopments.79.    The 1$ to 1^396 annually available for non-capital developments is rathergreater than the forecast increase in the population as a whole, but the numbersof the elderly and the very young, who contribute significantly to thedemand for hospital treatment, will rise at a considerably higher rate.     Inthe past, this additional burden, together with improvements in the conditions under which treatment is given and the quality of treatment, have beenpossible because of increases in &quot;productivity&quot;.    For example, in the 10 years to 1965, the productivity of staff employed in diagnostic departments(e.g. X-ray and particularly pathology) have as shown in Section III, increased substantially, the average length of stay of patients has been reduced, andthe number of in-patient cases treated a year has risen from about 3.6m. to 4-Sm.without increase in the number of beds, while the cost per in-patient treatedhas fallen in real terms.80.    There are increasing demands on the already strained resources availableto the hospital service.   Waiting lists now include over half a million patients,and the numbers are tending to rise;   it is increasingly difficult to findfunds for the additional cost in a full year of developments begun duringthe previous year, for small qualitative improvements in the standard ofaedical care and the conditions in which it is given;   and at the same timeto undertake significant advances in diagnosis and medical treatment which are becoming available, e.g. cervical cytology screening and intermittent dialysisfor chronic renal failure.    Other costly and life saving developments arealready appearing and may be expected to be used increasingly in the next fewyears, for example, oardiao surgery for the very young, and the prevention ofhaemolytio disease of the newborn, and others for instance in the treatment ofcancer, may well emerge.

In crude terms, the effect of an increase of  15m. in 1970/71 can berepresented as the cost of treating just over 200,000 in-patients in acutehospitals, at the present average cost of just over  70 for each in-patienttreated.   This is in the context of existing waiting lists of over ^m. patients,although lists would not be reduced pro tanto for the reasons already givenin Section III.Reduction of Arrears of Maintenance ( 6m.)8).   In addition to an increase in the regular rate of development, hospitalsneed for a period of years to spend more money on maintenance and replacement of equipment which have been deferred through lack of funds to such an extent that they are seriously in arrears.   The proposal in this section is therefore to add by stages in the three years 1968/69, 1969/70 and 1970/71 further sumsfor this purpose, reaching  6me in 1970/71.   A sum of  6m, would represent anincrease of about one-fifth in the amount (something over  30m.) which might otherwise be devoted to maintenance in 1970/71, but to provide for substantially more than this in a single year might create problems of availability of director outside labour to undertake the work.Hfy,    The path of expenditure would thus be modified as follows:-1967/68    1968/69    1969/70    1970/71    1973/72Present &quot;Basic&quot; 712.5       731.2       753.1       779.5       807.7Percentage Increase p.a. 2^/o 2^/0 j/o 3s$ 35%
66. Throughout, the need to economise on manpower is accepted as animportant consideration to which increased use of automation, e.g. inlaboratories and elsewhere will play an important part, but at no less cost,and emphasis is placed on training to make the best use of available manpower(see paras. 98 to 100 be low).lje. The revenue consequences of bringing forward the starts of capitalschemes would absorb a part of the additions for general developments,the effectdthough the main revenue effect would fall in later years.  For the year 1970/71/(leafing aside the further additions for maintenance) would be that thepresently planned addition in that year of about 1j% which would be devoted tojon-capital developments would be increased to about 1^2*   Other progressionsto achieve an addition of  21m. in 1970/71 are possible, as are other divisions of the  21 m. between maintenance and general development.   But &amp; singleaddition of  15m. to general development in 1970/71 would need to be matched by corresponding additions in subsequent years to enable the new level ofservice reached in 1970/71 to be maintained^ and in later years this additionlight need to be larger if there were a faster hospital building programme, i.e.as its revenue consequences became effective.
LOCAL HEALTH AND WELFARELooal Authority Capital Expenditure ( 8111.addition)87,   The main effects of increased capital expenditure would be topermit the restoration of the development foregone by the two cuts - 7m. in 1966/67 and  3m. in 1967/68 - in the capital expenditure planned for those years (see paragraph 27);   to enable the increasing demand for health centres to be met without reducing the development formerly plannedon, for example, old people&apos;s homes, services for the mentally disorderedand, if the increase were large enough, to accelerate the development ofthese services.   The extent to which the development provided for in the basic forecast will fall short both of need and of what is planned bylocal authorities towards meeting that need is set out in paragraphs 29to 33&apos;     To repeat just one example: 40,000 more places in old people&apos;shomes would still be needed in 1970/71 to give a reasonable minimumratio (20 per 1,000 elderly) and to get rid of ex-Public Assistance Institutii88.   Because local health and welfare capital projects take only abouta year to complete, a decision to increase capital expenditure in,or up to,1970/71 would not necessarily have implications for policy after that year.It would be possible, for example, to provide for a single addition of  8m.in 1970/71, reverting to the basic forecast figure for 1973/72; or preferably(in order to avoid the difficulties of a sudden sharp planning peak) to spend the  8m. over two years, say  3m. in 1969/70 and  5mc in 1970/71.       Thefigures from 1968/69 to 197V72 would then run approximately  35m.,  40m., 44m. and  41m. (basic forecast).   Y/ith a total increase of  8m. it wouldprobably be possible to build say a further 100 centres beyond those provided for in the basic forecast and at the same time to provide some800 additional places in homes for the elderly and 700 more new places in centres and hostels for the mentally disordered.89.   But on the assumption that a decision to increase capital expenditure by  8m. in 1970/71 was part of a longer term decision to devote a greater-proportion of resources to local health and welfare services, it would bedesirable both for effective planning and to give local authorities thenecessary assurance to achieve the right momentum, to build up towards thehigher figure from 1968/69 onwards (1967/68 capital expenditure is alreadydetermined by loan sanctions given in 1966/67) say  2m. in 1968/69 and/ 5m, in
 5m. in 1969/70.   The additional  8m. in 197Q/71 might be continued- not necessarily increased - in 1971/72.   On this basis, the run ofcapital expenditure from 1968/69 to 1973/72 would be approximatelyM2*, 37m.,/ 47m. and  49m.90.   With such a progression, real inroads could be made into theunmet needs.   It would, for example, be possible by 1971/72 to provide -in addition to the provision in the basic forecast - some 4,000 newplaces in old people&apos;s homes, some 3,000 new places in adult centres and 1,000 places in hostels for the mentally disordered, as well assay 100 extra centres for the physically handicapped; and to make a start on providing proper residential care and treatment for epileptics.The extra places for old people would bring the ratio per thousandpopulation over 65 to about 17*5, after allowing for replacement of another 1,500 places in ex-public assistance institutions.   The minimumreasonable target of 20 places per thousand over 65, after replacingall ex-public assistance accommodation (see paragraph 33) might beattainable in a further six years or so, provided that capital were allowed to continue to grow at  2m. to  3m. a year over that period;but unmet need for services for the mentally disordered and for thehandicapped would still persist for some years.
T/iflAL AUTHORITY REVENUE EXPENDITURE ( 4m. addition) 5 9191.    An increase in total local authority revenue expenditure on local health and welfare servioes cannot be ensured under present arrangeaents for localauthority expenditure generally just as a reduction cannot be enforced).Butif the Department were given authority for very positive enoeurageaent to localauthorities to channel more resources to these services a swifter developmentthan the 71- per annum assumed in the basic forecast might well be achieved.     Itwould not bo realistic to contemplate that such acceleration eould be confined to a single year;   the aim might be an increase, over the basic forecast, of  2m.in 1969/70,  4m. in 1970/71 and  6m. in 1971/72.    This would bring the totalexpenditure figures up to  206.8m,  223.4m. and  241.2m., increasing the totalgrowth rats for the 3 years to about 8$ per annum.92.    Inoreased capital expenditure as proposed in paragraph 39 would itselfcarry revenue implications, for instance the additional 4,000 places in homesfer the elderly would cost of the order of about  l m. per annum more by 1972/73(though it does not fellow that these revenue consequences could net boaccommodated within the basic forecast by some deceleration under ether revenueheads).    Per the rest the Department would look to the authorities fer anincrease in revenue expenditure to accelerate the development of all theirexisting services, especially the welfare services for the elderly living athome, through a more intensive search for those in need and the meeting efneeds when discovered.   A topical example of other fields in which it may benecessary to meet needs is large scale vaccination against measles. One particularobjective would be a more rapid build up of family planning services.93.    The additional call on staff would depend on the mix of the new programmes.Bat in very broad terms an additional  4 million revenue expenditure might boassociated with an increase of the order of 4*000 staff.    If past experience is any guide the general shortage of manpower expeoted over the next few years wouldnet prevent such further expansion.   The local health and welfare servicesappear to bo particularly attractive to married women (many of them trained)vhe can work part-time.    The new developments in welfare services for the elderly and in family planning should bo able to rely extensively emvoluntary helpers.
TRANSPORT FOR THE DISABLED ( 6 million addition)94.   Having received the report of the interdepartmental committee on Vehicles for the Disabled the Minister of Healthannounced on 15th February, 1967 that the making available ofsmall cars (instead of tricycles) to three further small groups of the disabled would be started this year.   , At the same time he announced that, under statutory powers which he intended to seek, the intention was to take a substantial step forward assoon as practicable in making cars available to the other groupsregarded as next in priority.95.   The estimated provision assumes (a) the continuation ofsupply of cars in 1968/69 to the three small groups mentionedin the Minister1s Statement and (b) the implementation in1969/70 and subsequent years of an extended programme basedon the recommendations made by the Interdepartmental Committeeon Vehicles for the Disabled and under statutory powers (to beobtained in the i-liscellaneous Health Services Bill).     Thecapital costs according to the latest forecasts of the rateof possible progress of supply, taking account of likelyresources, are in respect of about 800 cars in 1968/69;i+,000 cars in 1969/70;    12,000 cars in 1970/71;    and 10,000cars in 1971/72;    allowing also for the maintenance costsinvolved, the expenditure would be  0.5 million for 1968/69; 2 million for 1969/70 and  6 million for the two following years, leading to completion of the full programme in later years at a somewhat higher rate.     This rate of expenditure would be reduced if Ministers were to decide that soaecharges should be levied for the supply of cars.     This is outside the scope of this paper, but is a matter being examined interdepartmentally following the recent discussion in the Ministerial Committee on Social Sendees./HEARING AIDS
HEARING AIDS ( 3 million addition)96.   Demand is growing for the provision of a modern head-wornhearing aid to replace the present obsolete N.H.S. aid.     Therate at which provision could be made is dependent on progressin design (on which a start is being made in accordance with theMinister&apos;s recent Statement), on solving problems likely to arise in large-scale production of an aid of this type, and onthe assessment of the results of the experimental issue of theseaids to children of school age.     There is accordinglyconsiderable difficulty in forecasting how soon a substantialstart could be made to a main programme of providing these modernhead-worn aids both to new patients and to the users of body-worninstruments;   the estimated expenditure of  .3 million a year for1970/71 and 1971/72 would be followed by completion of the full programme over perhaps another 2-3 years (the numbers neededbeing assessed as about 700,000 in all at a capital cost of 12 million).     As in the case of vehicles for the disabled, this rate of expenditure would be reduced if Ministers decided thatcharges should be made for these modern hearing aids.SPECTACLE FRAMES ( 1 million addition)97.   The present range of I\T.H.S. frames is no longer generallysocially acceptable.     Press and other public comment isunrelievedly critical;   and two spectacle wearers out of everythree reject N.H.S. frames in favour of private ones.     It isproposed to bring the N.H.S. range more up-to-date by theinclusion of two or three frames of modem but well-establishedpattern, such as a library or semi-library frame and one or moreduo-tone (two colour) frames.     The full cost of the new frameswill be borne by patients (except in cases of financial hardship)while the optical charges remain.     But in every case in which thenew N.H.S. frames replaced private ones the optician would get an extra 5/- dispensing fee;   and if the new frames were generally acceptable the cost to the Exchequer of this might risetowards  1 million.     If charges to patients were increased to/cover
cover the full cost of dispensing - a possibility outside thescope of this paper - new frames could be introduced withoutincreased cost to the Exchequer.RESULTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ( 5 million addition)98.   It is important to the balanced development of the health and welfare services that considerable progress is made in(a) automation,  (b) use of computers, and (c) research anddevelopment of medical supplies and equipment.     It can alreadybe seen that investment over the next few years in testing andapplying automation to hospital procedures (e.g., patientmonitoring, pathology work and the handling of stores, drugs,and documents) would enable more efficient use to be made ofthe limited manpower and would reduce the demands of thehospital service for additional staff to deal with increasedwork load.     The Ministry are now beginning to see how computerscould be used in the N.H.3. as a whole and the possibilities are far-ranging, including advances in the field of preventivemedicine.     Most of the potential computer applications are as yet unproven, but a period of development work is starting,based on a small number of projects, to provide a practicalbasis for eventual expansion of computer service.     Constrainton funds and the scarcity of qualified people have probablydelayed progress of both automation and use of computers, butthere is a need to broaden the developmental programme *quickly so that the health services catch up at least by 1970.Substantial results in the production and use of medical supplieand equipment are expected to follow from R. and D. work,carried out by the iVJinistry and other staff.     The rapid growth of technology, particularly in the field of electronics, has produced many actual and potential applications to medicalequipment.     This tendency seems certain to continue, and therewill be a growing need for feasibility studies and other formsof research and development on equipment of many kinds.     The/working
working relationship recently established with A.W.H.E. willbe of assistance here.TRAINING [ih million addition)99.   The need for the best use of available manpower is centralto the development of the health and welfare services, and theneeds for further training range over the whole field.Comprehensive proposals for the management training ofadministrators have been made by the National Staff Committee,and are in hand for supervisory staff in general ( 0.25 million)The Government has accepted the recommendations for organisedtraining for nurses made by the Salmon Committee ( 0.9 million).Particular emphasis is being placed on postgraduate medical education, to keep g.ps up-to-date by attending refreshercourses and medical centres, and to enable hospital doctors byorganised improvements in study leave to develop skills intheir chosen specialties ( 2.5 million).     The National board for Prices and Incomes has recommended the training of more work study experts to improve the development and pay structure of ancillary workers in the N.H-.S. ( 0.05 million), and rapiddevelopments in the training of ancillary workers themselves are needed ( 0.4 million).     More should be done in the service for the whole range of professional and technical staff, suchas medical laboratory technicians ( 0.5 million), engineers,social workers and dental technicians ( 0.5 million).     Thereis a need for the training of more nurse teaching staff, toreduce the failure rate in examinations and wastage in training,and thus produce more trained nurses from the same number of recruits ( 0.2 million).100.     Bearing in mind the time required to organise and to assemble the resources for this programme, these requirements( 5.3 million in a full year) are not likely to be met until after 1970/71, and the provision for that year has accordingly been limited to SM million.

III, - lift DETAILED POSSIBILITIESHOSPITAL SXPEHDITUPJSCapital (- 0.8m. -  3m. saving)6.    The current programme and the background of need:   It is estimated that about 12 per cent, of the existing 63,000 hospital beds are over 100 years oldand that about 50 per cent, date from the last century.     The mean-age of a hospital bed in Scotland is about 65 years.     It is acknowledged that a consid-erable part of present hospital accommodation is inadequate for the practice of modern medicine.     The Review of the Hospital Plan for Scotland, published inFebruary, 1966, provisionally assumed a capital expenditure of about  60m. inthe quinquennium 1966-67 to 1970-71,     During the five years the main emphasisof hospital building will be on improving the provision of beds for geriatriccare, in providing improved hospital maternity services, in starting new district general hospitals to permit the reorganisation of general hospital services incertain areas, and to start the redevelopment of the existing major teaching hospitals.     Given the minimal level of capital expenditure between 1938 and about 1955 and the very large backlog of obsolescence, this programme wouldjust about keep pace with the passage of time, but no more.7.   Tho present planning figures for capital expenditure (buildings, equipment and fees) for N.H.S. hospitals are as follows1967^68     1968-69     1969r70    I9.70r7l m.  m.  u.  m.12.4 13.3 14.0 14.98.    Over the period 1967-68 to 1970-71, the current programme would entail the start of some 30 major schemes with a total value gi*eater than  60m.;    inaddition, over  14m. would be allocated to Regional Boards for their ordinarybuilding programmes.9.    Table A illustrates ways in which i-eduotions in capital expenditure couldbe made, disturbing  is little as possible the building programme and olinicadpriorities, while minimising so far as possible abortive expenditure.     The effectof these reductions on the present planning figures shown in paragraph 7 is asfollows:-

It would not be practicable to defer any patching up or plant replacementschemes.    Reductions in the size of the main programme would thus be almostentirely at the expense of major schemes providing new beds (either additionalor replacement).     The present programme envisages the start of over 5?800 beds in the four-year period 1967-68 to 1970-71.     The number of beds affected by thevarious capital reductions is as follows :-AlternativeANumber of bedsAlternative AlternativeB CSchemes (starting 1970-71) deferredbeyond 1970-71Schemes deferred by one year within four year period, up to 1970-71(but still starting before end of 1970-71)800&quot;800&quot;9001,000179001,0002,3001730011.    While the schemes which would be deferred have not been finally identified,it is clear that deferment would affect the new general hospitals to be built atGreenock, Inverness, Airdrie and North Ayrshire;   redevelopment at Glasgow andAberdeen Royal Infirmaries;    and also possibly new maternity units at Dunfermlineand the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.     Provisional starting dates for thes-e-schemes have been agreed with Regional Boards for planning purposes, and most ifnot all of thai) ha.ve become public, in some cases in answer to parliamentary questions.All the schemes are included in the Review of the Hospital Plan which clearlyindicates that it is hoped to start them in the period up to 1970-71.     Anydeferments would inevitably become public knowledge.

Revenue ( 1.4m. saving)12.    The present forecasts of revenue expenditure on hospital services are asfollows:ISiZriS    ^t^2    1969-70    Jl^o 7i    1971^72 000  000  000  000  000Forecasts 91.911        95.011        98.340       101.735      105.484Percentage rateof growth 3.5?o 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5%This rate of growth represents just over  3m. per annum of which almost exactlya half is required to meet the revenue consequences of capital schemes in 1967-68,1968-69 and 1969-70.     In 1970-71 rather more than half, or nearly  2m., might beavailable for developments other than the revenue consequences of capital projectsbut, on the present basis of a flat rate of growth, a substantial part of this figure would have to be carried forward into 1971-72 to meet the exceptionally high cost of capital projects foreseen in that year.     In 1971-72, when thegrowth figure reaches nearly  3.6m., from 75 to 85 per cent, spoms likely to berequired for capital projects because of a peak in new projects coming intocommission.13,     In Scottish hospitals the average length of stay has reduced in the years from 1960-65 by 20 per cent, in medical departments and 7 per cant, in surgicaldepartments (comparable figures are not available before i960).     In the ten-year period from 1955 to 1965 the number of staffed beds has actually fallenslightly;    discharges and deaths i.e. the number of patients treated, has risen from 0.49m. to 0.637m. or by about 29 per cent, in the same period.     Theaverage cost of treating a patient in an acute non-teaching hospital has fallen by about 10 per cent, in real terms between 1957-58 and 1965-66.14.     The 1967-68 expenditure at  92m- was made up of  66.9m. for salaries and wages and  25.1m. for supplies and services.     On existing forecasts, manpower in the Scottish hospital service is expected to increase from 71,000 in 1967-68to 76,500 &quot;by April, 1971;    the nursing staff included in these figures will increase from 34,000 to 37,000.15.     Reduction:     A cumulative reduction of  1.4m. by 1970-71 would representthe cost of some 1,780 nurses or 59 per cent, of the total increase referred toin the preceding paragraphs.     Alternatively, it corresponds to a reduction ofabout a third in the present level of expenditure on the maintenance of buildings,plant /
plant and grounds v/hich in 1967-68 is running at  4.2m.     The reduction of  1.4m.by 1970-71 would require the rate of growth to be cut back to 3 per cent -significantly below the 1967-68 level of 3i&quot; Pe^ cent., and the cut would be worth, on average,  450,000 in each of the three years of the period.id,    A reduction of this size would probably result in a general restriction on the growth of the service and on the steady pattern of improvement which hasbeen achieved in recent years.     The slowing down of the rate of capitalexpenditure and the postponement of certain capital projects would not affectthe money required for the revenue consequences of capital projects in theperiod up to 1970-71 because the schemes involved in the postponement are notthose v/hich would have been commissioned in this period.     Certain developments,such as the increasing use of laboratory services, X-ray facilities, etc., thechangeover to the use of disposables and the adoption of new and improvedprocedures (sterile packs etc,.,), are not susceptible to the same positivecontrol by hospital authorities as, for example, additional staff,  so that forsuoh purposes a proportion of the development money becomes virtually a firstcommitment each year.     Restriction of the growth rate would mean that the items which eire most easily controlled would be those likely to suffer, e.g.,improvements in staffing levels, the introduction of good management techniquessuoh as planned preventive maintenance, the maintenance of buildings and the renewal of furniture and equipment. .,,17.     The cumulative reductions have been based on the restriction of the growth rate to 3 per cent, throughout the period and the resulting pattern ofexpenditure, compared with the present forecasts, is shown below.	1967-68	1968-^69	1.96.9-70	1970-71	1921^72Present Basic	91.9	95.0	98.3	101.8	105 ,.5Percentage increase per annum		3,5&quot;.......	. 3.5%	3-51.	..... 3.5?;Reductions - Annual	-	.42	.48	.5	.5Cumulative	-	.42	.90	......   1.4 ....	1.9Reduced level	91.9	94.58	97.4	100.4	103.6Percentage increase per annum	3&amp;	3%	3%	3%	3%It would be extremely undesirable to impose the whole of the cut in the lastyear of the period i.e., 1970-71, since this would represent a very markedreversal /
reversal of the steady rate of progress which the 3-  per cent, growth has alreadyenabled the hospital service to achieve in 1966-67 arid 1967-68;    a continuation of tliis rate for a. further two years would, in itself, create a climate ofsteady improvement which by 1970-71 would be difficult to change.     On presentforecasts, 1970-71 would require rather less for capital projects than thepreceding or subsequent years so that, at first sight, other developments wouldnot suffer so greatly in that year if a cut were imposed;   even with theincreased amount available, however, a cut of  1.4m. imposed in that year wouldmean a drop from about  1.6m. for developments other than capital in 1969-70 to 0.6m. in 1970-71.18.    The table in paragraph 17 carries forward into 1971-72 the projection and increases the cumulative reduction by that year to  1.9m.     The cut of  0.5m. inthat year would mean that only the capital projects,  as forecast at present,could be financed within the total, leaving virtually nothing for otherdevelopments.     In order to provide for hew capital developments in that yearand to avoid leaving new buildings unopened, it would be necessary to use someof the money in the previous year for nou-recurring items such as maintenance;tut this would be made more difficult by the reduction already imposed in theearlier years.JjgALTH CEKT?.E319.    The bulk of health centre building in Scotland is being carried out as a central programme by the Scottish Home and Health Department, supplemented tosome extent by the provision of a smaller number of health centres by localauthorities under delegated powers.     Capital expenditure on the centralprogramme, as included in the PESO basic programme revalued is expected to ..rise^ ;from  .16m. in 1967/68 to over  .5m. In 1970/71.     6 centres are at present under construction under the central programme and in view of the pressing need to make progress with further development of centres in Scotland no reductionin the basic programme id. proposed.     The effects of a reduction of the health and welfare capital programme of local authorities could be expected to affecttheir health centre provision,  and this is discussed in paras. 20-22.
LOCAL HEALTH AND WELFARECapital ( 0.25m. saving)20.    In 1967/68 the allocation of local authority capital expenditure is:- m.(l)   Health centres provided by local authorities under delegated powers 0.1(2)   Centres for mentally handicapped 0,2(3)   Homes for the elderly (and the physically handicapped) 0.7(4)   Other items, e.g., clinics end. day nurseries 0,31.3The total reflects a reduction of  .1m, in the expenditure planned for1967/68 before the cuts announced in July, 1966, and is still appreciably short of the local authority forecasts for the year.     The &quot;basic&quot; forecast forI970/7I is  1,5m.KggM^JIgj3.tres:     As already indicated, in Scotland., the major part of the health centre building programme is being carried out directly by the scottish home and. Health Department.     Health centres provided by local authorities areonly just beginning to be accepted by general practitioners and many proposalssre now coming forward from authorities.     In 1967/68, work is expected to start on four centres, and by 1971 possibly 15, costing  40,000 to  50,000 eachwill have been completed. i1^^^j^mc^jf^r^the,mentallj^handioajffpj^t   At the present planned rate ofexpenditure the number of places in junior occupation centres would increase from 420 at present to about 700 in 1971, in senior occupation centres from ,030 to about 2,650 and in hostels from 100 to 180.     Present plans would allow places per thousand of population to rise by 1971 from 0.08 to 0.13 forjunior occupation centres,  0.39 to 0.51 for senior occupation centres and 0.02to 0.03 per cent, for hostels.     This is not a high rate of expansion in a service which is comparatively new and in which local authorities have considerable leeway to make up.     Reduction in the present proposed rate of growth would mean continuing hospital care for some at greater cost.Old people&apos;s home3 and welfare services:   These services are grouped together for capital expenditure purposes, the major element being expenditure on old people&apos;s homes.     In Scotland,  separate homes have not so far been provided for young /

This represents 23 places per1,000 of the population aged over 65 years.     Local authority homes aloneprovide 7,639 of these places (representing under 14 places per thousand of thepopulation age-group).     The present planned rate of capital expenditure, whichvisualises ah annual increase of 200 places, will at most maintain the presentratio (itself little more than minimal) , talcing into account the expected increase in the olderly population by 1971.     This takes no account of proposalsfor replacement during the next few years of obsolete premises provided underthe old poor law.     A start has already been made on one such major project atForesthall, Glasgow, at present accommodating over 400 elderly residents, and plans have already been received for further stages of replacement costing-over  .5m.22.     In Scotland, the present planned investment programme rises from only 1.3m. to  1.5m. between 1967/68 and 1970/71.     A cut of  0.25m. would be the equivalent of cancelling about 17 per cent, of the planned programme for thatyear, reducing the 1970/71 investment level to below the 1967/68 figure.     A cut of this kind would be likely to fall most heavily on provision of homes for the elderly, and as a result of the population increase- in this age group wouldresult in a fall in the current ratio of places provided for old people.Applied across the board, it would mean perhaps 2-3 fewer health centres,150 fewer places in occupation centres and 130 fewer places in old people&apos;shomes.Revenue ( .25 saving)23.

17 4 5% DETAILED POSSIBILITIESGENERAL31.   The proposals in this part of the paper relate tos-(a) the hospital services;(h) health centres;(c) local authority health and welfare servicesp(d) training,research and development.32,   The Department&apos;s aim is to achieve a &quot;balance between the pressingneed to provide a modern hospital service and, through expenditure on local authority and central government services, to meet more fully the special needs of the young, the elderly and the handicapped; andto afford help to these groups wherever possible within thecommunity, without recourse to more expensive hospital services.The hospital service33.   The main expenditure necessarily lies here, the aim being toincrease as rapidly as possible the scale of hospital rebuilding inorder to improve the provision for geriatric and maternity care, andto replace old, inadequate and wrongly sited hospitals.Health centres34-     The start made in the provision, of health centres needs to be accelerated and expanded, both through the Department&apos;s central programme and by local authority provision under delegated powers.Local authority health and welfare services35*     Progress would be made in overtaking the shortage of places in old people&apos;s homes, including replacement of obsolete institutions, and places for the mentally disordered.     Limited additional expenditure would alsobe incurred as a result of the reorganisation of social work services inScotland, as outlined in the White Paper on &quot;Social Work and the Community&quot;(Cmnd. 3065).     Both sets of proposals are highly important in themselves as being designed to achieve by selective and economical methods more/effective
effective provision for the elderly and the handicapped;than either hyhospital or residential care or unselective cash benefits.HOSPITAL EKPLIEDITUHSCapital ( 4.1m. -  1.4m. - addition)36.     Needs;   Section III explained that it was estimated that about12 per cent of the existing- 63,000 hospital beds in Scotland are over 100years old and that about 50 per cent date from the last century.     There isan urgent need to replace these by a network of modern hospitals, well-sitedto serve present-day concentrations of population.37-     The present programmes    the present programme provisionally assumescapital expenditure of some  60m. in the quinquennium 1966/67 to 1970/71,directed to improved provision of beds for geriatric care, improved hospitalmaternity services and to starting new district general hospitals andredevelopment of existing major teaching hospitals.     Provision for anincreased programme is governed by the practical possibilities for extending the programme rather than by the need which would justifygreater increases.38.   The first call on any increased allocation must be to maintain and ifpossible advance the construction of schemes which are at present being planned to start in the period up to 1970/71&apos;     These are the schemes ofhighest priority at present.     It would be possible to advance the start of several major schemes by one or even two years against the dates thatwill be fea-sible in. financial terms unde.r the present programme, and toincrease to some extent the number of minor schemes undertaken.     Table Bshows as a basis of illustration the same range of possible 1970-71increases as was considered earlier for possible decreases!    the balanceproposed between major and minor schemes is deliberately weighted in favourof the former since they are of greater long term value.     Table B alsoshows the additional allocations which would be needed in 1971/72, both toavoid a hiatus in the programme of starting dates and to prevent a falling/ off
off in the level of expenditure following 1970/71.39&apos; The effect of these increases on the present planning figures is asfollows?	1967/68	1968/69  m.	1969/70  m.	1970/71  m.Planning figures	12.4	13.3	14.0	14.9Additions	-		1.0	1.4 to 4.1Increased level	12.4	13.3.	15-0	16.3 to 19.0Since the effect of any increase in the size of the programme would heconcentrated mainly on large schemes, there would be some increase in thenumber of new beds and supporting services (mainly replacement).40.

But the followingtable gives a notional guide to the number of beds and their supportingfacilities that would be affected by the various alternatives.Alternative D      Alternative E      Alternative Pstart advanced to 1970/71 3,400 3,100 1,000start advanced to within four year period upto 1970/71 300 300 3003,700 3,400 1*300The schemes which would bo advanced have not been finally identifiedbut the list would comprise large important schemes such as the district general hospitals which have baen deferred from earlier Hospital plans and which it is hoped to start in the period 1971/72 to 1975/76 (e.g. those at Paisley, Southern Ayrshire, and West Lothian) further work at the majorteaching hospitals, and schemes designed to upgrade and reduce overcrowdingin mental hospitals, together with schemes to improve the basic hospital services.41.   Some of the schemes which could be accelerated are not included in the review of the Hospital Plan for Scotland published in 1966, and accordinglyany advancement which would bring them into the period up to 1970/71 wouldbe publicly obvious.     Some are listed schemes whose provisional startingdates cannot be maintained under the present programme.

(b) Hospital Revenue ( 1.5m. additional expenditure)42.     The present annual rate of growth (3-5 per cent) is just over  3m. perannum rising to nearly  3.5m. in 1970/71.     In 1967/68, 1968/69 and 1969/7Oabout half is required to meet the revenue consequences of capital schemes,leaving about  1.5m. or 1.75 per cent of the total, available fox- otherdevelopments of the service.     In 1970/71 about 40&apos;per cent will be absorbed by the revenue consequences of capital projects leaving about 2m. or 2.1 per cent for non-capital developments.43.   The growth of 1.75 per cent to 2.1 per cent annually for non-capitaldevelopments is substantially higher than the forecast increase in popula-tion.     The trend of the load on the hospital service and of the cost of treating patients has already been described in the paragraphs dealing with possible savings, and although existing resources have dealt, with greaternumbers of patients, it is unlikely that it will be possible to continue toincrease productivity to meet tlip expected increased demand.44.    vThile the full effect of the 3.5 per cent rate of growth available fax-Scottish hospitals may not yet have become fully evident, the hospital authorities are still conscious of many improvements required in theexisting services and of their inability to develop some new techniquesor treatments as quickly as they would wish because resources are notavailable.     An increase in the rate of growth to 4 per cent by 1970/71would, therefore, relieve some of these pressures 1    it would require an addition of  0.75m. accumulative by 1970/71 over the basic P.E.S.C. figures which would be achieved by  0,25m. in 1969/70 and a further  0.5m. in1970/71.45*   As stated above in relation to general developments, it is not yet known what easement the present 3.5 per cent growth rate-will provide in.thelevel of expenditure on the maintenance of buildings and the replacement of equipment, but a further  0.75m. could profitably be used by the service onthis category of expenditure by 1970/71./The

Although revenue consequences of capital projects might require slightly-more than is provided in the basic P.E.S.C. forecasts if the rate of capitalexpenditure is increased, the effect is not likely to be significant sincethe increased capital would be used to bring forward starts rather than to speed up existing projects which might be commissioned by 1970/71-   Porpresent purposes, therefore, the effect in the year 1970/71 (leaving aside the further additions for maintenance) would be that the level of 2.1$ fornon-capital developments contained in the basic 3.5$ growth rate would beincreased to about 2.6$ or  2.5m.   The table in paragraph 45 projects the/higher
higher growth rate forward into 1971/72 and the extra 0.5$ would help to contain the high cost of revenue consequences of capital projects foreseenfor that year without depressing overmuch the percentage available for non-capital developments;    otherwise a substantial proportion of the 2.6$ in1970/71 would have to be used for non-recvtrring expendittire so that it couldbe carried forward into 1971/72 to help to maintain the level of non-capitaldevelopments.47. Other progressions or a different division between general developments and maintenance could be considered, but it is important that there should bea reasonable assurance of any increase agreed up to 1970/7$? especially forgeneral development, continuing into later years in order to give hospital authorities a sound basis for planning and maintaining development of theservice at the new level.48. Health Centres ( .4m - addition)As explained in section III the Scottish central health centre building programme presently provides for capital expenditure rising from  .16m. in1967/68 to  .55ra. in 1970/71.   In view of the pressing need to accelerate andexpand the programme,, on which a limited start has now been made, theprogramme could usefully be augmented to the extent indicated in the followingprogressions1968/69        1969/70 1970/71     1971/72 a. capital .1 .2 .3 .2revenue - .05 .1 .local HEALTH AID WELFARELocal authority capital expenditure ( .6m. - addition)49.   The main effects of an increase of this order would be to enable the increasing demand for health centres (in so far as provided by local authoritieto he met without curtailing the development planned for old people&apos;s homes,/and
and to make provision for part of such capital expenditure as is initially-likely to arise in 1970/71 consequent on the re-organisation of social workservices in Scotland on the lines set out in the White Paper on &quot;Social Workand the Community&quot; (Cmnd. 3065).50. In order to avoid a very sharp planning peak, a total increase of  0.6m.by 1970/71 could be spread progressively over the years 1968/69 to 1971/72 byincrements of  0.1m.,  0.2m.,  0.3m., and  0.4m. (the higher figures in the two latter years partly reflecting the effects of social work reorganisation).This would permit the provision of 2-3 more health centres by localauthorities and perhaps some 500 extra places in old people&apos;s homes as wellas 50-80 places in centres and hostels for the mentally disordered and thenaladjusted - without, however, making any appreciable inroad in replacingobsolete premises.51.   The latter could only be achieved on tho aJsoiyapti on of a loxjyex---termdecision to devote a greater proportion of resources to local health and welfare services, thereby giving local authorities the necessary assurance to achieve sustained momentum.   On that basis, a higher figure could be built up from 1968/69 onwards by annual progressions of .fi0.?m., SO.4m., and  0.6m., up to1970/71, with a continuation of the latter figures in 1971/72.   As well asenabling very substantial progress in the replacement of obsolete premises, itwould, for old people&apos;s homes, be likely to secure the Scottish target of 25places per thousand of population over the age.of 65;   and to fulfil asubstantial part of the unmet need for assessment and residential facilitiesfor the mentally disordered, the handicapped and the maladjusted.Local authority revenue expenditure ( 0.5m.)52.   About  .4m. is likely to be required in 1970/71 as part of the welfareservice contribution towards additional expenditure in that year directlyattributable to the effects of social work reorganisation in Scotland.   Bearing
in nind the revenue consequences of capital expenditure discussed in thepreceding paragraphs, and the desirability of developing existing sowingsfor care of the elderly living at home, it is feonsidered that the Scottishbasic forecast could usefully be increased in the following progression - .3a. in 1969/70,  .5m. in 1970/71 and  .6m. in 197l/?2, thus increasing thetotal growth rate for the three years to about f-Q^fo.TRANSPORT FOR THE DISABLED   ( .6m - addition)53.   The proposals, announced in the Ministerial statement of 15th February,1967 for making available small cars to three further small groups of the disabled, and (subject to legislation) subsequently to other prioritygroups, would provide for the supply in Scotland of 80 cars in 196e/69,400 in 1969/70, 1,200 in 1970/71 and 1,000 in 1971/72.   Allowing fornaintenanco costs, expenditure won Id h* f.&apos;.05iTt. in -f 968/69$    .2m. in 1969/YOand  .6m. for the following two years.HEARING AIDS ( 0.3m. - addition)54.   A programme for replacement of the present obsolete N.H.S. hearing aidby a modern head-worn hearing aid would in Scotland be likely to cost  0.era. ayear in 1970/71 and 1971/72.SPECTACLE FRAMES ( 0.1m. - addition)55.   The inclusion in the N.H.S. range of spectacle frames of 2 or 3 newframes of modern design would in Scotland be likely-to result in increased cost to the Exchequer (in dispensing fees ami n slight increase in the use ofthe service), estimated at  .05m. in 1968/69 and  0.1m. a year thereafter.RESEARCH AMD DEVELOEMEMT ( .5m. - addition)56.   It is equally important for the balanced development of the health and welfare services in Scotland that progi-ess should be made in automation, theuse of computers and research and development of medical supplies andequipment, and that the Scottish set-vice should equally benefit by direct
participation and association in practicability studies and other forms of research.TRAINING ( .4m. - addition)57.   There is equally in Scotland a need for further training ranges over thewhole field.   Implementation of the Salmon Committee recommendations fororganised training of nurses is likely to cost of  .1m. in Scotland, whileproposals for management training of administrators as recommended by theNational Staff Committees   ^or supervisory staff generally;    and fer post-graduate medical education, for G.P.s and hospital doctors, are likely to involve a further  .3m.   Improvements in the training facilities forancillary workers and for professional and technical staff could absorb afurther  .1m.   These developments together would be likely to cost  .5m. ina full year, but bearing in mind the time necessary to organise and assembleresources for such a programme the provision for 1970/71 has been limited
