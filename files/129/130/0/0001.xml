Subsequently theForeign Secretary consulted Australia, New Zealand and theUnited States in Washington in April, and I had discussions withSingapore and Malaysia later in the same month.Outcome of Consultations2.       Our allies have made it plain that they would be opposed to ourdeciding now to withdraw from Singapore and Malaysia in the mid-1970s,and even more strongly opposed to our announcing this intention whenthe Defence Expenditure Studies are completed in July.    All fiveGovernments maintain that this would seriously impair the political stability of the area. &quot;*3.      Singapore, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, consider thafcs ifwe were to announce withdrawal as a long term objective, this would destroy commercial confidence and gravely damage their economicpositionj  this could lead to the fall of the present regime in singapore and to a situation in which the orderly withdrawal of our forces becameimpossible, combining the worst features of our experience over aden and Malta.    There are still some 70, 000 Servicemen, women andchildren in Singapore cn an island about the size of the Isle of Wight,widely dispersed among two million Asians of mixed race v/ith a historyof civil disorder!  some 100f 000 Asian men, women and children areeconomically dependent on their presence,    British aid per head in singapore is 6s 8d per annum compared with  18 in Malta.    If we wishfor an orderly withdrawal, we have therefore a strong interest in thesurvival of a regime which is prepared to co-operate with us in phasingthe withdrawal so as to cause minimum disturbance.(97294)
4.      Australia and New Zealand attach importance to the Singapore/Malaysia base as an essential element in their forward defence;  they regard it as a unique contribution to stability which could not be adequately made by any other means.    The United States urge that?while the Vietnam war continues, we should not decide to withdrawaltogether;  they have made it clear that they would not take over anycommitments which we thereby renounced.5.      As to the shorter term, both Singapore and Malaysia v/ill beprepared to see a reduction of about half in our forces there by1970-71 (subject to detailed discussions particularly about timing),provided they can be reassured about our continuing stake in the stability of the area.    The United States understands the reasons forour proposed reductions, and it seems likely that Australia andNew Zealand can be brought to accept them.    But their co-operationdepends critically on what we decide about the long term and on what we say about our intentions in public.6.      Until the outcome of the Defence Expenditure Studies is available at the beginning of next month, we cannot reach decisions on the size, shape and deployment of our forces in the mid-70s, nor can we decide the scope of what we shall wish to announce in July.    Butit is also clear that we cannot complete the current studies, norconsult our allies any further, without deciding in principle whether insuch consultations we may offer to maintain seme military capabilityin the Far East after we have withdrawn from our bases on the mainland.    The Foreign Secretary has already reported to the Cabinet(CC(67) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3) how much more difficult thefirst round of consultation had been made by an inability to say that wewould maintain a continuing military capability for use in the Far Eastafter we had left the mainland of South East Asia.    This applied just as strongly to my discussions with Singapore and Malaysia.7.       The Prime Minister will be seeing President Johnson early inJune.    In the same month there will be further Ministerial discussions with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.    If we are to achieve our objective of smooth and rapid progress towards the plannedsavings over the next few years, it is essential to decide now whether,in the course of these discussions, we are, prepared to indicate that we might be willing to maintain a continuing capability for use in the far east after 1975-76.    Moreover, as paragraph 3 shows, an announcement about this might be of crucial importance to our plans.    If we should find it necessary to decide to announce our intention of leaving our bases in Singapore/Malaysia by. the mid-70s, a simultaneous statement abouta continuing capability thereafter might be essential to prevent animmediate breakdown of confidence in the area, with dangerous and costly consequences for our own rundown.A continuing military capability for use in the Far East8.       The full costing of the Defence Expenditure Studies has not -yetbeen completed.    We cannot, therefore, define precisely what it would cost us to maintain, after we have left our mainland bases inSouth-East Asia, some form of military capability for possible use inthe Far East.    But, as a result of the work already done, I am confident that we should be able to afford a useful capability within a defence budget limited to  1, 800 million (1964 prices) in 1975-76, and that itsincremental cost will not be large.mm c*t**
9,      Whatever our future policy in South-East Asia, we cannotdiscard the military capability required to fulfil other potentialobligations outside Europe,    Looking to the period beyond the mid-70s.,we cannot count on being rid of all our existing constitutionalresponsibilities  or the external defence and internal security of Fiji,Hong Kong and other dependencies in the Pacific.    We have promisedMauritius a defence agreement when she becomes independent? and wehave accepted responsibility for the external defence of, for example,the associated states in the Caribbean.    In parts of Africa we mighthave to protect British lives if they were threatened by disorder.    Wehave a moral obligation to give help, if needed, to Australia andNew Zealand,    Moieover, in South-East Asia itself, we have formaltreaty obligations to countries such as Malaysia, and to the members ofthe South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO), which can be terminated only by negotiations - although we can seek to change our commitments to meet these obligations with changes in our capability.10.      Whatever progress we may expect to make in obtaining release from our major formal commitments outside Europe, it would bedifficult to decide now to renounce all military capability to take actionin our remaining dependent territories, to help friendly commonwealth governments, or to serve as part of a United Nations force in thepeace-keeping role.    We must, therefore, plan to equip and train someof our forces  or these tasks.11.       I have made a preliminary examination of the way in which amilitary capability could be made available for use in the Far East,though its character, scale, and deployment must await the outcome ofthe Defence Expenditure Studies.12.       We should be able, if we wished, to continue to maintain in theFar East the naval presence which we plan to have there until the mid-70s, though it would be on a very much smaller scale.    It could include amphibious units (and two Commandos) and a small force of destroyers, frigates, and submarines.    A force of this kind - whichwould be a token of our continuing interest in the area - might be able,to share Australian facilities in Western Australia;  or it might continue to use in Singapore limited facilities maintained by the singapore Government,13,      As to Army and RAF units, our aim would be to avoid,stationing thern in the area, with the exception of those units which weshall have to station in Hong Kong (and possibly a few P,AF aircraft which we might keep in Singapore, if naval forces were to usefacilities provided there).    But the Strategic Reserve in this country,and the capability of the Royal Navy and RAF, would enable us to deploy reinforcements, if required, to the Indo-Pacific area, thoughany heavy equipment would take time.    It might well prove useful to demonstrate our reinforcement capability by the regular rotation of units for exercise purposes to Australia or perhaps to Singapore orMalaysia,3-
14.       It would be possible to base in the United Kingdom our naval forces as well;  but, from the military aspect, it would be more effective to have some military presence in the Far East, - of a kind which a small naval force can best provide.    Our allies v/ould certainlyprefer mat these ships should be based on Singapore, arguing that thiswould be making a significant contribution to the stability of the area as well as providing political cover for any forces which Australia andNew Zealand decide to keep in Malaysia.    On the ocher hand, the continuing presence of a British force in Singapore, even though it were using the facilities of the Singapore Government, would increase therisk of involvement, and it would be exposed to adverse change in the singapore political scone.    The coudrse of relying entirely on bringingforces, if necessary, into the ax*ea from the United Kingdom would be^the least effective in military terms and politically much tih&amp; leastattractive to our allies,    All our allies could be expected to resist itstrongly! and^\ if it were a choice between that a:ad the concept of basinga small naval force in Australia, we can assume that they would go forthe latter.15.       We do not, in any event, have to take a decision on deploymentplans at this stage.    So long as we avoid any commitment to new and heavy capital expenditure on base facilities in Australia, the difference in cost between the alternative ways of deployment would be relatively small.    If it were decided to keep a small presence in the area, it might prove cheajjer to do so in Australia than in Singapore.16.       There are two other matters - Polaris and the Gurkhas - whichcould be relevant to our military capability for use in the Far Eastafter the mid&quot;-70s.Deployment of Polaris East of Suez17,      There is no evidence that any of our allies outside Europe would wish us to deploy our Polaris submarines in the Indian or Pacific Oceansor that they would regard the presence of these submarines as asuitable compensation for the removal of other British forces.    But itmay be desired to discuss this possibility with our allies duringconsultations on the defence expenditure studies.18.      I attach an annex which sets out the major military and political implications of deployment East of Suez.    The terms in which we proposeto assign the Polaris force to NATO do rot exclude deployment of theforce East of Suez from 1972 onwards when the new depot ship which hasbeen planned for the support of other units of the Far East fleet is dueto come into service.    It is clear, however, that the political difficulties are such as to require major compensating advantagesbefore a firm decision to deploy East of Suez could be contemplated.In particular, renegotiation of the Nassau Agreement might give theUnited States opportunities for raising wider issues to our disadvantage!and the withdrawal of the force from assignment to NATO mightdamage not only our military relations with our European allies, butalso our prospects of negotiating entry into the Common Market onacceptable terms.    The cost of such a deployment is likely to be of theorder of  15 million in capital expenditure, of which  10 million v/ould-4-
be in dollars,,     The effect on running costs would be insignificant.    Froma practical point of view it now seerns clear that we would not need totake a decision on the deployment East of Suez until, say, October,when it will be necessary to decide whether or not to place ordersworth about  4,5 million for some of the extra facilities and supportthat would be required East of Suez,The Gurkhas19.      If we plan to reduce our forces in the Far East by half in1970- 71 , we shall have to continue the rundown of Gurkha forces fromthe 10, 000 already announced (to be reached by the end of 1969) to about, 000 (to be reached by the end of 1971).   I have been considering whether there would be advantage in retaining about 6, 000 Gurkhasbeyond 1975-76 in Hong Kong or Singapore or both.    The case for doing so does not appear strong at present.     Once the size of theGurkha force is reduced to about 6,000, its small size in relation to itsoverheads means that there is only a marginal saving from having aGurkha battalion above that rather than a British battalion.    TheNepalese Government might one day decide as a result of Chinesepressure, or for other reasons, to cease allowing us to recruit Gurkhasin Nepal;  and there is no obvious way of ensuring that a commitment in Hong Kong or Malaysia lapsed automatically with the end of Gurkharecruiting.    The Far East is the only area in which we can be sure ofbeing able to use Gurkhas.    For these reasons it would be unwise to plan on reducing even further the number of British infantry units so asto accommodate the four residual Gurkha battalions, which a force ofabout 6, 000 would produce,20.      On the other hand, I am advised that it would be dangerous to announce a firm intention to disband the Gurkhas entirely as part of anannouncement (v/hich might best be next Autumn) about the furtherrundown from 10, 000 to about 6, 000, since this could damage moraleamong the remaining Gurkhas, even to the point of mutiny.    For thisreason a firm decision on the final rundown of the Gurkhas to zero is unlikely to be required before, say, 1970, although for planning ptirposesI believe that we must now assume that the Gurkha rundown will be complete by the end of 1974.     Our costings are based on this assumption.Conclusions21.       To sum up, after consulting the Foreign Secretary and theCommonwealth Secretary, I v/ould put the following conclusions to mycolleague s:-(a)    Until we have completed the Defence Expenditure Studies, wecannot reach final decisions on our defence policy in theFar East, and on the character, scale and deployment ofany military capability we decide to retain for use in that area after we have withdrawn from the mainland of South-east asia.    But a decision in principle to maintain such acapability may be essential to our plans for smooth and rapid reductions in South-East Asia over the next few years;and a statement to this effect could be crucial for themaintenance of confidence if v/e should later decide to announce our intention of leaving Singapore and Malaysiaby the mid-70s.-5-
(b) Our continuing obligations outside Europe will require some military capability, whatever our future policy in South-EastAsiaj and we can expect to be able to afford this within thedefence budget ceiling assumed in the current studies.    Fromthe military and political aspects, the most effectivecapability is likely to be composed of a small naval presence in the Far East, backed by a reinforcement capability fromall three Services based on the United Kingdomj butdeployment plans can be settled later.(c) The deployment East of Suez of the United Kingdom Polarisforce would present some political difficulties!  and it isnot certain that it would be of special value as a military capability in the Indo-Pacific area;  but a decision on thisoption can be deferred until next October,(d) There would be difficulties in the way of planning to retainindefinitely, beyond 1974, a residual force of Gurkhab; butit will not be necessary, or wise, to take a final decision to disband the Gurkhas for several years yet.Recommendations22.      I invite the Cabinet -(a) to agree that^, in the forthcoming round of consultation, weshould make clear that, while we shall plan to give up ourbases on the mainland of South-East Asia by the mid-70s, weshall also plan to retain a military capability for use, if required, in the Far East after 1975;(b) to note that, while the size, character, and deployment ofthis military capability can be decided later, it should bepossible to accommodate it within a defence budget ceiling of  1, 800 million (at 1964 prices) in 1975-76;(c) to note the position on the possible deplo/ment East of Suezof the Polaris force, on which no decision is required, and can best be deferred, until next October;(d) to note the position on the Gurkhas, which shows that a finaldecision on disbandment should not be taken for several years yet.D.W.H.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.23 rd May, 1967-6-
Possible Deployment of Polaris East of SuezThe major military and political implications of deployingthe United Kingdom polaris force East of Suez, when (after 1972) wewere in a position to do so, would be these,2.      It is not possible to split a deterrent force of four polaris submarines between the Atlantic and East of Suez.    Moreover,because of the long lines of communication to the main base in theUnited Kingdom, and the distance between their forward operating base and firing positions in the Indian Ocean, thb availability of submarineson their station at immediate readiness to fire would be less than withan Atlantic deployment; but,, at the worst, it should be possible tokeep one submarine continuously on patrol in the Indo-Pacific area.This patrol could be in one of two positions from which either NATOtargets in Russia, or targets in South China (but not both) could be immediately attacked;  or in an area from which either position couldbe reached in four days.    Although the Chinese nuclear programme is going ahead faster than had been expected, this progress is unlikely tobe as rapid as that of the development of the Russian ABM programme in the 1970&apos;s.    This development underlines the need to consider thepossibility of deploying the submarines against China rather thanRussia in the long term.3,       But deployment East of Suez would raise difficult political issues.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government is deeply committed by theNassau Agreement, and by its public statements since, to contributethe Polaris Force to NATO;  and it is planned to assign the boats asthey come into service.    The ANF proposal included the specificcommitment of the Force for the duration of the Alliance;  and, althoughthe ANF scheme itself is dormant, the withdrawal of the Forceentirely from NATO -- or the announced intention of doing so - mightdamage the prospect of solving the problem of nuclear sharing in the alliance.    Moreover, our nuclear strategic force may well be a valuable card in relation to membership of the e.c..4,      At the same time, there axe some doubts about deploymentEast of Suez,    Would the Americans welcome it?    V/ould the australians or any other country be willing to allow the submarines tobe based on their territory?    In the longer run is there any prospect ofa nuclear free zone being established in and around the Indian Ocean,which might restrain our freedom of action in the British Indian OceanTerritories?    There would certainly be little prospect of finding any basis in the IndO&apos;-Pacific area on which we could say that the PolarisForce had been internationalised,5.       Finally there would be risks of criticism, however misplaced, ofany move which appeared to substitute nuclear for conventionalcapabilities in the area;  and neither the Americans nor our other allies would be likely to regard the Polaris submarines as a satisfactory alternative to those conventional forces which we are proposing towithdraw from the Far East.-7-ANNEX
