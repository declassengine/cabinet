OCUMENTCONFIDENTIAL *       g76IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)Cj67i85.y^hUav. 1967COPY NO. -64CABINETTHE ECONOMY OF WALES; DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for wales attach, in continuation of rny memorandum C(67) 84 of25th May, revised drafts of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Foreword to theWhite Paper, which refer to the Welsh Economic Council, ofparagraph 340 regarding Cardiff, of paragraph 348 regarding the Deeestuary, and of paragraphs 129, 130, 333 and 395 regarding the Welshcoal industry.    These revisions take account of the discussion of thedraft in the Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning.2.     I have also made a small amendment to paragraph 271 regardingthe derelict a.rea in the lower Swansea valley, a problem which is also mentioned in paragraph 341.3.      Paragraphs 174 and 394 will require revision in the light of theCabinet&apos;s decision on 25th May about the Regional Employment Premiumand this is in hand, in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned.4.     The Ministerial Committee suggested that the calculation of the job gap in 1971, which is made in paragraphs 93-101 and which is also referred to in paragraphs 392-394, should be revised to take account ofthe most up to date estimate of the expected reduction in employment inthe coal industry in Wales.    The calculation at present assumes areduction of 20,500 males employed in the coal mines below theMinistry of Labours figure for June, 1966, although this is not disclosed in the draft.    If the calculation were to be revised, all the changes inprospects which have occurred since March would have to be taken intoaccount (including the effect of the Regional Employment Premium) andnot merely those in the coal mines.    On balance, the result might not ^differ much from the estimated job gap of 15, 000 males now embodied inthe document and the publication of the White Paper would be delayed.The draft makes it clear that the calculation was made in March, 1967on the basis of the best information then available;  that it has no claimto precision and was made merely to indicate the order of magnitude ofthe employment problem in Wales and thus provide a basis for policy;and that it will have to be the subject of periodic revision as time goes on.C.H.^british Office, 3.W.I.25th May, 1967CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEXRevised ParagraphsWelsh Economic Council.   Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Foreword.&quot;The White Paper has drawn on the views of local authorities,both sides of industry, members of the University of Wales, andmany others;    and in its preparation I have had the advantage ofcomments by the Welsh Economic Council.     But the responsibilityfor the document is mine.I hope that the White Paper will be of help to all those concerned in shaping the destiny of Wales;   that it will be widely read by the public, on whose understanding and co-operationso much depends;    that it will be discussed and debated;    and thatit will stimulate other ideas and call forth other proposals.    Thetask of planning the development of Wales must now be carried further and I hope that the Welsh Economic Council will take a leading part in this work.&quot;Cardiff. Paragraph 340*   Replace the first five lines by:-&quot;The City of Cardiff should assume an increasingly important part in the life and economy of South Wales.   Its existingindustrial base and substantial labour force give it greatnatural advantages for the development of manufacturing industry and these advantages are being rapidly increasedwith the improvement of road and rail communications betweenSouth East Wales and the main centres of population in England.The City may also look forward to a major expansion of its administration and commercial services, shopping.....&quot;Dge Estuary.   Replace the third, fourth, fifth and sixth sentences of paragraph 348 by:-&quot;The Dee estuary forms a considerable barrier to communicationsv.ith Merseyside.   The main point of access is the QueensferryBridge;   and, although this was opened only four years ago, theamount of traffic using it is already nearing its designedcapacity.   The construction of a further crossing of the Deeat a lower point has been proposed by the local authorities.The Government have undertaken to meet a large share of the- 1 -RESTRICTED

The Government are considering with the other authorities concerned what furtherstudies of the project should be undertaken.&quot;Coal^Indjastry. Replace paragraph 129 by:-&quot;The National Coal Board have continuously sought to increasethe efficiency of the industry by the better use of men andmachines and by concentrating production at the most economicpits.     In Wales, 106 collieries were closed between 194-7 and1966:   most of these, after a long life span, had eitherexhausted their reserves or reached the limits of economicoperations.     Notwithstanding its reduced scale, the coalindustry contributes about  100 million annually to the welsh economy and in the middle of 1966 provided employment for nearly 61,000 mineworkers and some 5,500 other staff.It is, therefore, an important part of the economy of Wales.&quot;In the third sentence of paragraph 150, omit the words:-and the fall is likely to continue&quot;.paragraph 533? replace the fifth and sixth sentences by:-&quot;But a balanced economic structure has not yet been achieved.The decline in employment in the old established industriesboth presents a need for the rapid development of new.. industrial employment and provides an opportunity for it.&quot;In the last sentence of paragraph 333;.&quot;omit the words &quot;though smaller&quot;In paragraph 395: - project which, in addition to shortening communications,could bring other considerable advantages to the area.   a preliminary report by the consultants points to the advantagesomit the last sentence.- 2 -ftESTfllCTED
