this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTYrS GOVERNMENT)9(67183,24th May, 1967COPY NO,64CABINETREGIONAL EMPLOYMENT PREMIUMMemorandum.byjbhe First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic Affairs and theThe Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy attheir meeting on 23rd May considered the annexed memorandum on theintroduction of a Regional Employment Premium (REP).2.     The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that theGovernment should go ahead with the introduction of REP on the lines proposed in the &quot;Green Paper&quot;.    They agreed on balance that thescheme should be confined to the existing development areas and that special assistance should not at this stage be extended to other areas with employment difficulties - the so-called &quot;grey areas&quot; - whoseproblems would need to be reviewed in the light of the effects of REP.3.     The Committee endorsed the recommendations set out inparagraph 22 of the annexed memorandum, subject to the followingpoints:-(a) While it was agreed that a debate in Parliament should bearranged before a new Clause to the Finance Bill was putdown, it was for consideration whether, instead of deferring the announcement of its decision until after the debate (as proposed in paragraph 22(i) of the annex), theGovernment should not announce in the debate   their decision in principle to introduce REP, while remaininguncommitted until after the debate an particular aspectssuch as the coverage of the scheme and the rate of premium.(b) While an assurance should be given that the scheme would continue for seven years (paragraph 22(iii) of the annex),in the interests of ensuring that it did not continue indefinitely it was for consideration whether it should bemade clear that the amount of the premium would begin tobe tapered off during the seven-year period, from a pointin time to be decided in the light of the schemed effects,so as to phase it out completely at the end of seven years.
4,       We invite the Cabinet -(i)      to decide the points at (a) and (b) above;(ii)      subject to those points, to endorse the recommendations in paragraph 22 of the annex; and(iii)      to consider whether REP should be paid to the nationalised steel industry (this is referred to inparagraph 17 of the annex, but was not discussed bythe Committee).M. S.L. J. C.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1.24th May, 1967
SEP(6&quot;7)32j, the report &quot;by officials, summarises theresults of the consultations on the proposals set out inthe &quot;Green Paper&quot; for a Regional Employment Premium, anddraws attention to a number of points which will need to hesettled if we decide to go ahead with the proposals.    Themain issues for decision at this stage are r-(a)    Can we, in the light of the consultations, nowdecide whether or not to go ahead with theproposals?(h)    Should any amendments or additions he made to the&quot;Green Paper&quot; proposals?(c)    If we decide to proceed, should we do so by an amendment of the Finance Bill or &quot;by separate legislation?Case for the proposals.      The publication of the &quot;Green Paper&quot; has generated a wide-ranging and generally constructive discussion of theproposals in Parliament and the press, as well as in N.E.D. C.and the regional Economic Planning Councils.    There is nodoubt that if we decide to go ahead there will he more support for the proposals from informed opinion than we could other-wise have expected.    This new technique has also made it possible to assess more accurately the nature ofthe objections which are likely to he raised, and to distinguishthose which are directed to the general objectives of theproposal from those which arise from fears of its effecton particular interests or particular areas.
3.     On the general objectives of the proposal there has,among economists, been virtually unanimous support for it as an imaginative approach to the long-term problemsof the development areas.    The balance of comment in thepress, particularly from economic and financial correspondents,has been favourable.    The T.U.C. support it, though withsome reservations.    The reactions of the regional economic planning Councils have been mixed; in Scotland, Wales, theNorthern Region and Northern Ireland, the Councils have welcomed the proposal, but in the North West, Yorkshire andHumberside, East Anglia and the South West, the emphasishas been on the possible harmful effects on these regions of further preferential treatment for the development areas,and comment on the proposal itself has varied from alukewarm acceptance to outright opposition.    It is significant that the East and West. Midlands Councils have welcomed the proposal, and that the South East Council,while expressing doubts about the value of the proposalfor the national economy, accepts that in so far as itis effective it might help to relieve the pressures on labour in the South East,k-     Industrial opinion as expressed through the C.B.I.and A.B.C.C,  and through those E.D.C.S who have been consulted, is strongly critical of many of the economic arguments on which the proposals are based.    The main points of this criticism are that the premium would be unlikely to have a significant effect on prices in thedevelopment areas, or lead to a shift in the pressure2.
of demand from the South East and the Midlands.    It is also considered that a large element in the premium, perhaps as high as 50% would be dissipated in wage increases in the development areas with possible inflationary repercussions elsewhere.   For3jl these reasons it is denoted whether the premium could, in fact,be regarded as self-financing.    The C.3.I.  think that what is needed is a survey in depth of the objectives of regional policy,in which they would be glad to cooperate, which might lead to theintroduction of different measures.    They lay particular emphasis on the need to improve the arrangements for training skilled labour, the shortage of which they regard as the major inhibitingfactor on regional development at the present time.5.    The criticisms of the economic case for the proposal were taken into account before we decided to publish the &quot;Green Paper&quot;and they are further discussed in the report by officials(paras. 8-30).   Although they underline the uncertainty of someof the assumptions underlying the scheme,  our judgement is thatthe doubts raised by industry are not sufficient in themselves toinvalidate the general case for the proposals;    wo think it unlikely, however, that further consultation would lead to any significant change of industrial opinion on the general case forthe proposals.6,    A point to which industry attaches particular importance isthat if the regional premium is introduced,  it will have to bemade clear that it will remain in force for a substantial periodif it is to have much influence on industrial investment.    Thispoint is discussed in paras. 75 - dk in the report by.officialswhere it is suggested that there should be a Ministerial statementgiving a specific assurance that the premium would be paid at thefull rate for a minimum period of 5 years for the presentDevelopment Areas.   We think that there is considerable force inthe point made by industry, and that a better way of dealing withthe matter would be to say that in the light of the representations made by industry, we have decided to extend the period of 5 yearsreferred to in para. 29 of the -Green Paper- to 7 years.3.SECRET
7.     Of the other criticisms made of the proposal the mostsubstantial is that it would reduce the incentive to manufacturers to use their labour more efficiently and so run counter tothe efforts we are making through the E.D.C.S,  the national productivity Conference, and so on to raise productivity.   Giventhe crucial importance of improving labour utilisation this criticism cannot be lightly dismissed hut on balance we donot consider it of sufficient weight to offset the other advantages of the scheme.The Rate of Premium8.     There has been very little comment on the level ofthe premium, most commentators having assumed that the rate would he 30/-.    This question and the associated issues ofthe rates for women,  juveniles and part-timers are discussed in paras. 57 to 69 of the officials&apos; report.   We recommendthat the rate should be 30/- for males, 15/- for women andboys, 9/6 for girls with half-rates for part-timers,subject,    on the last point, to further consultation with both sides of industry.Possible Amendment of Additions to the Proposal9.     It has been suggested that the premium   should heextended to service industries and to the construction industry in the development areas.    The report by officials(paras. 2+6-56) recommends against both these proposals, for reasons which we find convincing.   Otherwise,  the pressure for modifications of the proposal is for it to be accompanied by other measures to assist areas which would gain little benefit from the premium, or which might headversely affected by it.    This has taken the form of suggestions for additions to the development areas (paras. 31-33of the report by officials), special treatment for &quot;grey areas&quot;(paras. 34-35) , arL(i special measures to assist sub-regions inthe development areas with a low lovel of manufacturingemployment (paras. 36-45).ElSECRET
10.   The point was made in the &quot;Green Paper&quot; that &quot;it wouldnot be possible to satisfy demands for a substantial extensionof the development areas without diluting the preference for the existing development areas and reducing the effective-ness of the scheme in remedying their special problems&quot;,(para, i+h) .     Apart from this very important consideration, anyaddition to the existing development areas would automaticallyinvolve additional expenditure on investment grants and assistance under the Local Employment Acts, as well as anincrease in the total payments through the regional employment premium.     There would therefore be difficulty in any major changes in the present boundaries of the development areas.11.    It remains for consideration whether some specialincentive to industrial development would be justified insome areas, close to the existing development areas, on theground   that they are likely to be adversely affected by theintroduction of a regional premium.     Examples of such areas are N.E. Lancashire, S.E. Wales, and Plymouth.12.   Without special legislation, the only form of incentivewhich could be given to such areas would be an increase in thelevel of investment grants (say, from 25% to 35%).     The cost would not be large.     Since the effect of this on the prefer-ential position of the development areas would be small, itwould not seriously weaken the regional premium.     But for this very reason,  it might do very little to satisfy the demand inthese areas for more substantial incentives.
13.      It would, moreover, be difficult to define the ares which would qualify for an increased rate of investment grant.Even if these could be confined to areas which are close to theexisting development areas, there would be pressure to includeother areas in the N.W. Region besides N.S. Lancashire, part(or, as the regional Council have suggested, the whole) of the yorkshire and Humberside Region, Edinburgh and North Wales.1k.     The problems of the &quot;grey areas&quot; are not as urgent asthose of the present development areas, and we would think itwiser not to introduce any concept of special treatment for&quot;grey areas&quot; at the same time as the regional employment premium.     We should, however, make it clear that although we do not accept the view that the introduction of a regional employment premium would make it necessary to provide animmediate stimulus to industrial development in other partsof the country, we recognise that if the premium is successful,it will create changes in the regional balance which may makeit necessary to review the general objectives of regional policy.15.     The problem of sub-regions within the development areas is rather different.      It is not suggested that these will beharmed by the premium, but that they need other forms ofassistance, particularly in view of the supposed effect of S.E.T.on tourism and other service industries.16.     The arguments against refunds of S.E.T. for serviceindustries in the development areas or in sub-regions were fully set out in the &quot;Green Paper&quot;; there may, however, be acase for giving further consideration to the position of the hotel and catering industry,  in view of the fact that in thesesub-regions it has a special importance for the tourist trade.This is discussed in paragraphs 36-h5 of the report &quot;by officials.The hotel industry is already in receipt of official assistance.6.
It may &quot;be that this could &quot;be extended to some extent or that new forms of assistance could be evolved.      In view of thepractical difficulties of defining the sub-regions themselves,it would be very difficult to draw up a workable scheme.     Thissould certainly not be done in time to take any legislative provision in the Finance Bill or indeed to announce theGovernment&apos;s intentions at that time.     Any move in thisdirection would lead to pressure for further concessions.      Itis not yet clear whether tourism will be adversely affected byS.E.T. and it will benefit (though not this season) from therecent concession for part-timers.     It would seem justifiable to take the line that the introduction of a regional employment premium for manufacturing does not itself afford any grounds for further amendment of S.E.T.Steel17.     The question of whether regional employment premiumshould be paid to the nationalised steel industry is still under consideration, but no fresh legislative provision v/ould be needed to give it.Lap lie at ion of ear 1 y legislat ion18. The result of the consultations and comments on the &quot;green paper&quot; have, in our view, established that although tnere are possible difficulties about the proposal for a regional employment premium, it should be of considerable value both for the general management of the economy and as a reinforcement of our regional policies. If this is accepted, the arguments for proceeding bya new Clause of the Finance Bill are:-(a)   Although the Premium is not intended as acontracyclical measure, it would have some immediateimpact.      It might, for example, influence manage-ments to keep open factories in development ares which would otherwise be closed.      It could, therefore,be of some importance to start the premium paymentsbefore next winter.7.SECRET
(b) There is increasing pressure from the regionswhich would benefit from the pro mi tup. for theearly implementation of the proposals.(c) There is little point in delaying legislationif.there is no prospect of any significant changesin the &quot;Green Paper&quot; proposals.(d) There would be no need to find time for a separate bill.19. The main objection to early legislation is that it may besaid that we have not paid sufficient attention to the criticisms of the proposal, particularly from industry.   At the meeting which the First Secretary held with the C.B.I. on 19th May it became clear that there is no likelihood that the C.B.I. wouldalter their general attitude to the proposal,    Apart from theobjections of principle which they raised, they laid greatemphasis on the importance of increasing the supply of skilled labour in the Development Areas.    The;y said that they had someconstructive suggestions to make on the way in which trainingin the Development Areas might be stepped up.   The C.B.I.envisaged these as an alternative to the premium, but it isclear that an increased programme of training in the development areas is very desirable as a complement to the premium.    Moreover,the presentation of the premium would clearly be a good dealeasier if we could simultaneously announce new measures toincrease training in the Development Areas.   We accordinglysuggest that the First Secretary and the Minister of labour should have urgent talks with the C.B.I. about their ideas inorder to establish whether there is any further action theGovernment could usefully take in this field.20. The C.B.I.  also pressed strongly for a study in depth ofour regional economic policies before a decision is taken onthe regional employment premium.   Others, including some of the
Regional Economic Planning Councils, have made similar suggestionsWe believe there is much to he said for such a study in due course hut to do it properly would take a considerable time,while the problem of the Development Areas cannot wait.    Itwould, however, help to mollify the C.B.I. and other criticsif, at the time of the announcement of R.E.P., the intention of conducting such a study were also announced together with an offer for the C.B.I. and the T.U.C. to be associated with the work.The intention would eventually be to publish another paper, likethe &quot;Green Paper&quot; to provide a background for informed discussion.Such a paper could not usefully be published for at least 18months, until there has been time to make some assessment of the impact of the regional employment premium.21. The procedure of publishing the &quot;Green Paper&quot; for informeddiscussion has been widely welcomed.    Parliament &apos;.has   not yet had an opportunity to debate the subject in itself although ithas figured in many speeches on related issues.      In ourview, there should be a debate before the clauseis announced, and it is most &quot;desirable that after theGovernment decision is announced, there should be a convincingresponse to the various criticisms that have been made of the green Paper to make it clear that the Government gave full  .consideration to all the criticisms before they went ahead,.We propose, therefore, that a White Paper should be published at an appropriate moment setting out the main criticisms andreplies to them.Conclusions22fl We ask our colleagues to agree that we should make thefollowing recommendations to the Cabinet:-(i)    that there should be a debate in parliament on the regional    employment premium before&apos;,the Governments decision is announced;9.
(ii)    that subject to this debate, a new Clause to theFinance Bill should be moved at the committee stage providing for the introduction of the regional employment premium;(iii)    that the period of 5 years referred to in paragraph29 of the &quot;Green Paper&quot; should be extended to7 years;(iv)    that the rate of premium should be 30s. Od. formales with the corresponding rates for women,juveniles and part-timers proposed in paragraph 8above;(v)    that there should be urgent discussions with theC.B.I. about their ideas on new means to increasetraining in the Development Areas;(vi)    that there should be a study in depth of ourregional economic policies with a view topublishing a further &quot;Green Paper&quot; in about18 months&apos; time;(vii)    that a White Paper should be presented toParliament after the announcement of the government&apos;s decision, setting out the main criticisms of the green Paper and giving the answers to them.M.S.19th May., 196710.
