FOREWORDWales is passing through a period of unusually rapidsocial and economic changef   the age of sophisticated andautomated industry is pressing upon us.   It is right that,at this moment, we should pause to consider the whole sceneand examine the economy of Y/ales and the environment of its people.   This White Paper is, indeed, the first occasion whenHer Majesty&apos;s Government have brought together all the issues which affect the economic, social, and cultural background of life in modern Wales,,Planning means different things to different people, butI suggest that the essence of it lies in trying to identify, and where possible quantify, the problems that face us and thenseeking to work out, in the light of the available resources,the policies that best promote their solution.   It is this objective that has been pursued in this document and not anattempt to construct a theoretical framework within whichdetailed targets can be set for all concerned with our economic life.   The White Paper looks ahead as far as practicable, but does not claim to predict the future.   Because our problemsare continually changing, planning must be a continuing processand this document is a first step.   -The White Paper analyses the prospective employment situation.   It describes the great natural attractions of wales to new industry and ways in which the Government have increasedthese attractions, particularly by the inclusion of most of the principality in the Development Area created last year.   It dealswith the plans for the improvement of roads and stresses theimportance of applying new technology in industry, ofincreasing the adaptability of labour, and of encouraging tourism,,It reviews the housing situation, the health and education services,what needs to be done to improve our towns, and to preserve ourcountryside, and the work of fostering the cultural traditions of Wales - all of which are so significant for the quality of life.
Q9O hiDifferent parts of Wales have their special problems andthese are examined.   The last Chapter of the document summarisesand appraises the main issues.Much of the responsibility for pursuing many of thematters discussed in the White Paper lies with local authorities,and the Government1s forthcoming proposals for there organisation of Welsh local government will strengthen their ability to undertake this task.The White Paper has drawn on the views of localauthorities^ both sides of industry, members of the university of Wales, and many others,,   In its preparation I have had theadvantage of comments by the Welsh Economic Council, but theCouncil bear no share in my responsibility for the document.The issues indicated in the White Paper must now becarried further.   I hope that it will be of help to all those concerned in shaping the destiny of Wales;   that it will be widely read by the public, on whose understanding andco-operation so much depends;    that it will be discussed anddebated;    and that it will stimulate other ideas and call forthother proposals.There are both challenges and opportunities.   We are seeking ways in which the people of Wales may hope to leadfuller lives with less exposure to the chill winds which havemarred so much of their history.   The Government are determined that, as the economy of the nation gathers strength, a due shareof its swelling resources will be devoted to the needs of wales and of other less developed parts of the United Kingdom,,   our aim must be to create a dynamic, outward-looking Wales, proudof its traditions and making its rightful contribution to the life of these Islands.Byw yno byth raae pob hen obeithion,Yno mae cynnydd uchel amcanion.Here still our ancient hopes we cherish,Here too our noble aspirations flourish,iv
1 &quot;part ONE - RESOURCESCHAPTER ITHE FRAMEWORK OF change is,        The Welsh economy is today undergoing a transformationas sweeping and far reaching in scope &quot;but much faster in pacethan all the changes it underwent during the First IndustrialRevolution and up to the outbreak of World War One.   Theearlier transformation was from a predominantly agriculturaleconomy to dependence upon two heavy industries,,   The first stage, which occupied the hundred years up to i860, was basedon the exploitation of limited iron ore and other mineral resources to meet demands for iron for munitions and rails.The second stage arose from a world-wide demand for coal forthe rapidly developing steamships and railways, and for steel,steel sheet and tinplate for railways, construction and canning?it was made possible by the existence of vast resources of coal,and by the invention of the Bessemer and Siemens-Martin processesfor the conversion of imported ores into steel.   The changesnow in progress are largely from these basic industries tonewer industries, such as chemicals, synthetic fibres, oilrefining, aircraft, motor vehicles, electrical engineering andelectronics? and the increasing adoption of automation is bringingfresh challenges.2.        The first transformation made a great contribution tothe balance of payments and consequent economic strength of theUnited Kingdom, but was accompanied by much human suffering..The Government intend that the current transformation shall beachieved with the fullest possible benefit to the people of wales.   The extent to which a changeover in employment hasalready taken place is roughly indicated by Table I.

During much of the period fromI76O to 1913 Wales was one of the boom areas of the UnitedKingdom.     Every Welsh oounty increased its population up toI84L   Thereafter, while the rural areas lost to the industrial areas, the population of Wales as a whole doubled from 1.million in 1851 to 2.4 million in 1911.     This increasedpopulation however was heavily dependent for employment on an arrow range of industries?   whereas 36.7 per cent of the working population of Wales were in mining or metal manufacture in1921, the corresponding figure for England and Wales as awhole was only 10.2 per centoThe Years Between the Wars4.        When this undiversified Welsh economy, faced with changes in international demand and In technology, collapsedafter the First World War, the resulting unemployment wascatastrophic, and was only partially relieved by an exodusof population and by new industrial growth .     Whereas net
outward migration from Wales during the period 1851 to 1911was negligible^^\ during the period 1921 to 1939 it averaged25,000 per annum, and the total population in the latter year was 2,465jOQQ, which was 272,000 below the peak reached in the mid 1920s e     Industrial growth in Britain in this inter-warthe country.period was concentrated in other parts of/  The development ofelectricity for motive power liberated industrL es from theirnineteenth century dependence on coalfield areas for locations,many of the new industries producing consumer durables for thehome market sprang up in London and the Midlands, wherethere were large concentrations of purchasing power, and existing manufacturing industries using similar techniques wliichoffered sources of skilled labour, experienced management andentrepreneurial ability.     Once a tradition of location for thenewer industries was established, industrialists thinking of expansion or starting new industries increasingly played&quot;follow-my-leader&quot;, and psychology reinforced economic advantage.Conversely, the relative disadvantages, real and imagined, of wales and other &quot;outer&quot; parts of Britain became progressively more pronounced, and although Wales could offer a large pool ofadaptable but unskilled workers, this was not a crucial factorat a time when labour was everywhere plentiful.5.      Although measures taken by the Government in the1930&apos;s succeeded in bringing some new industries into SouthWales, their scale was altogether inadequate to the need, and itrequired the challenge of war to bring about the full utilisation of Welsh labour.     This labour coupled with the strategicadvantages of dispersal of war production, led to the building in Wales between 1939 and 1943 of large ordnance factories, theintroduction of new industries engaged in defence work, and increased demands on existing essential industries.     By 1943unemployment was virtually eliminated and Wales was mailing asubstantial contribution to the needs of the nation.-3-^Brinley Thomas (Ed).. The Welsh Economy. University of WalesPress, I962H.1
Postal? ar Jge const ruction6. With the end of the War, the Government assistedthe conversion of the Welsh economy to a peacetime basis,.   Thewartime factories, with their experienced labour, were convertedand reallocated to new industrial tenants    Large firms withspecialised requirements were persuaded to build other new factories, and privately owned existing premises (ranging fromdance halls to disused schools) were pressed into the serviceof new industryo   In South Wales, factories for renting were built with Government finance where sites acceptable toindustrialists were availablee   By 1955 the first phase of post-war reconstruction was complete,.   Hundreds of enterpriseshad been set up and were working successfully;    the nationalisedcoal industry v/as engaged in an ambitious programme of developing the Welsh collieries and coal reserves;   while the steel andtinplate industry was well advanced with a major redevelopmentprogramme in West South WaJ.es, replacing the older works bymodem plants^   By this date, the population of Wales had increased to 2,603,000,   the estimated employee population was948,000, nearly a third of whom were engaged in manufacturing,compared with less than a quarter in 1958;    and the rate ofunemployment had fallen below 2 per cent.   A pointer to theprogress made is the estimate of a group   of economists headed, (l)by Professor Edward Nevin at University College, Aberystwyth      ,that the gross national product of Wales grew by 68 per cent between 1948 and 1954 compared with the equivalent increasein the United Kingdom of 51 per cent.,   For manufacturing industry,this is supported by the Census of Production for 1948 and 1954*The Last Decade7* Despite this progress, the problems of the economyhad not been wholly solved,,   Although the traditional extractiveindustries were how accounting for less than a fifth of totalemployment compared with almost a third in 1938, and although-4- ______________________Edward Nevin et al*   The Structure of the Welsh Economy,University of Wales Press, 1966,
their labour continued to fall, coal mining and agriculturestill employed a high proportion of the working population.As the new steel and tinplate plants in West South Wales came into production, the older works closed, releasing by 1958some   8,000-9*000   workers.     The release of labour from agriculture due to increasing productivity affected the extensive rural areas of Wales, where some localities also suffered from reduced activity in other traditional industries,such as slate in parts of North Wales and fishing and shiprepairing at Milford Haven.     Efforts to balance these changesby encouraging new industrial.development achieved some success,Governmentalthough during the late 1950&apos;s and early 19oQ&apos;s   the/ were giving greater priority to the needs of other areas,  particularlyScotland and the North-East of England, which were thenmore pressing.     Several of the newer, growing industries were established in South Wales and a large integrated steelworks wasbuilt,at Llanwern east of Newport.     In the rural areas smallindustries were fostered in a number of the towns and in SouthPembrokeshire the oil industry began its large refinerydevelopments around Ml ford Haven.     In the second post-wardecade, Wales was not able to do bettor than to hold the placein relation to England which it had reached by 1954:    theNevin study estimated that between 1954 and I964 the   rossnational product per head of population increased by the same amount in Wales as in the United IZingdom,8.        In 1965 and 1966 the Government took further steps to foster economic expansion in Wales.  The new post of Secretary ofState for Wales was created as an earnest of the importance which the Government attached to economic expansion in  /alesand in order to strengthen the means by which all the interestsof Wales are taken fully into account by the Government .-5-
The Development Districts created under the Local EmploymentAct i960 were greatly extended until in August I966 the wholeof Wales, except for parts of the South-East and the North-East,became a single Development Area;   but because of the timeneeded to build new factories, the efforts of the last two years have not yet had time to bear full fruit.-5A-R.1
11.      The comparative weakness of the Welsh economy is reflected also in the flows of Government expenditure.Government revenue from taxes on personal incomes in Wales waslow.     The  Nevin study, which brings together estimates ofGovernment expenditure, suggests that grants by the CentralGovernment to persons and to local authorities in Wales, which amounted to  94 million and  58 million respectively in 1^62,were 12 per cent and 37 per cent higher per head of populationthan in the United Kingdom, and together were some  30 million higher than they would have been if Wales had received thenational average level of payment.     The high level of government grants to local authorities per head of population reflect inpart the higher level of per capita expenditure by Welsh localauthorities,due to the small and scattered populations of manyR.l.The Legacy of the Past9.        The great problem inherited from the past is thatthe level of economic activity is still too low to make full useof the resources available in Wales.     This is shown by the relatively high level of unemployment and the relatively lowactivity rates (i.e. the number of employees expressed as a proportion of the population over 15)? particularly among women.A serious feature of the history of the last decade is thatthe number of men in employment has declined;   for them^the bigincreases in manufacturing, construction and service industriesdid not offset the decline in  extractive industries.10.      The low level of activity is reflected in thelow level of personal incomes in Wales as compared withGreat Britain,,   The Inland Revenue Survey of Incomesfor 1964-65 ( Grand. 3200) shows that the difference in average personal income is about 7 per cent.
of their areas and the resulting high cost per head of providingschools, roads and other services.   It also reflects the lower levels of local authority receipts from rates and trading income.The study shows however that the rate of capital formation in wales has been very high (perhaps a quarter higher per head of population in 1958-62 than in the United Kingdom as a whole),as a result of the heavy investment in steel, oil, coal, chemicals,nuclear and conventional power stations and new manufacturing capacity, which has been financed by a large net inflow ofcapital to Wales from outside.12.        At the same time, according to the estimates in theNevin study, the gross domestic product per person employedwas in 1964 some 51&quot; per cent higher in Wales than in the UnitedKingdom.   In manufacturing industry output per person employedWas considerably higher in Wales than in Great Britain as a whole,according to the latest available Census of Production data.The difference is partly due to the strong representation in wales of capital-intensive industries, notably steel, and alsoto output per person being considerably higher in Wales than in britain as a whole in the metal manufacture and textile industries.The high net output in the Welshtextile industries is due mainly to its consisting mainly of the manufacture of syntheticfibres, with its capital-intensive processes.The Objective15.        The structure of the Welsh economy results in a low   percentage of employees in the total population and lowincomes for the self-employed, who are mainly small farmers and shopkeepers.   To strengthen the Welsh economy, more industrial and other development is needed so that fuller use can be madeof the available labour.   This means, not only wideropportunities to work for those not now in any employment, butalso a greater choice of employment in better paid jobs for people who are at present engaged in the relatively lowly-paid
sectors.     It will be to the advantage of the whole national economy as well as to the advantage of Wales itself that the effort needed to secure this development is made.     Thenational economy will benefit from the extra output resultingdirectly from new industries, and from the extra demand for goods and services indirectly generated by their operation.A more uniform distribution of employment throughout Britain willmake it easier to run the whole economy at a high level of activity, while avoiding excessive pressure on resources incongested areas.14.       Ways in which Wales can advance towards this objective are indicated in the Chapters which follow.     Thisendeavour can be confidently based on the substantial naturaladvantages described in Chapter II, and will be reinforced by the actions of the Government.     Tho situation varies widelyin the different parts of Wales:   there are several challengingissues, and the resources available must be deployed in the most advantageous manner overall.     The policies of the Government,which are explained below, will receive constant reappraisal asthe future unfolds and as experience shows in what respectsthey demand adjustment and developments
CHAPTER IINATURAL RESOURCES15. Wales has important natural advantages which have,as in the case of mineral deposits, profoundly influenced its economic development.     As technology advances, as some marketsgrow and others contract, as richer mineral deposits are worked out and as new transport facilities are developed, the value ofsome of these advantages may decline and that of others grow.So, a fresh look must continually be taken at the best use to bemade of resources in modern conditions.Accessibilityl6c Eor their successful conduct, industries need readyaccess to large and growing markets and to sources of materials and components.     In these respects Wales has been handicapped inthe past by its inadequate communications with other parts of britain;   and to a lesser extent because, with little more than5 per cent of the national population and a below-average levelof income, it has by itself offered a market which was bothrestricted and dispersed.17. There are two powerful factors which are nowbreaking down the old barriers of inaccessibility.     One is the increasing congestion in the main centres in Britain aspopulation continues to grow.     According to recent estimatesthe population of Britain may grow by around 20 million or nearly two-fifths by the end of the century;   and the resultingpressure makes less densely-populated and not-too-distant areaslike Wales more attractive as places of work as well as of residence.     The other factor is the improvement of communicationsProgress towards the completion of the London-South Walesmotorway (M4), including the new Severn road bridge, the newroad links with the Midlands and the North via the I.15 and M50,and the improved speed and efficiency of the main British Railservices, particularly the faster inter-city passenger servicesand the new block and liner trains for the movement of commodities, are reducing the effective distance between Welshindustrial areas and those of England.
For Wales, these mean quicker and more efficient links with themain British markets and better access to the markets of europe and the world.18* Newport, Swansea, Barry, Port Talbot, Cardiff,Pishguard and Holyhead have extensive port installations whichare being modernised, and Llilford Haven has natural deep wateraccess.     nationally, such facilities are scarce.     LlilfordHaven is indeed one of the outstanding physiographic assets of wales and of Britain in its ability to handle large ships usedfor transporting bulk cargoes.     Its advantages have alreadyencouraged four oil companies to locate either their refineriesor&quot; pipe-line terminals there, and further developments can beexpected.19* Map 1 shows how Wales is placed in relation to thelarge industrial and population centres of the Midlands,Ivlerseyside and South-East England.     Distances will be further reduced in terms of time and convenience as transport linkscontinue to be improved and this will reinforce the incentivefor industry and population to grow in Wales, as the pressure of population elsewhere in Britain increases and as the specialinducements available in the Welsh Development Area areincreasingly appreciated.Land for Development -,20. Wales has plenty of land suitable for new urban andindustrial development.     Over its total area of some 0,000
square miles, the gross population density is only 0*5 personsper acre, compared with 0.9 persons per acre in Great Britain.Moreover, although 80 per cent of the population live in 28 percent of the total area, and some redevelopment is necessary inthese more populous parts of Wales, there is even there no serious problem of excessive density or land shortage.     In theremainder of Wales the gross density of population is only 0.1persons per acre;   and, although much of this consists of land at too high an elevation or otherwise unsuitable for urban development, there still remain considerable tracts of country where substantial urban and industrial development could takeplace.     These are for the most part found along the wide coastalbelt of South Wales, in the North-East, the South-West, and inAnglesey and some parts of Central Wales;    although it is alsoin these areas that the best agricultural land is found, and theneed to preserve this must be weighed against other factors in deciding where development should take place.     Manyareother areas /suitable for smaller-scale development.     There areample reserves of land suitable for industrial use in places wherelabour and basic services are available, as well as access toports and markets.Land for Agriculture and Forestry21i        Compared with some other parts of Britain and europe, the greater part of Wales, because of its relief andclimate, is unsuitable for the production of cereals, fruit andflowers.     It is much better placed to grow grass andthis is    why its agriculture is concentrated on grass-fed milk and meat, both of which are high-quality products for whichdemand should continue to grow.     Some parts of Wales, inparticular Gower and Pembrokeshire, are also suitable for theproduction of vegetables such as early potatoes.22*,        Large areas of the uplands of Wales are well suited to afforestation, offering a long growing season and an ability
to produce /rood-quality conifers relatively quickly.   other land of limited agricultural value is likely to be availablefor tree planting.   The forests, both public and private,provide readily marketable products and limited but much-neededopportunities for alternative employment in rural Wales.Indirectly, they can further assist the economy and employment by enhancing the recreational attractions of the countryside.Minerals23.        Though less important than in the past, andunlikely again to provide the basis for a big expansion of the welsh economy, mineral resources will remain of great significance.   The market for coal has declined but theremaining reserves in South Wales, especially of coking and high quality smokeless fuel (anthracite and dry steam) willcontinue to be valuable assets to the Welsh economy, providedproductivity can be so increased as to maintain coal prices at fully competitive levels.   Among other minerals still being worked, the demand for slate, granite and clay is expectedto be maintained at about its present level and that forlimestone, sand and gravel to continue to increase.   There isalso renewed interest in mining some of the rarer minerals, suchas copper and lead, which have been worked in Wales in the pasteWater24.        Because of its topography and the high averagerainfall over much of the country Wales has important resourcesof water.   The development and control of these resources can bring particular benefit to Wales as well as to other partsof Britain.   The growing demand for water for domestic andindustrial purposes is such that areas with ready access to amplesupplies have a significant locational advantage, particularly for those
industries needing large amounts *     The construction of a modernreservoir can often be combined with improvements to existinglocal roads, the creation of new scenic roads, the provision ofcamping orcar parks and/picnic areas, fishing and boating facilities andother recreational and tourist attractions.     The control ofwater run-off can help to reduce the risk of serious flooding towhich many Welsh valleys are subjects     Thus, developed in animaginative way, after careful and sympathetic consideration ofall the conflicting issues affecting each project, waterresources can be made to serve a wide range of purposes andafford new opportunities for economic advance in localitieswhich most need them.Amenity Resources25&quot;        Most parts of Wales have fine stretches ofcoastline or inland scenic features such as hills, mountains,scarped ridges, woods, high moorlands, rivers and lakes whichhave already made them attractive to many discriminating visitorsand holiday-makers.    Much of the best landscape is protected bythe National Parks legislation and there is scope for the designation of further areas.     A wide variety of recreationaldemands is catered for by the many holiday resorts around thelengthy coast-line, and by facilities for self-catering holidays and for enjoying pursuits such as sailing, fishing and pony-trekking^ while historical sites, including one of the greatestchains of mediaeval castles in the world, attract other holidaymakers.     These resources, located so near big populationcentres in an age when mobility is being greatly increased by thegrowth, of car ownership , should make Wales an increasingly     important recreation area&quot;26.        The value of these amenities lies partly in theinducement they give to industrialists and to individuals tomove to, or stay in, Wales and partly in the opportunities theypresent for the development of tourism.     Local amenitiesinfluence industrialists seeking new locations and draw people
to live near them for their working careers as well as for retirement and for week-end residence.     Tourism is already oneof the main industries, and the potential is there for &quot;bigexpansion,.Conclusion27. In the past, the form and location of economic growth in Wales were conditioned &quot;by its mineral resources and low energy prices.     In future, economic progress should be increasingly influenced by its groxving accessibility in .relation to the big and fast-growing populations in the congested areas of Britain, by its reserves of labour, itswater supplies, its facilities for landing imports of rawruaterials, its reserves of land.for urban and industrialdevelopment, and its scenic and recreational attractions.
CHAPTER IIIWATER28. As has been said in Chapter II, Wales is richin water resources which can be harnessed to the needs of thewhole community, both in the Principality and outside it.Just how this should be done is a matter of great concern.   Thegoverning considerations are the need to safeguard legitimateamenity and agricultural interests, while developing theresources available for the benefit of Wales as well as ofneighbouring parts of England.   Water resources are alreadyused to satisfy heavy demands from consumers in and outsideWales and in the generation of electricity, and there is a growing appreciation of their value for recreation and inattracting tourists.   In some areas rivers are liable to causedistress and damage through flooding, and works are needed to limit this as well as to provide water supplies.   The reverseside of the coin is that major water conservation   works can hardly ever be carried out without causing disturbance in the localities concerned.   The importance of a comprehensiveapproach to surface water
development is evident.   The Government&apos;s aim is to ensurethat the water resources of Wales are used and controlledto the widest public benefit, and with the fullest safeguards for Welsh interests.Availability29. There is ample water to meet all foreseeableWelsh needs for a very long time ahead.   In 1961 the WelshAdvisory Water Committee reported that,after making an allowance of some 1,000 million gallons a day for use in wales (about six times the present consumption of publicsupplies in Wales), the available surplus, according to thesystem of development adopted, would amount to between 235and 800 million gallons a day.   This estimate assumed the useonly of reservoir sites to which no more than a moderatedegree of objection might be raised on technical, financial,agricultural and sociological grounds.   These abundantresources will be of considerable advantage in meeting the rising needs of the population and the demands of new and expanding industry.   They may also prove particularlyattractive to firms which use large quantities of water intheir industrial processes.   To fulfil   all requirements,however, it is necessary to carry out works to ensure thatthe water will be available in adequate quantity in the areas where it is needed.Methods of Development30.       Daily consumption of water does not vary greatly;but surface run-off fluctuates according to rainfall, and storage is necessary to even out these fluctuations.   Becauseof the nature of geological strata in Wales, undergroundstorage can play only a minor role.   Estuarial barragescould bring advantages, in making available for public use
the full resources of rivers and in serving highway,recreational and other purposes;   but they present many problems requiring extensive investigation.   The only methodof obtaining substantial additional supplies not necessarilyinvolving major storage facilities is the de-salting of seawater;   but,although recent research is encouraging,desalination is unlikely to make a significant contributionto water resources for many years.   For countries like britain with a good rainfall, the cost of production is likely atpresent to be very high   as compared with that fffom naturalsources;   and, as with estuarial barrages, the water wouldhave to be pumped considerable distances, thus addingappreciably to distribution costs.   Thus fora long time ahead, the construction of further surface storagereservoirs will be inevitable.31. The form of storage reservoir recommended bythe Welsh Advisory Water Committee in their 1961 report, andthat now widely favoured, is the regulating reservoir.   Thissystem of control enables some of the surplus run-off duringspells of heavy rainfall to be stored and reSased in drierperiods, thus ensuring a minimum river flow sufficient tosatisfy all needs:   it could also help to alleviate floodingin some areas.   Because the water is not taken directly intosupply, access to regulating reservoirs and activities insave in exceptional circumstances,the gathering grounds need not^be restricted and they arepotential centres for water sports and recreation .-   It isexpected that future large-scale demands on water resources in Wales will be met by the construction of regulatingreservoirs.   These will normally be sited in upland   a reason rivers flowing  through or towards areas where wateris required, thus permitting local abstraction as needs arise.
32*        The use of regulating reservoirs to facilitateabstraction outside Wales   is not a policy to export    water.   The water released from the reservoiris that which, in the absence of regulation, would haveflowed naturally down the river and thus, over a period, theaggregate flow of water out of Wales is not changed by theconstruction of the reservoir.Future Demand and Supply33.        Consumption of public water supplies in Wales,now totalling about 180 million gallons a day, has been risingsteadily.   Over the past five years the rate of growth of demand has varied from about 3 per cent per annum in parts ofindustrial South Wales to over 10 per cent in many rural areas.There are also private industrial and agricultural abstractions,now in process of registration under the Water Resources Act1963* which have been estimated to use about 350 million gallons a day, of which some two-thirds is used for electricity generation.   The annual growth of these industrialdemands can be expected to be about 3 per cent, but much ofthe water so used is returned to rivers and is available forre-use.34*        In planning to meet future needs, it isnecessary to look well ahead because waterworks are costly and take several years to design and construct;   and surveys of resources and future demands are now being made by all riverauthorities, in pursuance of their statutory duty.   Inparticular areas the position is as follows:-(a)     In South Wales, current demand on public supplysources is about 135 million gallons a day, as against their reliable yield of 152 million gallons a day, andthis demand is expected to grow to about 235 million gallons a day in fifteen years time.   Additional works
are needed to match this.     Proposals underconsideration are the phased development of a major regulatingreservoir on the upper reaches of the River Towy to give an ultimate yield of 110 million gallons per day for the benefitof Y/est Glamorgan and. Carmarthenshire;   and the conversion ofthe existing impounding reservoirs on the Usk and Cray toregulating reservoirs capable of providing an additional 28million gallons per day for abstraction from the Usk,     Even so,another major regulating reservoir will probably be neededsomewhere in the Usk catchments(b) In Pembrokeshire, consumption, now some 8 million gallons a day, is expected to increase by about 12 million gallons a day in the next fifteen years.     Construction ofa regulating reservoir on the Eastern Cleddau will start in1967*     The first phase will make available an additional13*5 million gallons a day by 1970 and raising the height ofthe dam could provide a further 10 million gallons a day,(c) The expected growth of demand in the catchment of theRiver Severn and populous areas nearby will make it necessaryto depend increasingly on this river for supplies.     The newClyv/edog regulating reservoir will sustain additionalabstractions at various points   of/some 108 million gallons per day by the Montgomeryshire Water Board, tenEnglish water supply undertakings and the Central electricity generating Board,     Since this is unlikely to be sufficient for more than a few years ahead, the possibilities of furtherregulation of the Severn are being investigated.     The&apos; WelshCommittee of the Water Resources Board have been asked toreport on &quot;the lines along which the water resources of the welsh part of the Severn Basin should be developed, having. &apos;   &apos; &apos; ., - .&quot;&apos;.vj.:regard to (i) the likely demand for water from this sourceup to about 1990, and (ii) the need to utilise those assets in the interests of the area itself, as well as outside
consumers, through making abundant supplies of wateravailable for incoming industries and population, theimprovement of amenities, the promotion of tourism and thealleviation of flooding&quot;*    The Severn River Authority, in association with the Welsh Committee, have commissioneda survey of possible sites for regulating reservoirs tomeet demands on the Severn, which in fifteen years time mayamount; to 200 million gallons a day additional to what is available from existing resources including the Clywedogreservoir^(d)    In Flintshire and Denbighshire, there is a narrowmargin between reliable yields and the current consumptionof about 16 million gallons a day.     It seems likely that in fifteen years the demand here will increase by.about 20 million gallons a day.     Consumers in Englandrelying on the Dee catchment for supplies will also requiremore water0     Possibilities under preliminary considerationinclude the greater use in Wales of water from the Alwenreservoir and aqueduct; at present owned by the WirralWater Board, regulating reservoirs in the Dee and Clwydcatchments and the construction of a fresh-water reservoirin the Dee estuary in connection with a road crossing.Rural Supplies35e        Apart from these major developments, it isnecessary to press ahead with schemes to provide piped water supplies in Welsh rural areas and considerable progress hasalready been made.     At the end of the last War it was estimatedthat more than 80,000 (42 per cent) of the properties in rural districts of Wales lacked a piped supply.     This figure has nowbeen rtduced to some 20,000 properties (8 per cent).     About 22 million has been spent on rural water schemes since 1945*schemes costing  16 million having attracted Government grants
of  ?i million^   It is expected that within the next fiveyears about 95 per cent of properties in the rural areas willhave a piped water supply eInvestment36c       In the five years ending in April 1967, capitalexpenditure by Welsh statutory water undertakers averagedabout  4 million a yeare   As a result of major schemes now contemplated their rate of capital investment is likely toincrease within a few years to  10 million a year.   This will mean significant expenditure in Wales, and of benefit to Wales.Saf^guardi^^^ot^gr^ni^er^sts37o        The Government are deeply concerned to ensure that development of water supplies in Wales is carried out under themost stringent safeguards for the interests of Wales and those ofthe localities immediately affected.   Major new works are essential to meet growing demands for water on both sides ofthe border0   It is probable that these can be constructedwithout disturbance to communities or any serious effects on agriculture, amenity and other interests!   but all these considerations will be closely scrutinised before proposals are finalised,,   The Government will introduce legislationproviding for the compensation payable to tenant farmersdisplaced for non-agricultural purposes to be raised to a minimum of five years&apos; rent.   The detailed surveys which are being conducted and the further extensive inquiries which will be heldwill reveal the social advantages and disadvantages of waterschemes.   Where conflicting interests emerge, as they often do,the Government will scrupulously watch over the welfare of people in Wales.FJ^oding^38c       Flooding is caused in Wales from time to time by heavy rainfall on saturated, or in some cases frozen and snowcovered, ground0   Lands villages and towns in the naturalflood plains of Welsh rivers have in consequence been invaded byfast flowing flood waters several feet in depth.   On someoccasions damage to property has been extensive and severe.   Themost recent serious floods took place in December of the
years i960, 1964 and 1965 when the valleys of the Severn, Taff,Conway, Dee, Dovey and Ystwyth were most affected.   Each year there is a risk of some overspill from the naturally
formed river channels, but the available records suggest thatthe series of heavy inundations in 1960-65 represented an aboveaverage incidence of floods of this size.39.        The responsibility for initiating, preparing and carrying out works for the alleviation of flooding rests withriver authorities, internal drainage boards and localauthorities.     The cost is met partly by the rates and partly by Government grants.     The Government*s policy is to encourageand assist the responsible authorities to examine their floodproblems and to carry out works of alleviation or preventionwhere the cost can be justified^400 While it would not be sensibleto spend millions of pounds to safeguard property worththousands, the question is rarely as simple as this, particularlywhen flooding could endanger human life.     Regulating reservoirsconstructed for water supply purposes can help but do not by themselves normally provide a full solution.     Where they can help,they will be so used, but the main attack on the problem in theyears immediately ahead is likely to be throughchannelling and other works in the lower river reaches.Considerable sums are being spent on these works.     Expenditurein Wales on land drainage (including flood prevention) has inrecent years been running at over  800,000 a year, includingmaintenance and administrative costs, over  300,000 of this being for new works or works of improvement which earnGovernment grants.     Since the end of 1960, over 90 drainageimprovement schemes have been approved for grant aid at an estimated cost of  2.75 million, and at current rates grant onthis expenditure amounts to about  1.9 million.     The riverauthorities plan to increase their expenditure  on floodprevention, and the Government will continue to encourage themto press, ahead with sound schemes.
CHAPTERCOMMUNICATIONS41.      The way in which centres of population andindustry in Wales are positioned in relation to each other and to similar centres in England, the size and difficultinature of much of the country, and the low density of population in rural Wales, make of great moment theprovision and maintenance of adequate communications.This Chapter will first describe the progress already achieved in the construction of roads in the Principalityand the manner in which it is proposed to implement inthe future plans for a great improvement in the existingnetwork.    It will then turn to. the railways, ports and air communications*
ROADS42o      G-ood roads are one of the keys to thefuture prosperity of Wales.   The Government attach greatimportance to the development of the main routes connectingWelsh industry and ports with centres of population andindustry in Englandj, as well as to the provision of adequatecommunications bet?/een points inside Wales.A3.     The Government, through the Welsh Office, are solely responsible for the trunk road network in Wales, which consists of 1,000 miles of main through routes.   Local authorities are .responsible for the other roads.   For those designated asprincipal roads, totalling some 1,500 miles, the Welsh Officeprovide, by way of specific grant, 75 per cent of the cost of construction and improvements   In maintaining such roads, andfor all work done by them on the remaining roads, localauthorities are assisted by the Government&apos;s rate support grants,44a      In planning a road programme for Wales account must be taken of the main directions in which traffic wishes andwill wish to move,   of the present and prospective volumes oftraffic,    and of the character of the topography.   Steepmountain sides and narrow valleys restrict the ohoice ofroute for major highways and make the construction of wideroads singularly expensive, since it is often necessary to diginto the mountainside or to support roads on viaducts.Sometimes topographical features make it impossible to provideroads of desirable standards..lgBJ!9Ze-me^tsi already^made45o       Since the last War road communioations have been improved in all.parts of Wales, though a great deal remains to be donee   The major improvements in trunk roads in existence,in progress or in prospect are shown on Map 2.   The most striking improvements already made have been in industrial
South Wales, where there is nearly three-quarters of thepopulation of Wales.     Along the main west-east route major improvements with dual carriageways made in recent yearscomprise the Heath By-pass;   the Port Talbot By-pass, whichwas the first full urban motorway to be completed in Britain;the Stormy Down widening;   the Cov/bridge By-pass;   the lengthof the Mo4 motorway from a point west of Newport to the severn bridge;   and the Severn Bridge itself, which reduces the roaddistance to the West of England by some 50 miles and gives anew unity to the Severnside area.     The completion of the Headsof the Valleys road has greatly improved communications betweenthe Swansea area and the Midlands, and has opened up to potentialdevelopment the northern parts of the Monmouthshire and Glamorganvalleys.     Substantial progress has been made in the constructionof a new dual carriageway road, of near motorway standard, betweenNewport and Ross, where it connects with, the 1.1.50 Ross Spur motor-way leading to M.5s   this major new route may. well mean as much tothe future prosperity of South Wales as the M.4. and the severn bridge.     In North Wales, there have been major improvements onthe main through route, including the Penyclip Improvement, thenew Conway Bridge, the widening at Lianddula.8   on A.55? the AstonHill and Ewloe Diversion   and the Queensferry By-pass on A.494&quot;The Programme for Trunk Roads46.        The programme of construction nov; inprogress^, or planned for the period up to the early1970&apos;s, includes farther major schemes in both South and north wales,     On the main east-west route in the south, the mostserious remaining bottleneck is Cardiff itself;   congestion here will be partly relieved by the construction of Eastern Avenue,which is expected to begin late in 1967*     Farther to the west,the programme includes a by-pass at Morriston andthe third and final section of the Carmarthen diversion.     The
south-north trunk road between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil,possibly the most overloaded road in Wales, is programmed for earlyimprovement as far as Abercynonj   and work on an extension ofthe Manor lay dual carriageway, to carry it northwards toNantgarw, will begin in 1968.   The western end of the newHeads of the valleys road will benefit from a by-pass atGlyn-Neath, and from a new road linking Aberdulais with the KeathBy-pass at Llandarcy.   The programme includes the remaining stages of the important new road between Newport and Ross.These schemes will considerably speed up road communicationsboth within South Wales and with the main centres of population in England, where the remaining sections of the M.4 motorwaybetween the Severn Bridge and London should be completed by1971*47 s.  In North Wales, further major work now under construction onthe A.55 includes the Llandudno Junction Ely-over, the Llanddulasdiversion and Abergele By-pass, and a widening to dualcarriageways between Tai&quot;r Meibion and Aber;    and theSta, Asaph By-pass is planned to start in 1967.   Elsewhere in north Wales the main programmed scheme is the Wrexham By-pass onA.483.   These schemes will help to relieve further the acutetraffic congestion in North Wales, chiefly experienced in the summer monthsp and to meet the needs of new development there.In Wales as a whole, the schemes in the present programme will increase the mileage of dual carriageway roads to 120 miles.Improvements on a smaller scale to other trunk roads ofimportance to the more sparsely populated areas which they servewill be made at many places throughout Wales.Principal Roads48.     Many improvements have also been carried out, andmany more are in progress and programmed, on principal roads forwhich local authorities are responsible.   The most notableexamples of what has been done are, at Newport, the george street Bridge and its approach roads which gave a second road
crossing of the River Usks and the Ringland Way industrial road between A.48 at Coldra and Corporation Road;   at Swansea, the eastside approach road linking the town with A.48 near Briton Ferry;the Pontypridd Town Centre Diversion (A.4058);   and the BridgendInner By-pass,,   The more important schemes now in progressinclude the Llantrisant By-pass (A.4119), the reconstruction ofthe bridge carrying Penarth Road (A.4I60) over the River Taffat Cardiff, the improvement along the canal between Crumlinand Pant Bridge (Ae467) in Monmouthshire and the Bagillt By-pass(A. 548) on the Rhyl-Chester road in Flintshire.   Noteworthyschemes which are programmed for an early start are theAbercrave-Onllwyn link road in Breconshire, a new road inCardiff to link Eastern Avenue with A.48 at Rumney Bridge, the widening of Newport Road A048 in Cardiff, and the constructionof a new approach road to Porthcawl (A.4106).Cost of Works in Prpgre^s^^qi^rogrammed49a The estimated cost of the schemes in progress orprogrammed is  49 million for trunk roads and  15 million forprincipal roads.   Their completion will mean a considerable improvement in the road communications of Wales by the early19708s, though the expected growth in traffic will, as inEngland, present a continuing problem.Further Plans for the 1970&apos;sas possible of the existing serious points of congestion and delay on the trunk roads which provide the main industrial and tourist routes.Regard will be had to the expected growth of trafficas industry and tourism are developed, and to theeffect of rail closures.(b)   There will be a steady programme designed tobring other lengths of existing narrow and tortuoustrunk roads, which are to be found in all parts of wales, up to the highest practical standard.   Theseroads often have a carriageway no more than 16 feet50 .The programme for the, 19705s will have fivemain objectives:-(a)   Schemes will be prepared to remove as many
wide, and will wherever possible be widened to atleast 24 feet and improved in other ways to give better visibility, less severe curves, and easiergradients,,   In this way all parts of wales should experience a substantial improvement inmain communications.   Foreseeable traffic on someof the trunk roads in Mid and West Wales cannotjustify the provision of dual carriageways on them;   but with the improvements the Governmenthave in mind, traffic should be able to proceedsafely at a reasonable speed.(c) The Government will continue to make grants to local authorities for the improvement of their principal roads, which play an important part inWelsh communications.(d) There will be a programme designed to improve the standard of urban roads, particularly in thelarger towns, where the problems of congestionare likely to be greatest.   It will not be practicable to remove all bottlenecks here and a compromise will have to be found between the needsof traffic and of local environment.   A substantial contribution to the freeing of the flow of trafficwill have to be made by imaginative schemes oftraffic management.(e) It will be necessary to carry out schemesrequired to improve communications to new industrial or population growth points where specialconsiderations affecting traffic growth and roadneeds arise.   This will not in itself require manynew roads additional to those already planned but,beyond the existing programme, it may be necessaryto bring forward the timing of some schemes andto provide roads to a higher standard than would be
justified merely on the basis of normal trafficincreases.   An example of one new road that isrequired is one from the present termination ofthe M.4 Motorway to the Bridgend area, referredto in paragraph 53(h) below.   This would serve a useful purpose in providing an outer by-pass to Cardiff, in relieving congestion on
the A.48 road between Cardiff and Bridgend, and in speeding upcommunications with West South Wales .   It would also be needed to serve major residential and industrial development atLlantrisant.51*     It will be necessary for the Welsh Office to plan this programme in such a way as to have a measure of flexibility in deciding which works are to be undertaken from year to year, both to meet changes in actual need which unforeseeable events will no doubt bring andto match the resources which can be devoted to highwayimprovements.   There will therefore be a two-stage procedure.First, a pool of schemes will be prepared to the point where thenecessary statutory procedures have been completed, the land to be acquired has been accurately defined, and their costs and likely benefits can be more precisely assessed.   Then, on thebasis of this information schemes will be drawn from the poolinto the firm programme as they can be undertaken.52.       The Secretary of State for Wales has already announced the first major trunk and principal road schemes in the pool.   These are:-(a) North WalesTrunk roadsPrincipal roads(iii)     A.541   Mold By-pass and Llong Crossing.(b) South WalesTrunk roads(iv)A.48    Pyle By-pass in Glamorgan.A.48    Improvement in West Cardiff.(vi)(vii)A.4042 Llantarnam By-pass.A.465   Aberdulais-Llandarcy new road.A.4076 Haverfordwest Southern By-passin Pembrokeshire.
Principal roads(ix) A.48/A.i(J0if2    Old Green Crossing koundaboutand Underpass at Newport.(x) h*k&amp;l    Newport-Brynmawr Road;   improvementfrom Pant Bridge at Newbridgeto Abercarn.(xi) Cardiff  First priority schemes in the redevelopment of the centralarea of the City.The present estimated cost of these schemes, togetherwith smaller schemes in the pool, is  19 million for trunk roads and  8 million for principal roads.53 &amp;    Looking yet further ahead, the objective, as seen at present,will be to implement the following broad programme for trunk roads:-South WalesV(a) providing dual carriageways along most of theA.48/A.AO road as far west as St. Clears;(b) a new road from the existing end of the M.4 Motorway to theBridgend area, providing an outer by-pass to Cardiff;(0) completing the new road between Raglan andNeath via the Heads of the Valleys road;(d) providing substantial lengths of dualcarriageway on the A.40 road betweenAbergavenny and Carmarthen via Brecon;(a) completing the dualling of theCardiff-Merthyr road A.470;(f) further improving the Newport-Abergavennyroad A.4042;North Wales(g) providing dual carriageways along theA.55 road from Chester to Bangor;(h) cbnitwoting by-passes and lengths ofdual carriageway on the A.5/A.483Swansea-Manchester trunk road fromChirk to the Welsh boundary with Cheshire;(i) constructing by-passes and lengths of dualcarriageway on the A.5 road westwards fromits Junction with A9kB3 to Kolybead;-30-R.O 1 C
( j)   constructing by-passes and lengths of dualcarriageway on the A.494 Dolgellau-Queensferry Road.54. In addition substantial road widening, generally notto dual carriageway standards, and other improvements are planned;in South Wales, on the A.40 road west of St. Clears, the A.477 road between St. Clears and the south of Milford Haven, the A.4076Haverfordwest-Hilford Haven road, and the A.483 Pontardulais-Ammanford-Llandeilo roadj   and in Mid and North Wales, on the A.487Haverf ordwe st-Bangor road, the A.483/A.44 Shrew sbury-Aberystwythroad, and the South-North Wales trunk road and associated link roadsincluding by-passes at Newbridge in Radnorshire and Llanrwst inDenbighshire.55* The estimated cost of all these works is about 200 million.   In bringing schemes first into the preparation pooland then into the firm programme, priority will be given in north Wales to the improvement of the more important sections of theA.55 coast road and of the Swansea-Manchester trunk road A.5/A.483from Chirk to the Welsh boundary with Cheshire.   In South wales the question of priorities is more complex.   The most importantsingle objective is the provision of a new road between the presenttermination of the Mffl4 Motorway at Newport and the Bridgend area.Whilst it is clear in principle that such a new road will be needed, problems arise on the timing and phasing of its construction,particularly in relation to improvements that are also needed tothe western approaches of Cardiff.   Subject to that prioritywill be given to the more important sections of the A.48, theA.4042 Newport-Abergavenny road and the eastern and westernextensions of the Heads of the Valleys Road.   In Mid-Walespriority will be given to the improvement of the Aberystwyth-Shrewsbury road9 the Brecon-Llangurig road and sections of theHaverf ordwe st-Bangor road056c It is not at present possible to indicate in a comparable way the further improvements to principal roadswhich may be undertaken in the 19708s, as these are theresponsibility of local authorities;   but the construction by the
Pembrokeshire County Council of a toll bridge across milford haven to replace the existing unsatisfactory ferry is at an advanced stage of preparation   Although schemes will becarried out in all parts of Wales, the emphasis is likelyto be on urban schemes within the major towns, where improvedprincipal roads will be required to meet traffic demandsforecast by the urban transportation and planning surveyswhich are being carried out at several places.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT57. In the last fifteen years there has been asubstantial reduction of the network of railway services in wales, as in the rest of Britain.     Throughout this period,under growing competition from road transport, there has beena very sharp decline in the proportion of the passenger and freight traffic in Britain carried by rail;   and the financial loss on the railways, with their high fixed costs, has risenso steeply as to make inevitable a drastic pruning of seriouslyunremunerative lines and services.     The railways have aimed to achieve a financial balance by concentrating attention and investment on the traffic for which they are best suited.58. Following a fundamental review of railway policy,the Government have decided that wider considerations than the test of financial viability alone should apply;   and that thefuture pattern of the railway system must be related to thecountry&apos;s economic, social and overall transport needs.    While itmust still be the aim to operate all services economically, anydeficit on passenger services maintained because of their socialnecessity should be borne by the community.    The Governmentand the Railways Board have set up joint machinery to considerthe long-term future financial prospects of the Board;   toexamine the organisation of the railways;   and to devise meansof identifying and costing unremunerative passenger services, sothat the Government can decide which of these should be grant-aided on broad social and economic grounds.    Leglislation will then be introduced to provide a new financial framework for theoperation of the railways.59. In the light of this policy, the Government, inconsultation with the Welsh Economic Council and other economic planning Councils, have determined the size and shape of the basic railway network required to meet both commercial and social needs.    For Wales this comprises, apart from short lines
to be developed for freight only, the following routes to serveboth passenger and freight traffic or passengers only:-(i)   Chester to Holyhead (with branches to Llandudno,Caernarvon and Blaenau Pfestiniog);(ii)   Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth;(iii)   Newport to Shrewsbury!(iv)   The Severn Tunnel to Pishguard and Milford Haven(with branches to Barry, Penarth, Rhymney,Merthyr and Treherbert).The designation of this basic network does notprejudge the future of passenger services on any existing linesnot included in this list, decisions on each of which willcontinue to be reached under the established procedure,including full consultation with the Welsh Economic Councils60o The modernisation and improvement of the continuingrailway network in Wales is being pressed ahead.     considerable progress has already been made in reixLacing obsolete rolling stock, in modernising track, signalling and other equipment andin rationalising the arrangements for goods traffic     Tneseimprovements have led to marked advances in the speed, comfort and safety of main line passenger services between London and North and South Wales, although travel by rail by passengers between North and South Wales is inconvenient.There has also been an improvement in the efficiency of freightservices.     Further substantial investment in the Welsh railway system is already planned.     A liner train depot will come intooperation at Cardiff in the summer of 1967*     Initially, door-to-door goods services will be operated to London.     Planning, inthe light of experience and market research, for later stages ofthe national freight grid will take account of the need forfurther terminals in Wales.    The Railways Board will alsoextend, wherever possible, the arrangements for the carriage of whole train loads of goods between clearly defined points, as
in the services provided for transporting oil refinery productsbetween Milford Haven and the Midlands and steel betweenLlanwern and London.    Through further investment and other measures, the Government intend to ensure that the railways willbe developed to meet the needs of present and future users in wales.6l. Public road transport also requires to be strengthened and improved, particularly in view of the closure of uneconomic rail passenger services,     rJ?he Government arevery conscious that this problem is especially severe in the rural parts of Wales, where, although car ownership is high, many people also need adequate public transport.     They haveaccepited in principle that help from public funds should bemade available to secure that adequate rural bus services are provided and continued.     They propose that local authoritiesshould be empowered to give financial assistance, and theMinistry of Transport empowered to contribute.     The criteria for assessing this financial assistance are being considered inconsultation with the associations of local authorities.     the experiment which is being made in Montgomeryshire of carryingpassengers as well as mail in Post Office vehicles will be watched with interest,-!     - ,62.&apos;        The Government also intend to avoid uneconomiccompetition between rail and road transport, by incorporatingan efficient railways network in an integrated transport system; and thus to secure that the interests of the public arebest served and the most economic use made of the country&apos;resources.     The Welsh Economic Council have given advice onmachinery for the more effective co-ordination of publicpassenger services by road and rail in Wales.     In the light ofthis advice, the Government have set up a Passenger TransportCo-ordinating Committee in Wales, as in other areas, to secureimprovements ;lp these services through the co-operationof transport operators and local
authorities.     The committee is working closely with the WelshEconomic Council, ro that progress towards an integrated public transport system can be related to overall planning objectives in Wales.PORTS63, Ports provide an essential service to industry,and Wales is well served in this respect.     The ports in SouthWales have not been used to full cai^acity for several years,mainly because the coal trade has diminished, but other trade has recently developed.     Total traffic at the five major SouthWales ports now administered by the British Transport Docks Board(Newport, Port Talbot, Cardiff, Swansea and Barry) has recentlyexceeded 20 million tons, which is double the low annual rate towhich it fell immediately after the last War;   and an overallfinancial loss in 0ach post-War year up to I96I has been converted to a profit in all subsequent years.     Further west,at Milford Haven, the new refineries have brought aspectacular rise in oil traffic, as a result of which the porthas become the fourth largest in the United Kingdom in terms oftonnage handled.     Passenger traffic through the british railways&apos; ports of Fishguard and Holyhead is steadily growingand the car ferry iand container traffic through Holyhead hassubstantially increased in recent years.     There are prospects of reviving activity at some of the smaller ports.64.        There is considerable scope for further development to meet demands as they arise.     Studies made by the WelshEconomic Council have shown that extra dock capacity,including deep-water berths, can be provided in South Walesquickly and cheaply.     The National Ports Council, who areresponsible for advising the Minister of Transport on allmajor porj; developments, are also aware of this potential.At Newport, about, 160 acres of land are available for development in the immediate vicinity of the docks,
and a still larger area could be provided for port andindustrial use nearby.    Newport and Swansea have a considerableliner service to all parts of the world? the substantial volumeof iron and steel products for export, which can be stowed asbottom cargo, making the South Wales ports a convenient point of departure for general cargo liners.    The outstanding advantageof the South Wales ports is that, together, they offer a range of facilities^ combined with an amount of surplus capacity,whichcannot be found at other existing ports.65.       What has mainly stood in the way of realising thispotential has been the lack of an industrial hinterlandproducing a sufficient demand for importing and exportingfacilities to replace the former trade in coal.    This has made it difficult to arrange for full loads in the same way as atLondon and Liverpool, which serve large concentrations of population and industry.     Specialised traffic through theSouth Vales ports in iron ore, steel, oil and oil products,timber and fruit has risen steadily, but there has been lesssuccess in attracting large volumes of general cargo066.       This problem is now decreasing.    The growth of manufacturing industry in South Wales has generated a usefulamount of new traffic for the ports which should increase in theyears ahead.     A second important factor is that the road links between the South Wales coast and the motorway system Via the severn Bridge and the Ross Spur will widely extend the area which the ports of South East Wales can economically serve;while those further west will benefit from the Heads of theValleys road and the progressive improvement of the A.48trunk route.67.      In order to take advantage of growing opportunities,the South Wales ports are adapting their facilities to serve new types of vessel and cargo.     Coal traffic has, for instance,been concentrated at Barry and Swansea, releasing the old coalloading quays elsewhere for other forms of trade;   but this and
other sjoare capacity cannot be put to profitable use withoutextensive schemes of modernisation and development,     A large and growing programme of investment is meeting this need.-Since 1963? works to the value of over  4i million have beencompleted;   and further schemes which will cost the british transport Docks Board more than  20 million were in progressat the end of 19 66.     These include the new iron-ore terminal,at Port Talbdt, costing  17*7 million,&apos; of which  13*7 million will be borne by the Board.      Works costing ove.r  8*5 millionhave recently been completed or are in hand at Newport( 4*6 million), Swansea ( 1.9 million), Cardiff ( 1,6 million)and Barry ( 435*COOj*      With these works the Board areaiming both to serve existing traffic more efficiently and to attract new cargo to the ports?     Among schemes to fosteradditional trade are one  for- the deepening of the channelcosting  if.203,000 to improve access to the Queen Alexandra Dock,,Cardiff, and the new quay under construction at South Dock,Newport, which will provide two modern berths,, one principallyfor timber and timber products and the other either as acontainer terminal or for handling conventional cargo ships.68,,       Future schemes proposed by the British transport docks Board for the South Wales group of ports would involveincreasing annual expenditure on them from an. average of  2.4 million in 1964-66 to 7*25   . million in the period 1967-70./These proposals include the iron-ore terminal at ITskmouth,expected to cost  12.3 million, of which  606 million would beborne by the board     In addition to its primary purpose of serv-ing the steel industry, this scheme would make available for.other traffic accommodation at Newport now used for theimport of iron-orey^     The Board&apos;s proposals also includeplans for the expenditure of nearly    &quot;( million
at the South Wales ports, including some  1.9 million atCardiff,  1.7 million at Newport,  1.5 million at Barry and 1.3 million at Swansea.      Although the precise pattern of portdevelopment which will be required to service the use ofcontainers and purpose-built container ships is not yetclear, Welsh industry may be expected to benefit from this new form of transport.
AIR COMMUNICATIONS69.      There has been an encouraging development of air transport facilities serving Wales in recent years.   The three main airports ofGlamorgan (Rhoose), Swansea (Fairwood Common) and Hawardenhave developed very substantially, and between them provide a growingrange of domestic and international scheduled services, as well asnumerous inclusive tour and other charter services.   The prospects for continuing development are favourable.Aerodromes79 e     Glamorgan (Rhoose) is owned and operated by the GlamorganCounty Council.   There are two tarmac runways, 1,382 and 1,128 metresin length, and a grass strip of 826 metres.   Navigational aids includevery high-frequency direction finding equipment, a non-directionalradic beacon and radar equipment.   Air traffic control services atGlamorgan are provided by the Government at an ^/estimated/&apos; net costin 1966/67 of  109,000, which is expeoted to increase to  150,000 by1970/71.   At present, scheduled passenger services, both domestic and international, are operated from Glamorgan by British Midland Airways,Cambrian Airways, Dan-Air Services and Aer Lingus, using Viscount and d.C.3 Pionair aircraft.   Numerous inclusive tour charter services arealso operated during the summer season.   The extension of the runwaywhich is planned would enable larger aircraft, such as the BAC.111,Trident and Caravelle, to use the airport.   New passenger buildings andan instrument landing system are also planned.   Between i960 and 1966,the number of passengers carried by scheduled services rose from 63,000to 156,000, the bulk being terminal passengers.   There were some 49,000passengers, mainly terminal, carried on charter services in 1966.   Some500 tons of freight were also carried.71.     Swansea (Fairwood Common) is owned and operated by SwanseaCounty Borough Council.   There are three conorete or tarmac runways of965, 966 and 1,472 metres in length and navigational aids include very
high-frequency direction finding equipment, a non-directionalradio beacon and radar equipment.   Future plans provide for thebuilding of an additional hangar and a motel.   Scheduled servioes on domestic and international routes are operated by Cambrian Airways,Dan-Air Services and Morton Air Services, using Heron and D.C.3Pionair aircraft;   and the aerodrome is capable of handling largeraircraft, such as Viscounts.   During the summer season, inclusive tourcharter flights are operated to holiday centres.   The number of passengers, mainly terminal, using the aerodrome rose between I960and 1966 from 4,700 to 13,500.72.       Hawarden Aerodrome is operated by the Hawker Siddeley AviationCompany. There are two concrete runways, 1,437 and 1,004 metres in length,and navigational aids include very high-frequency direotion findingequipment and radar equipment.   Scheduled services on domestic routes,are operated by British Eagle International Airways, using Viscountaircraft, and inclusive tour charter services are operated each summer.Plans for the development of the aerodrome are under considerationby Hawker Siddeley and include an extension of the main runway and theconstruction of a new terminal building.   The number of passengers,more than half of them terminal passengers, using Hawarden rose from some 22s000 in 1963 to nearly 40,000 in 1966.   A further 3,000passengers were carried by charter services in 1966.   Some 220 tons of freight were also carried.73.    As regards the rest of Wales, it would be difficult, apartfrom the limitations imposed by geography, to justify the very high costof establishing additional airports until the demand for air servicesreaches a level sufficient to support the introduction of scheduled services on a fully eoonomic basis.   Experience in other parts of theUnited Kingdom suggests that a population of 150,000 within a 15 mileradius is the minimum needed to sustain suoh a demand.   The provisionof aerodromes is a matter mainly for local authorities or other interests concerned.   The existing aerodromes are well sited to serve
main centres &amp;f population in Wales;   they are considerably under-utilised at present and offer ample scope for expansion of air transport,To help meet the demand for landing facilities for occasionaluse by executive aircraft in areas remote from airports, the Servicesairfields at Valley in Anglesey and Brawdy in Pembrokeshire have beenmade available for use by civil aircraft with the prior permission ofthe station commanders, who will normally grant it provided that &apos;interference with Service use of the airfields can be avoided.Air Services75 e    Table 2 lists the domestic and international scheduled services advertised from Welsh airports in the summer of 1966 and early in 1967*TABLE 2&quot;Scheduled Air ServicesDomestic services between CARDIFF	OPERATOR	[ Weekly Frequencies&quot;]	and:-		Aug&apos;66       Feb*67	Bristol	Dan Air Services Ltd	12	, 5Isle Of Man	it      ti         it           tt	1	Liverpool	tt      tt         tt           tt	10	5Newcastle	tt      tt         tt           tt	10	5Middle sbrough	tt     tt          tt           it	2	2Belfast	Cambrian Airways Ltd	7	Bristol	^          tt           tt	31	Glasgow	tt          tt           tt	5	Guernsey	w          w            n	15	6Jersey	tt                  tt                    .,!!	27	7Liverpool	It                  tt                      It	3	-Manchester	tt                  tt                     tt	5	10Swansea	tt                  tl                     tt	1	-Between SWANSEA			I ands-			1   Cardiff	Cambrian Airways Ltd	1	Jersey	M                  tt                   It	3	I   Exeter	Morton Air Services	7	-Guernsey	it       tt          tt	3	London	tt      tt          tt	6	5Plymouth	n      tt          it	2	-Isle of Man	Dan Mr Services	1	Between HAWARDEN1			ands-			London	British Eagle Inter-			national Airways Ltd.	11       I	10      j

Development of air services is, subjeot to licensing,primarily a matter for the commercial judgement of airlines.   Where a worthwhile demand exists or can reasonably be foreseen, airline companiesusually respond to it with enterprise and are prepared to take a goodmeasure of risk to build up traffic.   Licensing decisions (except onappeals which are decided by the Board of Trade) are the responsibilityof the independent Air Transport Licensing Board.   They and the Boardof Trade are very oonscious of the importance of air services to regional development, and the Government have often affirmed, without prejudice to individual licensing decisions, their sympathy for genuine newservices for Wales provided there is the traffic to justify them.   TheGovernment&apos;s general policy in this field is one of expansion.77,     The Welsh Advisory Committee for Civil Aviation plays animportant role in encouraging the development of Welsh air transport facilities.   It has the important statutory duty of advising the air transport Licensing Board upon licence applications affecting Wales, inthe light of local circumstances and requirements.   It also considersWelsh oivil aviation questions generally including those concerningaerodromes, and in 1965 its terms of reference in this re spe ct we restrengthened to enable it to keep a olose watch on the adequacy and quality of Wel3h air services.   The Committee work3 in close touch withlooal authorities, business organisations, other bodies interested in air transport and the Welsh Economio Council, with which it has some commonmembership. -^2&quot;
CHAPTER.....VHITMAN RESOURCES78*       The greatest resource of Wales is its people?     only if they are properly employed will the principality prosper as it should and make its full contribution to the wealth of Great Britain.70^     How many people are there?    What do they do?Who comes to Wales?    Whs leaves?     The answers to thesequestionsi will indicate how the size and composition ofthe population may change during the next few years.     Onthat basis, an attempt will then be made in this Chapterto assess the possible size of the employee population in1971 and to compare that with such indication as it is practicable to give of the demand for labour in that year.Population Jba 1^6680s 1     The &apos;homef population of Wales in the middleof 1966 is estimated by the Registrar General to have been2,701,200*     This was 48,000 more than   four years earlierand 112,000 more than in 1951*     The rate of growth has beenquickening from an annual increase of under 4,000 in theearly 1950ss to an average of about 13,000 between mid 1963and mid 1966,     The natural increase (i.e, the excess of births over deaths) between 1951 and I96S was 144,000 and,allowing for changes in the number in the armed forces,the difference between the natural increase and the actualincrease reveals a net outward migration of 43,000 fromWales over the fifteen year period.     The rate of the netoutflow has, however, been falling steadily from 5,500annually in the early 1950*s to virtually nil since 1962.8l0      In South Wales the rate of net migration losshas fallen from around 3,500 a year in the early 1950*s to approximately 2,300 a year since 1956, while within SouthWales there was, over the whole period, an average net
movement of nearly 3*000 annually to the coastal plain andan average net annual loss of 5*500 from the rest of thearea, mainly from the central and eastern valleys,,     in north-East Wales the net flow has switched from an average annual loss of 1,000 up to 1956 to an average gain of 400a year between 1962 and 1966.     In the North-West Wales coastalarea there has been a progressive increase in the rate of net inward migration, the annual net inflow having gone up from 600 in the early 1950*s to 1,900 between I962 and1966.       In the remainder of North-West Wales and in central and West Wales it is only since 1962 that there has been any significant falling off in the outward flow, the combined loss having declined from around 1,500 a year before that date to 500 a year since,, .  These trends are shown indetail in Tables A, 3 and C in the Appendix.Population in 197182ffl Any estimates of future population must bebased on a series of assumptions regarding two elements, namelynatural increase and migration, and must therefore bespeculative.     Fluctuations in the rate of natural increasehave an immediate effect on the rate of population growth,although there will of course be a time lag of at least sixteenyears before any change in the birth rate has much- effect onthe supply of labour.     Changes in&quot;the rates of migration, onthe other hand, have a direct effect on both the populationtotal and the availability of labour.     Moreover, it is not onlythe level of net migration which is important but also therelative composition of the inward and outward flows.Although there has been little total net loss throughmigration since 196-2, there is evidence from information relating to earlier years indicating that there is a considerablnet outflow of persons in the younger age groups whichis offset by a net inflow of persons in older age groups.-i.A-
The I96I Census 10 per cent sample provides a measure ofthese flows during the year preceding the Census and revealsthat the loss \as particularly marked in the 15 - 24 age group where it was proportionately well in excess of the comparable figures for any of the English Regions.     Losses inthe younger and middle working age groups (i.e. 15 - 44)reduce the manpower immediately availables   they also affectthe birth rate, and so ultimately reduce the future population and the potential labour supply.83.        Vigorous policies for the introduction ofnew and more varied employment opportunities should go along way towards countering the encouragement to migrationresulting from the run-down in the coal milling and steel industries, but up to 1971 some net outflow from Yfales ofpersons of working age may continue.     The rising trend of retirement migration into coastal areas particularly in North-west wales is expected to continue, although the increment to thetotal population from this source, up to 1971* Is likely to be small.     On the assumption of nil net migration for Wales as awhole, but on certain assumptions regarding the continuingloss from the working age groups   and gains to the non-working age groups, the Registrar General estimates thatduring the period I966 to 1971 the population of Wales vailincrease by 91,000 to a figure of &apos;2,792,000, and thatthis will include 1,010,000 males and 1,100,000 femalesaged 15 years and over0Population in 198184. The Registrar General estimates that by 1981the population will have grown to 2,9519 000.     this figure, which implies a population of 3 million by the
early 1980&apos;s, may well be exceeded as a result of anincreased rate of inward migration to North and Mid wales which may occur in the 1970ss and also because the economic policies which the Government have already adopted should enable a greater proportion of those who wish to work in wales to do so and thereby reduce the loss by migration ofthe younger age groups0     Moreover this does not allow forany movement of population into Wales, on Severnside and perhaps Deeaide, which may take place if the study of those areas which has been put in hand leads to decisions by theGovernment for large scale development there to provide forsome of the natural growth in the population of GreatBritain^85*     There will be found in Tables      E and F inthe Appendix, mid-year figures over the period 1956 to1966 for the total employees   (i0e. the employed andunemployed), the registered wholly unemployed, and employees in employment (i0e0 total employees lessregistered wholly unemployed)e     The Appendix also containsTables showing the distribution of employees in employmentin 1961 and I966 as between industries (Table G);   thedistribution of employees in employment in the different areas of Wales as between the main industrial sectors overthe period 1950-65 (Table H);   and activity rates (Table i).None of these Tables includes the self-employed or the armed forces0860       This material shows that, despite the progress made after the War and the vigorous steps taken by theGovernment since 1964, *ne best use is still not beingmade of the human resources of &apos;iffales*     The evidence forthis is two-folds     in the first place unemployment rates
are high, and in the second place activity rates(i.e. the proportion which total employees constitute ofthe home population aged 15 and over) are relatively low.Tiiis is the basic challenge and opportunity    we have today087.        During the decade 1956-66 the total employees in Great Britain as a whole grew by 8.4 per cent, while in Wales they increased by only 5.3 per cent.     Moreover, thewhole of the Welsh increase was in female employment;   thefigure for male employees in June I966 was lower by some 4?000(0*7 per cent) in Wales than that for June 1956, whereas inGreat Britain the number of male employees rose during theperiod by 5*7 per cent.     Among females the rise in Wales was20*2 per cent compared with 13*5 per cent in Great Britain,88.     It will also be seen that the rate of unemploymentin Wales over the past ten years has been consistently much higher than in the country as a whole.     It has hovered at between one and a half and twice the national rate.     Withapproximately 4*3 per cent of the employees in Great Britain,Wales has suffered in recent years from between 6 per cent and 9 per cent of national unemployment.     This bearsparticularly on those aged over 45*Disablement890     A special problem in Wales is the incidence of disablement.     This has been heavier than inthe rest of the country, largely because Wales has had ahigh proportion of its workers in heavy industries with high injury and sickness rates and these industries providefewer opportunities for disabled workers.   In Great Britainan average of 10,7 per cent of the unemployed are registered as disabled, while in &quot;Wales the comparable figure is 13.0 per cent;
and the problem is heightened because many of theunemployed disabled are the older men.      the incidence of disablement should drop with theadoption of modern methods in heavy industries andas the proportion of the employee populationengaged in other occupations increases.     Bycareful job selection and by using industrial rehabilitation and training facilities as necessary,the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministryof Labour&apos; aim to place disabled persons in work in open industry as far as this is possible.     until recently there was only one industrial rehabilitation Unit in Wales, at Cardiff, butanother has now been opened at Port Talbot, whichis specially concerned with redundant coal miners.These units greatly enhance the prospects ofresettling the disabled, as well as redundantworkers and able-bodied people who have beenwithout work for some time, through rehabilitationand by introducing them to new industrial occupations.    For those too severely disabledto secure employment in open industry, shelteredemployment is provided in Remploy factories andin the increasing number of workshops maintained by local authorities and voluntary bodies, manyof which undertake work on contract from localindustry.     Disability itself need not excludeworkers from contributing fully to the nation&apos;slabour requirements and disabled workers provided with rehabilitation and training services within
industry as well as by G-overnment centres form a valuable part of the labour force.     Theproportion of disabled persons employed in openindustry in Wales is already higher than else-where and the growth of new industry will helpfurther progress.Youth Employment90*      There is a disturbing lack of employment opportunities for young people in Wales in comparisonwith those for their contemporaries elsewhere.     Thisis strikingly illustrated by the ratios of unfilledvacancies to unemployed young persons.     In December1966 there were, in Great Britain, 184 unfilledvacancies to each hundred wholly unemployed boysand 337 &quot;to each hundred wholly unemployed girls:in Wales, the figure for boys was only 36 and thatfor girls 38.     For school leavers, the consequenceis slower absorption into employments     in December1966^2.1 per cent of Welsh summer school leaverswere still without their first jobs, compared with0.4 per cent nationally.     It also means that itis more difficult to ensure that; young people take up work for which they are best suited, and that unemployment and migration among them is so high.
Activity Rates91*      Relatively low activity rates are a secondindication that human resources are under-used.     Because ofspecial regional characteristics activity rates In all areas will never be equalo     Wales, with its own establishedpattern of life, the scattered population in the rural areas with transport difficulties, and a high proportion of self-employed workers, is unlikely to have employee activityrates as high as those in England.     The high proportion of personsover 15 who remain in full-time education (despite the long termadvaatagas of this) depresses the-raies, particularly in wales.     As will be seen from Table I in the Appendix, theestimated employee activity rate in Wales in mid-1966 forall persons aged 15 and over was 485 per cent, that formales was 6f-g per cent and that for females 30? per cent:the corresponding figures for Great Britain were 57?, 7^and 40? per cent.     The rates for males have declinedcontinuously between 196l and 1966 both in Great Britainand in Wales, but more rapidly in Wales.     On the otherhand, the corresponding rates for females have increased and the rate of increase has been faster in Wales0     Thispoints to the existence of reserves, mainly female, which,in a more congenial economic climate, could serve to raisethe female activity rate and slow down the decline in feemale activity rate in Wales.     The unused reserves are a loss to the Principality&apos;s wealth and to the national economy,,Supply of Labour in 1971 92ffl     The general picture painted of Wales as comparedwith Great Britain as a whole is therefore of a smaller proportion of employees in the population, a higher proportion of unemployed, and an employee population whichhas been growing more slowly.     The number of male employeeshas been relatively static and indeed tending to declinein Wales.*a*50jM*
93-      An attempt has been made, on the basis of the trendsshown in the period 1956-1966 and other information, to assesson certain assumptions what may be the total number of employees in 1971 and the possible employment prospects in that year.Estimating is particularly difficult In this field, because manyof the factors likely to be relevant are not susceptible to accuratemeasurement, and no approach to precision is practicable.     Theestimates are only required to give a broad indication ofthe position   on the basis of possible trends^ so thatGovernment action can be directed towards reducing the gap between the supply of and the demand for labour,,94.       In attempting to calculate the availability of labour in 1971? the starting point must be the population projections.As has been said in paragraph 83 , in 1971 the population of Walesaged 15 and over is expected to include about.1,010,000 males and about 1,100,000 females.     How many of these will be in the employee population will depend in part on their age distribution,and in this connection the character of movements into and out of wales is important.     It is expected that migration will have little effect on the total size of the population up to 1971?the movement into Wales of mostly older people being balanced byan outward movement of younger workersg    so the potential numberof workers is likely to be less than if there were no migrationeither into or out of Wales.95o       The demand for labour and its availability areinter-related, and the making of any assumption as to activityrates is hazardous.   If economic activity increases, thedemand for labour rises, and the number of employees and soactivity rates will be higher than they would otherwise be; andthe converse is also true.     If demand does not grow, potentialworkers may remain in or return to inactivity or self-employment or may migrates   they will not necessarily become registered
unemplc-yedL   To some extent, demand itself will depend on supply?unless there is a reasonable expectation that labour of the kind?in the quantity, and in the places required will be forthcoming,potential demand may not materialise into jobs,     In a favourableeconomic climate, activity rates are likoly to be high and unemployment low, while in adverse circumstances low&quot;activityrates are likely to bo associated with higher unemployment,,,....96*,,The changing age structure of the population, the increasing proportion of married women and the tendency towardsearlier retirement will continue to depress activity ratesthroughout Groat Britain,,     The proposed raising of theschool-leaving age in 1971 will also lower thorn below what thoywould otherwise be %   in Wales it will do so less than in GreatBritain as a whole because young people in Wales already tend to stay longer at school, but the effect in Wales may be to loweractivity rates by up to one per cent.     In these circumstances,even to maintain the 1966 activity rates in Y/ales of 67-g- per cent for males and 3C&quot;g&quot; per cent for females would really represent asubstantial improvement.     As was said in paragraph 91? the activity rate for males has been falling;   and, because of agedistribution, self-employment, the raising of the school-leaving age, and the social factors which affect activity rates in&apos; Wales,it is likely in 1971 to be lower than in 1966w     It is hoped,however, that by 1971 it will have fallen less sharply than inrecent years and less sharply than seems likely in Great britain as a whole.     Moreover, for the purpose of the calculation made inthis Chapter, it is appropriate to assume a good demand for labourand consequently high activity rates.     On this basis and for thepurpose of this- calculation, an activity rate for males of 67per cent is assumed, which would mean a male employee population(employed and unemployed) of about 675,000,^52-
97.    The activity rate for females is lower in Wales thanin any other part of Groat Britain, but it has been rising moresharply than in Great Britain as a whole?   and there is evidentscope for more females to be drawn into employment if the opportunities existed.     It is expected that the rate for GreatBritain will fall by 1971? because of the increased proportion of married women and because the number of girls entering the labour force will be lower than in recent years   but that the rate for wales will continue to rise from its 1966 level of 30-g- Vox cent,although more slowly.     It is proposed to assume for the purposeof this calculation that by 1971 the rate could reach about32 per cent, if the demand for female labour in that year is sufficiently high to coax that number into employment.     Thiswould moan a female employee population (employed and unemployed)of about 350,000,98.     In considering any forward projection of labour supplyand hence tho likely demand for employment opportunities, it isnecessary to adjust the estimates ef tho total number of employeesmade in paragraphs 96 and 97 to take account of those who aremoving from one job to another, with possibly an interval forretraining in between, those affected by short term fluctuations in demand, and those who because of age or disability have difficulty in obtaining employment.     What deductions in thecircumstances of Wales should be made on these accounts from theestimates of the employee population in 1971 is speculative.For the purpose of this calculation, it is proposed to assumo that .the number of males effectively available for employment at anyone time will be about 660,000, and that the effectiveavailability of female labour will be about 345,000.Demand for Labour in 197199*      An attempt has also been made to forecast the demandfor labour in Wales in 1971 on the basis of recent trends, as
somodified by the information available and policy decisions asthey stood in March 1967&quot;     For some of the industrial sectorsmost significant to Wales, such as the coal and steel industries,estimates can be ventured on the basis of the existing plans ofthe industries.     Something is also known of increases likelyto take place in the manufacturing field as a result of the continuing operation of the Industrial Development Act 1966,Over much of the remainder of the economy it is possible onlyto project trends and to modify them in the light of what maybe known.     On this admittedly uncertain basis, the number ofemployment opportunities likely to be available in 1971 may be ofthe order of 640,000 to 650,000 for males and 350,000 for-females,compared with about 664,000 and 323,000 in mid-1966 s   this isnotwithstanding the progress so far made in implementing the policies adopted since 1964*     This assessment is based partly on impressions and assumptions, is subject to an unknown margin of error, and no claim at all can be ratio  to precision.Different assumptions would produce different results.Nevertheless, it is only by attempting such an assessment thatthe order of the size of the problem of providing work for thelabour available can be broadly defined and thus a basis forpolicy be given*Conclusion100.      Relating the estimates of effectively available supply of and the demand for labour to each other, it appearsthat for females they should in 1971 be roughly in balance at .a level of 345?000-350,000? with rising demand for female labourprobably having the effect of drawing into the employeepopulation some who would othor\vise remain inactive, thusenabling demand to be fully met.     For males, on the other hand,developments foreseen in March 19^7 seem likely to be inadequate to provide employment for all those effectively available on the
assumptions made.   The mean of the employment opportunities for males in 1971 estimated in paragraph   99 (645,000) fallsshort of the number of male workers estimated in paragraph 98as being effectively available (about 660,000) by around 15,000.As has already been stressed, this calculation is impreciseand has been made only to enable the broad magnitude of theproblem to be assessed;   what is clear is that the employment opportunities available for men in Wales in the early 1970&apos;S would, in the absence of action additional to that envisaged inMarch 1967, be inadequate on a quite substantial scale.   Ifthis situation in fact developed, the consequences would be,for a large number of men, a combination of withdrawal from and a reduced inflow into the employment field, of unemployment at a level higher than that resulting from the factorsreferred to in paragraph 98, and of migrationa   All theseconsequences would involve loss to the economy of Wales, andall except the last to that of Great Britain as a whole.101.       For planning purposes, it is desirable to have, notonly an estimate of the size of the problem, but also an indication of the localities where it is likely to arise mostacutely.   The main impact of reduced demand for labour ^nagriculture, coal and steel will be in the rural and coalfieldareas and in some of those with large steel plants.   Theintroduction of new industries is easiest and is taking placefastest in the South-East and North-East parts of WalesQThe largest unemployment difficulties therefore face men living inthe area within fifteen miles or so of Swansea, in the Rhondda, insome of the other mining valleys, and in some of the westerlyrural districts.   It is in these places,  or within reasonabledaily travelling distance of them,that fresh employment opportunities are needed.
102.      It is,&quot;therefore, the Government&apos;s intention tomake every effort to increase the employment opportunities in wales, as in other development areas.     Since the review of thesituation made in March ISlSf, they have made a number of decisions which are described in later Chapters.103.      Although the needs of the future have beendiscussed in this Chapter in quantitative terms, that is not all that matters.     The resources must not only be fullyused, but effectively used.     There will be problems ofredeployment, of the adoption of new technology, and oftraining.     These are considered in Chapter VIII.
PART TWO - MATERIAL PROSPERITYCHAPTER VITRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES104.        Having described in Part One the framework of the economy of Wales, the changes which it has undergone, thenatural and human resources available, the water resources andthe situation regarding communications, it is convenient to turn to the uses made of these resources and first of all tothe industries of Wales.   This Chapter will deal with the traditional industries of agriculture, coal and steel;    and chapter VII with the holiday industry.   Chapter VIII will cover new manufacturing industry including the oil industry,the measures taken by the Government to promote manufacturing industry, the provision of industrial sites, productivity,technological development, industrial training and exportpromotion, which affect all production industry.AGRICULTURE. FISHERIES AND FORESTRYThe Contribution of Agriculture105.        Farming will make a growing contribution to thecountry&apos;s food requirements, if the favourable trends of recentyears are maintained.   Encouraged by the Agriculture Act of 1947and other Government measures for the support and developmentof agriculture, the industry in Wales has undergone much change and has achieved considerably greater output and efficiency;but further improvements are needed in the interests of both theBritish economy and Welsh farmers themselves.106.        Home agriculture can make its best contribution to national economic growth through a selective expansion programme,in which meat production is particularly important.   During thenext few years there will be scope for more home supplies of mutton, lamb and pigmeat, but particularly of beef;   and as
about two-thirds of the United Kingdom&apos;s production of beefcomes from the dairy herd, more beef will entail more milkoThis in turn, after meeting requirements for liquid milk and fresh cream, will supply a substantial part of the additional demand for milk products.   The implications are very import antsthe total receipts of Welsh agriculture, including subsidies, are estimated as ourrently in the region of  100-125million a year, and about three-quarters of this is obtainedfrom livestock products.   Welsh farmers can therefore look forward to an expanding market.107. The livestock population has been rising sharplyduring the past few years:   between 19&amp;4 and 1966 the number of cattle rose by 10 per cent and of sheep by about 8 per cent,reaching record levels of over I3 million cattle and over65 million sheep in June I966.   Even pigs, which decreased byalmost 37,000 in 1966, were still about the same in number asin 1964o   Despite a decline in the number of milk producers,milk output in the year ending 31st December 1966, at 256million gallons, was less than one per cent down on the previous year.   A continuation of upward trends in cattle and sheep,reinforced by measures referred to below, will enable Welshfarmers to play a valuable part in meeting the nation8sincreasing food requirements.The Size of Holdings108.   There are about 48,000 holdings in Wales.   Even amongthe 24,000 full-time holdings, there are a large number which,on account of meagre acreage or indifferent land or both, can never provide a satisfactory livelihood.   In some years thenet income from many Welsh farms may be less than the wages of a farm-worker.   Even on farms on better land the inoome is often low and leaves little margin for increased capital investment.   With the increasing pressure of competition, itseems inevitable that many of the farms which yield a poorreturn will cease to exist as separate units.
109.   This structural weakness is evident from changes which have already taken plaoe*   Between 1951 (when the totalnumber of holdings was about 56,W)0) and 1966, approximately5,900 holdings under 20 acres and 2,700 holdings between 20 and50 acres disappeared, and there was an increase of about 850in the number of holdings of 150 acres and upwards.   TheGovernment&apos;s policy is aimed at increasing the proportion of farms capable of supporting a commercial business whilstcontinuing to help progressive smaller farmers to become more competitive.   For this purpose, a commercial business is regardedas one capable of providing, mainly from the land, full-timeoccupation to a farmer employing one worker or having equivalenthelp from his family.   Only 17 per cent of the holdings attainthis level and, even though many of the others are viable, anincrease in the number of larger farms would help Welshagriculture to meet the demands of economic food production andto provide a better living for farmers and farm-workers.Government Support110.    Between 1946 and 1966 grant-aided improvement schemesestimated to cost some  1*9 million were approved for Welshfarms and, in addition,  2 million in grant was provided for theimprovement of rural roads in the uplands.   The proportion ofthese sums already spent, coupled with other investment by localauthorities and other public bodies and by landowners and farmersthemselves, has helped to raise agricultural output to high levels.   Long-term investment covered by these grants is currentlyrunning at the rate of  4 million a year in Wales, including 1 million a year for work approved under the Hill Farming and livestock Rearing Acts and  2 million a year for that under the farm improvement Schemes; and these rates of investment are likely tocontinue for some years to come.   Grants totalling  65 millionhave been approved for nearly 9,000 occupiers under the small farmer Scheme, which was modified in 1965 to put a new emphasis on better management.-59-R.I.
Farmers also benefit from the whole range of guarantees and production grants determined at the Annual Review.The Agriculture Act 1967111.       The Agriculture Act 1967 will have specialvalue      for Wales, with its preponderance of small and hillfarms.     The Act contains far-reaching provisions for improving the industry9s structure by assisting worthwhile amalgamationsthrough grants towards incidental costs and approved worksdirectly consequent on the amalgamations and also payments tooutgoing occupiers;   for encouraging the improvement of hill land;for putting the hill stock subsidies on a long-term basis;   for encouraging farmers to co-operate in production and marketing;for establishing      Rural Development Boards for certain uplandareas;   and for a Meat and Livestock Commission to improve theproduction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat inG-reat Britain.     The implementation of these provisions should go far towards improving the structure and, hence, the economicfuture of Welsh agriculture.     If the rate of change between 1960and 1966 continues and is gradually accelerated by the Government9snew incentives to voluntary amalgamation, a further reduction of2,700 in the number of small holdings and an increase of about350 to 400 in that of the larger holdings  may be expected by1970s    Looking yet further ahead and leaving aside those part-timeholdings which, combined with other Employment, yield satisfactoryincomes, the prospects are of a steady decline in the number ofthose holdings that, on a full-time basis, offer little more thanmere subsistence to their occupiers;   a fairly stable majorityof holdings, mostly of between 60 and 100 acres, capable, withefficient and economic management, of producing a reasonably satisfactory living;   and a gradual increase in the number of larger commercial holdings employing specialist labour andequipment.112.     The new scheme of grants to encourage co-operation which is provided for in the Act should give fresh stimulus to a movement in which Welsh farmers have long been active:
co-operation &quot;between small farmers in production and marketingactivities could do much to reduce their costs and enhancetheir incomes.     Other provisions of the Act will undoubtedlyencourage more investment, especially through the extendedPar/a Improvement Scheme and the Hill Land Improvement Scheme,and in the labour-saving equipment and self-propelled machinerycovered by the Investment Incentive grants.     The larger farms ofthe future will be more economical on replacements and betterplaced to finance improvements made necessary by technologicaladvances.113.     An important provision in the I967 Act is one forthe establishment of Rural Development Boards in upland areas where there are special problems, including that of farm structure,affecting their development as rural areas.     The Boards willdraw up programmes to co-ordinate the development of agricultureand forestry.     The Government consider that among the first ofthe Boards should be one in Mid Wales.     They are consultinglocal authorities and other interested bodies as to the area itshould cover.     This and other Government measures will help the welsh countryside to make its fullest contribution to thenational well-being and, at the same time, to provide a betterliving for those who work there.Productivity114.       After allowing for part-time working, agricultureemploys an estimated labour force equivalent to 55*000 full-timeworkers, not including farmer&apos;s wives.     This represents a markeddecline during the last fifteen years.     The loss of manpowerconsequent upon a 15 per cent fall in the number of agricultural holdings between 1951 end 1966 has been substantial.     Inaddition, the number of employed whole-time workers fell byabout 3 per cent per annum from 1951 to 1963 and at asignificantly greater rate from then to 1966.     But this reduction in the labour force has been more than offset by increased productivity, made possible largely by thesimplification of farming systems, the increased use of machinery
and improved fixed equipment, and technological developments.Tractors have increased in number from nearly 19,000 in 1948 toover 44,000 in 1966 (giving a ratio of one tractor to every 59 acres of crops and grass), combine harvesters from only 118 to 2,400,and milking machines have increased by over 300 per cent.   Areport by the Milk Marketing Board in 1965 shows that there isstill scope for further improvement in productivity in Welshdairy farms.   Output per full-time worker (including farmers and family labour) in sample milk-producing farms in 1963-64was lower in Wales than in England and Wales as a whole.Economic improvement would now-62-R.l.
seem to depend on further investment, new forms of organisationand co-operation, and the achievement of a better balance of resources between machinery and livestock.115.      The outlook for the future is therefore one of increasingoutput from a smaller labour force.   If, as suggested in paragraph in,some 2,700 of the smaller holdings no longer exist as separate unitsby 1970, and if the release of agricultural workers continues atthe same rate as in recent years, there might be a reductionequivalent to between  4,500 and 5,000   full-time workers (includingfarmers) in the Welsh agricultural labour force by 1970.   In some areas any substantial loss of labour from agriculture may bringdifficulties, particularly in livestock husbandry, but technicaldevelopments, including the fullest use of machinery and bettermanagement,   should ease the problem.Agriculture and the Countryside116.      It is a major concern of the Government that the countryside should be developed to the fullest health and vigour.Their aim is to ensure that as many as possible of the peoplereleased from agriculture will find other employment within the rural areas themselves.   It will be particularly important to build upthetourism and/population and economy of the country towns.   Theirprosperity must be fostered  so that they can continue to providethe services essential to the farming industry and generally actas focal centres of rural development, &quot;and so build up a morethriving economy in the rural areas, stem depopulation and provide a better social environment.   Agriculture is bound toremain the dominant feature of the rural scene.   The Ministry ofAgriculture&apos;s advisory services are freely available to farmers andlandowners and, together with the financial incentives which are being provided and extended, will enable the industry to adapt itself toand benefit from the inevitable changes.   The value of good landin agrdoalLtegal aae should be taken into account when considering competing requirements.
Fisheries117.        The fishing industry occupies a relatively smallplace in the Welsh economy,but provides a valuable source ofemployment in areas where this is particularly needed.     Inrecent years landings of fish and shellfish in Wales have beenworth about  1 million a year.     Wet fish account for over 800,000of the total, most of this being landed at the deep seaport of Milford Haven.     The inshore fishing ports of Conway andSwansea specialise in supplying high quality white fish, forwhich there is a good market.     Conway has the more modern fleet and the value of the catch has more than doubled in the past ten years.     The smaller inshore fishing ports contribute thebulk of the shellfish.     About 450 workers are regularlyemployed in the industry and a somewhat smaller number areemployed part-time.118. The Government are helping theindustry as a whole to become viable and for this purpose they make grants towards the cost of building new vessels and of improving existing vessels.    These grantshave been raised for deep sea trawlers to 35 per cent andfor inshore vessels, which are usually owned by those who sailin them, to 40 per cent;   and legislation has been sought toenable both rates to be increased.,by an additional 5 per cent for investments in 19&amp;7        1968.     Operating subsidies arealso given for all vesselsjbased on the days they spend at sea^or, for certain very small vessels, on the weight of fish landed.In recent years the port of Milford Haven has suffered froma decline in hake fishing, and special rates of subsidy havebeen paid to help the local industry there to adjust itself tothis situation.   Unsuitable vessels have been eliminated fromthe Milford Haven fleet and smaller modern ones, whichoffer better chances of success, are being introduced.
The fishing trade at the inshoreports of Conway and Swansea is in a stronger position economically,hut there is seope for modernisation especially at Swansea.Beth ports should benefit from the extension of British fishery limits which has now taken effect.   At the smaller inshore fishingports, the prospects of development are generally good, if modest:sales of shellfish are increasing and there has been an upward trend of investment in vessels, stimulated by improvedmarketing arrangements and by keen demand.   The Government willcontinue to help the industry by means of research, conservationmeasures and assistance for investment;   but the success of modernisation schemes will depend largely on the enterpriseof individual owners01!9S    Salmon and trout fishing on Welsh rivers provides agreat and increasing attraction for visitors.   The government intend to seek legislation to give river authorities greaterscope to assist the development of fresh water fisheries.Forestry120o    A great deal has been done by the Forestry Commission and private land-owners to revive the forestry industry.   Theonce abundant woodlands were severely diminished by centuriesof encroachment, culminating in the devastation caused by&quot;the timber needs of the industrial revolution and the first world War.   Since 1919, successive Governments have encouraged the expansion of both private and state forestry.   In the years between the Wars the Forestry Commission planted some 60,000acres in Wales.   Since 1946, a further 228,000 acres of foresthave been created by the Commission, mostly on land of littleagricultural value in the upland areas and on derelict woodland.ro65*&quot;HI.
Rl.There are also about 80,000 aeres of well-managed privateforests, mainly in the traditional woodland areas.   about per cent of the land area of Wales is now occupied byeffectively managed forests.121.     Originally policy was aimed at creating and maintaining a reserve of growing timber for use in emergency; but theeaphasis is now on the value of forestry as a source of timberfor industry and for the contribution it can make to the social welfare of the countryside.    The financial return from forestrycannot alone justify investment in it.   The length of the growingcycle makes it difficult to eospare the profitability of forestrywith other forms of land use yielding earlier financial returns*but, so far as can be judged, the state forests in Wales might beexpected to yield a net return of about      Per cent compoundinterest.   Although this is not attractive in relation to many other forms of investment, the Government have taken a wider view:it is their aim to encourage the best and fullest use of theuplands of Wales, and forestry is one of the best forms ofland use for these areas.   Apart from making a significant contribution to the country&apos;s supplies of timber and timberproducts, it can assist the establishment of timber-based industryand the growth of tourism, and can help the farmer.In particular, forestry can bring some social stability andemployment opportunities to areas especially liable to depopulation.For these reasons, the Government have encouraged the further development of forestry, and the Forestry Commission are plantingat the rate of 5*000 acres a year in Wales.122*       There is considerable difficulty in acquiringsufficient land to continue this rate of planting: for a variety of reasons, the acquisition rate has been fallingin recent years, and an effort is being made to increasethe Commission*s reserves.   It is not that suitable land islacking: there are still substantial acreages of inferior hill
land which could be beneficially used for forestry.     The       x uproposed Rural Development Board in Mid-Wales will assistintegrated development of farming and forestry.     It is alsoexpected that in time the commons of Wales, amounting to some4505000 acres, will provide a good deal of land which may be of only marginal value to agriculture and would be better used fortree planting.     The Government will give all possible help tothe Forestry Commission in their task.     They will also continueto support private woodland owners, who have recently been increasing their plantations at the rate of about 3?000 acresa year.     Substantial inducements are available to encouragethese owners to maintain their valuable contribution to theextension and management of forest areas.123.      Through growing output, the forestry industry willmake an increasing contribution to the economy.     Timberproduction currently amounts to about 225?000 tons annually,mostly in the form of small round-wood from softwood thinnings.The Forestry Commissions output, which accounts for some175*000 tons of this, is expected to rise to about 750,000 tons annually by 1985*     A great deal of the timber produced in wales is used in Wales or on the Welsh borders by coalmines, sawmills,pulpmills, boardmills and farms, which together are capable ofabsorbing all the increasing forest production of Wales for atleast the next decade.124.       The Forestry Commission now provide direct employment in Y/ales for about 2,700 workers, mostly in the uplandareas, and some 1,400 are employed by timber merchants and in private woodlands.     These numbers, though small in total, arevaluable in helping to stem depopulation in sparsely populated areas, and in remote villages.     Modern methods of training andthe use of new techniques are increasing productivity in theforests, with resultant economies in manpowers   but the increasing flow of timber from the forests should in the longterm bring a gradual net increase in employment, both inforestry and in the ancillary industries and services.
125.      Forestry offers.other direct and indirect benefits.There is a growing appreciation of its recreational andamenity value.   The Snowdoaia Forest Park, with its camping groundat Beddgelert, has proved extremely popular, and wherever possibleforests are now open for public enjoyment.   About 1,900 miles of forestroad have been constructsfi in Wales and further constructionof about 100 miles f ye&amp;Jf is planned.   These roads are below normal standardfsnd must remain unobstructed for timber extractionand fire-fighting, but can be of great help to visitorswho want to explore the for&amp;stsi on foot.   The number ofparking and picnic places where people can leave theircars before entering the forests   will be increased.   Trees canenhance the attractions of beauty spots, mask unsightly areas and help to deal with the problem of derelict land.COAL126,,    In the wide range of high-grade coals it produces^ the coalindustry in Wales has assets of considerable national importance.Its   total production from all sources in 1966 was 20.b million tons.   The South Wales coalfield  provides virtually the wholeUnited Kingdom output of anthracite for home use and export,dry steam goals valued for their high calorific value andsmokeless properties, and coking coals and domestic   fuelof the best quality, &apos;Tke smaller North Wales coalfield, comprisingfive collieri.es, produces mainly general purpose coals which are disposed of in and around the ares. Many of the South Wales coalshave important specialised uges, as in providing smokeless fuelto jjeive the Government&apos;s clean air policy and in meeting the distinctive needs of the steel, electricity supply and otherindustries.   They also furnish the? raw materials forthe National Coal Board9 8     coking        plants in South Wales atCms Qm&amp;Bly and lantgarwf   for the coktog plants of tfos steal-works, Aich between them supply a high proportion of the-.
Wales Gas Board8s requirements of gas, in addition to producinglarge quantities of metallurgical coke;   for a phurnacite plant at Aberaman manufacturing one million tons of premium smokelessfuel a yeari and for a new plant at Cardiff Docks, which producesa new smokeless fuel called multiheat and is at present beingexpanded to produce 330,000 tons per yearBInvestment127s To make the fullest use of these resources, theNational Coal Board have carried out an intensive programme ofcapital development in Wales, particularly in sinking new minesfor the production of anthracite e   -Among these are the newcollieries at Abernant, near Pontardawe, and at Cynheidre, nearLlanelli, on which the Board have spent over  23 million.     InSouth Wales, the National Coal Board have invested about  142million since 1946* out of some  1,292 million in the industry as a wholeo     Concurrently with the development of new collieriesthere has been a drive to modernise and reconstruct existingcollieries, the most successful of these being Abertillery inMonmouthshire, in which about  3 million has been invested,,At the end of 1966, twenty colliery reconstructions were still inhand, including one at Marine Colliery, Ebbw Vale, where thefirst scheme in Wales for a remotely operated longwall face isbeing carried out.Two new drift mines, -Treforgan and Blaenant NewDrift, both in the Dulais Valley, have come into productionwithin the last two years, and one near Blaenavon, known asBlaentillery New Drift, is expected to become operative in 1967*Opencast coal mining, which has been undertaken in Wales since1943, now affords employment for about 1,800 men at sixteensites.     Production from opencast sites has risen from 0.7 million tons in 1946 to 2-4 million tons in 1966, and the coalproduced, particularly coking coal   and anthracite, is a valuable addition to the output from other operations of theBoard in Wales.
Demand128*       The industry in &quot;Wales, as in the rest of theUnited Kingdom, has been faced with a difficult task in adjustingitself to market conditions.    For some years from 1950 the Britishfuel economy was overwhelmingly dependent on coal, home demandreaching a peak of over 217 million tons in 1956, and thecoal industry had difficulty in meeting demand both at home andfor exports, even having to arrange imports at high cost.   &quot;but after 1956 total inland consumption of all fuels failed torise as had been expected and the growing use of oil caused a sharp decline in the market for coal, with immediate and serious effects on the industry.   Although the fall in demand was arrested between I960 and 1963, demand has since declined stillfurther, and in 1966 total inland consumption and exports fell to just over 177 million tons.   Financial results have been disappointing, particularly in   South Wales where accumulateddeficits since 1946 after payment of interest amounted to. 116 million.Concentration129*        The National Coal Board have continuously sought to increase the efficiency of the industry by the better use ofmen and machines and by concentrating production at the most economic pits.   In Wales, 95 collieries were closed in theperiod 1947-65:   most of these, after a long life span, hadeither exhausted their reserves or reached the limits ofeconomic operations.   Since November 1965, &quot;the Board, with theGovernment&apos;s full support, have been speeding up theirconcentration programme.   During 1966 a further elevencollieries were closed in Wales;  and, while redundancies were relatively small, they unfortunately fell most heavily ondisabled and elderly miners.   Notwithstanding its reduced-TO-
scale, the coal industry contributes about  100 million annually to the Welsh economy and provides employment for nearly 61,000 mineworkers and some 5*500 other staff.     It is,therefore, an important part of the economy of Wales.The Future130.       The Board are proceeding with their programme for strengthening the competitive position of the coal industryand this involves a continuation of the process of concentrating production on the more economic collieries.    Butthe Board will need to maintain an adequate labour force at these collieries.     Between I963 and I966, the number of mine-workers employed by the industry in Wales fell by over 18,000from 79*700 to 61,000 and the fall is likely to continue.Despite a reduction in the rate of manpower loss in the latter half of I966, the immediate problem is one, not of a surplusof mineworkers, but of a shortage of about 1,300 faceworkers inthe South Wales coalfield.     The redeployment of mineworkersfrom closing collieries to long-life collieries is essential and the National Coal Board will do all they can to make thisredeployment practicable and successful.131.        The Government have afforded substantial help tothe industry during the present difficult period of transition.Special preference has been given to the use of coal by theelectricity industry and in the heating of public buildings.The Coal Industry Act 1965 provided for the capital reconstruction of the industry by relieving the Board of ; 415 million of i^s accumulated debt, and for grants of upto  30 million during the period I966-67 to 1970-71 to meet
half the Board&apos;s additional expenditure in connection with the human and social costs arising from the closure of collieries.The incentives to new industrial enterprises described in chapter Y1TI are available to those established in areas of SouthWales where coal-mining has declined, and in particular theGovernment have since November 1964 authorised the building of eighteen advance factories in those areas.132*      The successful completion of the programme of concentration will improve the strength of the coalindustry in Wales, which has the advantage of its special coals,new collieries of considerable potential and the prospect ofobtaining improved results from the large amount of capital invested in it.     There was an encouraging rise of 4*8 per centin output per man shift in i960 in the South Western Division,compared with an increase of only 1.3 per cent in the industry as a whole, and absenteeism has fallen to its present average level of 19o4 per cent from 20.7 per cant a year ago.     Moreover,the latest financial returns show that losses in the SouthWestern Division in the first half of 1966-67 were the lowestfor several years.     This improvement must to some extent be attributed to the beneficial effects of the capital reconstruction in the industry.     These encouraging developments will helpcoal to compete with other fuels and to make a continuingcontribution to the nation8s energy requirements.STEEL135*    Throughout the revolutionary technological changes that have occurred since World War II, Wales has maintained itstraditional place as one of the main steel-making areas of britain.   The economic prospect for Wales is still, and willcontinue to be for the foreseeable future, strongly influenced by the fortunes of the steel industry.   At present the industryis facing serious problems, particularly a world-wide surplus
of capacity,&apos;   but the Government believe that, by taking the major part of the industry into public ownership, important new opportunities will be created for improving efficiency.The National Steel Corporation, owning all the major steelworks in the country,   will be in a position to undertakepositive planning of the development of the main part of theindustry as a whole;   to concentrate production on the most efficient and best placed works;   and to reorganise the nationalised sector into larger units of management,comparable in size with those of our chief overseascompetitors.   The responsibility for the future structure and location of the industry will rest primarily with theCorporation;   but there can be no question that Wales, withits modern steelworks, important reserves of limestone,high quality coking coal and access to deep-water ports, isunusually well placed to remain a key area in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s steel industry of the future.134.        Steel production in Wales is concentrated onflat-rolled products - sheet, coil and tinplate.   In 1966,8.2 million tons of crude steel, 34 per cent of the total forthe United Kingdom, were produced in Wales;   and3.7 million tons of sheet and 1.2 million tons
of tinplate were rolled.     The last two decades have seenimmense changes in both these sections of the industry, theerection of great new up-to-date plants and the closure of some500 hand tinplate mills and virtually all the smallersteelworks.     The industry is now largely concentrated at thefour integrated works of the aajor&apos;companies, the Ebbw TaleWorks and the Spencer Works at Llanwern of Richard Thomas &amp;Baldwins;   the Kargam and Abbey Works of the Steel Company of wales and its associated tinplate works at Swansea and Llanelli;and the Hawarden Bridge Steelworks of John Summers &amp; Sons atShotton.     There are several other important works producingdifferent steel products, the largest being the Guest, Keenand ITettlefold Group&apos;s plants at Cardiff and Brymbo.     just over three-quarters of the Principality&apos;s steel-making capacity is in South Wales, and the remainder in Forth-EastWales.     The number of people employed by the major steelworksin Wales at the end of I966 was 69*000 compared with 70,650at the end of 1965.135*        Since 1953* out of the steel industry&apos;s total capital expenditure in the United Kingdom of about  1,280 million,some  390 million was spent in South Wales and about  80 million in the area centred on the North Wales steel industry.     By1970, capacity in Wales from existing plant and planned expansion already approved should rise to 10.7 million tons, outof the total United Kingdom capacity of 34 million tons a year.Some 300,000 tons of additional finished sheet capacity will be needed in the United Kingdom by 1970, and, to meet this, the capacity of the Spencer Steelworks is to be raised from1.5 million to 2 million ingot tons a year at an estimatedcost of  3.5 million.     Companies have proposed expenditure on other fresh development estimated to cost about  83 million.136.        The iron and steel industry in Wales, in common with the industry as a whole9 has been affected by the adverseeconomic
conditions in Britain:   its output of crude steel in I966- fell4.8 per cent below that in ly65 9 against a fall of 10 per centin the United Kingdom as a whole.     The Welsh steel industry isparticularly susceptible to fluctuations in the demand for steel from manufacturers of motor vehicles and consumer durables andany recession in those industries causes reduced activity atYfelsh steelworks.    Steel generally, and tinplate in particular,is also subject to intense competition from other materials,such as plastics, aluminium, glass and foil, and this will affectfuture demand.    Moreover, because of the world-wide surplus ofsteel manufacturing capacity, producers in the United Kingdom facedifficulties in maintaining exports of finished steel at economicprices and in competing with imports.     Despite these adversetrading conditions, exports of steel sheet from the UnitedKingdom in 1966, which came very largely from Wales, were about1.1 million tons, or some 50s000 tons more than in I965;   and exports of tinplate, amounting to 392, 000 tons, were only slightly less than in 19&apos;65e137.      A major problem in at least one of the larger steel-works in South Wales is over-manning:   the surplus has beenvariously estimated as between 6,000 and 9*000 men, and areduction of this order in the manpower force is expected by 1970oThis reduction in manpower should be partly met by naturalwastage, but a large number of workers will be come redundant.      1138.        The construction of new port facilities at PortTalbot for the Steel Company of Wales will make it possible to import iron ore in large carriers, bringing increased efficiency and reduced costs.   The new harbour will be able to accommodateinitially carriers of 65,000 deadweight tons, with the capability of being extended to receive vessels of at least 100,000 tons,^The British Transport Docks Board have promoted legislationempowering them to provide an iron-ore terminal at Uskmouth toserve the Spencer Steelworks.   This terminal would take the formof an impounded basin and a dredged approach channel capable of taking carriers of at least 65,000 deadweight tonsj7  Theseport facilities will greatly help the Welsh steel industry.
CHAPTER vii the HOLIDAY industry the Existing Position139*       With the fine natural assets at its disposal, the welsh holiday ihdusiry has outstanding possibilities of further developments   In most rural counties tourism forms, with&apos;agriculture and forestry, the basis of. the economy,   even so,4Its potential is far frofa being realised, not least in the &apos;attraction of overseas visitoiPs*   Wales has the oo&amp;aial, scenicand other resources to serve to an increased extent the growing demand in Britain for holidays and a much greater flow of foreign tourists.   To achieve this growth, beneficial to both the British and the Welsh economies, co-operative action will be needed by those concerned in fostering the industry.140. Par-reaching developments are already in train.Following the reports of the Council for Wales (Cmnd. 1950)and the subsequent Cole Working Party, the Wales Tourist
Board, who work in close association with the British TravelAssociation, have re-shaped their organisation to unite theefforts of holiday interests both in the Principality asa whole and in eight local areas.   Their promotionalactivity has been increased and their publicity materialsubstantially improved.   To enable them to establish a sound basis for future development, the Government havegiven the Board a special grant of  40,000 to&apos;carryout an intensive three-year programme of research.141*   The Board&apos;s research work has shown that,in the I9608s, ten to twelve per cent of Britishholiday-makers stayed on holiday in Wales.   Total holidayspending in Wales amounted to about  50 million a year.   Selfcatering holidays have increased in popularity:   rented cottages,flats, caravans and tents give visitors greater freedom of activity;   and Wales is particularly well equipped to providesuch holidays.   Of some 210,000 licensed caravan pitches in britain, over one-fifth are in Wales and the proportion is growing.   Wales now entertains nearly four million holidayvisitors a year.   Most of these travel to the five North Walescounties, which are convenient to the industrial North andMidlands of England and provide about two-thirds of the350,000 tourist   beds in Wales.   The popularity of South Wales,with its new developments at Barry and Aberavon, and of west wales is also growing.   Outdoor recreation facilities - climbing,sailing, fishing and pony-trekking among them - have developedrapidly in all parts of Wales.   There are facilities at a numberof centres suitable for the holding of international gatheringsin different sports, and these could be more fully used if hotel accommodation increased.The Future142.    Future prospects are still more promising.While main holidays taken in Britain are not expected toincrease by more than about 10 per cent by 1980, they are-76- B.1
-77-R.1.likely to last longer and to be supplemented by many more&quot;second holidays&quot; and day trips.   In the same period theannual influx of overseas visitors to Britain could well double.With a larger recreation area for development than almost anyother part of Britain, Wales is well placed to cater for a greatly increased trade.   The Wales Tourist Board estimate atotal tourist expenditure in Wales of over  100 million annually by 1981 from over 5zT million visitors and a much larger trafficof day trippers.   The greater part of the increase is expectedto result from the growing demand for self-catering holidays,although a large number of caravan sites are likely to be converted into holiday camps and this trend is already apparent.The number of visitors requiring hotel accommodation shouldalso rise, to nearly 750,000 a year, partly through an increasein those from abroad.   Wales should therefore be able to doubleits earnings from the holiday trade over the next fifteen years or so, but there will need to be continuing efforts to raisestandards so that visitors may enjoy modern comforts as wellas the traditional welcome which always awaits them.Measures required143^    To accommodate this substantial growth, the Welshholiday industry will face challenging tasks.   rffae increasing pressure on holiday resources in Wales requires morethan separate action by individual interests.   There is serious risk that, without careful planning, the attractions of wales, far from being enhanced by holiday development, will beswamped by masses of cars and caravans.   It will be essentialto draw up and implement development plans to ensure that theneeds of visitors are met, and that the amenities of each area are adequately safeguarded.   These plans will need to take into account the kind of holiday that individual localities
are best fitted to provide;   their capacity to receive visitorsand to increase that capacity;   the measures required to developor preserve the area&apos;s attractions;   and the possibility of extending o\it-of-season activities.   All this will be largely a matter for the local planning authorities and,the WalesTourist Board.144.       The Government will assist the effort which thetask demands.     Substantial improvements of routes leading intoWales have already made access quicker and easier for holidayvisitors.     The extensive programme of further road improvementsdescribed in Chapter IV will bring advantages for   tourism.Through the designation of National Parks and Areas of OutstandingNatural Beauty, and through other measures to preserve the attractions of the coast and countryside described in ChapterXI, the Government are aiming to safeguard the amenities of Wales.They are encouraging a more positive policy of recreationaldevelopment on the lines set out in the White Paper on Leisurein the Countryside (Cmnd. 2928);   and in this context the study of the recreational potentialities of Fid-Wales, which is beingjointly carried out by the Welsh and West Midlands EconomicCouncils, will be helpful.145.       A major concern of the Government is to help in measures to increase the flow of overseas visitors to Britain.The estimates presented to Parliament envisage a grant to theBritish Travel Association for 1967-68 of  2-g million comparedwith  2^ million in 1966-67 and  2 million in 1965-66.Out of this the Association promote holiday traffic to Britainincluding Wales.     In this connection they are mailing a total,payment of  35?000 to the Wales Tourist Board in I967-6.8 which ismore than double the figure for 1966-67.     The income of theWales Tourist Board for 1967-68 will be around  80,000 comparedwith  55*000 for the previous year.     With the prospect ofincreasing revenue from commercial and other sources as well,the Board will be able to strengthen its position and to play an even more active part in attracting holiday makers to Wales.
In the Development Area, Government loans and grants areavailable for projects, including hotels, which will provide employment.   Wales, like other parts of Britain, can benefit from these measures, but much will depend on the success ofefforts by the holiday industry to &quot;sell&quot; Wales to the overseasvisitor.146.     Progress will also depend on the willingness oflocal authorities and holiday interests in Wales to contribute to promotional activity.   Some are alive to the value of increased tourism and generous with their help, but many whobenefit from the work of the Wales Tourist Board are doing little to assist it.   The Board are conducting a campaign to increasesupport for their activities and the Government very much hopethat this will receive a sympathetic response.
CHAPTER TillINDUSTRIAL EXPANSIONNEW MANUFACTURING- IHDUSTRY147.     A rapid expansion in the size and variety of manufacturing industry in Wales has accompanied the decline inemployment in some of the older industries.    In contrast to the narrow range of industrial operations thirty years ago, virtuallyevery kind of manufacturing activity now finds some representation in Wales,    Between.1950 and I966 the chemicals group of
industries increased its employment by a third to more than26,000;   this includes such new developments as the oil installations in South Pembrokeshire, petro-chemicals at port Talbot, and plastics at Barry.   The older-establishedman-made fibres industry on Deeside and newer plants at Wrexhamand at Pontypool have helped to increase employment in thetextiles industry to nearly 18,000.   New factories at G-orseinon,Bridgend and Treforest have helped to raise the number of jobs inthe paper industries from 7,000 to 12,000.   Many areas in wales have branches of the clothing industry, which has grown to employnearly 16,000 workers.   There has been a marked growth ofemployment in other production Industries:    in the metal goodsindustries by a quarter to 24,000;   in engineering and electricalgoods by 70 per cent to nearly 58,000;    and in the miscellaneousgroup known as &quot;other manufacturing industries&quot; it has more than doubled to over 15,000.   Companies connected with motor-vehiclemanufacture, operating in many parts of the Principality, providework for nearly 22,000 people.   There are sectors^  such asship repairing, in which employment has declinedpbut the net result of changes between 1950 and 1966 is that employment in manufacturing has steadily increased, independently of periods ofeconomic difficulty in Great Britain as a whole, from about277,000 to nearly 351,000.   This shows the growing attractivenessof Wales as a location for manufacturing industry.I489      Much of the increased manufacturing activity hasbeen undertaken by companies which had previously operated out-side Wales.   More than 300 such enterprises have been attractedto Wales since 194-5 o   Experience has shown that there is no ground for the fears once held by some that enterprises soestablished might be specially liable to feel the cold windof temporarily unfavourable economic conditions.   On thecontrary, the majority have put down strong roots and conferredconsiderable benefits on the Welsh economy.Rl
349*       There are sound reasons for this healthy growth.New enterprises have helped to harness under-used labour resources and have benefited from the natural advantages of Wales ,described in Chapter II.   They have found workers easy to trainand quick to adapt themselves to new processes;   they haveenjoyed a higher degree of labour stability than in areas where competition for workers is more intense;   and,with up-to-date and well-equipped premises, they have started with good prospects of successful operation.   Enterpriseslinked with companies outside Wales have the further advantages of being able to draw on the expertise and larger resources ofthe parent organisations and to use the latter&apos;s access todeveloped export and other markets.   Some branch factories have proved so successful that their parent companies have movedtheir entire operations to Wales.150,        It is encouraging that this vigorous progress hasnot been limited to enterprises in the eastern and moreaccessible half of Wales?   many, including large-scale companies with household names, have successfully developed in the morewesterly areas.   With the rapid improvement of communications,the advantages which industry can gain from settling in areasformerly regarded as remote are increasing.
OIL151.   -A- modern industry which has a special place in the economy of Wales is that based on oil.     Since the last War,successive Governments have encouraged the home refining of crude oil, and between 1947        1966 refinery capacity in the unitedKingdom increased from 2.3 to 82.5 million tons a year.    Homerefining offers great advantages,   it reduces the foreign exchange costs of oil imports;   avoids dependence on foreignrefineries, so ensuring the security of supplies;   attractsforeign investment and orders for plant;   and stimulates thedevelopment of oil-based industry.    By 1970, the annual output capacity of refineries in the United Kingdom should be close to100 million tons, compared with an estimated demand for inlanduse and for bunkers approaching that total.152.   The first major oil refinery in the United Kingdom^owned by the British Petroleum Company, at Llandarcy, nearSwansea, began operating in 1921 and now has a throughput
of over 8 million tons a year.     Crude oil for this refineryis received at Angle Bay on the south shore of llilford Haven,and pumped by pipeline to Llandarcy.     Two other refineries arenow in operation, both on Milford Haven, one owned by the EssoPetroleum Company v/ith a throxxghput of over 6 million tons of crude oil a year, and the other owned by the Regent RefiningCompany with a throughput of 5 million tons a year.    A newrefinery with a throughput of 3 million tons a year and anassociated petro-chemical plant with a capacity of over 200,000 tonsSi year are now being built at Waterston, Milford Haven, for theGulf Oil Refining Company.   These two installations are expectedto be fully operational by mid-1968, and on completion of the refinery, about 22 million tons per annum, or about a quarter ofthe total refinery capacity of the United Kingdom will be located in South Wales.     The rapid development of the industry in wales has owed, much to the fine natural harbour at llilford Haven, wherethe sheltered deep water enables tankers of over 100,000 tons tounload their cargoes and which in I966 handled no less than one quarter of the total of the United kingdom&apos;s imports of crude oil.The deep water channel at Milford Haven is being improved inorder to accommodate tankers of up to 200,000 deadweight tons.153.        There are good prospects of further growth.Refinery capacity in the United Kingdom should continue toincrease over the next ten years, either through the expansion ofexisting refineries or through the building of new ones.Suitable locations for this further development exist in bothNorth and South Wales.     The oil industry provides a basis forother industries using oil as their raw material, and there arealready important examples in the petro-chemical complex basedon the products of the Llandarcy Refinery1   in the E.M. Edwards&apos;Works of the Wales Gas Board, which is adjacent to and draws itsfeedstocks from this refinery;   and in the oil-fired generating station being built by the Central Electricity Generating Boardon Milford Haven.     The Government will continue to encourage the location of oil refineries and associated industries atsuitable sites in Wales,
MEASURES TO PROMOTE INDUSTRY154*    The Government are determined to accelerate theprogress already made in developing manufacturing industry in WalesAlthough the Principality is in many ways well placed for industrial growth, its advantages have not in themselves provedsufficient to ensure this growth on the scale needed.Industrial firms have a natural tendency to congregate in mainpopulation and communication centres and an in-built resistanceagainst expanding elsewhere,.     There are often internal economiesto be derived from close proximity to markets and to associatedfirms providing necessary services.     On the other hand,unrestrained growth in congested areas tends to overstrain localresources of labour, housing, transport and other services andthus to encourage inflation!   while, elsewhere, labour and other resources may be under-used, causing waste and hardship.Measures have been taken to correct this imbalance and toensure a wider spread of prosperity and opportunity.155*     These measures are two-fold.     There is^ firstly,the control over industrial location.    Under the Town and country Planning Acts, applications for the consent of a local planning authority to industrial development above a specified scale require to be accompanied by an industrialdevelopment certificate granted by the Board of Trade.     TheBoard of Trade have made vigorous use of these provisions to steer expanding firms away from London and the Midlandsto those parts of the
country, including most of Wales, which are in special need offurther development.Wales Development Area156.        There are secondly the positive incentivesavailable to industrialists in Development Areas under theLocal Employment Acts, strengthened by the Industrial Develop-ment Act I966.     These incentives are available only in respectof projects undertaken in the new wide Development Areas whichsince August 1966 have replaced smaller and scatteredDevelopment Districts.     The Welsh Development Area now comprisesthe whole of Wales with the exception of parts of South-East and north-East Wales.     One important effect was that for the first time the whole of Mid-Wales, the rural parts of Carmarthenshireand Pembrokeshire, and an extensive area of Denbighshire, becameeligible for a far reaching range of inducements.157-        It has been argued that the industrial developmentof Wales could be encouraged most economically and effectively in the districts where natural growth is easiest and ?/hich are excluded from the Development Area, and that the secondaryeffects of such development would gradually extend toneighbouring parts of Wales.     It is true that the area inSouth-East Wales outside the Development Area has, in its existing industrial base, its speedily improving communications with London and the Midlands, the City of Cardiff and its othersubstantial towns, and its ports, great natural potentialitiesfor further rapid economic growth.     Similarly the areaexcluded in the North-East also has advantages of its own,particularly in its prtiqcimity to Merseyside and the Midlands.The system of Development Areas inevitably poses problems ofwhere to draw the boundaries of the areas selected.    When theWales Development Area was created in I966, it was decided to exclude South-East and North-East Wales?   because, even without special financial inducements for new industrial enterprises,they both possess good prospects of continuing economic development.     It was also considered that, if the inducements
available in the parts of Wales included in the Development area were equally available in adjacent districts already morediversified economically, the latter would attract enterpriseswhich might otherwise go to places in Wales where their presenceis more immediately required to give employment to men released from declining industries or to help check rural depopulation.The primary objective of fostering industrial development where itis most needed could thus be frustrated.Industrial Premises158.        Some of the most important of the inducementsavailable in Development Areas relate to buildings:-(a)     The Board of Trade may provide premises forany suitable undertaking, on eitherindustrial estates or individual sites.These may be of standard design or, withinwide limits, tailored to suit the applicantsrequirements.     Such factories may usuallybe built to rent, normally on 21 yearleases, at a rent assessed by the DistrictValuer on the basis of the current market value of industrial property in the district,which is generally below the economiclevel.     By renting a factory in this wayan industrialist can conserve his owncapital for other uses.
(b) An effective way of influencing industrialiststo accept particular locations is for the Boardof Trade to build factories in advance of demand from any specific tenants(c) An innovation made by the 1966 Act is that firmsrenting a Board of Trade factory (advance orpurpose-built) for a new project may qualify foran initial rent-free period of two years incases where, in the Board&apos;s opinion, special problems have been involved in setting it up ata considerable distance from the firm&apos;s existingundertaking, sufficient to justify the special assistance.(d) Should an industrialist prefer to own the factoryhimself, it may be built to his specificationand sold by the Board of Trade at cost, outrightor on a repayment basis spread over a periodof years.    Factories built in advance or whichhave become vacant may also be sold if theindustrialist prefers to buy rather than lease.(e) Another possibility is also offered.     Aneligible undertaking purchasing a new buildingnot previously occupied, or one itselfproviding a new building or extending oradapting an existing building,   may receive a building grant.     The standard rate for thisis up to 25 per cent of building costsi   butagain, in cases where there are special problems involved in setting up a new projectat a considerable distance from the firm&apos;sexisting undertaking, the rate may be up to 35per cent.    Building grants are made only on afavourable recommendation from the Board ofTrade Advisory Committee, an independentstatutory body.-86-
General Purpose Loans and Grants159.   The Board of Trade may also make general purposeloans-or grantss-(i)   General purpose loans can he made for working capital, for the purchase of plant and machinery(excluding the amount of any investment grant,described below) and for purchasing or buildingpremises (except where a building grant is beingmade or the Board of Trade are providing thepremises).(ii)   General purpose grants can be offered only where an undertaking incurs initial expenses, which areunusual in nature or amount, as a result oflocating the project in a Development Areas   anygrant made would be a reasonable contribution towards, and not a reimbursement of the whole of,such initial costs,(iii)   The Board of Trade can make these general purposeloans or grants only on, and in accordance with,the advice of the Board of Trade AdvisoryCommittee.     This body must be satisfied thatthere are good prospects of the projectultimately being successful without further such assistance.160,   Under other legislation, the Ministry of Labour can provide the financial and other assistance described in paragraph3.00 in connection with the training of additional labour requiredby firms moving into, or expanding in, a Development Area.Investment Grants161.   All the foregoing forms of assistance are conditional upon the enterprise providing a satisfactory proportion of newemployment.     The Industrial Development Act I966 however also provides for investment grants, designed to improve the efficiency of those parts of the economy which contribute most directly to continue growth and the balance of payments.     These grants aretherefore payable irrespective of whether the investment provides,87- R.1
additional employment;   but they are differentiated so as toencourage development in the parts of Britain where it is most needed.162.        The Board of Trade may pay these cash grants on capital expenditure, incurred, on and after 17th January 1966, on new plant and machinery for use in a qualifying process in the manufacturing, extractive or construction sectors of industry,or in research or development related to such a process.The qualifying processes include manufacture of all kinds,extraction of minerals, construction, civil engineering and shiprepairing.     Computers, ships, hovercraft and mining works arealso eligible for grants.     Certain assets are however excluded,such as road vehicles, office machinery and furniture, andcanteen equipment.I63.        The normal rate of grant is 20 per cent of thecapital cost of eligible assets, but a higher rate of 40 percent is payable on plant and machinery for use in development areas.    Moreover, as a special measure to stimulate industrial investment in the period immediately ahead, the rates of granthave been temporarily increased:   the rates of grant applicableto qualifying expenditure incurred in I967 and I968 will be25 per cent and 45 per cent.     Expenditure incurred during 1966will of course qualify only for the 20 per cent and 40 percent rates respectively.Progress made since 1964i64.        By making full use of existing powers and armingthemselves with new ones, the Government have already securedsubstantial industrial gains for Wales.    Whereas in the fiveyears i960 to I964 new factory floofc space approved in wales was at an annual average of 3.0 million square feet, the comparable figure for I965 was 4.5 million square feet and in1966 it reached the exceptional level of 9*2 million square feet.The space approved in Wales in I966 is estimated, after makingallowance for a change in definition which affects the figure forGreat Britain, to have accounted for something like 9 per cent of the latter, whereas Wales has only 5 per cent of thepopulation of Great Britain ^qq^
Figures prepared for the Annual Reports on government action and Developments in Wales contained inTable 3, which cover all types of industrial development,including expansions by firms already in Wales, show a similarencouraging trend.    In all years a proportion of projects donot materialise, or provide less jobs than was anticipated, butemployment is nevertheless constantly coming into being fromprojects initiated in earlier years.TABLE  3Calendar Number of       Eventual Additional EmploymentYear Developments Estimated by the Firms &apos;1963 107) 6,700))   254 )   15,7001964 147) 9,000)1965 162) 12,000))   345 )   34,0001966 183) 22,000)I65.        These estimates omit any employment to be giveneventually in factories built by the Government in advance of specific demand, but not yet allocated to a tenant.     TheGovernment have made vigorous use of this incentive.    since october I964, it has been announced that 28 such &quot;advancefactories&quot; are to be built in Wales with a total area of 415,000square feet (compared with eight factories with a total plannedarea of 119,000 square feet in the preceding five years, whichhas subsequently been extended to a total of 235,000 square feet).    At the. request of prospective tenants, the sizes of
-90-E.1four 10,000 square feet factories in the current programme arebeing increased!   the engineering firm taking the factory atBlaenau Pfestiniog requiring a five-fold increase to 51*000square feet;   another engineering firm in the Rhondda requiringimmediate extension to 37*000 square feet;   the Bargoed factory,which is to make plastic and paper containers, being increasedthree-fold to 29,000 square feet;   and a 50 per cent extensionbeing needed to the Pontardulais factory.    The total space tobe provided in the 28 factories will thus reach 508,000 square feet.166.      Firms which in the last two years have agreed to open in Wales for the -first time total 67 in number and selectedwidely dispersed locations.     They include some of the best knownnames in British and American industry.   North-West Wales hasbeen chosen by, for example, the Wellman-Smith-Owen corporation for engineering at Llangefni, and by Smith-Corona Ltd. fortypewriter assembly at Portmadoc.     In North-East Wales the new-comers will include the Firestone Tyre Company, BritishInsulated Callenders Cables, and Cadburys Ltd. at Wrexham;while South Pembrokeshire has acquired a unit of the importantelectronics firm, Solartroi Ltd.   West South Wales will gainsubstantially from the decision of the Ford Motor Company topurchase and expand a large government-provided factory atSwansea to produce car components, while other important new acquisitions include Alkaline Batteries Ltd. at Ponthenry andao4 Jefferson ChemicalsEnfield Standard Power Cables/at Llanelli.     East South Wales hasbeen favoured by several incoming industrialists of major standingnotably Johnson &amp; Johnson who will make pharmaceutical productsat Mses-y-Cwmmer;    Perkin-Elmer Ltd., the American scientificinstrument makers, who have selected Llantrisant;   and Austin-Crompton Parkinson Ltd., who will make electric vehicles atTredegar.     Mid-Wales, with its smaller labour resources, cannotaccommodate large projects but welcome developments have includedSetten &amp; Durward (metal stationery wares) at Llandrindod Wells,
Robertson Thain Ltd. (plastic goods) at Welshpool, and theBrockhouse engineering group at Aberystwyth.l67* Firms already operating in Wales are also playing a major part in the growth of manufacturing activity.     Indeed, theexpansion of existing firms, which are eligible for theinducements available in Development Areas, accounts for morethan 80 per cent of the additional employment expected to arise from the developments notified in 1966 and referred to inparagraph 164*168, The Development Corporation for Wales was established in 1958 by industrialists to support the efforts of Governmentin inducing new industry to establish itself in Wales.     Untilthe financial year 1966-67 the Corporation was wholly financed by means of contributions from industry which, in the last nine years, has provided some  150,000 to the Corporation.     Last year the Government paid a grant of  5,000 to the Corporation and will pay another  5,000 this year and  2,500 in 1968-69.     In additionto providing a great deal of literature about the attractionsof Wales as a location for industrial development the Corporationhas been responsible for organising a number of exhibitions inGreat Britain and missions to overseas countries.
Office Employment 131169.      There are also substantially improved prospects foroffice employment in Wales, particularly from the dispersal of Government offices,,    Among other developments, theGovernment have decided to set up a Land Registry at Swansea;an office at Cardiff to administer the new investment grants for wales, the Midlands and South-West England;   an office of theLand Commission at Cardiff;   offices of the Inland RevenueDepartment at Cardiff and Newport;   and a new Passport office at Newport.     These establishments will employ a total staffof about 3,500, many of whom will be recruited locally.Mobility of Labour170.      A changing industrial structure calls increasinglyfor labour mobility of three kinds, between industries, betweenoccupations, and between areas, and this mobility is essential .to the progressive modernisation of the economy of Wales.     Tolessen the hardships of such disturbances, the Government have provided for the payment of lump sums to workers made redundant,and of earnings related supplements to tuiemployment benefit.The help which can be given towards adapting skills is described in paragraphs  290- 202 below.     For workers obligedto move, financial assistance towards removal and resettlementcosts is available.Further Sfreps171*        It was clear from the calculation made in March1967 of the possible gap between- the supply of and the demandfor male labour in 1971, which is set out in paragraphs. 93-100?tihstfurther steps are needed to increase employment opportunities formales in Wales;   and, since March, the Government have already taken a number of decisions which will serve to improve theposition in 1971 as it was forecast in March.172.       In particular, they have decided, in pursuance oftheir policy of dispersal, that the new Royal Mint which isrequired shall be built at Llantrisant.   Its first task will beto produce the new decimal coinage and a work force of about 400
to 500 will be recruited, mainly from the surrounding areas.These workers will continue to be needed when the Royal Mintitself moves to Llantrisant, which will be by 1973 at thelatest. They have also decided, as is recorded in paragraph339, to appoint consultants to advise on urban growth in theLlantrisant area and its neighbourhood.173*        The Government have similarly decided to establishat Swansea an office for goods vehicles test bookings, whichwill begin to operate next year.   An office for motor vehicleregistration and licensing and drivers&apos; licensing, with a computer, will also be established at Swansea.   Building workon it is expected to start next year and to be completed by 1972,and&apos; it is likely, when fully operative, to need a staff ofabout 2,500.   The goods vehicles office will eventually beintegrated with the licensing organisation, providing anational computerised service for the whole country.174*       ^The Memorandum &quot;The Development Areas - A Proposalfor a Regional Employment Premium&quot;, which was published by theDepartment of Economic Affairs and the Treasury on 5 April,contained an analysis of the general problem of Development areas and put forward one possible method by which the disparityin unemployment levels between those Areas and the rest of britain might be reduced.   The Government are carefullyconsidering the comments that have been made on thisMemorandum and are confident that out of the public discussion ithas stimulated, proposals will emerge which should enable them tomake further substantial steps forward in dealing with the problemsof areas of the country such as Wales^/7
INDUSTRIAL SITES175*       Without a reasonably attractive site, readily available, new industrial development is virtually impossible.Fortunately, except in some-of the more constricted valleys,there is throughout most of Wales an ample supply ofpotentially suitable land.
176.     In South Wales, where the need for well distributedsites of varied size is greatest, more than 9,000 acres ofpotentially suitable land exist, of which more than 2,500 aoreshave been allocated for industrial use in county and countyborough development plans.   This allocated land, comprising someone hundred and forty sites, includes ten ranging from 50 to200 acres and one of over 200 acres.   The land not allocated in development plans, but regarded as potentially suitable   subjectto planning procedure, includes seventeen sites of between 15 and200 acres and five of over 200 acres.   Over 80 per cent of the9,000 acres lies in the coastal plain stretching from Kidwellyto Chepstow and is well distributed to meet the needs of the area.In the well populated mining valleys to the north, however, only about 1,350 acres of potential industrial land were found, and much of this would require extensive preparation before being brought into use for industry.   In some of these valleys,physical difficulties limit the possibilities of large-scale development, but local authorities can contribute to the well-in suitable casesbeing of their districts by ensuring/that smaller sites, includingderelict land, are cleared or made available for industry.Elsewhere in Wales, where the pressure of population on theavailable land is less intense, there is, in general, no serious shortage of possible sites:   West Wales has ample flat land,including considerable acreages for large-scale development inSouth Pembrokeshire;   in Mid-Wales local authorities have been successfully encouraged by the Mid-^ales Industrial development association to set aside or prepare industrial sites;   while in north Wales sufficient land should be available to meetforeseeable industrial needs.    There should be no difficulty in meeting the requirements of projects with a special need forsites adjacent to sheltered deep water.
177.        Difficulty is most likely to arise, not so much from a lack ofland as from a lack of attractive sites in asufficient state of readiness.   It is not always economicallyfeasible to lay out and provide services to sites in advance of demand, but some degree of preparation may well be justified,particularly where the need for development is urgent.   TheGovernment, for their part, aim to have limited reserves ofland in strategic locations which can be quickly brought intouse for industry;   and the industrial estates owned by theBoard of Trade in Ifales are one major source of such land.The Board of Trade already own or are in the process of acquiringland for industrial building which will total just under 400acres.   Some 90 acres are available at Swansea, over 80 acresat Kenfig, and over 70 acres at Llantrisant.   Land is also available at the Wrexham Industrial Estate in North Wales.     Inaddition, small parcels of land suitable for early developmentare held at other places in Wales.   The major holdings of landin South Wales at Swansea, Kenfig and Llantrisant aregeographically well placed to cater for the needs, not only of the areas immediately adjacent to them, but also of thevalleys which lie behind them.   Many local authorities in wales have also been active in preparing industrial estatesand individual sites. -
178.       For the benefit of intending developers itwill be important to maintain up-to-date information aboutsites for industry.   A special survey is being made in the welsh Development Area  by the Welsh Office, in consultationwith the Board of Trade and local planning authorities, andthe results will be embodied in a register of sites available at the Board of Trade Office for Wales for any interestedin establishing industrial enterprises.   Advice on suitablesites can also be provided by the Mid-Wales IndustrialDevelopment Association.
PBODyCTWlTT179*    So stimulate further growth, it is important topress ahead with efforts to raise industrial efficiency,,   what has already &quot;bean achieved is encouraging, but in conditions ofintense and growing competition it is vital to take advantageof new technologies, materials and processes.   Comprehensivemachinery has been established by the Government, or with government support, to encourage more efficient operation.Hie National Economic Development Council and the economic development Committees for individual industries are bringing the concentrated attention of the Government and both sides ofindustry to bear on measures to improve productivity, increaseexports and generally raise levels of, performance,,   TheBritish Productivity Council,, through its office and committees in Wales, is also concerned to bring management and employeestogether in efforts to increase standards of efficiencyu   InSouth Wales, where more than 400 firms are members of productivity committees and associations, some 150 eventswere arranged in 1966-67 to further the study of new techniques and the oross-fertilis&amp;tion of ideas,   The value of these studies and discussions lies mainly in the practical applicationof the new ideas they bring to the surface.   Shortage ofcapital need not be a barrier to the adoption of newE.1.
manufacturing techniques, since firms in Wales, especially inthe Development Area, can take advantage of the substantialGovernment assistance described in paragraphs   161-163*     138180.    With increased output should go increased attentionto quality, reliability and design:   customers at home andabroad are increasingly well organised and educated to demand the highest standards.   There is scope for raising thesestandards in both the new and older sectors of Welsh industry;and,while the larger and more progressive firms have responded to this need, the record of many of the smaller firms hasbeen disappointing.TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT181.   Speedy application of the results of research anddevelopment to industrial processes is most important to thegrowth of competitive industry.   Britain&apos;s expenditure on research and development is relatively high and our output of scientific ideas and information is impressive, but we are notreaping a full return from our efforts.   The major responsibilityfor greater progress rests on industry, but the Government can and do help.Researeh 11and. Industry182.   Industrial research and development is a^ present veryunevenly distributed between different firms, most of it beingcarried out by a handful of the larger concerns.   Some two-thirds of industrial research in Wales is done by one-third of the manufacturing industry there, including one firm which, with about 2 per cent of title manufacturing labour force?employs some 12 per cent of all graduates in Welsh manufacturingas in the rest of Britain,industry;   bulymany firms, including some which are concernedwith new or advanced products or processes,do little researchthemselves and pay scant attention to work done elsewhere.
Many enterprises need to develop research facilities oftheir own, or at least to take more advantage of research icarried out at central industrial laboratories, Governmentstations and the universities,183*   The rapid growth of research work in its university and technical colleges is of major significance to Wales.Since the War, the science depariaaents of Welsh colleges havebeen substantially re-housed and re-equipped.   In the five years ending 1966=67, expenditure by the University of Wales on scientific and technological facilities  exceeded  10 million,including over  7 million on new buildings 0   At Swansea, forexample, the new applied science building and facilities,completed at a cost of approximately  4 million, compare favourably with those of any other similar establishment in britain.   Government support for research projects in Welshcolleges has also been substantially increased, the total of current research grants awarded having now reached nearly 1 million .   The colleges are anxious to help in solving thepractical problems which industry is facing and industrialistsin Wales should seise this opportunity.   Many successfulprojects have been pursued by the colleges in collaboration withsome of the larger industrial companies in Wales, but many of thesmaller companies have failed to appreciate the valueof these facilities on their doorstep.   The University colleges and the College of Advanced Technology, as well as some of thetechnical colleges, are well equipped to carry out research,design and development work for industry in special fields.   TheSchool of Engineering Science at Bangor, for example, can greatlyassist commercial developments in the fields of scientificinstrumentation and industrial control systems, whilst otherdepartments at Swansea, Cardiff and Aberystwyth offer manypossibilities in metallurgy, electronics, engineering, chemistryand other fields.   Go-operation between industry and the collegescanr.1.
spur technological advance in the former and direct the attentionof the latter to important practical problems.Assistance by theMinistry of Technology184*     Since the First World War successive governments have supported the activities of industry by themselves developingresearch facilities in many fields.   These facilities and theirfindings are readily accessible to Welsh industry, and provideone of the easiest ways for industry to keep abreast of progress.185.     The Ministry of Technology help industry to seekout and apply new technical knowledge, whilst keeping closely in touch with industry&apos;s needs for programmes of research,development and technical support.   As part of a national network,five industrial liaison centres have been based on the WelshtheCollege of Advanced Technology at Cardiff and/technical collegesat Swansea, Newport, Treforest and Connah&apos;s Quay.   These centresare responsible for promoting technological innovation in thesmaller and medium-sized firms and offer a wide-ranging technical information service to help solve industrial problems.   Other newadvisory services, including mobile demonstration units, arebeing developed.186.      The Ministry of Technology and the National ResearchDevelopment Corporation can also provide financial backing forthe development of new products or processes.   In suitable casesrisk capital can be made available on a joint basis with firmsfor this purpose.   This work may be carried out in collaboration with university departments, Government laboratories or industrial firms.   National Research Development Corporationprojects already in progress in Wales include a modest contract with a small precision engineering firm for the development of a self-aligning epicyclic gear, and support for the completeautomation of a production line for the manufacture of floorcoverings from the raw material to the packed product.   Enterprisesin Wales with the necessary capability and foresight can takeadvantage of financial and technical co-operation of this kind to reduce the risks of taking bold steps forward.-100- r.l.
Management187* In today&apos;s highly competitive conditions,management itself must have an understanding of the advancesthat are being made in techniques and the ability to assesswhich of them are most likely to prove profitable.     This canbe done by giving scientists and technologists wideropportunities of participating in management, but it alsorequires up-to-date training of executive personnel.     these considerations are neglected by many companies in Wales.Senior management courses offered, by Welsh colleges are notwell supported, particularly by the smaller and medium-sizedcompanies, and few of these firms operate their own schemes or make use of trade association facilities.    While it may bedifficult for the smaller firms to spare managers and traineesfor long academic courses, it would often be possible for the colleges to devise mutually convenient arrangements for courses of most practical use to such firms.     The Yfelsh College of advanced technology and three colleges of technology in SouthWales offer courses of a post-graduate type for the Diploma in management Studies, organised on a block-release or part-time basis, and thus particularly suitable for people already in industry; and the University of Wales are in the process of developing courses in management studies at both undergraduateand post-graduate level.     The Welsh Committee of the CentralTraining Council have taken considerable interest in managementtraining, in the reasons for the poor support of the managementtraining courses at Welsh colleges, and in the relevance ofsuch courses to the training needs of managers.
They have encouraged research by Cardiff University College,supported by the Government, into methods of determiningtraining needs and of validating training methods.   The WelshCommittee have submitted their views on this question to theCentral Training Council, who are now drawing up long-termplans for the training of managers.Graduates188.       The output and employment of people qualified to initiate and develop new industrial processes is crucialto technological development.   Several important sectors of manufacturing industry in Wales, including engineering andelectronics, employ far fewer graduates than the UnitedKingdom average for their industry, and often do not offersatisfactory career opportunities to those whom they do employ,which in turn makes recruitment more difficult.   It isessential for industry to use the special abilities of thegraduate, and for the colleges to ensure that their training is related to industrial needs.Automation and Computers189.       Growing enterprises will increasingly need toapply automation and computers to their industrial processes.There is considerable scope for the wider application of low-cost control and inspection de/ices throughout industry,apart from the highly sophisticated systems of automation whichare expensive to design and install.   Some eight-five computersare now installed in Wales and others are on order.   Many ofthese are used in industry for data processing, designcalculations and process control, and a number outside industry have time available on their machines.   The large industries,for example steel, have been particularly active in employingthis powerful tool, but there is a need for smaller firms, inparticular, to look closely at the assistance it can provide.
If the use of computers in Wales follows the national trend,there should be about 19Q in operation by 1970 and over 300 by1974.     To speed the use and development of computer techniques,and to help relieve the acute shortage of qualified staff, theGovernment have set up a National Computing Centre at Manchester,which needs to be supported in Wales by the further developmentof educational and training courses in Welsh colleges and other centres.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING190. Training of industrial labour is particularly important in Wales, where many workers will move into new industries requiring new skills, and where shortages of skilled workers could impede the introduction of these industries.Even craftsmen who do not change their industries must be readyto adapt their skills to meet changing needs, advances intechnology and the use of new materials.     There is a human,as well as an industrial problem, because both young peopleentering industry and those already employed in it need to feelthat they are doing a useful and satisfactory job.In Industry191. Changes in the industrial structure in the past two decades have improved the range and capacity of trainingavailable in Wales.     New enterprises using mass productionmethods demanded new skills in their toolrooms, machine shops and fabrication departments which Wales could not at first meet,and many established training organisations to train their ownworkers.     Despite the rapid expansion of industry, shortages of craftsmen have remained relatively constant and marginal,and exist largely because training is time-consuming and expansion has outpaced the rate of training.R. 1.
192.        There remains much unrealised potential in the contribution that men and women in Wales could make to the economy.     More than three-quarters of the unemployed do not possess skills used in modern industry and these, like most menfrom the basic industries who change their jobs, will be unableto realise their full abilities until they acquire new skills.There is also untapped potential among young people, as Table 4illustrates.TABLE 4Comparison of Training Available to Pupils who Left School for employment in 1966Boys Wales Great Britain&quot;IT f0Apprenticed to skilled trades     36.6 42.4Entered work offeringlittle training 52 34*1Entered professions, clericalwork and work offeringshort courses of training 11.4 23*5GirlsEntered clerical work 28.6 40.1Entered work offeringlittle training 56*3 37*8Entered apprenticeships,professions and workinvolving short courses of training 15*1 22,1There is room for more youths to be apprenticed, and the availability of girls for clerical work should attract officesto Wales,   A number of firms have reduced theapprenticeship period from five to four years by the adoptionof more systematic methods of training;   and this gives industrygreater flexibility to meet new situations as well as a more rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers.193.        The. increasingly specialised processes of indtistrymake, standardised training methods less effective except inimparting general skills, and most industrial training must be closely matched to specific jobs in individual firms.     It istherefore difficult to anticipate the training needs which may
arise in any area until the requirements of individual firms are known.     Individual enterprises cannot usually train many more skilled men than they require themselves and, since thereare some which offer little training, some form of co-ordinationis necessary.     Until 1964* &quot;the Minister of Labour had no powersto influence the situation except by exhortation and, whenshortages had become apparent, by training provided in government training Centres.The Industrial Training Act 1964194o        In order to secure an adequate supply of trainedworkers, to improve the quality of training, and to distributethe cost of training more fairly between firms, powers were obtained under the Industrial Training Act 1964 to establishindustrial training boards for particular industries, eachresponsible for the adequacy of training at all levels in its own industry.     The boards are required to evaluate the trainingbeing done and are empowered to levy from firms a contributionto the total cost of the industry&apos;s training effort.     They paygrants to employers providing training to approved standards,and in this way both influence the quantity and quality oftraining and redistribute more equitably the total cost.     Theadoiotion of planned systematic training will be encouraged bytothe boards and this will help/shorten training periods.     the overall volume of training required in particular industries will be determined by the boards in consultation with theMinistry of Labour&apos;s Manpower Research Unit   and the economic development Committees,     If necessary, boards may themselvesprovide training in their own centres.     Eighteen industrial training boards have been established so far, extending overmost of the manufacturing sector and activities as diverse as agriculture, road transport and hotel and catering, and they now cover nearly half the employees in Wales.     Additionalboards are being set up for the food processing, distribution,
petroleum, chemicals and rubber processing industries, andthe influence of boards should rapidly spread over theindustrial life of Wales.195*      The Central Training Council were appointed toadvise the Minister of Labour on the exercise of his functions under the Act and on any matters relating to industrial and commercial training he may refer to it.     As a result ofthe Act the old Industrial Training Council was abolished, butprovision was made for the consultancy service it had given to
II. 1 .continue under a new body, designated the Industrial TrainingService, with a board of directors appointed from members ofthe Central Training Council.     Officers of the Service give assistance to industries and to individual companies to developtraining schemes at all levels, including group training schemes196.       The Central Training Council have constituted aCommittee for Wales to examine the implementation and operationof the Act in the Principality and to promote additionaltraining effort.     The Committee, in particular, encouragefirms to employ qualified training officers, who are key figuresA sample survey of some 350 firms in Wales made in 1966 revealedthat the number of companies employing their own trainingofficers had risen from 33 to 6l since 1964, a further 18 were planning appointments, and half the firms surveyed had experthelp of some kind in planning their training.     Firms that are too small to employ training officers have been urged to formgroup training associations employing group training officers,and eleven such associations, comprising 92 companies, have been set up in Wales in the last two years.     The Committee havegiven special attention to training in several industries notyet covered by boards;   they have examined the contributionsmade to industrial training by colleges of technology,particularly in the management field.;   and they are currentlystudying problems of industrial training in Mid-Wales.     the welsh Economic Council have stressed the importance of relatingthe work of the training boards to the special needs of Wales,and arrangements have been made for regular consultation betweenthe Council and the Committee for Wales.Assistance by the Government197* Although training in specific skills must remainlargely the responsibility of industry, there are many ways inwhich Government assistance is made more directly available to
firms.     Technical colleges provide courses of technical &quot;education associated with industrial training which are likelyto develop rapidly under the influence of the 1964 Act, andthey assist in training in basic skills.     In 1966, first yearplaces for apprentices available at technical colleges in Walesquadrupled and a &quot;pilot course&quot; is being developed to teachbasic office skills to young clerks.198.        The Ministry of Labour provide, through industrial training boards, a wide range of grants designed to stimulatetraining;   including grants for the training of trainingofficers, towards the cost of the industrial training content ofsandwich courses leading to a degree or equivalent qualification,and towards the running costs associated with additional &quot;offthe job&quot; training places.     In I967, as a further measure, 2 million is being made available to the training boards to enablethem to give grants to employers throughout Great Britain towards thecapital cost of n&amp;chdnery and equipment installed in their training baysor centres to permit schemes of retraining for semi-skilled workers to be developed.199.        As a direct contribution, the Ministry of Labouroperate Government Training Centres at Cardiff and Llanelli whichtogether provided in mid-1967 some 577 training places in about20 skilled trades, and 60 places for first year apprentices.There are waiting lists for most of these classes and interestin training is strong;   3,518 applications were received in1966, more than 50 per cent of them from persons already inemployment.     The Welsh Economic Council have recommended thata third training centre be provided in South Wales.     This isbeing done, and when the new centre, at Port Talbot, is fullyoperational the three centres will produce about 1,500 trained men per year in trades and numbers closely related to industrialneeds.   The Ministry&apos;s direct services also include a range of trainingR. 1
courses in the skills of supervision, provided locally byspecially qualified trainers.     Special courses in instructionaltechniques are also provided for instructors in industry.200.     New or expanding firms in the Welsh development area can receive a wide range of training assistance from theMinistry of Labour, particularly if their needs are identifiedat an early stage.     Assistance can include weekly grants inrespect of individual trainees for additional jobs;   grants forcourses of management, supervisory, and technical training;half the rent and rates of temporary training premises set up inadvance of factory occupation;   and waiver of fees for theMinistry&apos;s courses of training for instructors and supervisors.In addition mobile instructors attached to Government TrainingCentres can be lent to firms to organise and begin the trainingof workers in semi-skilled engineering operations.201.     Agreement was reached in March 19^7 on a scheme, thefirst of its kind, under which those concerned will co-operate,for a period of a year or so, in making use of some of the fineresources of the Royal Air Force station at St. than to help inthe urgent task of training additional skilled men for industry.202.     The combined effect of the measures being taken byindustrial training boards and of the stimulus offered by theGovernment&apos;s direct assistance is considerable.     The Committeefor Wales of the Central Training Council will seek to ensurethat the objectives of these measures are fully achieved.EXPORT PROMOTION203.     Further advances in productivity, quality,reliability and design, technology and training will help toincrease the already substantial Welsh contribution to theexport trade.     The Welsh coal and steel industries have longaccounted for the whole of the United Kingdom&apos;s exports ofanthracite and tinplate.     These are how supplemented by an increasing volume of the output of industries comparatively newto Wales, such as chemicals, cosmetics, electrical equipment,foodstuffs, machinery, man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals,paper and paper products, toys, vehicle parts and many other products.     Manufacturers in Wales, two of whom received the
Queen&apos;a Award for Industry in the first year of the scheme foroutstanding export achievements, are keen to increase their contribution to our overseas trade.   They have shown this risinginterest by forming the South Wales Exporters&apos; Club, one ofthe first in the United Kingdom; by participating in InternationalFairs in Vienna and Copenhagen; and by arranging the visit of aWelsh Trade Mission to Canada in 1966.   The Board of Trade keepin close touch with over 700 firms in Y/ales to help them with their export problems and have recently opened an office in North wales to improve services there.   The Government well understand thedifficulties of developing new overseas markets and they willcontinue to give help and encouragement to exporting firms.204.      Wales offers great opportunities for industrialdevelopment.   There is a good supply of suitable labour whichhas proved its adaptability. Communications with the industrial areas and markets of England are being greatly improved, whilethe work in progress on the ports of South Wales is providingbetter access to the world.   For new industrial enterprise, sitescan be made readily available and the incentives offered by theGovernment in the expanded Development Area of Wales give valuablefinancial advantages.   Both new and existing enterprises enjoy thebenefits of -the services in the fields of technology and industrial training which have been described.   The success and growth ofindustry will much depend on the maintenance of a high quality of management and on the co-operation of employers and tradeunions in the earnest pursuit of new techniques and greater productivity.   In these ways the inevitable shift of labour fromtraditional occupations can be accommodated as it occurs, and therecan be secured for Wales an expanding prosperity spreading amongthe people of all parts of the Principality.
CHAPTER IX .,SERVICES205*       The economy, and industry in particular, is dependent on the provision of services.    This Chapter willdescribe the problems and prospects of the construction industry, which is itself a large employer of labour.    Itwill then turn to the gas and electricity industries, and finally to the important services provided by the Post Office.THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRYStructure of the Industry206.       The construction industry is dependent upon theorders placed on it for new building and for the maintenanceof existing buildings.    Demands on the industry are thereforeclosely linked to the rate of economic growth and   the industryis quickly affected by fluctuations in the economy.    In thetwo decades after the last War the work-load on the industryin Wales grew steadily.    New contracts reached a peak of  170million in I966, and the number of employees in the industryis estimated to have increased between 1959 and I966 from70,000 to 84,700.     The measures taken in I965 and i960 to dealwith the economic problems of Britain checked the growth, butthe current reduction of activity in Wales should be lessmarked than elsewhere and recovery quickened by the Government&apos;measures for increasing economic activity
B.1in Development Areas.   On the other hand, the run-down in majorconstruction projects such as the Wylfa Head and Aberthaw power stations can be expected to result in a fall in the labour forcebetween now and 1971*   Many workers in the industry who areitinerant, following contracts as they occur, came to Walesexpressly for work in existing civil engineering contracts, andare likely to leave  when these contracts are completed.In the long run, the amount of construction work in Wales, onhouses, schools, hospitals, factories, offices, roads, water,sewerage and other projects, is likely to result in a steadyrate of construction activity.207*     Pew construction firms based in Wales operate ona large scale:   out of nearly 3,700 such companies only aboutfifty employ more than a hundred workers each.   The smallercompanies have contributed to the considerable rise in outputwhich has already been achieved in Wales5 but, as contractsincrease in size, a growing volume of work is  being undertaken by large organisations from outside Wales which have the requiredcapacity.   In some parts of Britain there have been instances of smaller companies working together in order to obtain thebenefits of larger contracts and of buying materials in bulk,but there has been little progress on these lines in Wales.  !The ability of the industry in Wales to meet demands upon itwill depend on there being a ready supply of materials, anadequate and suitably trained labour force and increased productivity.Materials ,208.      Fluctuations in the level of constructional activityhave made it difficult for suppliers of   some materials to keep their production in step with demand.   A steadier work-load on the industry
should enable the producers of materials to plan ahead with greater confidence.   Building materials produced in Wales,though limited in range, can make a significant contribution tothe industry&apos;s needs.   Brick manufacturers in Wales have recentlybeen faced with problems of over-stocking? and,although the demandfor bricks should rise with the growth of construction activity,Welsh brickworks will continue to face strong competition fromproducers outside Wales.   Production of cement, sand and gravelhas been increasing and future supplies from Welsh sources are well assured.   The output of slate is adequate to meet the levelof demand, largely for maintenance but including some export trade.Craftsmen209.      There has been for many years an almost continuousshortage of craftsmen.   The reduction of the period of apprentiship to four years will help to increase the supply of skilled workers, and an addition to the numbers of craftsmenwill accrue from the Government training centres referred to inparagraph 199, but the industry will lose about one year&apos;s normalintake of school-leavers with the raising of the school-leaving age.   It will be important to make the best possible use of skilled labour, and the establishment of the construction industry Training Board will help the industry to improve thequantity and quality of the training it must provide and to adapt itself to changing methods.Productivity210.        Progress in raising output will also depend onimproved productivity.     This can be helped by the organisationof work in longer flows;   by encouraging local authorities to let work in larger contracts;   and by promoting the use ofindustrialised techniques.     These last offer considerable advantages in terms of increased output with economies inskilled labour and they are gaining ground.
211.    The bulk of construction work will, however,continue to be carried out by traditional methods and, in Walesas in the rest of Britain, every effort must be made to improve the efficiency of these, for example by keener attention to     &apos;design and site organisation.   There is need for a strengthening of professional and managerial staffs, adequate training inup-to-date processes and management procedures, increasedmechanisation, improved working conditions and the adoptionof methods to eliminate delays due to bad weather.   The useof improved techniques in repair and maintenance, which atpresent absorb about 40 per cent of the building labour forcein Great Britain, offers the prospect of valuable economies in manpower.   The efficiency of the industry can also be improved bybetter contractual procedures, the further standardisation ofcomponents and dimensions and the introduction of new materials*The Government are carrying out research and development in allthese fields and have set up, in the National Building agency and the Agrement Board^new organisations to appraise the merits of new systems of building and of new materials and components*
R 1GAS212.      There has been a marked rise in the consumption of gas in Wales since 1949 and this trend is expected to continue.Domestic demand has increased by 70 per cent, commercial demand by 110 per cent and industrial demand by 193 per cent.    As aresult, the total output of gas has more than doubled in thisperiod and reached an average of about    87    million cubic feeta day in the year 1966-67, with a peak demand of nearly   131 million cubic feet.    The Wales Gas Board, who provide employment for about,000 people in Wales, expect consumption to increase by 6 percent a year up to 197$* .213-,       To meet this considerable increase in demand, theBoard have carried out a major reorganisation of their system ofsupply and distribution.    On nationalisation of the industrythey took over ninety gas works, which produced gust under halfthe gas sold in Wales, the remainder being supplied by the cokingovens of the Welsh steel and coal industries.    In 1962, 95 percent of the gas supplied by the Wales Gas Board was coal-basedand only one-tenth was manufactured in the Board&apos;s own plants.The continuing growth of demand, particularly peak demand in coldweather, and the prospects of even more rapid growth in the future,required the installation of additional capacity.    To providethis the Board turned to the new oil-based processes which were much cheaper to install and operate and for which lightdistillate feedstocks were readily available from British oil refineries;   so between 1963 and 1 9^4, three gas-from-oil plants,producing a total of up to 15 million cubic feet per day, wereinstalled in South Wales and a fourth plant producing 5 million cubic feet a day at Wrexham.

On nationalisation of the industrythey took over ninety gas works, which produced -just under halfthe gas sold in Wales, the remainder being supplied by the cokingovens of the Welsh steel and coal industries.    In 1962, 95 percent of the gas supplied by the Wales Gas Board was coal-basedand only one-tenth was manufactured in the Board&apos;s own plants.The continuing growth of demand, particularly peak demand in coldweather, and the prospects of even more rapid growth in the future,required the installation of additional capacity.

214*     To meet longer term requirements in South wales the Board built at Llandaroy a high pressure oil gasificationplant, the E. M. Edwards Works, the first phase of which wasofficially opened in 1965 with an initial capacity of 45million cubic feet of gas per day.   This plant can be expanded,by the installation of additional gas-making streams, to produce a maximum of 200 million cubic feet a day;   and two such streamsare already in hand to produce an additional 30 million cubicfeet a day by 1968.   At Cardiff, a further gas-from-oil plantwith a capacity of 12 to 15 million cubic feet a day was broughtinto operation in late 1966.   To meet the expanding demand in north Wales, the Board have constructed a high pressure oilgasification plant at Wrexham capable of producing 20 million cubic feet a day.   Of the total gas supplied in Wales, theproportion based on coal has now fallen to about 70 per cent.215*     Gas is distributed through two main grid systems,mostly constructed in the last ten years, one in North and mid-Wales and the other in South Wales, with a total length of1,000 miles.   A high pressure pipeline has been constructedto carry gas from the E. M. Edwards Works to the eastern and western sections of the South Wales grid, and now extends toCaerwent in the east and Ammanford in the west.   A similarpipeline has been laid in North Wales to transmit gasfrom the new plant at Wrexham to Rhyl,216.      /North Sea gas will become available in Wales:while the phasing and quantities have not been finally settled,the indications are that initial supplies will be received in North Wales by 1969 and in South Wales by 1970^7217*      Capital expenditure by the Wales Gas Board from1949 to March 1966 totalled about  43 million, and their plannedinvestment for the four years from 1966-67 to 1970-71 is ofthe order of  28 million.   The schemes already completed by
the Board and those now planned will ensure that any likelyfuture demand for gas in Wales can readily be met.ELECTRICITY218.       Consumption of electricity in Wales has more thantrebled since 1948 as a result of increased use by industry,which now accounts for some 65 per cent of the total load, andthe wider use of electricity in the home.     In the same period the number of consumers in Wales has increased from 538,000 to965,000.    The electricity supply industry in Wales now providesemployment for over 15,000 people.    In the early post-war years, mainly because of rising industrial demand, electricityhad to be brought into Wales, particularly at times of peakdemand.    A major programme for the construction of generating stations in Wales has since been carried out by the central electricity Generating Board, and generating capacity has now well overtaken the maximum demand for power.     Large coal-firedpower stations have been built at Uskmouth ^&apos;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;),Carmarthen Bay, Connah&apos;s Quay, Rogerstone and Aberthaws   a hydro-electric scheme has been constructed at Rheidol, nearAberystwythj and Britain&apos;s first major pumped-storage scheme atPfestiniog.     The first Welsh nuclear power station, atTrawsfynydd, was brought into operation in I965.     Accordingly,Wales has now become not merely self-supporting, but anexporter of electricity and in 1966, after meeting the Welshdemand of 10,000 million units, 3,000 million units were supplied to England.     Capital expenditure on generatingcompletedstations 7in Wales since 1948 has amounted to  234       * million,the increase in generating capacity, which has enabled someobsolete plant to be closed down, is shown in Table 5.

In addition to the existing integratedgrid system of 275 kV and132 kV lines for the transmission of power, a super-grid of 400 kV lines is being constructed in Northand South Wales for the inter-connection of major power stations and the strengthening of outlets from stations now being built.220*.     The distribution of electricity in Wales is carriedout by two Area Boards, the South Wales Electricity Board and theMerseyside and North Wales Electricity Board.    Since 1948 the .two Area Boards have invested a total of about  122 million in providing for the distribution of electricity supplies to theofvarious classes/consumers. Both Boards are very dependent ontheir industrial load and the South Wales Board showed a lossfor the first time in its accounts for the year 1 965-66.
/221.A major task of the Area Boards in Wales has been to extend rural electricity supplies.    In 1948, only 14 per cent of the farms in Wales had mains electricity:   by the end of 1$66,some 94 per cent were receiving supplies.     Of other ruralpremises, 97 per cent are now connected to the mains.    Thecapital cost of this programme to the Boards since 1948 has been about  22 million, and rural supplies are estimated to involvethe two Boards in an annual loss of about  1.5 million.    the boards have carried out a detailed assessment of the number of premises still unconnected and the extent of the further networkextensions necessary.    Many of the properties still to besupplied are relatively remote from the electricity network,with a consequent increase in the average cost of affordingsupplies.     The contributions of new consumers towardsconnection charges will accordingly be higher, but many farmsmay be able to qualify for Government grants towards their shareof the capital cost.
POSTAL AND TELBCOMMDHICATICStS SERVICES222,    The Post Office in Wales continuously review   thePrincipality8 s requirements and base their planning  or manyyears ahead on the information they can obtain on future developments from local and other authorities concerned with housing and industrial building.   Particular attention is givento developments such as the new town at Cwmbran, to ensure thetimely provision of facilities and their subsequent expansion in step with needs.   The demands on services, already ata high level, are expected to increase very rapidly duringthe next decade and more, and the General Post Office are planning to meet them at the lowest possible cost to the public.Tele communications223.   As Table 6 shows, the size of the telephone system, as measured by total working exchange connections, has grownfaster in Wales than in the rest of Britain and is expectednearly to treble between 1965 and 1980e

Expansionof the trunk network to meet the growth of traffic has alreadybsen considerably accelerated, and the latest techniques arebeing used to speed up and cheapen new provision and make thebest use of existing plant.224*.       Despite the heavy demand for new telephones, nowrunning at a rate of nearly 30,000 a year, the waiting list(i.e. those orders held up by shortage of equipment or lineplant) is less than 2jj8Q0 and about 60% of new orders are met withiia fortnight.   Manufacturers have made exceptional efforts to
increase their output of exchange equipment and, in spite ofthe substantial growth of demand which is expected, the waiting list should be cleared before 1970*     The rapid growth of telephone calls has led to some telephone traffic congestionbut this is likely to be cleared within the next year or so.Only 10 of the 462 exchanges in Wales are still manuallyoperated and these will be converted to provide diallingfacilities by 1970.     Over 55 per cent of subscribers can nowdial some of their own trunk calls;   this facility will beavailable at every large exchange and most of the smaller onesby 1970-71* and only a few of the very smallest will be withoutsubscriber trunk dialling by 1973*   -&quot;The number of distant &apos;exchanges to which subscribers with S.T.D. are able to dial isalso being progressively increased,22%       Concurrently, new equipment and services are being developed.     The high frequency cable network will be extendedto additional centres in Wales, using a new design of cable and a compact transistorised amplifier which can be putbelow ground.     Developments are proceeding which will increasethe number of conversations that can be carried by existing cables,More efficient types of exchange system are being evolved andsome 30 small electronic exchanges each up to 2,000 linescapacity are expected to go into service in Wales duringthe next five years.     One of the first in the United kingdom will open in Llanwern early in 1968.    Provision is being, madgfor substantial expansion of other essential services such asTelex and Data Transmission and to meet the nedds of broadcasting authorities and other specialist users.     TheFreefone service, which enables customers to telephone orderswithout any charge to themselves and is now widely available,was pioneered in Wales.     The Post Office have collaborated withthe Glamorgan police force to introduce in South Wales the firstroad congestion announcement service in the. United Kingdom.
^2&amp;V        Despite the considerable growth in telecofimunicatiaasservices, rises in costs and demands on scarce manpower are being kept to a minimum by a constant search for ways of increasing productivity.    Modern techniques of construction andmaintenance and improved patterns of organisation are being fully exploited.     It is planned that the increase of 40 percent in the number of working telephones in the next five years will be achieved with no increase in engineering manpower 5   andthat by 1970, largely as a result of subscriber trunk diallingdevelopment, only the same number of telephonists will be needed as in 1950, despite nearly a six-fold increase in trunkcalls0    Telephone billing is already beingv concentrated onCardiff and fully mechanised, in part electronically;   itwill soon be computerised.     The next ten years will seeconversion to computer working of most other accounting andgeneral office work, and as a result clerical and other office staff should not exceed half the number required by presentmethods.Postal services227.       In order to meet the expected growth in postaltraffic described in Table jj &quot;the Post Office are introducing a wider range of mechanised methods to speed the mail and simplifyits handling at reduced cost.     Some of the larger officesalready have mail conveyor systems and new sorting offices arebeing built at Cardiff and Newport with more complex and far-reaching mechanisation.     This will include conveyors to carrymail bags from the offices to railway station platforms, whichamong other advantages will help to ease road congestion.

Other steps are being taken to increase efficiency.It is expected that the use of codes for postal addresses will beintroduced in certain cities and towns throughout the UnitedKingdom within the next few years, and letters bearing an address which includes the postal code will eventually be sortedat every stage by automatic equipment.    When this planmaterialises, some areas of Wales will be among the first to beincluded.     The Post Office also intend   to regroup   theirmanagement units so that, without any reduction,in service tothe community,tbafcr activities can be more economicallyadministered.    Mail will be handled more efficiently by concentrating sorting, despatch and delivery on fewer offices.
Other Post Office Services229-.       In addition to their postal functions, the 2,000post offices in Wales are providing an increasing range of services to the public, many of them on behalf of other GovernmentDepartments.     The agency services, covering pensions and allowances, savings, licences, national insurance and othermatters, today represent about half the business transacted atpost office counters.     The new Post Office Giro or postalcheque system will be introduced at about the end of 1968.This system will provide cheap and efficient current bank account and money-transfer facilities through a centralised office andwill be made available at most Welsh post offices.Mew Building230,      The modernisation and expansion of the postal and telephone services is linked with an extensive building programme to provide new or enlarged post offices, sortingoffices, telephone exchanges and engineering centres.     The costof work in progress in Wales is approximately  1,500,000 and between now and 1970 work will start on the erection orextension of 23 postal buildings and approximately^roximately 100 exchanges and engineering centres at a cost of about  6 million.    Between1971 and 1975 nine more postal and about 80 more telephone building projects are planned at a cost of about  2,250,000.

FART THREE - THE ENVIRONMENT231&apos;*      In addition to the forms of economic activitywhich have been the subject of the Chapters in Part Two, the life of a country requires to be supported in other ways.   Theprovision of houses;   the preservation of the beauty of the physical environment in which men and women live, and itsrestoration in those places where it has in the past been damaged or destroyed;   the health, welfare and social security of thepeople;   the education of the young;   and the things of thespirit, are all no less important to contented existence than ismaterial prosperity.   It is with these matters that this Partwill deal.CHAPTER XHOUSING232.      It is one of the main objectives of government policy to do everything possible to ensure an adequate supplyof good housing.   It is necessary in Wales, as in other partsof Britain, to replace or improve many of the existing dwellings;to add considerably to their numbers in order to remedyshortages and provide for the growth of population;   and in so doing to improve the environment in which people live.Existing Houses233*      Rapid industrialisation in the nineteenth centurywith its accompanying urban growth, and the long years betweenthe Wars of relatively little new house-building, have leftas a legacy a very high proportion of old and unfit dwellings.Although Wales does not have anywhere such large areas ofclearly unfit dwellings as some of the English and Scottishtowns, it has a greater proportion of old dwellings than anyEnglish Begion or Scotland.   More than half of the existing
894,000 dwellings were built before the First World War,nearly a third more than eighty years ago, and about a quarter merethan a hundred years ago.   Many of these older houses were built to standards that are no longer acceptable, and suffer fromchronic dampness and structural defects which it would beuneconomic to rectify.   About 185,000 houses have no fixed bath,and about 150,000 no hot water supply.234*      Age of itself does not make a house a poor dwellingplace:   much of the older stock is very well built, lacking onlymodern facilities to make dwelling-places good for many years to come.     The proportion of owner-occupiers is high in Wales,and in the Rhondda Valleys, for example, nearly three quarters ofthe present stock of houses is owner-occupied.   The post-wartransformation of the appearance of these owner-occupied houses,the neatness, cleanliness and bright paint, show what can beachieved outwardly.   With the help of the Government1sImprovement Grant schemes, about 7,000 houses are being improvedeach year.   Many more could be improved, and the Government hopethat the rate of improvement will increase considerably.   the sense of greater security given by the Government&apos;s proposalsfor leasehold reform should encourage more householders to takeadvantage of the improvement schemes.Replacement of Old Houses235,     Still, a vast problem of replacement lies ahead.It is not yet possible to estimate firmly how many of the olderhouses will need to be replaced g.s incapable of substantial improvement.   Looking well into the future, changes in the standards required by householders may mean that older houses which might be accepted as adequate dwelling places now, with or without improvement, will cease to be: acceptable.   Atpresent, estimates of the replacement necessary have to be madeon the basis of imperfect information.   Surveys by local
bousing authorities made in 1965 suggest that at least 40,000houses are now unfit I that the number is growing   rapidly;and that, if the rate of replacement is to catch up with theneed within fifteen years, some 135,000 new dwellings arerequired for the purpose in that period.2369        Moreover, the fabric of many towns needs to betransformed if an environment of the standard demanded in moderntimes is to be provided.    Much can be achieved by the improvementof older houses and of the details of the environment, but itwill be necessary to clear and replace many houses which,although themselves not unfit, form part of an area that isunfit as a whole.     Further experience in tackling the problemsof urban renewal is needed to show how many structurally soundhouses will have to be replaced in.this process, and at thisstage only tentative estimates can be made?   at present around figure of 1,000 a year is assumed, malting a total of 15,000in a fifteen year period.237&quot;        Then in most towns there is a need for majorroad works, more parking places, more open spaces and somerearrangement of shopping areas, which will require the demolition of houses.     It is difficult to forecast how far such demolitionswill coincide with the clearance of unfit and obsolescent housing,and how far they may reduce the stock of good houses.     once more only tentative estimates can be made at this stage, and again an assumption is made of a round 1,000 a year, making atotal of 15,000 in a fifteen year period.238.,       So far, therefore, the estimate of new dwellingsrequired in a fifteen year period as replacement is -

Thecompensation which can be paid rarely enables the owner ofan older house to buy a new one, and where he is rehoused bythe local authority his outgoings on rent and rates are greaterthan those which he formerly had.     This situation, though, not peculiar to Wales, creates special difficulty there because ofthe high proportion of owner-occupation.

There are stillwaiting lists for council houses and, of the present numberof about 890,000 dwellings, some are, at any time vacant in thenormal process of changing occupants and some are holiday orsecond homes.     The existing, shortage is estimated at about20,000.241.        In addition to malting good the shortage andreplacing unfit and obsolescent houses, it will be necessaryto provide for a growth in population.     On the assumptions about population growth made in Chapter Y,    the number of households needing a separate dwelling would increase in a:fifteen-year period by about 80,000.Li&apos;-129-

The element for dwellings alreadyby local authoritiesregarded/as unfit (40,000) is certainly an under-estimate;   andthe problem of obsolescence has to be seen against the background of a large number of old houses of which something like 300,000will be more than a hundred years old in fifteen years time.Thus it seems likely that many more new dwellings will berequired in a fifteen-year period than the figure of 265,000above, probably at least 300,000.   In the short term the current level of housebuilding, which is rather more than 19,000 a year,,needs to be raised to deal   with the existingshortage and the replacement of unfit houses, as well as to keeppaoe with the increase in population.   For the next five years,the target can confidently be   put at 100,000 dwellings.   Thismeans an average of 20,000 a year, rising to a rate of about21,000 towards the end of the five years, and the situation will need to be kept under review from year to year.Measures to Achieve the Necessary Future Production244*       In        years after the War the immediate task wasto make good the gap in housebuilding caused by the War yearsR1The Total Need242*     The figures set out so far give a total as follows:-Replacement 165,000Current shortage 20,000Increase in number ofhous eholds 80,000
and the low rate of housebuilding in Wales in the years betweenthe Wars.     Between 1947 and I963 the rate of building fluctuatedconsiderably, but averaged about 12,000 a year.      In 19^3 thesituation was reviewed in the light of the I96I census, and itwas estimated that even the more urgent needs required the building of 175,000 houses between I96I and 1971j and that to achieve this itwould be necessary to raise the rate of building to 19,000 ayear by I966, and to maintain this rate to 1971.     The figure of19,000 houses a year was in fact reached in 1965 and maintained in 1966.245.        A rise in the shorter term to 20,000 houses ayear and then to 21,000 would represent a further stepping-up ofa performance that has already risen sharply over the last threeyears, and would require conditions in which the building; industryand the local authorities can meet the demands made upon them.The Government, for their part, will help to create theseconditions.     It is expected that,as in recent years,the public sector and the private sector will  contribute roughly equalshares of the programme.246.       The greatest part of the burden on the public sector will be carried by the local authorities, and their willingness to build must be backed with financial ability.     Ahigh level of building lays a financial burden on the localauthority, and this burden will be the greater when, as inus thappen, an increasing proportion of the new houses built willbe in place of unfit houses which have to be demolished.     Toprovide the financial help required, the Government are increasing the subsidies payable to local authorities.     Thenew Housing Subsidies Act, by relating subsidies to permissiblecost, both increases the financial aid given to localauthorities and encourages them to be conscious of the costof their housing.     The Act provides for a basic subsidy which
in effect stablises at four per cent the interest payable bylocal authorities on the funds they borrow for house-building,and also provides further subsidies to give extra help to themore needy councils.     The spur to private enterprise to buildhouses is provided by a public willing and able to buy them.The Government will assist private house purchasers who wouldnot qualify for tax relief by making cheaper mortgages availableto them under the Mortgage Option Scheme.247*&quot;     A11 SBla^gsdprogramme also calls for increased efficiency from the construction industry.     The problems thatarise in this field are described in Chapter IX.    A higher rate of building will require more efficient techniques, andindustrialised methods must be used to cut down the total man/hourcontent that goes into the building of each dwelling.    Atpresent, about 30 per cent of new dwellings in the public sectorin Wales are being built by industrialised methods, and this proportion will need to be increased.   The National BuildingAgency will help and advise local authorities in selectingfrom the many new systems that are now being devised.248.       Local authorities are encouraged to planprogrammes well ahead, in order to provide the industry with amore constant demand upon it.     They are also helped to formconsortia for the purpose of arranging joint programmes, toenable them to let larger contracts to ensure this continuityand to encourage the use of industrialised methods.249*        It is important that the closest attention shouldbe paid to the quality of construction, design and last^out.With the introduction of increased subsidies, local authorities will now be exj)ected to incorporate in future housing schemesstandards recommended in the. Parker Morris Report (&quot;houses for Today and Tomorrow&quot;, H.M.3.0. 1961), particularly those concerned with&apos;space and heating.      To encourage good design
in housing, the Welsh Office are presenting annually a GoodDesign Medal, and are always ready to assist and advise localauthorities and others who have problems of design and layout.250..,       Although, broadly speaking, there Is no insuperable difficulty in obtaining building land for housing in Wales, theuse of more difficult sites   is necessary in themining valleys, where the need to build on steepsites, clearance areas and derelict land may require new designsadapted to these conditions.     As increased building brings anincreased need for a continuous supply of building land, theLand Commission will be able to help both local authorities and private builders.
CHAPTERTHE   PHYSICAL   ENVIRONMENT251*      The surroundings of a house are almost as important to the quality of living as the house itself.   While most ofthe general landscape in Wales is very attractive, there areplaces where the density of development is too high, where thetown-centres are inconvenient and choked with traffic, wherethe general urban environment is drab, where there is inadequate opportunity for recreation and where there isindustrial pollution and dereliction.   Many people have learntto live, with resignation if not with contentment, in suchconditions.   But often the younger and more ambitious seize the first opportunity to move away, leaving behind themcommunities which are the poorer for their absence and whichare all the less able     to attract new industries and theirkey workers.The Towns252,,      The improvement of the physical environment shouldbe made to accompany the building of houses.   As the precedingChapter has indicated, at least   300,000 new houses will be needed in Wales during the next fifteen years, more than halfof them to replace old existing dwellings.   This largereplacement presents opportunities for re-shaping much ofthe urban fabric in just those localities where the environment is most in need of improvement.253j       One requirement is to reduce the density ofdevelopment where this is so high that essential amenities,such as playing-fields, are lacking, or where the growth of population and traffic is causing congestion.   Fortunately,not only is the average density of population in Walesrelatively low but, even in the more heavily populated  parts
-135-Rl.of South and North Wales, the overall population densities doHot exceed 1*5 persons per acre.    These densities are wellbelow those in populous areas of England, such as the conurbations of South-East Lancashire (10.1 persons per acre),Merseyside (14*4) and the West Midlands (15*9).254.       In the rural areas, covering two-thirds of Wales,all the towns are under 15,000 in population - mostly a gooddeal under - and are mainly old-established and compact markettowns.     Many have problems of obsolescence and traffic congestion, but space for new houses, industries, roads andother urban purposes can usually be provided by normal outwardgrowth.     Even in Mid-Wales, with its high proportion of hillland, the consultants appointed to look into the possibilitiesof a new town there were able to advise that there were foursites capable of accommodating large urban growth.255,,        There are problems of urban congestion in limitedlocalities elsewhere in Wales.     In North Wales, along the coastfrom Bangor to Prestatyn, there was a population growth of6.5 per cent between 1962 and 1966.     This area is becoming increasingly popular for retirement, while employment is increasing in both tourist and manufacturing industries.     some places along the coast, such as Conway and Penmaenmawr, arehemmed in by mountains, but most of the land needed for urban development (estimated to be 1,600 acres in the next fifteen years) can be found near other, less confined, towns in the-area.     Deeside too is experiencing appreciable population growth, and has local problems of urban renewal.     In North-East 7/ales as a whole, there is a considerable surplus of landsuitable for development;   but difficulties arise in some parts of the area, and in particular at Wrexham, where the impetus to urban growth conflicts with the need to retain good agricultural land.
256.. South Wales has the greatest demand for land, butthere is no overall difficulty in meeting most of this.   on present expectations, a requirement in the region of 5,000 to5,500 acres for urban development is likely to arise during thenext fifteen years.   Much of this can be provided by expanding the existing towns, especially in West South Vales, whereSwansea for instance has no difficulty in finding adequate supplies of building land.   Port Talbot, constricted bymountains and sea, is less well placed but it has some reserves.In East South Wales too there is a surplus over present demands.The needs of people emigrating from the Monmouthshire valleystowards the coast have largely been met at Cwmbran and the settlements in the south of the County.    There is room for growthto meet further needs of this kind and also to satisfy demandsarising at Newport from problems of urban renewal.257*-   One of the more difficult planning problems in SouthWales arises from pressures to develop in the neighbourhood ofCardiff, coupled with the need to reduce congestion within theCity.   The overall town density of Cardiff is quite high (17persons per acre, compared with 7.7 at Swansea), and there arepockets of high-density slum property (up to 125 persons per acre) which the local authority are.,progressively clearing.   Morespace is required for commercial development and traffic, andconsultants have recently advised that to provide this the areaof the business centre of the City will need to be doubled.There is plenty of land suitable for building purposes withindaily travelling distance of the centre, and the problem is not one of excessive population in relation to the total availableland;    it is whether the bulk of future growth should continue tobe concentrated on the periphery - so conflicting with thedemands of agriculture, amenity and recreation, and making it more difficult to relieve road .traffic and other congestionwithin the City itself - or whether some of the new development should be located further afield.
258.  There are density problems in some of the central valleysof South Wales, where urban growth in constricting physical      77circumstances has resulted in the congestion of buildings, badlay-out and inconvenient, sometimes dangerous, road acoess.Notwithstanding persistent net migration f rora the central and eastern valleys,amounting to 70,000 during the last fifteen years,the number of inhabited houses has increased.   The problem manifestsitself in a shortage of land for new industrial and other development,open spaces, school playing-fields and for better traffic circulationwithin the valleys.   As in the case of Cardiff, there is landavailable within daily travelling distance and the density problemwithin the valleys can be solved by redeveloping their areas ofunfit property and by carefully selecting sites for new developmentnot far distant from the present constricted towns.259,   ^e growtk of motor traffic makes it increasingly urgentto reshape the larger towns in ways which will provide safer and less congested conditions for both oars and people.   Because manybuildings in town centres are obsolete for modern business purposes and are backed by areas of old housing due for replacement, thereare opportunities for constructing more efficient and attractiveshopping and business areas.   Over thirty towns in Wales already have comprehensive redevelopment sohemes in progress or in preparation.   The Welsh Of f Ice will continue to encourage localauthorities to prepare and adopt soundly conceived schemes whichcan be carried out as circumstances and resources permit.   Whilemany years will be needed to do all that is necessary, this is allthe more reason why as rapid progress as possible should be made and why special care must be paid to the safety and convenience ofpedestrians and others.260.    The Wel^i Off ice will also give practical support to measures aimed at eliminating eyesores inherited from the past and at preventing the creation of further unsightly development.High standards of design and layout in public and privateBl
building will be fostered by merit awards and by assistance and advice to local housing and planning authorities.   The Welsh    178Office will encourage local authorities to undertake comprehensivehousing renewal and improvement schemes where these can bringabout better environmental conditions.   There are other ways in which surroundings can be improved, such as tree planting and improvement of the design and maintenance of street equipment,and the Government will give all the help they can to measuresof this kind.   Detailed schemes for creating a betterenvironment are being prepared for some of the valley towns, andlocal authorities will be encouraged to prepare schemes forall towns.261.     There will remain great scope for local and voluntaryefforts to tackle these problems.   A Civic Trust for Wales hasbeen formed to attract public attention to the need for improving the urban environment and to advise on how this can best be done.The Trust is assisting with town improvement schemes and hassponsored the setting up of local civil societies at Aberaeron,Caernarvon, Cardiff, Conway, Ferryside, Llandeilo, Monmouth,Newtown, Saudersfoot and Swansea.262.    Local authorities can rely on the pride of people intheir towns and villages responding to encouragement to ensurethat their wider surroundings, as well as their own homes, offercomfort, pleasure and security.   Some of the seaside and countrytowns and parts of some of the larger cities already well justifycivic pride.   Those living in a new town, like Cwmbran, are presented with a modern environment which, through local bodies and associations, they can help to shape.   Others, living in someof the older towns and villages scarred by decades of neglect,may well feel that there is little they can do to bring aboutbetter conditions;   but just as a series of small improvements- can work wonders in brightening a home, so they can bring about atransformation of living conditions, even in the worst towns.This is a field of work which cries out for local initiative and above all for leadership which can harness the energyof the younger generation.The Countryside263.    As the population increases and standards of living rise,
including the growing use of the motor-car, more extensivefacilities for outdoor recreation and wider opportunities to enjoy the countryside and coast will be needed.   There are hereconflicts of interest.   The search for peace and relaxation inthe open air could be frustrated by the increasing congestion of roads, beaches and beauty spots.   The growing pressure ona. limited number of recognised recreational areas in the countryside can impede the work of the farmer in those areas,while the uncontrolled exploitation of the countryside wouldthreaten the conservation of natural resources and amenities.264o   Wales has three national parks, Snowdonia, BreconBeacons and Pembrokeshire Coast, occupying about 1,590 square miles or one-fifth of the land surface.   The National ParksCommission and the Park planning authorities have a duty to take such measures as are necessary to preserve and enhance the naturalbeauty of the Parks and to promote their enjoyment by the public.There are also two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, covering the G-ower and Lleyn peninsulas, where special measures of planning control are in operation.   Proposals to designate other attractiveareas for enjoyment by the public are under consideration.   TheNational Parks Commission are investigating the question ofestablishing a fourth Welsh National Park of some 500 square miles of the mountainous area of Mid-Wales,,, in which stress would belaid on the promotion of recreational activities;   and ^they have-put forward?&apos; a proposal for the designation of a further Area of outstanding Natural Beauty covering most of the Anglesey coastline.265.     The Government propose to establish a CountrysideCommission which will replace, and exercise wider functions than,the present National Parks Commission.   The new Commission willhave the task of encouraging increased opportunities for the enjoyment of the countryside, partly through the creation of a
large number and wide variety of &quot;Country Parks&quot;.   The intention is to site these parks within easy distance of main towns, so asto reduce travel and road congestion, and in places where peoplecan gather without causing undue inconvenience to those who live and work in the countryside.   County councils, acting in close consultation with regional and local authorities and with agricultural, sporting and other interests, would be mainly responsible for their design and planning.   The Coverruuent willprovide grants at the rate of 75 per cent to assist the developmentof these and other facilities, such as picnic places.   Othersteps will be taken to improve the means of access to the countryside and to make it easier to use rivers, lakes and otherwater resources for recreation.266.. A closer control must also be exercised over commercial and other developments which could impair the scenery.   Stretchesof the Welsh coast have been spoiled by the spread of unsightlycaravan and other holiday accommodation;   but the Governmentwill aim to keep as much of the coast as possible open andunharmed in the future.   They are supporting the National Trust&apos;s appeal for funds to purchase further lengths of coast for protection, and the preservation of coastal areas is receivingspecial attention through a series of conferences of coastalplanning authorities organised by the National Parks Commissionon behalf of the Government.   In Wales, with its long coastlineand growing holiday industry, such measures are particularly important.   To remedy some of the damage done in the past, local planning authorities are being encouraged to join with other interested bodies in efforts to remove or screen existing eyesores.They will be. empowered to meet the need for more camping andother holiday facilities, where this is not satisfied by privatedevelopers, by providing well-designed and well-planned siteswith the aid of grants.Sport267.  Improved facilities for sport are needed.   Localauthorities have powers to provide recreation grounds, -swiuiming- -140-
pools and other land and buildings for sport.   Occasionally such schemes can be combined with projects for the clearance of derelictand as is proposed at Tredegar.and swimming pools at Bang or and Llan trisant are among recent developments, and a Welsh national sports centre at Cardiff isunder consideration.   Major projects of this sort can beundertaken jointly by groups of authorities and planned to serve a wide area.   A Sports Council for Wales has been established toencourage co-operation of this kind, to stimulate the   developmentof new facilities and to co-ordinate sports provision generally.Derelict Land268.     The reclamation of derelict land presents a seriouschallenge in Wales.   The disaster at Aberfan in October 1966 focussedattention on the potential danger, as well as the unsightliness,of industrial waste heaps, and kindled the determination to takeforceful action to deal with unsafe and derelict sites of all kinds.This task is urgent to improve safety and living conditions and tosecure direct and indirect economic benefits.   The total area ofdereliction is less in the whole of industrial Wales than in someindividual counties of England, but the proportion of/land in theareas affected is often high.   Separate measurements of its extenthave been made by l&amp;oal authorities and the Welsh Office.   The localauthorities&apos; survey covered land so damaged by industrial orother development as to be incapable of beneficial use withouttreatment, and on this basis estimated that there are over 16,000acres of derelict land in Wales.   The Welsh Office field survey was wider, taking in remoter sites and the less obvious spoilheaps which have acquired some form of vegetational cover: thisgave the total area affected as at least 27,000 acres.   Whicheverestimate is taken, a major effort will be needed to tackle theproblem.New sports centres at Port Talbot and Cwmbranderelict
269*    Not all derelict land, however, justifies the expenseof treatment.   It may be remote or hidden or otherwise less in need of urgent attention.   It is estimated that some 10,000 acreswould merit treatment and this can be taken as the present extentof the practical problem in Wales.   About 6,000 acres are in industrial South Wales, where the main forms of dereliction arecolliery and industrial spoil heaps, old colliery buildings anddisused tinplate and steel works with their associated slag heaps.Within the North Wales coalfield, colliery spoil heaps, old brick-works, dumps of tailings from lead mines and abandoned claypits arelocally conspicuous.   In North Wales and Mid-Wales much of thedereliction results from slate quarrying and the exploitation ofmetalliferous ores.270o    *n some arQas, where the unsightly remains of oldindustry are extensive and prominent, the problem is particularlyacute.   These include the Landore area of the Lower Swansea Valley,the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil and the urban districts of;..:,.::.v&apos;,: &apos; : . y&apos;-: . .;:  : ^ ; V&apos;. :VV: &apos;Blaenavon, Ebbw Vale, Nentyglo and Blaina, Pontyppol and Rhymney.In other places, such as the Rhondda Valleys and the middle of theNeath, Tawe and West Monmouthshire Valleys, derelict sitesindividually less extensive could be reclaimed to provideor other urban needs,accommodation, not otherwise easily found there, for new industry/The many advantages of replacing derelict industrial sites withspace for modern factory and other development, wherever this isfound practicable, are evident.   But promising opportunities have often been overlooked.   Within the South Wales coalfield more than,000 acres of colliery spoil heaps have been reworked for theirsmall ooal content.   This activity was not co-ordinated withderelict land clearance schemes and did not result, as it mighthave done, in  improvement of the scene.   On the other hand, some250 acres of coal tips have been planted by the Forestry Commissionin recent years.   In addition, 1,000 acres of opencast workingshave been planted as part of the arrangements for their restoration.At least comparable areas will be planted in the next decade onbehalf of the National Coal Board and local authorities.-142- ^
271.     An intensive study has been made of the Landore area.Formerly the site of a thriving metal industry, this area containsone of the largest single concentrations of industrial derelictionin the country^    Here, with financial support from the NuffieldFoundation the Government and the Swansea County Borough Council,the University College of Swansea have taken the initiative incarrying out a detailed survey of the main area of derelictionand have prepared a comprehensive plan for redevelopment.   In thecourse of this investigation, successful experiments were madewith new methods of treatment, opening up fresh lines of attackcm long-standing problems at Landore and elsewhere.   The findingsacd proposals are being examined by the %british Office and other aufcritlesconcerned.   The Welsh Economic Council have initiated and are co-ordinating a pilot scheme of land reclamation at Tredegar in co-operation with the local authority and other bodies.   A 42-acresite was selected for this purpose and an application by TredegarUrban District Council to carry out the scheme has been approved in principle for grant.272.   In the period 1960-65 clearance schemes approved for grant under the legislative provisions then in force covered onlya few hundred acres.   The area justifying clearance or landscaping,now 10,000 acres, is estimated to grow at a rate of about 100 acresa year.   To clear all this within fifteen years would need anannual programme of about 750 acres.   This ia far beyond the pastrate of achievement^though well within the rate planned in otherparts of Britain: in the Northern Region for instance, it is aimedto clear 18,000 acres of derelict land in the next ten years.273,   The Government have introduced measures which will help to stimulate a much faster rate of progress in Wales, withthe highest priority for schemes dealing with safety problems.The Industrial Development Act 1966 has increased their powers in this respeot and grants of 85% of the net cost are available
for a wide range of clearance schemes likely to contribute to thedevelopment of industry in the Development Area.   For localauthorities in receipt of rate support grant, Exchequerassistance can be as much as 95?S of the net cost.   In cases^iere financial difficulty still arises and safety is involved,the Government are prepared to consider additional help.Nor is Exchequer aid limited to the Development Area: theGovernment have introduced a nevk grant at a lower rate to assistderelict land clearance schemes in any area.   To increase the impetus, and to help authorities with limited resources, athespecial unit has been set up at/Welsh Office with the task of promoting a programme for the treatment of derelict land throughoutWales.   The unit can call on a wide range of professional andtechnical help, but needs the full co-operation of local authoritiesin carrying out its work.   This has been readily forthcoming andmany    treatment schemes, some covering considerable areas ofdereliction, are under preparation.   The unit is also making good progress in plans to co-ordinate with clearance schemes the workof coal recovery companies on colliery spoil heaps.   Thearrangements for  Government help towards schemes for the clearance of derelict land have never been so favourable as theyare at present, and there is now every incentive to attack theproblem on a much larger scale than in the past.   The Governmentare determined to build up and maintain a rapid rate of progress.R.l.
Air Pollution274a      Much effort has gone into controlling pollution ofthe air, rivers and sea by industrial and other processes, butfurther progress and continued vigilance are needed.   As regardspollution of the air, outstanding co-operation has been givenby Welsh industrialists in implementing the Alkali &amp;c.   WorksRegulations Act 1906 and the Order of 1966, which requireowners of certain works to use &quot;the best practicable means&quot;for minimising offensive emissions of fume, smoke, grit anddust.   As a result, much industrial pollution, formerly acceptedwith resignation, has been eliminated.   Ten years ago in SouthY/ales there were about a hundred chimneys continually emittingblack smoke from open hearth furnaces:   not one remains.   steel companies in Worth and South Wales have spent large sums on special equipment and have corrected most causes of seriousair pollution from their plants.   Much of the dense red-brownfumes resulting from the intensive use of oxygen in steel-making,which formerly gave rise to persistent complaint, is now arrestedby equipment with an efficiency of about 99 per cent;   in theCardiff area alone this equipment prevents about 100 tons ofdust a week from entering the atmosphere.   In the Landore/Llansamldjt area of Swansea, which&apos; used to suffer from the continuous emission of white zinc oxide, dark smoke andsulphuric acid mist, new processes fitted with modern arrestmentequipment have virtually eliminated the problem.   The oil refineries at Milford Haven and the large petro-chemical plant at Port Talbot operate essentially free from complaint;and otherchemical works in Worth and South Wales are overcoming theirproblems wi-tih new treatment plant.   The discharge of dust frompower stations is now almost entirely prevented by the use ofnew electrical precipitators.
2jejj       For *any remaining problems, solutions are in sight.Welsh cement works are taking part in a general drive to fitnew equipment to prevent the emission of dust.   The SteelCompany of Wales have an obstinate red-brown fume problem with one of their processes at Port Talbot, but are planning to overcome this within about three years by installing new plant.Improvements are being made at coke ovens in South Wales andShotton, and the phurnacite plant at Abercwmboi is to berebuilt in a way which will reduce past difficulties.   Atceramic works better firing methods are markedly reducingsmoke.   Atmospheric pollution problems at the british petroleum Company1s Refinery at Llandarcy are decreasingand the Company and others concerned continue to seek stillbetter results.276*      Some hard-core problems remain.   These includeacid soot emission from certain ceramic works, salt flux fumeproblems associated with aluminium recovery and otherindividual difficulties.   Nor has a practicable method yetbeen found for removing sulphur oxides from power station fluegases and these still have to be dealt with by the not alwayssatisfactory method of dispersal from high chimneys.    research into these remaining difficulties is being vigorously pursued by industry and the authorities concerned.277. is also important to press ahead with action under the Clean Air Act 1956   to reduce air pollution by smoke from coal-burning appliances, even though this is a lesserproblem in Wales than elsewhere.    Concentrations of smoke depressenvironmental standards and can have a bad effect on the health of the inhabitants.   While in Great Britain as a whole, about half.of the atmospheric smoke comes from the traditional openfire, most of Wales is well served with fuel which produces-i46-Rl
little smoke.   The coal used in the more densely populatedparts of South Wales has a volatile content of 20 per cent orless and is thus for all practical purposes smokeless; and, inthe built-up areas there, geographical and climatic factorscombine to ensure that smoke is quickly dispersed, so that smogconditions, when they occur, are usually much less intense andpersistent than in many urban areas elsewhere.   The main problem is found in the industrial areas of Denbighshire andFlintshire, where some of the coal used has a higher volatilecontent than that used in South Wales.   Pour of the five smokecontrol orders under the Clean Air Act so far made in Walesaffect areas in Wrexham, Connah&apos;s Quay and Mold, covering375 acres and some 2,000 premises;   while the other order madeapplies to 43 acres and approximately 650 premises at Newport,Monmouthshire.   The Welsh Office will continue to support localauthorities who bring forward further orders.   Householders inthe areas covered by such orders are given substantial grants towards the cost of replacing their existing fuel appliances.Sewerage and Sewage Disposal278*       Steady progress has been made over many years insafeguarding public health in Wales through more efficientsanitation;   but a great deal remains to be done to replaceoutworn sewers and to improve disposal arrangements.   Ruraldwellers rightly expect modern amenities and, wherever practicable, these must be provided.   Again, many rivers andsome beaches near populous areas are marred by pollution.   the increasing use of river intakes for water supply purposes, andthe high amenity and recreational value of clean running water,make it essential to purify sewage effluent to an acceptablestandard before discharge.
279*       The measure of the effort needed in this field isshown by the fact that schemes under examination would coet an estimated  80 million in the next fifteen years, compared withthe  30 million spent in the last fifteen years.     Much of this expenditure will be required to replace or improve many of the trunk sewers laid at the beginning of the century in theindustrial areas between Newport and Llanelli.     Nearly all thesewerage authorities in these areas have this problem and someof them are also having to carry out major new schemes to cater for new expansion.     In the rural areas of Wales there are stillsettlements without main sewerage facilities:   Government grants are available to help schemes necessary in these areas and itwill be aimed to complete this work in the next ten years.280.      Other urgent tasks are the replacement of certainold sewage treatment plants, such as those now serving Aberdare,Mountain Ash, Merthyr Tydfil and parts of the Wrexham district;and in some areas there is a need to provide new disposal workswhere no treatment has been given previously, as at Newport,Bridgend, Bangor and Caernarvon.     Public concern about thedischarge of untreated sewage into the coastal waters around the welsh coast is growing and there are areas, along the SouthWales coast in particular, where it will be necessary to considerproviding at least some form of partial treatment beforedischarges are made.     Hie rising-volume of these dischargesmake it essential urgently to assess the need for new measures,and the Welsh Office are considering to what extent it will be practicable to tackle the problem through further joint action by the authorities concerned.Contamination of Beaches by Oil281.       Oil pollution of the sea and beaches is a growingmenace, as was dramatically demonstrated in March 1?67 by thewreck of the &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; on its way to Milford Haven.     the rapid increase in world production of oil and the establishmentof large oil refineries in Europe since the War
have heightened the problem, which is usually caused by the    \ 8discharge of oil sludge from tankers on the high seas.     Becauseof the position of the Welsh coast in relation to the GulfStream and the shipping lanes linking Europe with the rest ofthe world, it is particularly liable to suffer from thispollution, with consequential damage to beaches and danger tobird life.     The contamination of beaches along the Welsh coast-line, more particularly in South and West Wales, has become more widespread over the last few years9    but has hitherto mostlyaffected the smaller beaches and coves.     There is a specialrisk at Milford Haven and the precautionary arrangements there,which were already the most stringent in the world, have been further strengthened after a spillage from a tanker inJanuary 1967*282.        The difficulty about this problem is that a fullsolution requires international co-operation.     Althoughproceedings under the Oil in Navigable Water Act 1955 may betaken against any vessel of any nation for discharging oil inUnited Kingdom territorial waters, no such action can be taken against a foreign vessel if the offence is committed outsidethose limits.     All that can be done is to report the offence tothe Government of the country in which the vessel is registered,and then only if that Government is a signatory of theInternational Convention on Oil Pollution.     Neither can theperpetrators of the nuisance be made resjjonsible for the clearance of any oil spillage.     Thus, when oil pollution arises,the task of dealing with it normally falls on local authorities with limited financial resources.     Some of these have takenspecific powers to deal with oil contamination on the beachesand, in a few cases, before it reaches the shore. &apos;283.        The wreck of the &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; focussedattention on-another and greater hazard.     As a result, theGovernment took the initiative in convening an early meeting ofthe Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative organisation to consider what changes are now required in international
maritime law and practice, and will continue to seek a widermeasure of international agreement to deal with the problem.The pollution which was caused by thewreck added considerably to knowledge of how it can best bedealt with,supplementing studies by a working group set up bythe local authority associations and the Institute ofPetroleum, and further advice has been given to coastal localauthorities.
CHAPTER XIIHEALTH. WELFARE AMD SOCIAL SECURITYHEALTH AND WELFAREXESThe demands on the health and welfare services iaWales are continually rising.   These services are important inthe economy and need to be efficient and of a sufficient sizeto serve the growing population of Wales, within which there willbe an increasing proportion of older people.   The Governmentprovided within the resources that can be made available.   in wales the hospital services are administered by the WelshHospital Board and seventeen hospital management committees,except that the teaching hospitals are managed by theBoard of Governors of the United Cardiff Hospitals.   The health and welfare services are provided by thirteen county councils,four county borough councils and one municipal borough councilexercising delegated powers.   The general practitioner, dental,ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services are provided through,contracts with fifteen executive councils*285,   The expenditure on health and welfare services in wales in 1967-68 is expected to be  83 million.   This includesover  45 million for the hospital service, compared with 15*3 million in 1954-55 and  24 million in 1959-60*   In the constant search for better standards of care for patients, costs are likely to go on rising.   New forms of treatment, by drugs,:surgery or other means, may involve greatly increased costsj   but where such treatment enables patients to leave hospital sooner orto avoid hospital altogether, the higher cost may be offset bylower costs in the recuperative period.   The trend nevertheless isfor treatment to require the co-ordinated efforts of teams ofspecialists working with complicated and expensive equipment. Asa result, the health services will have to be more closelyintegrated, with medical units working in well-equipped centres and in closer conjunction with one another.   It follows, therefora.that it would be impracticable for the full range of modernare determined that adequate and up-to-date services should be-151--152-

Substantial sum3 have already been allocated to providing new, and improving old, premises.   Between July 1948and March 1967, nearly  365- million was spent on hospital building, including expenditure on schemes in progress.   Among169 schemes, each costing over  30,000, included in this programme were eight which cost over  1 million each and ninemajor schemesother/costing between  250,000 and  1 million each.   Of the eighteen major general hospitals planned to be developed in .Wales, eight are now in course of development.288c      More remains to be done.    The task before the welsh Hospital Board is to meet the needs of the expandingpopulations in industrial South Wales and North-East Wales and provide a modern hospital service in the sparsely populated and difficult terrain of rural Wales.   The Board are building and planning a number of large new hospitals at locations where theneeds of the population can best be met, some on existing sites and others on &quot;green fields&quot;.   Nine major building schemes(i.e. schemes estimated to cost over  250,000) are expected to 1begin in the period up to 1969-70, and a further twenty-two areplanned to follow, in stages, as resources allow.

Between July 1948and March 1967, nearly  36  million was spent on hospital building, including expenditure on schemes in progress.

in the number of general medical practitioners in Wales.  Atpresent they number about 1,230 and the acre effective useof their services can be brought about by changes in theorganisation of their practices, especially by an increase in thenumber of group practices and health centres and by the employ-sent of more ancillary staff.   Close co-operation will benecessary between medical practitioners and local health authorities, who are responsible for providing health centres and for employing health visitors, home nurses, midwives, social workers and home helps, who provide support for people in theirown homes.   It is also desirable, in the interests of bothdoctors and patients, to raise the standard of surgery premises and Government financial help is being made available to general practitioners for this purpose..29Qo There are at present some %00 dentists practisingunder contract with Welsh Executive Councils:   this number isnot likely to increase significantly in the early future and, inview of the proportion in the higher age-groups^ it may fall.i Inthe longer term, the output of the new Dental School in Cardiffwill help to ease the shortage of dentists.291. She demand for ophthalmic services is growing, partly as a result of the increasing proportion of older people in thepopulation;  &quot;but no serious difficulty in maintaining adequateservices in Wales has arisen.292. *h* rising cost of pharmaceutical services is uniwcontinuous review.   In Wales, the average cost of drugs perperson supplied through the National Health Service haspersistently tended to be higher than in England, and researchis being carried out into the reasons for this trend.Meal Authority Servioes293. Tb.e health and welfare servioes provided by localauthorities have a growing part to play in promoting health and social well-being.   Their objectives are firstly to preventillnesa and disability;   secondly, where illness or disabilityooour but do not require the special servioes which onlyhospitals can give,
to assist in the provision of care in the home;   and thirdly sin the case of such special groups as the elderly, the physicallyhandicapped and the mentally disordered, to provide residential accommodation and training centres.   Through these and the otherhealth and welfare services administered by local authorities,the commmity tends to the needs of its less fortunate members.To increase their effectiveness, they will need more staff,equipment and premisese294s    Local authorities have reviewed their development plans for the ten years up to 1975-76 and aim to improve the.whole range of their health and welfare services.   In that period the plans envisage capital expenditure in Wales of over 16.6 million, $ompas^d with about  9 million in the previousdecade.   Local authorities in Wales aim at increasing the numberof staff engaged on personal services in the home by 24 per cent and the number of ambulances by 17 per cent.   They are planning for a considerable expansion of places in residential and otherestablishments;   for instance, from 59 to 463 in hostels formentally subnormal adults;   from 2,150 to 3,648 in trainingcentres for the mentally subnormal;   and from 5,381 to,575 in homes for the elderly.   They also aim at an increasein the number of health centres from 5 to 28 by 1976, in order tohelp the more efficient deployment of the family doctorservices, and to effect &quot;closer co-operation between local health and general practitioners;authorities / and present indications are that this number of28 will be exceededo   The Government wish to secure,through these and other planned developments, as rapid a rateof progress as possible towards a higher standard of health and welfare services in Walesffl
SOCIAL SECURITY I 9 g295*      To meet modern needs the Government are makingfundamental changes in the character of the social security arrangements which were brought into operation in 1948 on thebasis of the Beveridge Report.     The long-term aims have been toprovide earnings-related pensions and benefits which will avoid a sudden, drastic fall in income at the onset of unemployment,sickness or retirement1   to improve the position of specialgroups such as widows j   and to remove once and for all thebarriers which have discouraged many people in need of supple-mentary help from seeking it in the form of national assistance.As first steps towards achieving these aims, the rates ofunemployment, sickness and widows1 benefits and of retirement pension were raised in 1965 by the largest increases in absolute terms since the start of the national insurance scheme in 1948and there were comparable increases in war pensions and national assistance rates.     Subsequently, a system of earnings-relatedsupplements to benefit during the first six months of unemploy-ment, sickness or widow-hood has been introduced;   national assistance has been replaced by a new system of supplementary benefits, which includes the provision of a form of guaranteedincome for old people and others with long-term needs such asthe chronic sick;   and the former separation of the administrationof national insurance and national assistance has ceased withthe creation of a new Ministry of Social Security covering thewhole field.     The Ministry have systematic arrangements for ensuring, by personal approach if need be, that those retiringor widowed are aware of their rights under the new supplementary benefits scheme.     Their contacts with these people, and withthose receiving supplementary benefit, will provide a valuablemeans of ensuring that the needs for welfare services, as wellas financial needs, do not remain unmet because they are not known to the authorities who can provide for them.296.     These improvements in the country&apos;s system of social security are of particular importance to the people of V/ales.In Wales, as will be seen from Chapter V,   there are large scale-156-
problems of redeployment in industry and unemployment is wellabove the average national level.   Relatively lar^e numbers ofpersons are employed in industries such as coal mining which presentexceptional hazards of sickness and injury.   In recent years some per cent of the total amount paid in national insurance pensionsand benefits, war pensions, non-contributory old age pensions and national assistance has been received by: people in Wales, whereabout 5 Per cent of the population of Great Britain live.297.    r^e Government1s review of social security is continuing.It includes study of the position of low-wage earners with families and of other special groups, and of the various problems associatedwith the development of an earnings-related pensions scheme.

They have already declared their intention of raising the school leaving age to 16 in 1970-71.     It will alsoremain their policy to encourage young people to stay at school voluntarily beyond the minimum leaving age.     in wales, where education has traditionally bean regarded as the mainhighway towards a better life, this practice is already wide-spread:   of those in maintained schools and aged 13 in 1^)62^17*3 per cent were still in school four years later, as comparedwith 12.4 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.     TheGovernment want to see this trend continue after the school leaving age has been raised.300.        A large programme of school building is required^both to meet the needs of the rising school population, includingthe increase   which will result from raising the school leaving age, and of families in new housing areas, and also as faraa possible to
replace old and unsatisfactory school buildings.    Between         g1966 and 1972 the number of pupils in maintained schools in wales is expected to rise by   about 93.OOO or some 21 per cent.The Government are increasing their allocations for school building.    For England and Wales as a whole the authorisedlevel of school building of all kinds is to be raised from  117million in 1965-66 and I966-67 to  131 million in 1967-68 and 150 million in 1968-69 and I969-7O, on the basis of limits on costs existing after August I966.     The totals for the yearsI968-69 and 1969-70 will include a special allocation for raising the school leaving age.     Wales will share fujly inthis increase.     Thus the total sum allocated to Wales for1968-69 for the major school building programme and for raising the school leaving age, but exclusive of minor works and allocations to special schools, is just under  8 million, ofwhich  2.94 million is for raising the school leaving age,the comparable figure for I966-67 (which did not include provision for raising the school leaving age) being  5*4 million.3Q1.     It is the Government*s policy to continue expanding the supply of teachers so that classes can be progressively reduced to the regulation sizesof thirty in secondary schools and forty in primary, or even further.     The eight general colleges of education and the one specialist College of Domestic Arts in wales have already expanded their total student population from about 1,800 in 1957-58 to more than 5,000 in 1966-67, and will increase their numbers further to well over 6,000 by 1968-69,302.     The Government intend to raise standards and widenopportunities, not merely for selected pupils, but for all.     Tothis end, they propose to eliminate separatism in secondary education by encouraging reorganisation on comprehensive lines.Notable progress has already been made in Wales.   A Welshlocal education authority (Anglesey) waa the first in EnglandI?-r^.......
and Wales to adopt the comprehensive system for all itssecondary schools.   In July 1965, when the Department ofEducation and Science issued their circular 10/65 oncomprehensive education, four Welsh authorities, includingAnglesey, had already instituted a complete system of comprehensive secondary education;   and a year later, by which time plans were required to be submitted, all the other authorities in Wales had plans for the whole of their areasready or nearly ready.303&quot;,       The Government also wish to see further progressin the modernisation of school curricula and teaching methods.These matters are being studied by the Schools Council and theirWelsh Committee, and a number of projects aimed at reforming the teaching of English, Welsh, mathematics, science and foreignlanguages at various levels have been initiated.   special attention is being given to the pattern of sixth form courses andto the changes in the curricula consequent on the raising of theschool leaving age.   Steps are being taken to familiariseteachers, and pupils approaching school leaving age, with conditions in industry.   In addition, plans are being made toencourage the establishment of local and regional centres for teachers concerned in modifying and improving the curricula.304.       The Government are anxious to ensure as far aspossible that, in the schools of Wales, all those who wish to learn Welsh should be given the opportunity of doing so.   In themainly Welsh-speaking areas, instruction through the medium of welsh is common in the primary schools, and in some secondary schools certain subjects are taught in Welsh.   In the mainlyEnglish-speaking areas, forty-two schools or departments havebeen established, including five secondary schools, in whichthe main medium is Welsh.   The Government will continue to
encourage the development of schools of this kind, includingcomprehensive secondary schools, where this is the policy ofthe local education authority.     There will also be increasingattention to the teaching of Welsh as a second language, and tothe development and adoption of modem techniques, such asaudio-visual aids, for this purpose.    As a contribution towards this objective, the University and other educational bodies are carrying out a great deal of research and experiment intomethods of extending and improving the teaching of the welsh language.Farther Education305*    Under the Government&apos;s plans there will be a majorexpansion of the opportunities for further education in Wales,which is required to help meet the country1s needs for a widerspread and higher levels of skill and technical expertise.     Itis proposed to develop courses in the technical colleges at all levels to meet many requirements, including those for industrial training.     In Great Britain as a whole, total current expenditure on further education is expected to increase by 50per cent in the five year period up to 1969-70 and studentnumbers (full-time equivalent) by over one-third.306.     Special efforts will be needed to achieve; this rateof progress in Wales.     Although there has been a rajiid increasein the number of Welsh students at institutions of further education in recent years, the projjortions have not reached the levels found in England, as Table 9 shows.
am*a 202TABLE 9Further Educations   Student Numbers in November I965as a Percentage of Age GroupsWales only      England and WalesAll students aged 15-17 33.17 33.2118-20 21.21 24.77Part-time daystudents aged    15-17 9-46 13.0618.20 8.38 10.44To some extent the short-fall is accounted for by the relativelyhigher proportions staying on at school in Wales until they areat least 17 years of age and going on to universities, colleges of education or other full-time further education.     There is reason to think, however, that the lower intake of apprenticesin Wales and the reluctance of some employers to releasetrainees for further education also accounts in part for thedifference.    As new training arrangements are worked out underthe Industrial Training Act 19^4* and as the demands for skill and technical expertise increase in Wales, the use of further education establishments in Wales can be expected to grow.3Q73    A further re-shaping of the arrangements for technical education will be required to meet modern needs.     Thenumber of students following advanced full-time and sandwichcourses in Wales as elsewhere has grown rapidly in recent yearsand is expected to increase further.     The Government havedecided that there are advantages to be gained from concentratingthese courses in a substantially smaller number of centres, tobe designated polytechnics.     These will aim eventually at aoffull-time student population/normally at least 2,000 each, and develop a wide range of both full-time and part-time courses for advanced technological and professional students, includingcourses leading to degrees of the Council for National AcademicAwards.    The Glamorgan College of Technology at Treforest wasin the list of colleges selected 1
for designation as polytechnics and the localeducation authority have been invited to put forward detailed proposals for its development.     Discussions with the responsible authorities in Horth Wales about the arrangements to fee made for advanced technical education in that area arein progress.308.      There is also a need to develop agricultural,education.    Although the agricultural labour force in Wales is declining, demands on the skill and technical proficiency ofthe remaining manpower are constantly increasing.     There arein Wales five agricultural or horticultural institutesoffering full-time courses of agricultural education of oneyear&apos;s duration or longer, as well as part-time courses, anda further ten centres which provide such courses on a part-time basis.    A proposal is being considered to set up a WelshAgricultural College at the apex of the structure, to providethree-year sandwich courses in a range of subjects, with consequent changes among the agricultural institutes.     In thepast, the demand for full-time courses in Wales has beenvariable and much depends on the increasing support of the farming communityj   but the Government are anxious to ensurethat full-time agricultural education is made available on a scale and at levels sufficient to meet the special needs of wales.University Education309.     The Government have accepted that, in the interest:of the country and of the individuals concerned, there shouldbe a substantial increase in the number of university students.The targets of student population in universities in the UnitedKingdom recommended in the Bobbins Heport were 218,000 places in 1973-74 and about 350,000 by 1980-81, compared with 154,000(including those in colleges of advanced technology) in 1964*Development to 218,000 places in 1973-74 has already
been approved. The     total of full-time studentsin the University of Wales (excluding the Welsh College of advanced Technology and St. David&apos;s College, Lampeter) in theautumn of 1966 was about 10,500.     This was more than double the student numbers in the University in 1956-57&quot;     In addition,there were 1,207 full-time students at the Welsh College of advanced Technology, which is to become a full constituentmember of the University, and 263 at St. David1s College,Lampeter, which is also discussing its future relationship withthe University.310.      The allocations, in the authorised universitybuilding programmes, to university institutions in Wale3 forthe four year period 1966-70 amounted in all to  5 million.The immediately following years cover a period when, accordingto the Robbins Report,the number of University places requiredwill grow more slowly;   and it is hoped that the resources thenavailable will be devoted to making good obsolescence, improvingfacilities, and preparing for the further marked rise instudent numbers expected after the early 1970&apos;s.311.      In addition to the extensions of scale already approved, the range of studies available in the Universityv &apos;*has been considerably widened.     In the sessions between1962-63 and 1965-66, twelve new Departments and Chairs and27 new Chairs/within existing Departments were established, and furtheracademic developments are planned.    Arrangements are also beingmade for courses leading to the award of the Bachelor ofEducation Degree to be established at the expanding colleges ofeducation.312-.      Future development in the economic, social and cultural fields, in Wales as elsewhere, depends heavily onthe rising scale of expenditure and investment in education.Through applying an increasing share of national resources to the higher, as well as other, levels of the education service, the Government will aim to ensure a constantly
widening spread of educational opportunity for young people.Upon them will fall the challenging tasks of the last quarterof the present century, ,.CuITUKEThe Welsh Language313*      A large part of the cultural heritage and historyof Wales is embodied in the language.   It is a distinctive partof the way of life in Wales and is spoken by many as their first language, with English as their second language.   AlthoughWelsh speakers have declined in number throughout this century,the Welsh language shows a remarkable strength and vitalityin the face of the pressures exerted upon it.   The Governmentand local authorities have increasingly recognised that theycan do much to create conditions in which the language canflourishj   but in the final resort, as the Council for Walesstated in their report on &quot;The Welsh Language Today&quot; (Cmnd.2198)pits future &quot;lies largely in the hands of parents and teacherssupported by the goodwill of the community11.314.     Education authorities have for many years foughtto increase the use of Welsh in schools and the progress which i3 being made is described in paragraph    304*Teaching through the medium of Welsh has been extended inrecent years to colleges of education and to the University of wales.   The work of voluntary organisations serving the welsh-speaking population, such as Urdd Gobaith Cvmru. hasreceived considerable support and local authorities have beengenerous in the financial assistance they provide to Welshinstitutions, particularly in the contributions they makeannually towards the cost of the National Eisteddfod.   Thepublication of Welsh books for adults has been assisted by a Government grant which is now  7,500 a year,administered by the University of Wales Press board   and the books Panel of the Welsh Joint Education Committee is doing much
to supplement the publishing of children fs books in Welsh,The objectives of these measures are to provide a vehicle forliterary activity in the language and an adequate supply of reading material for Welsh readers.   It is hoped that thenumber of Welsh books published annually will soon exceed 200*Steps are also being taken, on the advice of the LibraryAdvisory Council for Wales, to improve the supply of Welshbooks in public libraries in Wales and, through the newCollege of Librarianship at Aberystwyth, to increase thenumber of bilingual librarians.315*      The Government have accepted the main recommendations of the Hughes Parry Committee on the LegalStatus of the Welsh Language.   Their report (Cmnd, 2785)recommended a relaxation of restrictions on the use of the welsh language in the administration of justice in wales which exist despite the passage of the Welsh Courts Act 1942.It is hoped to make steady progress in the use of the welsh language in Government forms in fair demand despite legal andadministrative difficulties, and a panel has been appointed toadvise the Welsh Office on translation problems as they arise.New legislation will be needed to give effect to certain of therecommendations of the Hughes Parry Committee and theSecretary of State intends to bring this forward at theearliest practicable date.316.      There is a growing and sharper recognition thatopportunities to enjoy the arts are important to good living standards.   Morgan! more people feel a sense of deprivationif they have little chance to visit theatres, concert-halls and;art exhibitions;   and many are anxious to cherish the formsof culture inherited from the past.   Apart from helping tosatisfy these aspirations, the arts and traditional culture are
relevant to the economic development of any country:   without them, as an integral part of the environment, it is the lessattractive to industrialists and tourists.   People cannot beexpected to settle contentedly without opportunities for a wide range of cultural activity.317.      Wales, unfortunately, is seriously deficient in good buildings and facilities for the arts.   The Council for wales has pointed out v &apos; that there is not a singlepurpose-built concert hall or a modern theatre equipped forprofessional drama of a high standard, no opera house and nonational symphony orchestra.   In Wales, where poetry, singingand drama are fervently admired, cultural development has followed a different path and has been largely based on thehearth, the chapel and the Welsh language.   In a rural economy,for many years virtually cut off from metropolitan centres,people made their own entertainments and followed their ownartistic bents.   Each village had its singers, poets andinstrumentalists, and perhaps its choir and drama group.Fostered by the eisteddfodau, these amateur traditions havestrongly persisted.   Until fairly recent years, Wales has not seriously felt its lack of modern arts buildings..  The villagehall, the chapel vestry, the eisteddfod tent served.318, More recently new ambitions have been stirring.The singer who used to be content with an eisteddfod medal nowaims at Covent Garden or La Scala; local choir members haveswollen the ranks of the Welsh National Opera Company^ finechorus; the drama enthusiast makes his way into television;Welsh painters and sculptors exhibit in London and New York; and through travel and in other ways people in Wales are becomingbetter acquainted with the artistic endeavours of other nations.-167-Report on the Arts in Wales (Cmnd. 2983).
All this is having a profound and gathering effect, and thedemand for a better range of facilities to enjoy the arts is growing.31?.&apos;      Through the activities of the Welsh Arts Council,a great deal has been done both to stimulate and to satisfy thissharpening appetite.   The Council for Wales have paid tribute to their work in organising and financing a great variety ofconcerts, plays and exhibitions and in providing help forcreative artists and performers.   To support this work,through the Welsh Arts CouncilGovernment financial help/has increased from  61,000 in 1960-61to over  155,000 in 1964-65 and  430,000 in 1 967-68.   Largeallocations have been made to help the Welsh National Opera company and the Welsh Theatre Company, while the needs of smallerorganisations and individual artists have not been neglected.This is just one stage in the erection of a solid structure for the support of the arts in Wales.   Inthe White Paper on &quot;A Policy for the Arts&quot; (Cmnd.2601) 9 theGovernment have suggested some lines for advance as resources allow.320.    There is a growing consciousness in Wales of the need to provide new buildings for the arts, especially well-equippedtheatres.   There are schemes for building a theatre in Cardiffas a main centre for productions in the English language, acomplementary theatre in Bangor to specialise in presenting dramain the Welsh language, and a mobile theatre of advanced designwhich could be brought into use more quickly and would make it possible to take performances to all parts of Wales.   Purpose-built concert halls and art galleries are needed in the? largercentres of population in Wales and there should be opportunities to fit some of these into schemes for the redevelopment of towncentres.     Funds, administered by the Arts Council, have beenmade available to assist with the cost of constructing oradapting buildings for the arts;   and the provision of a newadministrative headquarters for the Welsh
National Opera Company is being supported in this way.   Thereare now better prospects that the serious lack of modernbuildings for the arts in Wales will be remedied in time, butmuch will depend on the determined and united efforts of thosewho care most deeply about the present deficiencies.321.     The essential basis of further.....progress is strongerand better organised public support.   This can probably be bestbrought about through the creation of local and regionalassociations for the arts, which can seek to combine the efforts of the Arts Council, local authorities, the University, localarts societies and both sides of industry in a fruitful partner-ship.   Given this solid backing, events can be organised, andnew buildings for the arts can be constructed, with a strongerguarantee of success.   Some progress has been made in Wales.In Anglesey, for instance, an arts trust has been established to organise festivals, concerts and other artistic occasionsof a professional standard, and plans have been made for developing a local arts centre on the island. The Governmentare aiding such developments through the funds referred to inthrough the Welsh Arts Councilparagraph  319.&apos; Grants are available/to assist the formationand running of regional arts associations and have already beengiven to help in the creation of an association in North Wales.The Government are anxious to ensure that the arts are marieavailable to wider sections of the population in all parts ofthe country.   It now rests with local authorities and other      iinterested bodies to respond to this encouragement and to take up the challenge of building a modern structure of support forthe arts in Wales.Rational Institutions322.       Since the War there has been increasingly intensepressure on the space available at the National Museum and national Library of Wales.   The Government are anxious tosee these important cultural institutions develop, and have assumed a large share of the financial responsibility forthis, A twelve-year building,
programme at a cost of  700,000 -was approved in November1964. which will enable extensions and improvements tobe carried out at the National Museum, the WelshFolk Museum and the National Library.   The Governmentplan to meet 90 per cent of  the capital cost of this programme, in addition to providing grants to cover the whole of the approved expenditure of the institutions on revenue account which is estimated to total about  540,000 in 1967-63,   Part of thenew development will help in furthering the Government&apos;saim to provide more attractive restaurants, lecturerooms and amenities for visitors0BROADCASTING323b       Broadcasting authorities have had to meetseveral problems in providing services in Wales,The mountainous nature of the country inhibits the reception of programmes in many places;   the sparsityof the population over large areas makes itdifficult to provide services economically;   and additional facilities have to be provided to meetWelsh cultural and linguistic needs.    Nevertheless,good progress has been made in developing sound and television services for people in Wale Table 10shows 0

New transmitters were later installed to provideseparate Welsh services on very high frequency, and B.B.C. 2programmes on ultra high frequency (U.H.P.)   havealso been introduced in South Wales with the resultthat many parts of Wales have access to four television programmes and South Wales can receive five.   The additional facilities have made it possible to provide moreprogrammes of special Welsh interest or  inthe  Welsh language at peak viewing times.    On
B.B.C. Wales and on Teledu Cymru these are now transmitted for about twelve hours a week, Including six hours of output inWelsh. . -325^    While it is aimed to extend television services tofurther seotions of the population, there are serious obstacles to overcome.   Many people cannot receive signals directly fromthe high-power transmitters because the wireless waves areimpeded by mountains.   The usual solution is to relay programmesthrough low-power stations;   but this involves the use, or sofar as practicable the re-use, of the limited number of channelsavailable to Britain under international agreement, and the stage has now been reached when enough   suitable frequencies arenot available.   Even if they were, the cost of providing new       jstations might be disproportionately high in relation to the-numbers served.   For instance, while the capital cost for people reaohed by the main high-power transmitters of the B.B.C.is less than a shilling a head^ the comparative cost for thoseserved by low-power relay stations may be  5 and can be more thandouble that amount when a special radio link is needed.   Progressby the B.B.C. and I.T.A. in serving people in the remoter areasmust therefore depend on the technical and financial resources available.   Similar difficulties, though less weighty, apply tothe extension of sound broadcasting.326, Despite these difficulties, the B.B.C. and the I.T.A.are planning to increase the coverage of their programmes in wales.    By the end of 1968 the. B.B..C. hope to complete theconstruction of a further eight low-power V.H.F. stations torelay B.B.C. Wales programmes, two high-power U.II.F. stations, to transmit B.B.C. 2 in North Wales, at least four low-power U.H.F.stations to relay B.B.C. 2 in South Wales and three low-powerV.H.F. relay stations for sound broadcasting.   The proportions of the population then able to receive programmes will be aoout73 per cent (B.B.C. Wales, Welsh programme), 96 per cent(B.B.C. 1 orB.B.C. Wales or both), 53 per cent (B.B.C.2) and 96per cent (sound broadcasts on V.H.F.).   The Postmaster General-172-     f
has also authorised the construction of six more V.H.F. stationsby the I.T.A.   These should be completed by 1969 and will bringTeledu Cymru within reach of a further 41,000 people in-Wales.387&apos;, As the B.B.C. have announced;.the colourservice will start on B.B.G. 2 on 2nd December ;This service will be transmitted from the CorporationsU.H.F. stations and will cover nearly half the population of wales from the outset.   It will be extended to other parts ofYfales as additional U.H.E. transmitters for B.B.C. 2 are broughtinto service.   It is expected that colour will be introduced into the B.B.C. 1 and independent television services in Englandwithin the next three years, as part of the plan to change the television line standard, and will thereafter be extended toparts of Wales...&quot;328-. As was announced in December 1966 (Cmnd. 3169) theB.B.C. will provide a popular music programme, which will coverby day about three quarters of the population of Wales.
PART FOUR. - PROBLEMS OF PARTICULAR AREAS329.      The problems discussed in earlier Chapters occur withvarying emphasis in different parts of Wales;   and the purposeof the Chapters which follow is to examine the main problems and prospects of individual areas.   For this purpose it is convenient to divide Wales into the five parts shown on Map No. 3:(a) Industrial South Wales (Glamorgan, Monmouthshire and parts of Brecknockshire and Carmarthenshire;(b) Industrial North-East Wales (the Wrexham area and theDeeside coastal strip);(c) Central Wales (Brecknockshire north of the Beacons,Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire);(d) North-West Wales (Aaglesey, C^caasvoaahire, Merioneth)most of Denbighshire and part of Flintshire);(e) West Wales (Cardiganshire, Pembrokeshire and the rural part of Carmarthenshire)*330.     Some of these areas have common problems.Industrial South Wales and North-East Wales are deeply concernedwith the future of the coal and steel industries.   The other three areas are predominantly agricultural.   Among them, CentralWales is considered separately because it differs in some important respects from the other counties of Mid-Wales dividedfrom it by the Plynlimmon range.   But it shares with them the deep disquiet felt in Wales about the problem of ruraldepopulation, which in 1957 led to the formation, by the counties of Brecknockshire, Cardiganshire, Merioneth, Montgomeryshireand Radnorshire, of the Mid-Wales Industrial development association.   The Government1s efforts to deal with this problemrelate to the whole of rural Wales.
331      In these Chapters, account has been taken of theviews expressed by local authorities and other bodies about thedevelopment of particular areas in Wales.   The implementation of the policies described in them will call for the close co-operationof local authorities and will be the subject of full localconsultation.CHAPTER XIVINDUSTRIAL SOUTH WALES332*     This area, extending some 80 miles along the coastfrom roughly Kidwelly in the west to Chepstow in the east and up to 30 miles in depth, contains the heaviest concentrations of population in industry in Wales.   It comprises a coastal plainwhich broadens into the Vale of Glamorgan, backed by mountainouscountry deeply dissected by valleys, many of which are narrow.Though covering less than a quarter of Wales, the area housesnearly 70 per cent of the population and almost three-quarters of the employee population.   Between 1 951 and 1966, thepopulation of the area increased by 92,500 to 1,834,900.   it contains the  largest towns in Wales (Cardiff, Swansea *and Newport), the only other towns (Rhondda, Merthyr Tydfil and port Talbot) with a population exceeding 50,000 and severalcomparable in size with the largest town (Wrexham) elsewhere in wales.   Many of the problems which South Wales faces today have their origin in the industrial development which took place inthe last century.   Although this is the most heavilyindustrialised part of Wales, most of the area consists of rollingfarm-land and hill-top plateau.Changing Structure333*      The most pressing problems and the most promisingprospects of further development spring from the rapidly changingstructure and distribution of industry and employment inSouth Wales.   For a long period before the Second World War thearea was almost entirely dependent on mining, quarrying and
metal manufacture.     Although those industries still provide workfor almost a third of the male employee population, there hasin the past three decades been a rapid growth of both male and female employment in service and light manufacturing industries and the industrial base of the area has substantially broadened.Today about 37 per cent of employees in South Wales (male and female) are engaged in manufacturing industry (including steel)and about 50 per cent in service (including construction)industries.     But a balanced economic structure has not yet been achieved,&apos;   the rapid contraction of employment in the South Walescoal industry, the number of workers in which has nearly halvedsince 1953? is continuing and a. marked reduction of employment is also expected in the steel industry.     This both presents a need for the rapid development of new industrial employment and provides an opportunity for it.     The substantial numbers of menbecoming available for new employment will be mainly those nowliving in South Wales, especially in the mining valleys andthe western part of the area.     There are also considerablereserves of female labour.     The economy and people of South wales have already shown their resilience to change;   and the processof change is far from ended.     The aim of the Government is toprovide for a viable though smaller coal industry in the area,to consolidate the position on steel, and to encourage the growth of new employment opportunities as part of a pattern of planned and integrated development.The Valleys    &quot;334&apos;        The problems of planning for change are mostprominently posed in the mining valleys, where much of theoriginal economic basis has gone and has been only partiallyreplaced by new industry.     In many of these valleys it isphysically impossible to provide new jobs on the scale necessaryto meet all employment needs locally and there has, in the past,been heavy emigration both to the coastal plain and out of wales.     To some extent a reduction in population has eased
overcrowding;   but the valleys still contain just under half thepopulation of South Wales in physically constricted communities,and there is a shortage of building land, particularly in thenarrower valleys.   Some continuing migration from the valleys is inevitable and the future levels of population and the standards of housing and amenities   in the valleys will continueto need detailed study by the Government and local planning authorities.   The reorganised coal industry in Wales will still depend for its labour on people living in the valleys.For both economic and social reasons the Government rejectany policy which would assume the disintegration of the substantial valley communities;   and they propose instead to seek a solution in an integrated plan of development for south Wales as a whole, recognising the close interlocking ofeconomic and social activity and interdependence of interestsbetween the valleys and the rest of South Wales.335*        One element in an integrated plan must be theestablishment of new employment in the valleys themselves,inso far as this is practicableI so as to reduce emigration or travel to work, to encourage the fuller use of female labour and tohelp provide jobs for men with disabilities incurred in themining industry.   At the northern ends of the valleys in the eastwhere they broaden out, and in the more open valleys in the west,there are fewer difficulties in finding industrial sites.   the heads of the Valleys road will help such towns asMerthyr Tydfil, Aberdare, Tredegar and Brynmawr tohave an assured future and to achieve some growth.   TheGovernment recognise the need to foster new industrialdevelopment within the South Wales valleys, althoughthe problem of obtaining suitable sites will prevent as muchbeing done in this direction as they would wish.   Developmentmust be mainly composed of relatively small units suited tosuch locations.   Many units have already been established
successfully and the Government have sought to give a furtherstimulus to growth of this kind by siting advance factories in the valleys. 218336.        At the same time, the valley communities arelikely to rely to an increasing extent on employment within reasonable daily travelling distance of their homes;   and in thisway it will be easier to provide them with an adequate amount and sufficient choice of employment.    Many people living in thevalleys already work in Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and -Port Talbotand even more people have always used the main coastal towns fortheir shopping and entertainment, while daily travel to work isnowadays much more practicable and acceptable.     The effect ofeconomic changes on communities which have been virtually whollydependent on coal mining is the subject of a sociological researchproject commissioned from the University College of .ales,Swansea, by the Welsh Office.     This project will be started inOctober 1967 and will take two years to complete.337*        The valleys will also need substantial improvements to their environment.     The housing effort inthe valley towns will need for some years to be mainlyconcentrated on the replacement of unfit houses.     New housingdevelopment has usually taken place on the periphery of the towns, with little attention to most of the existing built-up area.     In some towns an attempt has been made to redevelopparts of the central commercial areas;   but what is generallyneeded is a comprehensive programme of internal and environmental development in which opportunities would betaken to allow for a better road pattern, to providegaraging and parking facilities, to clear derelict areas, toreplace obsolete street fittings and generally to improve theappearance of the towns:   such programmes will involve the demolition of some properties.     Studies are being made of urban renewal and environmental problems in the Khondda, inthe Aber Valley at Caerphilly, at Pontypridd and atBridgend, and other local authorities are realising theimportance of tackling these problems.
339*        Some &quot;valley mouth&quot; areas offer outstandingpossibilities for major development.     Those which satisfy mostclearly the criteria for growth are the Neath-Swansea-Llanelliarea in the west (where the coastal plain is narrow and it isnot possible to differentiate meaningfully between the coast and valley mouths) and, in the east, the Bridgend, Llan.risant,Caerphilly-Blackwood and Cwmbran-Pontypool areas.     Among these,the Llantrisant area is particularly well placed in relationto the largest concentrations of valley populationsValley Mouths338.       The rehabilitation of the valleys must be accompaniedby substantial new development within   commutingdistance to ensure the most productive use of their labour resources.,industrialThe parts of South Wales most favourable to major/growth are the valleymouths and the coastal belt.   The Government will seek to steer major new industrial development to the valley mouths and to those parts ofthe coastal belt which lie in the Development Area, where it will be close to the valley communities.   In terms of suitability andattractiveness of location for a wide range of industry, there is,east of Bridgend, little to choose between the immediate coastalarea and the northern edge of the coastal plain including the lowerreaches of some of the valleys opening on to it.    The valley mouthsare easily accessible to the coastal towns and ports.    This does not exclude the possibility of some industrial development in the re atof the coastal belt, particularly for certain enterprises which need to be at ports.    But the needs of the area as a whole argue strongly in favour of concentrating most development  during the years immediately ahead at sites in the Development Area.
and equally to Cardiff and the coast. ^ fe fit  has ample land suitable for large-scale industrial projects.The Government have already acquired an industrial site in this area, and started substantial new factory development there.It has been decided that the Royal Mint shall be established atLlantrisant.     The interlocking and inter-dependence of thedifferent parts of Wales and of the activities of its people are well illustrated by the role which could be played by a newcentre of urban growth in this area.     It could house a fairproportion of the future increase of population in South wales and be a focus for appreciable economic growth.     It would attract industry and provide employment opportunities for someof those living in the nearby Rhondda and Taff valleys, thusensuring continued use of the existing social investment therein houses, schools, and other services.     It woulc&apos;. reduce the pressure to develop on the periphery of Cardiff and on the coast.It would encourage those who wish to leave the mining valleysor the rural areas not to leave Wales.     It would provide homes for those working at collieries and factories in  itsneighbourhood, and for some who might work in Cardiff,The Secretary of state has accordingly decided, as an immediate first step, to appoint consultants to advise on the desirable futurescale, timing,layout, cost and organisation of urban growth inthe Llantrisant area and its neighbourhood.Cardiff340.      The City of Cardiff should assume an increasingly important part in the life and economy of South Wales.     its development should be based, not so much on further growth inthe City of general manufacturing industry, as on a majorexpansion of administrative and commercial services, shoppingfacilities, higher education, research activities, entertainment,sports and arts services, which it already provides as a regional centre and the capital city of Wales.     Cardiff is
within two-and-a-quarter hours train journey from London.    Ithas a large but not fully useidock system;   a rapidly developingUniversity College and College of Advanced Technology;   one ofthe finest civic centres in Britain;   and considerablepotential for tourist and other development.     Looking wellahead, the City Council have commissioned, in conjunctionwith the Welsh Office, a development and transportationstudy of the City by Colin Buchanan and Partners.The interim report already published recommends a new
341.       In the west of the area, Swansea has an importantfunction to fulfil,as a shopping, office and cultural centre.Moreover the Swansea County Borough Council and neighbouringlocal authorities have a particularly important part to play in providing sites, for the new industries needed to offset thedecline in employment in coal and steel.     Fortunately, Swanseahas outstanding natural and acquired advantages - a fine modernport, a rapidly expanding University College with excellentscientific and technological facilities, a newly re-builtshopping centre and, near at hand, the beautiful countryside andbeaches of the Gower peninsula.     The improvement of the A.48trunk road and of the Heads of the Valleys road have brought thetown much closerin travelling time to the Severn Bridge and theMidlands and will facilitate a faster rate of economic growth.There is ample land for industrial expansion and foreseeablehousing and other needs.      Much redevelopment is stillrequired around the town centre, particularly towards the dock area, which will call for a high standard of planning and civicdesign and a detailed study of the complex traffic problems inthe town.    Another problem is the widespread dereliction atLandore.     This locality has been the subject of the detailedtechnical study described in paragraph 271 which suggests ascheme of remedial treatment and rehabilitation.     The localauthority are  examining this scheme and the redevelopmentprospects of the foreshore following the closure of the railwayalong the sea front, and the Government attach great importance*0 this being followed by early action.&apos; -181-primary highway network and a northerly expansion of the centralcommercial and administrative areas of Cardiff, and containsproposals for the future use of land in the centre of the Cityto accommodate modern shopping, office, cultural and other facilities, with proper regard to the needs and convenience oftraffic and pedestrians.     The City Council have accepted inprinciple the recommendations in the report, and in theirimplementation they will have the   full support of the Secretaryof State.Swansea
Kewport342**     Newport, on the eastern side of the area, is well placed for further development.   The construction of the severn Bridge and 1,4 and the proposed road to link with theRoss Spur will appreciably increase its locations! advantages.This industrial town has a rapidly growing port with ample land and considerable potential for further expansion.   Work is inprogress on a  2% million scheme to provide two modern berthsfor handling timber imports and, possibly, container ships, thefirst phase of which is due for completion by September 1967.Further facilities can be provided fairly cheaply and, withvastly improved road communications with the Midlands, tradethrough the port is expected to grow substantially.   The town&apos;s functions as a centre for administration and shopping are alsoincreasing in importance.   Looking ahead, Severnside is thesubject of a feasibility study by the Government, in the lightof the expected population increase of Great Britain, toexamine its potential as an area for accommodatinga large addition of population:   the future of much ofMonmouthshire may be deeply affeoted by its results.Roads343.    A programme of improved inter-urban roads is vital to the balanced development of South Wales.   There appears tobe a strong case for  a new road westwards from the presenttermination of the M.4 Motorway, just west of Newport.     Inthe light of the proposals for major growth along theLlantrisant-Bridgend axis, it may prove advantageous to constructthis extension across the Vale of Glamorgan, coupled withrelatively modest improvement of the parallel stretch of A.48.Major improvements will be required to the A.48 westwards fromBridgend to Carmarthen,   the completion of the Port TalbotBy-pass has been an important step forward and plans are in
hand to start a Morriston By-pass in 1968-69.   In order to     &quot;enhance the prospects of growth in the Swansea and Llanelliareas and in towns along the route, the Heads of the Valleysroad needs to be further improved westwards to join the A*48near Neath, and eastwards to Raglan whence it would be linked with the Ross Spur Motorway M.50.   The Glyn-Neath By-pass anda new road between Aberdulais and Llandarcy by-passing Neathhave been included in the road programme for 1969-71.Besides these improvements to the main east-west routes,; the welsh office      have given priority to raising the standard of theCardiff -Merthyr trunk road A.470.   Good roads are also needed in the valleys themselves and arrangements are being made forland use/transport studies of the whole network of roads inthese areas.Amenities344*      Over the whole of South Wales, as has been indicated in earlier Chapters, there is a considerableenvironmental problem, ranging from the preservation of amenitiesto the renewal and improvement of the urban fabric andof water and sewerage systems.   The coastline must be protectedfrom further spoliation and better facilities for access tothe seaside and its enjoyment need to be developed.   Industrialdereliction, which is widespread, needs to be tackled .vigorously, both in the mining valleys and in areas likeLandore.   There is much that can be done to restore to the partsof South Wales affected the attractive environment which existed before the less admirable results of nineteenth centuryindustrialism took their toll.conclusion&quot; i&apos;-345*      The population of the area may be expected torise from 1,834,900 in 1966 to at least 2,024,000 over thenext fifteen years.  With a determined drive to raiseenvironmental standards;   with the plannedimprovements in communications;   with the aid togrowth which will come from the inclusion of most of SouthWales in the Development Area;   with its many advantages both
as a base for work and recreation and as a location for new development, South Wales as a whole has sound prospects for economic growth.   It has a good strategic position in the United Kingdom,lying on a major estuary and close to the Midlands and southern england.   The Severn Bridge and other major road works are greatly improving its accessibility and it is clear that the potential of its port facilities and adaptable labour supply,which in the past have often been under-used, should now be more fully developed to the benefit of the United Kingdom.
CHAPTER XTINDUSTRIAL NORTH-EAST WALES346,    This small part of Wales - covering only 4 per cent of the total land area, but with 8 per cent of the population- calls for separate consideration because of its distinctiveindustrial character and growth prospects.   It covers theWrexham area and the Deeside coastal strip and extends on thewest to the Clwydian range of hills.   It includes the north wales coalfield and has important steel and textile plants.There is an even greater emphasis on manufacturing industry(about 50 per cent of the employee population, compared with about 10 per cent in extractive industry) than in South Wales.Much of the manufacture, particularly of steel, textiles,chemicals and aircraft, is carried out in large plants, and thereis some concern lest a reduction of employment in any of them should occur.   The economy of the area is, however, generallyitstrongj/is increasingly affected by the close proximity ofMerseyside and Chester? and its long-term problems are more likely to be those of expansion than of decline.   The largesttown is Wrexham, with nearly 37,000 inhabitants, and the adjoining Wrexham Rural District has nearly 63,000.   Thepopulation of the whole area increased by nearly 14,000 to 215,000in the period 1951 to 1966 and this upward trend is expected to accelerate.347*    The economy of the area has been affected by thedecline of employment in coal mining, and some reduction of manpower is probable in an increasingly automated steel industry,but overall employment trends are favourable.   In recent years,there has been a growth in the employee population, from 71s000in 1959 to 76,000 in 1966 and, compared with other parts of wales, unemployment in North-East Wales is low.   The main problems have arisen in the Wrexham district, but this has been
included in the Welsh Development Area and the prospect of new industrial development is encouraging.     There is ample land in north-East Wales suitable for further industrial development.  2*348.       To establish the economy of the area on a firmlong-term basis, the main need is to improve its accessibilityby road.     Although heavy flows of traffic in the area are largely seasonal, accessibility here and farther west depends on the ability of industrial and tourist traffic to proceedthroughout the year along the main routes without excessivedelay.     The Dee estuary forms a considerable barrier tocommunications with Merseyside.     The main point of access isthe Queesnferry Bridge, and although this was opened only fouryears ago, the amount of traffic using it is already nearingits designed capacity.     The construction of a further crossingof the Dee at a lower point has been proposed by the localauthorities.     The Government have undertaken to meet a largeshare of the costs of a feasibility study of this project which,in addition to shortening communications, could bring otherconsiderable advantages to the area.     A first stage report onthis study by consultants has already been submitted to the welsh Office.     Adequate links with the national motorwaysystem are also needed, and the  Welsh Office propose to improve the road from Queensferry to the M.6; near Warrington to nearmotorway standard.     Within the area, substantial improvements have been carried out on the A.55 trunk road which will bereconstructed to a dual-carriageway road.     Other important industrial arteries are the A.483 (Jjanchester/Swansea trunk road),which serves the Wrexham area and passes through much urban development, and the A.5 (London/llolyhead) road.     The former is seriously overloaded!   the construction of a  2 million by-passof Wrexham is expected to start in 1970 and other improvementsare planned.349* Communications by rail and air are also important to North-East Wales.     The Government have decided that tv/omain railway lines serving the area - from Shrewsbury toChester via Wrexham and from Chester to Holyhead - willcontinue as part of
the basic railway network;   and the closure of some of thesmaller and more uneconomic stations in the area has made it possible to increase the speed and efficiency of main lineservices.   Facilities for air travel have also improved.   Intheir first four years of operation, services between the airfield at Hawarden and other United Kingdom centres havereceived encouraging support and show good prospects of becoming firmly established.350.    The improvement of communications, coupled withgrowing pressure from Herseyside, will give rise to urbangrowth requiring careful planning control.   On current trendsthe population of the area could rise by at least 35,000 to250,000 or more in fifteen years.   This could be accommodatedwithout encroaching on good quality agricultural land:   thereis no shortage of land for housing and a modest expansion ofexisting towns, with some emphasis on the growth of Wrexham,should meet the need for new and replacement houses.   A sharperincrease in population could occur, particularly if a newcrossing of the Dee is put in hand, as the travelling distancebetween Herseyside and North Wales would then be reduced byabout 16 miles, and North-Bast Wales, as well as the whole of north Wales, would attract population from Merseyside&quot;Much research relating to the planning of North-EastWales is currently being undertaken with Government support.A regional land use/transportation study is being made forMerseyside and North-West Cheshire, and a similar but smaller-scale study is being carried out in the Wrexham area.351,    Much can be done to improve the amenities of north-East Wales.   The town centres contain outworn property and are congested with traffic.    There will be opportunities to improve access and segregate traffic and pedestrians, aspart of the process of slum clearance and urban renewal.
plans for the redevelopment of Wrexham and some of the Flintshiretowns are available or are being prepared, and the Welsh office will continue to encourage local authorities to use their powers to secure comprehensive redevelopment so far as resourcesallow.   The natural attractions of the area - the Clwydian Hills,the Vale of Llangollen and the countryside generally - are ofa high order, and their protection will call for continuedvigilance.   Past industrial development, particularly theworking of coal and other minerals, has left some derelictionand a vigorous effort to clear and re-use or landscape derelictsites is necessary here as in South Wales.352&apos;.      The general economic outlook for Korth-Easb Walesisgood.The Government will aim to ensure the full use of the labourand other resources available in the area. In the longer run, the main need will be for the orderly regulationof the new growth which may be expected and for the improvementof the environment.
CHAPTER XVICENTRAL WALES353*       Central Wales, consisting of the county ofBrecknock north of the Beacons, Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire,has a high proportion of hill land and a very sparse population:these two factors are clearly connected.   About 80 per cent of the area is above the 600 ft. contour, and 50 per cent above,000 ft.   Much of the soil is poor or difficult to work and,with changes in agricultural conditions, the number of peopleengaged in agriculture has steadily declined to what is now acomparatively small figure.   Although, therefore&quot;, the areacomprises nearly a quarter of the land surface of wales, it contains only 3 per cent of the population.   Extractiveindustries (principally agriculture and forestry) still provide15 per cent of the employment, service and construction industries 73 per cent, and manufacturing only 12 per cent:this employment structure shows the under-development of the economy of the area.354,      Yet, Central Wales is not remote from areas of intensive development:   it is almost as close to the heavyconcentrations of industry and population in South Wales andthe Midlands as is the south coast of England to London; andthis reasonable proximity might be expected to conferimportant advantages on the area for the development of bothindustry and tourism.   It has ample space for growth, comparedwith the very congested areas not far away, and greatpotentialities as an area for outdoor recreation.   These andthe other assets of Central Wales have not been fully developed,and what has been done has not been sufficient to stemdepopulation.Decline of Population355*       The drift of people from the area has continued,more or less unchecked, for very many years, and the causes of
this migration are complex.   Agriculture has required lessmanpower because of improved productivity and changes infarming methods, and other traditional industries and crafts,like the local woollen industry, have sharply declined orvanished altogether.   New forms of employment have notdeveloped on a sufficient scale in the area to replace thelost employment opportunities.   So people have gone elsewhere,primarily in search of jobs or a better choice of jobs.   Limitedservice facilities and the attraction of bright lights have played their part in a process which has eroded the populationof Central Y/ales, and other Welsh rural areas, and which still continues.   The population of the area dropped from 90,000in 1951 to 85,000 in 1962 and has since remained at that level.356.       This decline of population, though experienced tosome degree by parts of England, has affected a much largercontinuous area in Y/ales and has created problems which are more intense.   The heavy outward migration of young adults,especially marked in Central Wales in recent years, hasunbalanced the age structure of the population, and has left alarger proportion of people aged 65   or over (about 13*per cent compared with 11.9 per cent in England and Wales as awhole).   The sparsity of population, coupled with the relativeshortage of younger adults, has made it difficult for new industry to develop on any substantial scale.   As a resultincome levels have remained low.Services357,      Even more serious, since it strikes at the rootsof the economic and social life of the area, is the increasingdifficulty of providing or maintaining public and other services.Either they are not viable, since they depend on too small a population for support, or they are too far away to meetpeople&apos;s needs or convenience.   Schools are liable to be closed,
so that children are obliged to travel long distances, or,especially in the case of further education, it is grosslyuneconomic to establish them in the area at all.   similar difficulties affect the health services.   Transport, electricity,gas, water and drainage facilities are difficult to provide and maintain without heavy subsidies.   About four-fifths of the costof local authority services has to be met from the Exchequer,..Urban centres are small and have limited service and entertainmentfacilities.   Welshpool, the largest town in Central Wales, hasa population of only 6,500.   As population continues to decline,the viability of services of all kinds is further undermined.If this process were allowed to continue, a large part of Wales,far from contributing a due share to national prosperity, wouldbecome an increasing burden on the rest of the country.   these problems are shared by other rural areas of Wales.Agriculture, Forestry and the Holiday Industry358&apos;      The objective must be to reverse the decline of population, which has already gone too farj but this will notbe achieved simply through the support and development of theexisting rural industries.   The measures which the Governmentare taking to assist agriculture, and which are described inparagraphs 110-113, will be of special importance to CentralWales, particularly in the encouragement they give to theestablishment of larger farms and the greater productivity oflabourJ although this implies a reduction, rather than anincrease, in the numbers of people getting a living from agriculture.   The further development of public and privatecontinue toforestry will also/be supported by G-overnment investment:in the long run this should result, both directly and indirectly,in increased employment and help particularly the remoter partsof Central Wales, although not on a scale sufficient to meet thelarger problem of the area.
359*     In addition to investing in agriculture and forestry, the Government will seek to establish them on a stronger and more integrated basis through setting up a rural development Board in Mid-Wales.     The activities of the Board,in encouraging a more rational use of land, an increasein thenumber of larger farms and co-ordination of the requirementsof agriculture and forestry, should do much to help the prosperity of people in the area.360.       A further contribution should come from the development of holiday and recreation facilities.     The area has fine and varied naturalbeauty, including most of the Brecon Beacons National Park and much of the proposed new National Park.     It already offers a wide range of outdoor recreation, including touring, walking,pony-trekking and fishing.     These facilities are as yetinsufficiently known and used.     There are further possibilities in the development for recreational, as well as other, purposesof the abundant water resources of the area;   and the Governmentare determined that this great asset shall be used with carefulconcern for the people whose lives and livelihood may be directly affected and in ways that will bring benefit to thearea.     There are outstanding prospects that Central Wales couldbecome part of a major new recreation area if its naturaladvantages were fully utilised.     The efforts of the WalesTourist Board described in paragraphs 140-143 will be supplemented by what the proposed new Countryside Commission referred to inparagraph  265can do to/encourage enjoyment of the area byvisitors.     This will bring welcome aid to its economy, but is unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in employment opportunities, which would be largely confined to the holidayseason.
Manufacturing industry361. A main source of new employment in the area mustbe in new manufacturing industries; and experience so far inattracting new industry, if mostly on a small scale,has been encouraging.     In the wider areaof the five counties served by the Mid-Wales Industrial development association, thirty industrial enterprises have been set up since1957 and aeleven   of these have had subsequent extensions.women.They at present employ approximately 650    men and 850Fifteen    of them are in premises built with Government funds,four  as advance factories.   The Government have authorised theconstruction of further advance factories in Central Wales   atBuilth Wells, Llandrindod Wells and Rhayader;   and elsewhere inthe Mid-Wales area   at Corwenand Dolgellau.     In 1965 they announced their aim of doubling,from 100 to 200 jobs a year, the rate of additional factoryemployment to be provided in Mid-Wales.   It has been demonstrated that light manufacturing industry can flourish in the small countrytowns and its establishment there will receive  furtherencouragement from the inclusion of the whole of Mid-Wales in the welsh Development Area.The Towns362.       The Government believe that, alongside the encouragement of manufacturing industry, efforts must be directed at strengthening the towns in the area.   There are two seriousobstacles to the growth of manufacturing or labour-intensiveservice industry on any considerable scale.   The first is the lackof adequate reserves of labour in the area:   unemployment isgenerally low and, while there may be some unused resources,particularly of female workers, these are small and thinlydispersed.   Secondly, the existing towns lack sufficientservices to attract new industry.   The solution must lie in building up simultaneously both m:w industry andthe population and the
A New Town in Mid-Wales, a report to the Secretary of Statefor Wales by Economic Associates, Ltd., published by H.M.S.0.general viability of one or jpore urban centres in the area.363.      If this can be done, it would bring advantages to mid-WaleB and to Britain.     The creation of a stronger urbanstructure would ensure the maintenance of essential services to agriculture and other existing industries.     It could also,by providing alternative employment opportunities in the area,assist towards securing a quicker and easier transition to amore economic system of agriculture, with larger farms and increased mechanisation and productivity.     There would bebetter services for holiday visitors.     Dependence on theExchequer would be gradually reduced and Mid-Wales would contribute more to national production.364.        It was for these reasons that in V-jG^ a firm ofconsultants (Economic Associates Ltd.) was appointed toadvise on the possibility, through the machinery of theNew Towns Act, of establishing an economically viable urbancentre in Mid-Wales, which, by making available new opportunities for employment, and by offering suitableservices and facilities, would arrest and possibly reverse thedepopulation and strengthen the area&apos;s economy.     In theirreport,        published in July 1966, the&apos;*consultants advised that a town of some 70,000 people, centred upon Caersws inMontgomerysliire and based partly on manufacturing and partly on recreational services, could become viable, if the rightsort of conditions were created to enable it to do so.     they recommended that the town should have its main centre atCaersws and should embrace Newtown, Llanidloes and Trefeglwys;that it should be built up to its target population over aperiod of about twenty years   that one of its specific
functions should be to act as a gateway to a proposed National Park inthe Plynlimmon area immediately to the west of the town;   and that thereshould also be a series of developments in some of the smaller towns ofKid-Wales outside the area of the new tov/n.365.    The Government consulted the Yfelsh Economic Council, theWest Midlands Economic Council and the local authorities and other organisations most directly concerned, about these proposals.     Amajority, but not all, of those consulted were in favour of theproposed new town, while there was unanimous agreement about the need to build up the existing towns.     The early achievement of both the objectives would, however, involve a heavy call on resources.    Moreover,the success of a new town of 70*000 in Mid-Wales would turn on the ability to provide all the jobs required by its residents.     Y/ith the new industry needed for a commensurate growth of existing towns, not far short of 2,000 new jobs a year would be needed in Mid-Wales to ensureachievement of both objectives and the Government are not convinced atthis stage that industry on this scale would be forthcoming.     Toattempt to do too much would be to run a real risk that neither the newtorn nor the expansion of existing towns would be successful.     the contribution which a substantial urban development could make in strengthening the area was not, however, in doubt and it was also clearthat such a development would be best carried out pander the machinery ofthe New Towns Act.     The Secretary of State, therefore, announced inMarch I967 his intention to set up a Mid-Wales Development corporation under the terms of that Act and to give it as its first task theexpansion of Newt own, which. the consultants had recommended as part oftheir total Caersws project.     The doubling of the population ofNevrtown, which is at present 5*500, will involve a total expenditureof some  11 million and it is expected that the work will be done over7-10 years, involving a rate of expenditure rising to some  2 million a year.    The decision whether to proceed further with the full CaerswsProject will be taken later in the light of the experience gained byCorporation on this first phase of the project.
366.        No less importance attaches to the expansion ofother towns in rural Wales by the provision both of places of workand of homes.   Industrial development will be assisted bythe Development Area status now accorded to rural Wales.   Toenable them to assess      the problems of providing the extrahousing and other facilities needed, the  Welsh Office, through theDevelopment Commission and the Mid-Wales Industrial development association,   financed a recently published study by consultantsof the problems of doubling the size of Rhayader.   Studies havealso been put in hand of other towns in the area.   The expansionof these towns would  normally be for the local authorities toundertake, with the support of the Development Commission onfactory building in appropriate cases;   but consideration will-begiven later in the light of experience to the employment of thenew Mid-Wales Development Corporation in towns other than Newtown.Roads367*     The Welsh Office   will improve, as quickly as resourcesallow, the trunk roads of Central Wales, and intend to develop the road system to the maximum extent justified by the foreseeablelevel of traffic, allowing for the effects of rail closures, thegrowth of the manufacturing and tourist industries and the urbangrowth which the area may expect.   As indicated in paragraph.55   , priority is to be given to the improvement of theAberystwyth - Shrewsbury road and the Brecon - Llangurig road.Conclusion36&amp;\.       In these various ways - through support for an efficient system of agriculture&apos;, the development of forestry, of tourism   and of water resources to give the maximum benefit to the area itself;   the expansion of manufacturing and
sersrio8Industries;   the improvement of communications;   and inparticular the &quot;building up of a number of the existing townships,with the ultimate possibility of creating a major urban centre at Caersws - Central Wales and  other parts of rural Wales can see hope of the end of the long process of depopulation.
CHAPTER XVTINORTH-WEST,WALES369,    North -West Wales covers the counties of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Merioneth, most ofDenbighshire and a small part of Flintshire.   It includes the towns of Colwyn Bay, Rhyl, Llandudno, Bangor, Conway, Holyhead,Abergele and Caernarvon^ contains the most popularholiday localities in VJalesj and each year attracts hundreds ofpart of the areathousands of visitors.   Yet, until fairly recent times, the larger/tended to be regarded by industrialists as too remote for development.   As a result, it has some of the characteristicproblems of holiday areas: an unduly large proportion of serviceindustry (in which some 78 per cent of the employee population are engaged, compared with 7 per cent in extractive industry and lesBthan   15 per cent in manufacturing industry)   and. seasonalfluctviations in unemployment.       Much ofthe country is mountainous and spars.ely inhabited.   Although North-West Wales covers just over a quarter of the land area of Wales,it contains only about one-eighth of the population.   There hasbeen an upward trend of population in recent years in the area as a whole, and in 1966 this had reached almost 340,000.   Most ofthis growth occurred in Anglesey and along the coast of the mainland; and the employee population has risen fairly sharplyfrom 87,000 to 100,000 in the period 1952-1965.   This is an indication of gathering strength, but further development is needed to establish the economy of the area on a sound footing.The Holiday Industry.  370* Tourism,  already very strong, has good prospects for further growth. The natural attractions of North-west wales are becoming still more widely known and appreciated.   The
mainland is dominated by the mountain mass of Snowdonia,. which forms the nucleus of a National Park extending over almost half ofthe entire area.   There are attractive estuaries and river valleysand an extensive and varied coastline.   Anglesey, separated fromthe mainland by the beautiful Menai Straits, has excellent touristcentres and beaches.   Few holiday regions combine within soconvenient a radius such a variety of recreational opportunities -fine beaches and rugged scenery, major coastal resorts and smallerholiday centres, pleasant market towns and fishing villages, anumber of well preserved mediaeval castles, and good facilitiesfor yachtsmen,   fishermen, golfers and mountaineers.   The area isconvenient for the large concentrations of population in theMidlands and North of England and its people are alive to the opportunities which this proximity presents.   The Wales TouristBoard and the new Countryside Commission will aim to developfurther and make more accessible the holiday attractions of thearea.   To assist in its conservation, much of the largelyunspoiled coastline of Anglesey/has beery7scheduled as an Area of outstanding Natural Beauty.371*      A great deal has already been done by localauthorities and interests to build up tourism and tomeet the increasing demands of visitors; and an alert attentionto those demands, coupled with determination to preserve thenatural attractions, will be required.   Carefully sited carparks and lay-bys are needed at vantage-points.   Standards ofcatering and accommodation must be improved.   Efforts must bemade to provide for the needs of growing numbers of caravannersand campers at carefully located and controlled sites which willnot repeat the errors of the past along the coast.   These are matters which the local authorities and the local touristassociations will no doubt keep well in mind.   The   Welsh office will give all possible help and advice in measures aimed atmaking the most of the area&apos;s holiday potential.
Traditional Industries372.        Unlike the holiday industry, other long-establishedlocal industries offer decreasing opportunities for employment;and this is associated with a loss of population in the inlandparts of the area.     In the extractive group of industriesemployment has fallen by about 30 per cent since 1959*     Thismainly reflects the declining -number of workers in farming andquarrying.     Agriculture will continue to be important throughoutthe &quot;area; but, as in other parts of V/ales, increasing productivity and the trend towards larger farms will mean the employment of a smaller labour force.       The slate industry now provides work for only a small proportion of the area&apos;s labour force, less thanone-tenth of the numbers employed at the beginning of the century.The continuing demand for replacement slates, hew uses for slateslab and measures of modernisation may however enable the slateindustry to stabilise itself.     The run-down of labour in thesetraditional occupations has been gradual, but new industry hasnot developed at a sufficient rate to absorb all the workersreleased, and the problem is intensified by the need to replace the substantial amount of temporary employment provided in recentyears by the major civil engineering works at Tanygrisiau,Tryweryn, Trawsfynydd and Wylfa.Hew Manufacturing Industry373.        The area must look to the growth of manufacturing industry in suitable places as the main means of strengtheningits economy.     Recent experience has been encouraging,,     A numberof substantial factories has been established in Horth-V/est &quot;Vales,with products ranging from motor vehicle components, washingmachines, electric meters, brake linings and waterproof clothing,to P.V.C. leather cloth, telecommunications and electronicscomponents, diamond tools, optical glass, chemicals and gramophoneneedles.     Ten Government advance factories have been allocated
to the area since 1959&apos;     ^s a result of new development and thegrowth of the holiday industry, the underlying trend of employment has been favourable.     More manufacturing industry is howeverneeded.374.   Most of North-West Wales has been included in the WelshDevelopment Area and, besides the financial inducements whichthis makes available,    . offers other considerable advantages for industrial development.     Among these are ample land for industrial use, substantial sources of power, abundant suppliesof water and the port of Holyhead, with its anchorage of potentialfuture importance.     The University College of Bangor has a notable School of Engineering Science and other facilities whichpresent valuable opportunities for collaboration with industry.Main towns throughout the area offer excellent amenities and living conditions, often In a fine historic or scenic setting.There has been particular emphasis in Anglesey on the developmentof facilities for the arts, and this is now spreading throughoutthe area.     All these advantages are becoming increasinglyappreciated by industry.Policies for Rural Areas.375&apos;      Particular efforts will be needed to counteract thedecline of population and employment In&quot;the inland and rural districts.     The Government&apos;s policies for rural Wales ofbuilding up country towns, encouraging small manufacturing industryin them, and supporting forestry and tourism   will apply to the depopulating areas of Worth-west wales.     In so far as any further shift of population   occurs,it will be aimed to absorb this as far as possible within thelforoh-West Wales area.    Most industrial development is likely to be inthe more accessible districts in the Development Area along thecoast of the mainland and in Anglesey, where the main reserves oflabour exist.     There is already a considerable amount of dailytravel to work in the area, and this practice may increase in the short term and help to widen employment opportunities for bothcoastal and inland communities,-201-
Communications376.       Economic growth in North-West Wales will require animprovement of road communications.   Largely because of the difficult terrain, the main access and internal routes arenarrow or winding for much of their length:   they pass throughmany built-up areas and, particularly in summer, are oftencongested by mixed industrial and tourist traffic.   A numberof by-passes and other schemes have already been carried outalong the A.55 coast road, with the ultimate intention ofproviding dual carriageways throughout.   A detailed trafficstudy of the Colwyn Bay and Conway district is being made withthe assistance of the Welsh Office to establish whatimpiwemenisarenecessary in this congested urban area.   The A,5 road will alsobe improved, but priority will be given to the A. 55.377. The main railway   line from Chester toHolyhead will form part of the basic national network, on whichfuture investment and improvement will be concentrated.   Thepopulation is hardly sufficient to support a commercial airport;but to meet the needs of businessmen with executive aircraft, theR.A.P. airfield at Valley in Anglesey is available with the prior permission of the station commander.Land Use378.      With the increasing popularity of North-West Wales,problems which arise from conflicting demands on land arelikely to become more acute.   In Snowdonia the claims ofagriculture and forestry are already challenged by the ever-increasing needs of holiday-makers, and a study of this problem is to be made by a team from Bangor University College with government support through the National ParksCommission.   In all parts of the area there is pressure to accommodate a vastlyincreased number of motor-cars in the holiday season, which willcall for the adoption of more comprehensive traffic mar%ementmeasures.
Conclusion37go     The population is likely to increase from 340,000in 1966 to about 360,000 over the next fifteen years, partly as a result of increased immigration of retired persons.This growth will, for the most part, be accommodated in the coastal areas of the mainland0     While, in a few places, theproximity of mountains to the coast limits the possibilitiesof urban expansion, there is ample suitable land for thedevelopment of most coastal towns.     There are no large-scaleproblems of urban renewal, but where they occur theopportunity should be taken to improve the capacity of the towns to absorb without discomfort the summer influx of car sand visitors.     Care will be needed, however, to ensure the conservation of historic towns, such as Bangor, Beauuaris,Caernarvon and Conway.380.   The Government&apos;s policy for North-West Wales will aim to counteract the unemployment problem by introducing new industry;   to increase accessibility by improvingcommunications!   and to encourage the adoption of measuresto meet the growing recreational needs of larger numbers of people, while protecting the natural amenities of the area and the interests of agriculture and forestry.
CHAPTER XVIII&quot; 1 &apos;WEST WALES381,    West Wales contains the counties of Cardigan andPembroke and the rural and larger part of Carmarthenshire.   Inmany respects it bears a strong resemblance to the otherpredominantly rural areas of Wales.   Over much of the area thepopulation is thinly spread and declining;   and, although it covers nearly a quarter of the land area of Wales, it has only8 per cent of the inhabitants.   About 83 per cent of the employee population are engaged in the service and construction industries, as compared with 9 per cent in extractiveindustries and only 8 per cent in manufacturing.     Employment inagriculture and some other traditional industries has shown a steady and continuing decline.382,     The area contains, however, some importantdistinguishing features.   In the south, around Milford Haven,there has been the remarkable post-war development of the oilrefining industry described in paragraph 152.   West hales also contains pockets of urban development of a kind not generallyfound in other Welsh rural areas, including the relativelysubstantial urban districts of Milford Haven and Pembroke,each with a population of over 13,000, the University and localadministrative centre of Aberystwyth (with a total populationof over 21,000 in the borough and rural district) and themarket towns of Carmarthen (12,800) and Haverfordwest (9,000),The relative strength and growth of these and other centreshave helped to counterbalance the migration of people fromthe rural districts.     In West Wales as a whole the population has shown a small increase over the last fifteen years from
&apos;     246about 225,000 in 1951 to 228,000 in I966.     Most of the growthhas&apos;taken place in Pembrokeshire, largely owing to thedevelopment of the holiday and other industries and to theexecution of a series of major constructional works.Traditional Industries383.        The decline of employment in traditional industries,however, has been continuous over a number of years.     Since1951 the number of full-time farm workers has fallen by morethan 40 per cent as the efficiency of agriculture has increased.The most serious problem of unemployment exists in SouthPembrokeshire, where the activities of the long-establishedship-repairing and fishing industries have considerably declined.Unemployment rates here have frequently been among the highestin the United Kingdom.     While the situation has been eased fromtime to time by the engagement of large numbers on theconstruction of refineries and other major works around theKaven, the permanent employment provided on completion ofthe new installations has been relatively small.     As a result,the loss of jobs from traditional industries has not beenbalanced by new developments:   it is clear that further efforts are needed to strengthen the economy and provide new employmentin both the rural parts of West Wales and the industrial beltin South Pembrokeshire.Hew Industry384.      Around the Haven the outlook is gradually butdistinctly improving.     With the aid of the inducementsavailable under the Local Employment and Industrial DevelopmentActs, some small light industries have been introduced to thearea with encouraging success, notably at the ThorntonIndustrial Estate laid out by Milford Haven Urban DistrictCouncil.     Advance factories   at Pembroke Dock and Milford Havenare in operationi and the one- at Pembroke Dock, engaged in light
&apos;     2 47engineering, already nearly doubled from its initial size,is being more than doubled again.     A third advance factory,also at Milford Haven, has yet to come into use.385. The major prospects, however, are centred on thegrowth of the oil industry and ancillary developments.     A thirdrefinery, and with it the area!s first petro-chemical works,and a large electricity generating station using oil as fuelare now being built.     These developments promise some improvementin the prospects for permanent er.iployr.ient.     Despite the trend to still larger oil tankers of up to 300,000 tons, andeven 500,000 tons, and a greater flexibility in the choice of sites for refineries and terminals by the extended use ofpipe-lines from ship to shore, Llilford Haven lias considerablepotential for further development by the oil industry, andpossibly by other industries using materials imported in bulk.386. Elsewhere in West Wales, action will be directed to strengthening the urban structure and providing additional employment opportunities, \. .   !The wholeof the area is included in the Welsh Development Area.     an encouraging start has already been made in introducing lightmanufacturing industry to Cardiganshire through the efforts of the Mid-Wales Industrial Development Association and with government help.     One advance factory has been built atAberystwythj   another, announced in September 1365? found a tenant even before the land was aca.uired.     Aberyst\7yth is alsobenefiting from the rapid and still continuing development ofthe University College -bhere and from its use as an administrative centre by * the Government and local authorities.Like Carmarthen, Haverfordwest and other relativelysubstantial towns in West Walc*s, it serves as a focal pointof growth throxigh which the economy of the surrounding ruralarea is, and can be further, strengthened.
The Holiday Industry387.       A significant contribution to the area&apos;economy can come from the continued development pf   tourism aWest Wales has a long and beautiful coastline,extending for some 175 miles, of which 110 miles are withinthe coastal National Park of Pembrokeshire, the only one ofits kind in Britain.     Another large part of the area isproposed for inclusion in a new National Park.     Apart fromestablished resorts like Tenby and Aberystwyth, there are many seaside villages and other centres with good facilitiesfor sailing and fishing.     This has been popular holidaycountry for many years and is growing steadily in favour:   itis likely to become still more attractive with, the improvement.in accessibility brought about by the opening of the severn bridge and by other road improvements in eastern South Wales.This may well call, however, for increased hotel and other accommodation;   and, in respect of developments which giverise to additional employment, application can be made for development Area grants and loans.388.       Local authorities face the problems of safeguarding the amenities of the area.     It will be essential for themto control effectively and sensitively^the encroachment ofcaravan sites and other development;   so far as possible to remedy the defects of unfortunate development in the past;and to adopt traffic management measures adequate to cope with the increase in the number of holiday visitors.     The  welsh office       have organised a series of conferences throughthe National Parks Commission to work out planning policies for the coastal areas.     Special studies of coastaldevelopment problems, such as that recently completed atFreshwater East, are particularly useful.
Communications 2 4 fl389.     Here as elsewhere it is necessary to improve theroads.     Minor improvements have been made in many places, and major schemes are being carried out at Carmarthen, the gatewayto Yfest Wales.     Looking ahead, the A.48 as far as Carmarthenand the A.40 from Carmarthen to St. Clears will be Improved todual carriageway standards.    Loan sanction will be given forthe Pembrokeshire County Council&apos;s proposal for a high-leveltoll bridge between Neyland and Pembroke Dock which will linkmore closely the communities on the two sides of the Haven.     Thearea will also benefit from the priority referred to in paragraph55   for the improvement of the Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth road and sections of the Haverfordwest-Bangor road.     As regards raillinks, the Government have decided that the main lines fromCardiff to Pishguard and Milford Haven and from Shrewsbury toAberystwyth will be retained as part of the basic railway network.Conclusion390.     The population of West Wales is expected to remainfairly constant, at about 228,000, over the next fifteen years.There is ample land for housing and other urban development in all parts of the area, but care is required to avoidintrusion on good agricultural land and on the attractive coastalscenery.     All the local housing authorities have problems ofslum clearance and redevelopment in varying degree, but nowhereare they substantial except in Pembroke Borough, where there isstill a high percentage of houses that need to be cleared ormodernised.     Water resources in South Pembrokeshire are limitedat present, but ample supplies for housing and industry willbe ensured for many years to come by a scheme for a regulatingreservoir on the River Cleddau,     Much of the area is wellsuited for agriculture and forestry, the market towns have Utetaskof providing amenities and improved services for these occupations and for tourism, and the shores of Milford Haven may attractfurther large scale sophisticated industry.
PART FIVE - APPRAISAL391*      An essential first step in planning for thedevelopment of Wales is to examine all the main fields of economicand social activity and the different areas of the Principality,in order to establish the nature of the problems that have tobe solved.   The purpose of the White Paper is to do this and,against that background, to review the Government&apos;s present policies for Wales,The Employment Problem392.      The foremost problem is how to make fuller useof the human resources that are available.   During the pastdecade, the overall demand for male labour has been staticand less than the supply.   Despite the substantial progress which has been made in the diversification of the economy9 the principality is still very much dependent upon the traditionalindustries of coal mining and steel;   and, although employment opportunities in new manufacturing industry and in serviceindustries have rapidly increased, those for males have hotquite offset the reduction in opportunities in these twotraditional industries, in agriculture and in  slatequarrying.Consequently, there is relatively high unemployment and a loss of younger people by migration.   Too many of the self-employed men have low incomes.   The number of women inemployment has been increasing rapidly, but the proportionis still low as compared with other parts of Great Britain.It is this inadequate number of employment oppertuinities which accounts for the comparatively low level of per capitaincome and the relatively high dependence of the Welsh economyon assistance from the Exchequer and on the import of capital(Chapter I and Paragraphs 78-91).393*    Any calculation of the scale of the need for
additional jobs is bound to be imprecise, based as it mustbe on factors which cannot be accurately measured and onassumptions which future events may falsify.   In paragraphs 93to 100 there is a calculation, made in March 1967, of theamount of labour likely to be effectively available for employment in 1971, compared with the estimated opportunities for employment in that year.   It was made, on the bestinformation available, in order to provide an indication ofthe order of magnitude of the employment problem in the principality, and thus give a basis for policy.   Thiscalculation suggested, on the basis of policies as theyexisted in March 1967, the prospects then in sight, and the assumptions made, that the supply of and demand for femalelabour might be in balance in 1971 at a higher level than atpresent;   but that there might be an excess of something ofthe order of 15,000 males effectively available for employment overthe employment opportunities for them.   This estimate allowed for the decline in employment in some industries and thegrowth expected in others, for the expected natural increasein population, and for an increase in the numbers in schools and colleges.   It assumed no net migration, with a decliningloss of younger people and an increasing immigration of older ones.394;        Since this calculation was made in March 1967,the Government have already taken a number of decisions,which should serve to improve the position as it was thenforecast.   These decisions, which are referred to below,included those to appoint consultants to study urban growth in theLlantrisant area and its neighbDvirhood,and to establish theRoyal Mint at Llantrisant and the Ministry of Transport motor vehicle licensing and goods vehicles test booking establishmentsat Swansea.   The Government also have under consideration the proposals published for a regional employment premium,which would give a yet further valuable incentive to
manufacturing industry in Development Areas (Paragraphs 171-174)Traditional Industries &quot;        2 5 2395.        Coal industry policy in the last few years has been based upon the concentration of output at colleries which,through heavy capital investment and favourable natural conditions,are able to produce coal at a reasonable cost.     This process of concentration will continue., thus improving the competitiveability of the industry.     With its special coals the industryin Wales has certain advantages and, although its manpower needsare expected to continue to decline, it will remain a majorsource of employment in Wales and contribute substantially tothe economy of the Principality.     (Paragraphs 126-132).396.        Although the steel industry will also need lesslabour, because of its increasing productivity and efficiency,its capacity will continue to expand.     Wales still has manylocational advantages for steel production.     These will be enhanced by the completion of the iron ore terminal at PortTalbot, and there is a proposal for a further iron ore terminalat Newport.     Further major investment in the Welsh steelindustry is proposed.     The major part of the industry is beingtaken into public ownership and the G-overnment are confident thatthis will give new opportunities for raising the industry&apos;sefficiency (Paragraphs 133-138).397&apos;        The rural areas, which are dealt with in ChaptersXVI-XVIII, have been steadily losing population for over a century, at first largely to what was then the boom area ofSouth Wales, and subsequently also to England and overseas.As productivity in agriculture increases, the amount ofemployment available on the land is declining;   a substantial number of younger people have tended to drift away to the attractions and the rewards of the towns;   and the economicand social fabric of the countryside has been weakened.398.        It is often urged that the Government should-m-
deal with the problem of inadequate employment opportunitiesby reducing the rate of their decline in the traditionalindustries.   These industries, particularly agriculture, coal,and the railways, already receive substantial financial andother assistance from the Government,   To give them further assistance in order to enable them to retain their existinglabour force would absorb resources which could be put tofar better use in other ways in Wales,   The sooner allsurplus labour in Wales is employed in profitable undertakings,the better for the Principality as v/ell as for the rest ofGreat Britain,399&apos;        Some reduction in population is inevitable in areas with limited prospects of profitable new economic growth,and it is important to help workers in the ways indicated inparagraphs 190 to 202  to move more freely from industry to industry, and from occupation to occupation within Wales, butthe loss of social capital may be unacceptable if too many people move their homes,   and Wales in general has the potential to justify the development of new industries to offset the decline in the older industries.   In particular, inthe ways described in Chapter  II, it offers notable advantages to new manufacturing industry, in its labour resources, itsimproving access to home and overseas markets, arid itsindustrial sites.   Some of its towns are well suited foraccommodating Government and other offices dispersed fromcongested areas.   Its scenery and accessibility make it oneof the promising parts of Britain for the development of tourism.   The Government&apos;s policies for dealing with theemployment problem in Wales have, therefore, been largelydirected at stimulating further growth of manufacturing industry, office employment, and tourism.New Manufacturing Industry400.        The problem is to secure a sufficiently fast
increase in modern industries by encouraging those already in wales to expand, and both new industrial enterprises and thosein areas of labour shortage elsewhere to move to Wales.   Themain action already taken to this end has been the schedulingin 1966 of the whole country, except parts of the South-Eastand North-East, as a Development Area;   and industrialenterprises expanding or establishing themselves in this area are eligible for the valuable inducements described inparagraphs 154 to 163,.   This action, together with thetight administration by the Government of the system ofindustrial development certificates in areas of labour shortage,has already dramatically increased the amount of new factorydevelopment in Vfales.   Whereas in the five years I960 to 1964new factory floor space approved in Males was at an annual average of 3.0 million square feet, the comparable figure for1965 was 4*5 million square feet, and    in I966 it reached the exceptional level of 9&quot;2 million square feet.     These approvalstake two years or more before they begin to result in a significant increase in employment, but this change in Wales&apos;share of new industrial development must be of inestimable value in strengthening the Welsh economy (Paragraphs I64-I68).Communications401*       One of the keys to the economic development of wales is better access, and the roads are steadily improving.Extensive work on trunk and principal roads is in progress, oris programmed to be undertaken by the early 19708 s, atan estimated cost of  64 million.   This work, which is described in paragraphs  46 to 48   , will increase the lengthsof dual carriageway roads to 120 miles.   A pool of further majorroad schemes is being prepared for implementation in the1970&apos;s, and schemes will be drawn from this pool into the firmprogramme, as they can be undertaken and as resources permit(Paragraphs   50-*56)       .   These schemes will greatly improve the accessibility of Wales in relation to the main centres of population in England, and encourage industrial expansion and
tourism in Wales,255402.The difficulties of the railways in attractingtraffic and the needs of users for better services can best be met by closing down those rail services for which road transport offers a better alternative, and by improving theservices on the rest of the rail system.     The basic rail networkfor development has been announced.     Great improvements in comfort and timing have been achieved on the main line passenger services between London and Worth and South Wales, and a liner train depotis being opened at Cardiff.     But passenger travel by train between north and South V/ales is inconvenient (Paragraphs 57-60).     to ease travelling difficulties in rural areas, the Government have accepted in principle that.help from public funds should beavailable to secure adequate rural bus services.     A passenger transport Co-ordinating Committee has been set up in Wales tosecure improvements in public passenger services by road and rail (Paragraphs 61-62).     There has been a steady increase in air traffic through Welsh airports (Paragraphs 69-7?)*403,        A substantial programme of port development is inhand at South Wales ports and their natural advantages, togetherwith those of Milford Haven, Fishguard and Holyhead, are important assets.     Although the pattern of port development which will be required to service the use of containers and purpose-built container ships is not yet clear, Welsh industry may expect increasingly to benefit from this new form oftransport (Paragraphs 63-68),The Areas of Wales404.        The economic problems of Wales vary greatly intheir nature and intensity as between the different parts of wales, and the policies of the Government for the deployment ofthe resources available in the most advantageous manner to meetthose problems can roost easily be summarised on a geographicalbasis.^Ql^b-East Wales405.        Cardiff, Newport and the part of Monmouthshire
outside the valleys form an area which already possessesa substantial and diversified industrial base, and hasgreat potentialities for further rapid economic growth,,   It wasexcluded from the Wales Development Area created in 1966,because the natural exploitation of its own geographicalstrength can ensure its yet greater prosperity (Paragraph 157).406.    The policies of the G-overnment for this area are mainly directed at improving communications, ports and other services;   at building up offices and similar establishmentsincluding those dispersed from congested areas;    and atensuring that new development is carefully sited and thatoutworn urban areas are redeveloped on attractive lines.   the severn Bridge, the Ross Spur M.50 Motorway,andth3road cf mar motorwaystandard under construction to link this with Newport;   the prospective completion of the M.fj Motorway between bristol and the Midlands and of the M.A Motorway between Newport and london;   fast passenger rail services with London and theintroduction of liner trains, should make the whole area evenmore attractive than at present to new manufacturing industry.   New Government offices on a substantial scale arebeing established in Cardiff and Newport.   The developmentof parts of Cardiff in the light of the Buchanan studies should increase further the attractions of the capital city.   Thegreater part of Monmouthshire will form part of the area tobe covered by a feasibility study of the growth potential of the whole of the Severnside area which has been set on foot (Paragraphs 340 and 342).North-East Wales407*      This area also possesses a sound existingindustrial base, notably in its steel, textile, chemical and aircraft plants;   and it offers advantages for furtherindustrial development because of its proximity to theMidlands and Merseyside.   Except for Wrexham and its vicinity,which has been affected by colliery closures, it wasexcluded from the Wales Development Area in 1966.   The main-215-
need is for an improvement of communications and services,careful planning control of new development, the improvementby clearance of derelict land and the development of some ofthe outworn urban areas and town centres.   A proposal fora barrage across the Dee estuary which would connect the area by road with Merseyside is under examination and a first stagefeasibility study report has already been prepared and isunder review by the Government (Paragraphs 346-352).The Mining Valleys and West South Wales408.     In terms of numbers the inadequacy of employment opportunities is likely to be greatest in the mining valleys andthe Swansea area.   Where suitable sites attractive to industry are available, the Government will encourage the establishment offurther new industries in the valleys themselves, and havealready constructed there a number of advance factories at theexpense of the Government as an attraction to tenants.   But theshortage of sites and the locational short earnings of the valleysgravely limit what can be done in this way.   Reliance must,therefore, 1&amp;I largely placed on establishing new opportunities for employment within reasonable daily travelling distance.   Thiswill enable the existing investment in the valleys in houses,schools and other services to continue to be put to use(Paragraphs 332-338).409&apos;      The Government have under consideration a proposalfor a major new urban development in an area already attractive to industry close to the mouths of the Ehondda and Taff valleys.A trading estate is being set up at Llantrisant and, most significant of all, it is at Llantrisant that the Royal Mintis to be established.   A new urban focus in that area couldhouse a fair  part of the future increase of population inSouth Wales.   It would provide employment opportunities for persons living in the neighbouring valleys, reduce the pressure to develop on the periphery of Cardiff and on the coast,and encourage those who wish to leave the valleys not to leave
Wale So   As an immediate first step, the G-overnment are 2 5 8appointing consultants to advise on the desirable futurescale, timing, layout, cost and organisation of urban growth in the Llantrisant area and its neighbourhood (Paragraph 339)*Relevant in this connection will be the timing and phasing of anew road through Mid-Glamorgan which will be needed from the presentend of the M.4   Motorway at Newport to the Bridgend area, andwhich would also provide an outer by-pass to Cardiff.(Paragraphs 50(e) and 343)*410.     The Government are similarly encouraging the creationof new employment in the Swansea-Llanelli area, which willbe made more attractive to industrialists by the roadimprovements already programmede   As part of the policy ofdispersing offices, a Land Registry will be established at Swansea.   An important decision is that of the Ministryof Transport to set up there the new national motor vehiclelicensing office, computer centre, and goods vehiclestest booking office for all Great Britain (Paragraphs 341*169 and 173).411*     Both in the mining valleys and in the Swanseaarea, vigorous action is in hand to rehabilitate derelictland and improve the environment.   The Government attach importance to early action to clear the derelict area atLandore in the lower Swansea valley (Paragraphs 268-273).Rural Wales412.        Particular encouragement is given through theprice support system to the production of meat, and thisis of special value to Welsh farmers who obtain two-thirds oftneir receipts from livestock products,,   Under the agriculture act 1967, financial assistance will be given for desirableamalgamations of farms, which will reduce the number of uneconomic smallholdings, and other assistance of special value

Under the agriculture act 1967, financial assistance will be given for desirableamalgamations of farms, which will reduce the number of uneconomic smallholdings, and other assistance of special value
to Welsh farmers raising livestock on hill land.   A rural development Board will be set up under the Act in Mid-wales to co-ordinate the development of agriculture and forestry.Encouragement will also be given to the fishing industry andto forestry(Paragraphs 105-125).413,     Tourism in Wales has great potential for furthergrowth, and this is most encouraging for the economy of the rural areas and coastal towns of Wales.   The Governmenthave increased their financial contribution to the WalesTourist Board, through the British Travel Association.It is important that the local authorities and the Welshtourist interests should also increase their support forthe Board and provide improved facilities for tourists.Careful planning control will be needed to ensure that the amenities which attract tourists are not affected by ill-designed or ill-sited development.   New access routes acrossthe Severn Bridge, and possibly later on across the Deeestuary, may present problems and opportunities different in scale from anything so far experienced and a strategy mustbe worked out to meet them (Paragraphs  139-146).414.     A main spur to the economy of the rural areasmust, however, be new small scale manufacturing industry in suitable places, and the incentives available under theIndustrial Development Act 1966 will be used to attract it.A Mid Wales Development Corporation is being set up under theNew Towns Act with, as its immediate task, doubling the size of Newtown.   Studies are also being made of the possibilityof expanding Ehayader and some other towns to provide focalpoints for economic and social development (Paragraphs   361-366).Coastal Towns415.       The coastal towns will benefit from the developmentof tourism and in particular from the improvements planned to theroads which serve them.   They are attracting some newmanufacturing enterprises, and in West Wales the rapidly
growing oil refining industry and the associated productionof petro-chemicals are taking advantage of the deep waterfacilities for large tankers at Milford Haven.Technologi cal^Deye1opment416.        In Wales, as in England, many firms, including some concerned with new advanced products, do little researchthemselves and pay little attention to that done by others.The rapid growth of the scientific work of the Welsh university and Technical Colleges is of major significance and theGovernment will encourage a closer liaison between thesecolleges and industry.   As part of a national network, fiveindustrial liaison centres based on technical colleges havebeen established by the Ministry of Technology, and theMinistry and the National Research Development Corporationprovide financial backing for the development of newprocesses and products.   Management training courses are beingexpanded and improved in Wales (Paragraphs I8I-I89).Industrial^ Traininje;417.        This is of special importance to Wales, wheremany workers need to move into new industries requiring newskills;   where more than three-quarters of the unemployed donot possess skills used in modem industries;   and wherethe proportion of school leavers entering work offering littletraining is much higher than in Britain generally.418,      The bulk of industrial training is for industry itself to carry out;    and, under the provisions of theIndustrial Training Act, the Committee for Wales of theCentral Training Council id helping it to do so.   Eighteenindustrial training boards covering nearly half of all employees in Wales have already been set up, and others will follow;these boards levy contributions on firms and make grants to employers giving approved training.   To help this work, thetechnical colleges are increasing the number of places they offer for apprentices, and the Ministry of Labour have increased their
help for the training of training officers, the cost oftraining, and the installation of training equipment.   TheMinistry have also increased the capacity of their two existing Government Training Centres and are building a third centre at Port Talbot (Paragraphs 190-202).Industrial Sites419&apos;     Good, readily available sites are essential forthe attraction of new industry.   There are plenty of suchsites in Wales, but one of the problems is that they arenot always to be found in, or near to, the localities with an employment problem.   To help with this, a special survey isbeing made by the Welsh Office in consultation with local planning authorities and others concerned.   The results willbe embodied in a register available for the guidance ofindustrialists (Paragraphs  175-178).Water420.     Water is one of the main resources of Wales, andits control and conservation are needed to satisfy growingrequirements in Wales itself and in neighbouring areas;   to attract further industrial development to Wales;   to promoterecreational and &quot;tourist amenities;   and to reduce the risks of flooding.   Regulating reservoirs will, for a longtime to come, be the best means of meeting these needs andthe main problem is the disturbance that the creation of thesecauses to the localities concerned.   The solution to thislies in greater public acceptance of the need for them, helped by very careful selection of sites, so as to minimise lossof agricultural land and existing buildings, and satisfactoryterms of compensation to those affected.   The Secretary ofState, helped by the Welsh Committee of the Water resources board and by public inquiries, will ensure that sites are most carefully selected in this way and the Government have recently announced much improved compensation to tenant farmers who maybe affected (Paragraphs   28-37).
Gas421.    Wales has long had the advantage of large supplies of cheap coke oven gas, and more recently, of a biglocal availability from oil refineries of light distillatefeedstocks, which have been exploited by the construction of gas gride and the use of new oil-based processes of gasmanufacture.   The indications are that initial supplies of north Sea gas will be received in North Wales by 1969 and inSouth Wales by 1970.   Planned investment by the Wales gas board for the four years to 1970-71 is of the order of 28 million (Paragraphs    212-217).Electricity422.     Large new generating stations at Aberthaw (coalfired), Pembroke (oil fired) and Wylfa (nuclear) which willprovide by the early 1970*s a further 4,680 MW of capacity on top of the existing 3,645 MW, are being constructed to meetthe growth in demand for electricity in Wales as well as elsewhere in Britain.   The Area Boards will continue their programme of rural electrification, which has already resultedin the connection of 94 per cent of all farms and 97 per cent of other rural premises (Paragraphs   218-221).Environment423.      Most of Wales is beautiful but some placesbear scars from the industrial past. While many ofthe problems connected with the improvement of the towns, the rehabilitation of derelict areas, the prevention of pollution,and the safeguarding of the countryside, are being tackledwith determination, much remains to be done by local authoritiesand others to create better conditions, particularly in. themining valleys and older towns.   The policies of the Governmenton these subjects are described in paragraphs 251 to 283.The establishment of a fourth Welsh National Park in themountainous area of Mid-Wales is being studied,   A Countryside
&apos;     263Commission will be created to replace and exercise widerfunctions than the present National Parks Commission.Housing424*     Nearly one-third of the houses in Wales are over eighty years old;   at least 4-0,000 houses are nowunfit and the number is rapidly growing;   and 100,000 new houses will be needed during the next five years, to meetthe existing shortage, to replace unfit houses and those in areas covered by urban improvement schemes, and to provide forthe growth in population.   This will mean increasing therate of building from the present level of 19,000 a year to21,000 by 1971 (Paragraphs   232-250).Health. Welfarey and Social Security425.       The expenditure on health and welfare services in wales in 1967-68 is expected to be  85 million;    and expenditureon the hospital services will be nearly double the figure for1959-60.   Nine major hospital building schemes, each estimated to cost over  250,000, are expected to begin in the period upto 1969-70, and a further twenty-two schemes are planned tofollow in stages as resources allow.   Local authorities areimproving their health and welfare services.   fundamental changes have been made in social security arrangements(Paragraphs 284-297),Education and Culture426.       Between 1966 and 1972 the number of pupils inmaintained schools in Wales is expected to rise by about95,000 or some 21 per cent.   As regards Further Education,the Glamorgan College of Technology at Treforest has been selected for designation as a Polytechnic.   It is hopedthat an early decision will be reached on the proposedWelsh Agricultural College.   The allocations to the building programmes of University institutions in Wales for the period1966-70 amount to  5 million (Paragraphs   298-312).427.      Encouragement is being given to the use of the
the Welsh language in schools, and to the publication of booksin Welsh.   Legislation is being drafted to give effect tothe Government8s decisions on the main recommendations of theHughes Parry Committee on the Legal Status of the welsh language (Paragraphs  313-315).428. Government financial help through the arts council to the Welsh Arts Council has been increased from 155,000 in 1964-65 to  450,000 in 1967-68 (Paragraphs 316-322)The coverage of sound broadcasting and television services in wales is being increased (Paragraphs 323-328).Future Work429.      rji^e planning of the economic development of wales must be a continuous process, as decisions taken showresults and as circumstances hitherto unforeseen arise.   Inparticular, estimates of the future employment situationin the Principality need to be kept under constant watch andfurther means to reduce the size of the problem must urgentlybe sought.   If the Government&quot;s negotiation3for the inclusionof the United Kingdom in the European Economic Community are successful,&apos; the best means of taking full advantage of the opportunities which this will present will demand close study.The stimulation and financing of new enterprise in technologicaadvanced industries, making full use of the facilities for research which are available, particularly in the university of Wales needs continuous attention.   The best means of developing tourism in Wales without spoiling the countrysideneeds similar urgent thought and action.430.   The Government hope that, in further planning,the Welsh   Economic Council will assist them by taking a leadinpart in charting the say ahead.
431.    The White Paper is a first step.   Howeffectively it is followed up will depend not only on theGovernment, but also on the robust determination of everyonein the public, academic and industrial life of 7/ales to seize opportunities as they occur and to forge together the best possible future for the Principality,-223A-

EMPLOYEE ACTIVITY RATES 1 961 -1 966COMPARISON OF RATES FOR WAXES AND GREAT BRITAINThese are based on mid-year estimates of total employees given in Table D and of the homepopulations aged 15 years and over provided by the General Register Office.    Although givento one decimal place, they are subject to margins of error and small changes from year to yearmay not be significant.The Ministry of Labour definition of employees and the methods of compiling the employeeestimates were changed in 1965.    The rates for Wales for earlier years are broadly but notcompletely comparable with those for 1965 and 1966.
