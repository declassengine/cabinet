CONFIDENTIAL280IcUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67186Z6thJiaxt.jL967,COPY NO.CABINETD E CAS U A LISA T ION OF THE DOCKS:LONDON DOCKs&quot;PISPUTEMemorandum by the Minister of labour I seek my colleagues agreement to an early announcement ofthe date by which we hope a decasualised system of working in the docks,on the lines recommended in the 1965 Devlin Report (Cmnd. 2734), canbe introduced.2.     With my colleagues agreement (CC(66) 48th Conclusions.Minute 4) I announced last October that the Government endorsed inprinciple the pay changes recommended in the 1966 Devlin Report(Cmnd. 3104) to accompany decasualisation, but that implementationmust in the Governments view be conditional upon specific agreement for the elimination of restrictive working practices, and subject toincomes policy.3.    Since then the Local Modernisation Committees, representativeof employers and unions in each port, have been negotiating on the elimination of restrictive practices to accompany decasualisation;Lord Brown and the other independent members of the NationalModernisation Committee have undertaken to report to me on 1st july the progress made by that date.    Agreement has already been reached by 32 of the 48 Local Committees and pressure is being brought to bearby the Transport and General Workers Union on its local officials tosettle quickly in most of the remainder.4.    The time which the negotiations, and the associated licensingarrangements laid down in the Docks and Harbours Act, 1966, havebeen taking reflects in part difficulties within the industry itself inresolving the problems inherent in preparing for the major changesinvolved in decasualisation.    But in some ports and among somegroups of workers impatience has been growing.    This is not surprisingsince it is nearly two years since the original Devlin Report was published.5.    The latest manifestation of impatience is a threat by the tallyclerks in the Port of London to strike from Monday, 5th June unless and until an early date is announced for the introduction of decasualisa-tlon.     In London negotiations have been conducted in four separates*-committees, of which one is concerned with tally clerks.     Thetally clerks sub-committee reached agreement last February.    Theagreement entirely meets the conditions set out in the 1966 DevlinReport and provides in addition a basis for the flexibility of workingween tallying and other dock clerical duties which is necessary for the confidential
COl SFSDENTIAL281jjjost efficient introduction of modern car go-handling methods.     It alsomakes a desirable adjustment to the method of payment for overtimewith a compensating increase in the basic rate.     The employers, theunions and the men themselves are anxious for the agreement to be implemented as soon as possible but this cannot be done in advance ofgeneral decasualisation.6     A strike by tally clerks would effectively immobilise the encloseddocks including Tilbviry.     Though unlikely to get official backing from either of the two unions concerned - the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union and the National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers - the strikeis expected to receive widespread unofficial support, including thepossibility of sympathetic action by London dockers generally,, and theunion leaders        \ittle hope of preventing it in the absence of a more definite Government commitment to a date for the introduction ofdecasualisation than has so far been given,7,    A necessary preliminary to decasualisation is the making, one month before it is due to come into operation, of the Dock Workers(Regulation of Employment) (Amendment) Order, 1967 which is nowready for my signature and is subject only to the negative resolution procedure.     This Order has to be brought in on the same date for allthe ports concerned.     Licensing of port employers under the Docks and harbours Act, 1966 (which is the responsibility of the Minister ofTransport) is proceeding port by port, but decasualisation need notawait its completion in all ports,8,     In the light of progress made so far, I am reasonably confident that the report I shall be seeing on 1st July will provide a satisfactory basis upon which to proceed.     It would, however, obviously be wrong for the Government to commit itself now, without qualification, to a date for the introduction of the new Scheme.     On the other hand I amciear that the time has come to make it   plain that we can now see adefinite date for its introduction, provided the progress already made ismaintained.    In my view it is reasonable now to look forward to thepossibility that decasualisation can be made effective on 15th September.This will allow time for completion of the necessary preliminaries.This is on the assumption that the July report will, as I expect, showthat sufficient progress has been achieved.9.    I shall, of course, consult my colleagues again when I havereceived the July report.    Meanwhile, I seek my colleagues approval for making, in the next few days, a public statement which would -(1)     recall the conditions on which the Government indicatedits acceptance in principle of the Devlin PayRecommendations in October, 1966;(2)     record that Lord Brown, the Chairman of the NationalDocks Modernisation Committee has reported to methat the Industry has made a great deal of progressin port by port negotiations for the elimination of restrictive practices;(3)     give an assurance that, provided the July report confirmsthat the progress made meets the Governmentrs conditions,I will take the necessary steps to bring the new dock labour scheme into operation not later than 15th September, andthat from that date the way will be open for the industry to implement the Devlin pay settlement.R. J. G.Miuustry of Labour, S. W. 1.26th May, 1967
