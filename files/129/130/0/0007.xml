IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0(67187?Qth i.-.;?.v, 1967COPY NO.CABINETFAR EAST DEFENCE policy note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for considerationby the Cabinet on Tuesday, 30th May, the attached copy of a letter dated26th May, 1967, from the Prime Minister of Singapore.     This is relevant to the consideration of the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C(67) 81).BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.W.1.29th May, 1967
But I would urge that unless there are compulsive pressures onBritain to make a public commitment now, then such a commitment shouldbe deferred for reassessments from time to time of the consequences ofsuch a course of action.    For, between now and 1970-71, all can get a closer look and probably a better picture of the possible repercussions of such a public commitment.I can only assume that you must have intended that Ministers ingovernment in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and singapore should think about and discuss their future courses of actionin terms of the &quot;planning assumptions&quot; of your Defence Ministry.    Andfurther that you were prepared to risk, or may have intended, that these governments would talk, in confidence, to their advisers and opinion-formulators.    For this spread has already taken place.    If there is notto be a rot in confidence, there must be either swift adjustments and alternative security arrangements or an announcement of the &quot;residualcapacity&quot; to which Denis Healey alluded.S EC RE?It is a month since Denis Healey told me of the decision to reduceBritish forces in the Singapore/Malaysia area to half its present strengthby 1970-71 and of the proposal thereafter to scale down so that all british force? will be off the mainland of Asia by the mid-&apos;70s.    He has no doubttold you of the immediate reactions of my colleagues and me.    Althoughthe economic consequences of withdrawing British troops from Singaporewill be painful, what we feared most was the chain reaction which may beset off once it was made known that British forces will be off the mainlandby 1975.A full month is time enough for careful reflection and an objectiveappraisal of what this will mean to us.    I can only guess at the advantages that the British Government will derive from a public commitment to totalwithdrawal by 1975.    But I know that gloom will descend on all those who,like us in Singapore, had hoped for a few more years of relative stabilityto strengthen the fragile basis of independence established only recently.Correspondingly there will be jubilation in Peking, Hanoi, among theVietcong in South Vietnam, in the Communist Party of Malaya and inCommunist bands elsewhere in South East Asia, corroding the fabricof their various societies.     There will also be some who are notCommunists, like the army generals in Jakarta, who v/ill be thrilledat the prospect of a bigger role for thexnselves.    Whichever way welook at the problem, we come to the conclusion that whether or notthere will bo British forces on the mainland of Asia in the rnid-&apos;70s,is completely secondary to the thinking, planning and initiatives whichwill be taken by Communists and others once they believe that there willbe no British forces in the raid-&quot;70s,     The time that would otherwise have been available between now and 1975, eight long years, will be considerably shrunk by activities launched in anticipation when sucha decision is announced.No-one has the right to tell Britain and the British Governmentwhat she must or must not do for the welfare of others.    Appeals tosentiment, the grandeur of Britain&apos;s past, the wisdom, expertise and experience, which she can bring to the problems of the region, willall be meticulously weighed against other economic and political factorswhen you and your Cabinet consider the alternatives open to Britain inthe world today for a role in the world tomorrow&apos;, in so far as that couldbe discerned.
If it is in Britain&apos;s interests to make public now what Britain intends to do in 197 5, perhaps you will not be unmindful of the price that will haveto be paid by all who live in South and South East Asia and others outsidewho have made a commitment to prevent the area going chaotic and communist.I would not like to leave the impression that my preoccupationwith the longer-term problems means that the economic disruption canbe shrugged off.     &quot;Significant aid&quot;, a phrase almost as ominous as&quot;planning assumptions&quot;, has been repeatedly used.     The dislocationon the employment pattern will be grievous.     This is a matter whichwill require a searching study of ways to buffer the shock of withdrawalof British spending and the creation of new means of employment for over 50,000 civilian employees now servicing the Services and their families here.     This number of bread-winners constitute more than10 per cent of our total work force.However, no-one has the right to expect Britain to bear the costof the security of the region.     But our long association with the British,who created a community which was not here in 1819 when the firstEnglishman landed to found a settlement in Singapore, emboldens meto believe that the British Government and people would wish us well,3ritainrs withdrawal could be done in a way that would give us themaximum chance to continue as a viable community.    For it is not too ambitious to want to build on the achievements of what good british administration and the enterprise and industry of Chinese, Indians andother migrants have together built.***
