Qi&amp;lL23 COPY NO.2nd June^ 19 67CABINETAN INTERIM INCREASE IN FAMILY allowances in 1967/68Memorandum by the Minister of Social security the Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio and myself (C(67) 92) sets out the steps we need to take now in order tobe in a position to increase family allowances at the same time asthe other social security benefits in the autumn.2.      I should like to make quite clear to my colleagues my own view that to refuse even a modest interim measure of relief to large families before the start of another winter would put us in a completely indefensible position.     It is now some eighteen monthssince the problem of family poverty was first brought prominentlyto public notice by the formation of the Child Poverty Action Group,and in the intervening period we have given repeated assurances thatwe were urgently considering how these families could best be helpd.Our own Survey has confirmed the existence of a large number of families with incomes below the Supplementary Benefit level, andthe publication of the full results of the Survey will certainlysharpen the demand for some immediate action.    Our position willbe all the more difficult because we shall be,announcing increases for virtually all other social security beneficiaries, which will further highlight the contrast between the lowest wage-earners andthese on benefit, and increase the number of those whoseSupplementary Benefit is reduced by the &quot;wage-atop&quot;.     I believe this would be an indefensible position.3.      I therefore urge my colleagues to agree to take a power inthe forthcoming National Insurance Bill which will enable us to makea concurrent increase in family allowances on an interim basis,while leaving the amount and scope of the increase to be decided in the light of the public expenditure review.M. H.Ministry of Social Security, W. C. 2.2nd June, 1967DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)
