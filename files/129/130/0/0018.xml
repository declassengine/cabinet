DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C(67) 98 (Revise) COPY NO.23rd June, 1967CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  CIVIL REVIEW;SOCIAL SECURITYNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the civil review on social security carried out by officialscirculated as C(67) 98 sets out in detail the various choices open to us,which are summarised in the relevant section of the official report&quot;Public Expenditure: Areas of Choice&quot; circulated as C(67) 102.    Thiswas prepared on the assumption that there would be an uprating of 9s.on the standard rate of national insurance for a single person at the endof October, 1967, in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 4th May,1967 (CC(67) 28th Conclusions, Minute 4).    Ministers subsequentlydecided on 15th June, 1967 (CC(67) 39th Conclusions, Minute 4) that the uprating should be 10s.    The civil expenditure review has therefore been amended, and the revised copy is attached.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.22nd June, 1967
Review of Civil Expenditure to 1971-72Social Security BenefitsPART I - introduction the 1966 Public Expenditure Survey1.     Public expenditure survey forecasts for social security benefits makeallowance for periodic increases of benefit rates in line with the forecastmovement in real earnings.   The further increase which would be required totake account of future price movements is not shown.2.     The amount allocated to social security benefits in the National plan was in practice arrived at by estimating the cost of increasing benefits(but not family allowances) from 1965-66 in line with the assumed rise in real earnings per head, together with an allowance of rather more than 20 million for the introduction of earnings-related unemployment benefit and a further  60 million for other reforms.   Changes since then, inparticular the widening of the scope of the earnings-related short-term benefits and the introduction of the supplementary benefits scheme, meant that in the 1966 Survey report there was no room in the basic programme forfurther improvements.   The figures for the basic programme in that reportaccordingly represented the cost of continuing the present benefits andkeeping the main rates in line with earnings, except for the uprating in1967, which was fixed at 1s. less (in terms of the single rate of retirement pension) than the earnings criterion would have produced in order to recouppart of the cost of the supplementary benefits scheme.   The figure in the 1966report for expenditure in 1970-71 was  3,201 million which, when revalued at1967 prices, becomes  3*303 million.Background:   Changed Assumptions in the present Review3.    One of the main reasons for the review was that &quot;present public expenditure policies were based on the expectation that we should achieve a higher rate of economic growth than now seems likely&quot; (P.E.(67)2,paragraph 6) *   One effect of slower growth is that real earnings rise moreslowly.   Thus the estimates of future expenditure on social security benefits,1
CONFIDENTIAL $22which are calculated by reference to the rise in real earnings, areautomatically reduced by the lower assumption about growth.   In other words,raising benefit rates in line with earnings means that beneficiaries underthe social security system, like the wage-earner, will get a smallerimprovement in their standard of living than was expected.   To this extentexpenditure on these benefits, unlike other public expenditure programmes,is self-adjusting to the rate of growth without any change of policy.At the same time, the level of unemployment is expected to be higher than was assumed last year, and expenditure on social security benefits ispeculiarly sensitive to the level of unemployments4.     In the present Survey the basic programme for social security benefitstakes acoount of the Cabinet decision that benefits should be raised at theend of October 1967 by 10s. Od. in noney terms, on the single rate of retirement pension.   Thereafter the calculation of the basic programmeallows for the main benefit rates to rise in line with real earnings.   Onthe latest assumptions about the movement of earnings, an increase of 10s.in the pension rate at the end of October 1967 is 1s. 5d. below what the risein earnings would justify instead of the 1s. Od. assumed in last year&apos;a report.This will result in savings of  13 million in 1970-71.   Moreover, because real earnings will have risen more slowly than was assumed last year, an up-rating in line with earnings (less 1s.) would itself have been a smallerimprovement in benefits than was implicit in last year&apos;s report, and this represents a further reduction in estimated expenditure in 1970-71 of some 40 million a year.   The slower growth now forecast for the period Ootober 1967to April 1970 represents a reduction in the rate of improvement of benefits inabsolute terms (though not relative to the standard of living of the rest ofthe community) and a further reduction in estimated expenditure of  100 millions5,     On the other hand, the estimates allow for a higher number ofbeneficiaries, costing an extra  60 million in 1970-71, of which  52 million is due to the higher number of unemployed.   This is in line with the figuresused for the 1967 PKSC returns, which were based on the January forecast of future unemployment levels (see Table 1 below).   Any variation in thesefigures, e,g, as a result of the introduction of a regional employment premium, would affect the estimates of cost,   A reduction of 50,000 in the2
3CONFIDENTIALannual average of unemployed would reduce social security expenditure byabout  20 million a year.6.     In previous public expenditure surveys the annual figures have been based on the assumption that benefit rates are raised on 1st April eachyear, though in practice up-ratings of contributory benefits have only takenplace in recent years at intervals of between two and three years,,A decision has now been reached that the 1967 up-rating will take place inOctober, some 2^ years after the last increase.   In view of this background,a more realistic assumption has been made this year, viz., that for the timebeing up-ratings will take place at intervals of about two years.   It istherefore assumed in the present survey that after the up-rating ofOctober 1967 the next up-rating will take place on 1st October, 1969.   Ascompared with the 1966 Survey figures, this assumption produces a further reduction in expenditure in each year from 1968-69 onwards, the reductionfor 1970-71 being  37 million.7.    The following tables set out the different assumptions made for the1966 and 1967 Surveys up to 1970-71, and show the effect of this on theestimate for 1970-71 at 1967 prices, together with a summary of the positionin the preceding years..

New Policies under consideration8.    Quite apart from any decision which might be taken in the context of thecivil review, there are two major changes under consideration by Ministers.The first is family endowment:   Ministers have agreed to resume their consideration of the form of an increase in family endowment in the light ofthis review of public expenditure;   some room must, therefore, be left for family endowment but it is not possible at present to quantify it.     Thesecond is the earnings-related pension scheme:   it now seems unlikely thatthis could be in operation before April 1972, so that it would not affect theestimate for 1970-71;   but this prospective major new commitment must be borne in mind in reaching decisions on other changes in the programme for social security up to 1970.PART n - THE -7&amp;g AND *5?g EXERCISEWhat a iWo saving would involve9.   A saving of 7^ per cent on the revalued 1966 Survey figure of 3,303 million in 1970-71 would be about  248 million.   Against this, the combination of (a) the slower rise in benefit rates resulting from theslower growth now expected, and from the Cabinet decision about the 1967uprating (b) the higher unemployment rate and (c) the assumption that up-ratingswould take place at two-year intervals for the time being would together givea reduction in expenditure of about  124 million compared with last year&apos;srevalued total.10. However, officials were asked to consider savings against what would berequired for &quot;continuance of the policies for which provision was included inthe 1966 basic programmes&quot; (P.E.(67)3. paragraph 7)*   This has been taken to mean that the saving of 7? per cent should be measured against the revisedcost of the programme after taking account of changes due to the revisedassumptions about earnings, unemployment, and the intervals between up-ratings.These factors account for a reduction in the revalued 1966 figures of about 110 million, leaving  3,192 million.   Thus the saving would need to beabout  240 million   in 1970-71.    Of this  13 million has already been achieved by holding back the 1967 uprating from 10s. 5d. to 10s. 0d., and this has been allowed for in Tables 1 and 3.11.   The basic programme in the 1966 Survey contained no margin beyond whatwas needed to continue the present range of benefits and increase the mainrates in line with earnings (apart from the 1s. cut in 1967 - see para.2),6
All the expenditure is on benefit apart from the marginal amounts necessarilyspent on administration and uhe cost of very minor welfare services.   There-fore the only possible ways of securing substantial savings are by postponingor reducing the amount of benefit increases and cutting out selected benefitsor restricting the circumstances in which they are paid.Postponement of up-ratings12.   A lengthening of the interval between up-ratings to more than the assumedtwo years would save money in certain years, to the extent that expenditure onimproved rates was postponed, but it would not necessarily save money in otheryears.   This is on the assumption that when benefits were up-rated they wouldbe increased in line with the latest rise in real earnings.   The followingtable shows the further savings (-) or extra cost (*) in different yearsresulting from postponement of the up-rating beyond October 1969 (assuming acorresponding postponement of the up-rating otherwise due in October 1971).s-  millionPostponement to:- 1969-70 1970-71 1971-721st April 1970 - 69 * 35 - 401st October 1970 - 69 - 35 Nil13.    Postponement to April 1970 would mean going through three winters without an up-rating for the first time since 1961 and legislation in the winter whenpressure for immediate improvement would be strongest.   Postponement to october 1970 would mean a three-year interval.Seducing the amount of the 1969 uprating14* Granted an up-rating in October 1969, it would be possible to reduce expenditure by again raising benefits by a smaller amount than the rise in earnings would justify.   The following paragraphs consider three ways of doing7CONFIDENTIAL
this:   by holding back all benefits to the same degree, or by holding baokcontributory benefits only, or by holding back non-contributory benefits only.In each case we set out the effect of uprating these benefits instead (a) in line with prices (which would deny those concerned any improvement in theirstandard of living);   (b) in line with personal consumption per head of thepopulation (estimated to increase by 2.5^ a year over the relevant period ifthe growth rate is, as in this exercise assumed to be 3.CfQ;   and (c) in line with earnings less an arbitrary amount of 3s.     It would of course be possibleto hold back contributory benefits in one of these ways and non-contributory benefits in another:   savings would then roughly equal the sum of the savings from each course,(a)   Holding back all benefits15.   The maximum saving would be achieved by uprating all benefits to take account only of the movement of prices from October, 1967.    This would save 140 million in 1970/71 compared with an uprating in line with real earnings,which is rather more than half of the total saving called for in this exercise.To secure the full saving in this way would mean increasing benefits by 4.6% lessthan the percentage rise in prices.     If for example prices increased by 6f:between October, 19^7 and October, 1969, an uprating in line with prices(saving   140 million)would be 5s. 6d.;   but if the balance of the saving( 87 million) had to be found by giving less than a prices increase, the uprating would be only 2b. Od.16.   The effect of the three alternative ways of holding back all benefitsyear by year (assuming a 1971 uprating in line with the movement in real earnings from October 19^9) would be:-  millionUprating in line with:	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72Prices	- 69	-140	-145Consumption	- 10	- 23	- 24Earnings less 3s.	- 41	-83	- 85(b)   Holding back contributory benefits17. It would be possible to concentrate on improving the real value of means-tested benefits in order to help the poorest, whilst increasing contributory8

Such a step at the 1969 uprating need not be represented as a permanentshift of policy.     The relative worsening of the level of contributory benefitscould either be rectified at the next uprating if Ministers then felt able toincrease contributory benefits more than non-contributory ones;   or it couldbe maintained as a permanent gap in relation to means-tested benefits;   or itcould be repeated at future upratings.     If concentration on means-testedbenefits in this way were adopted as a long-term policy, it could producelarger savings a few years ahead.     It is, however, doubtful whether such acourse would produce substantial savings in the long run because it would beless worth while to build up occupational pensions and other forms of savings,and this could lead to increased reliance on supplementary benefits.     TheMinistry of Social Security further consider that holding back contributory benefits in 1969, unless the amount withheld were restored in 1971, would be inconsistent with the aim of developing an earnings-related pension schemeafter 1970;   it would certainly make it much more difficult to devise a schemewhich had any hope of raising the pensions of most people above the means-tested level (see paragraph 27).(c)   Holding back non-contributory benefits19.   At the other extreme would lie the possibility of holding back theincrease in supplementary benefits in 1969, whilst raising contributory benefits and war pensions in line with earnings.     This would achieve thefollowing savings (assuming the gap was maintained but not increased in 1971):9benefits by some smaller amount.     If in October 1969 non-contributory benefitswere uprated in line with real earnings but contributory benefits and warpensions were held back, the following savings would be achieved (assuming the gap was maintained but not increased in 1971):-  millionContributory benefitsuprated in line with:
		  million	Means-tested benefits uprated in line with:	1?6?-70	1970-71	1971-72Prices	- 22	- 44	- 47Consumption	-   4	-   8	-  9Earnings less 3s.	- 13	- 27	- 2820.   Again, such a step in 1969 need not be represented as a permanent shift of policy.     As a long-term policy, concentration on contributory benefitscould be justified on the grounds that (a) means-tested benefits are whollyprovided by the State and need not necessarily move in line with contributory benefits, and/or (b) means-tested benefit had already reached a level whichensured a tolerable income for living expenses to those whose other resources were insufficient, and that, having achieved this objective, further realimprovements should be concentrated on the benefits to which the individualhad contributed.     This would however, mean that on the occasion of the up-rating the 2 million or so retirement pensioners with supplementary pensions would receive a smaller increase in their total income than retirementrpensioners who were somewhat better off.     The poorest would thus be receivingleast, but on the other hand the others would have allegedly paid for theirhigher benefit.     Such a step in 1969, if not rectified in 1971, could helpin raising more pensioners above the means-tested level before the introductionof the earnings-related scheme (see paragraph 27).Gutting out benefits or restricting the conditions of award21.   It has been assumed that there can be no question of removing from anygroup of people an existing entitlement to such main benefits as retirement pension, widow&apos;s benefit, unemployment and sickness benefit, war pensions andindustrial disablement benefit.     Nor, presumably, would Ministers wish tomodify the recently-introduced supplementary benefits scheme.     Savings in family allowances have not been considered since the problem of family endowment is before Ministers.     If savings had to be found by limiting the coverage of benefits, they would therefore have to be sought on the fringesof the main benefits or among the minor benefits in the insurance schemes.     Thefollowing are illustrations of what would need to be done to secure substantial savings in this way:-10CONFIDENTIAL
  millionMeans-tested benefitsuprated in line with:Prices1969-70- 221970-71- 441971-72- 47Consumption- 4-   8-  9Earnings less 3s.- 13- 27- 2820.   Again, such a step in 1969 need not be represented as a permanent shift of policy.     As a long-term policy, concentration on contributory benefitscould be justified on the grounds that (a) means-tested benefits are whollyprovided by the State and need not necessarily move in line with contributoryensured a tolerable income for living expenses to those whose other resources were insufficient, and that, having achieved this objective, further realimprovements should be concentrated on the benefits to which the individualhad contributed.     This would however, mean that on the occasion of the up-rating the 2 million or so retirement pensioners with supplementary pensions would receive a smaller increase in their total income than retirement pensioners who were somewhat better off.     The poorest would thus be receivingleast, but on the other hand the others would have allegedly paid for theirhigher benefit.     Such a step in 1969, if not rectified in 1971, could helpin raising more pensioners above the means-tested level before the introductionof the earnings-related scheme (see paragraph 27).Cutting out benefits or restricting the conditions of award21.   It has been assumed that there can be no question of removing from anygroup of people an existing entitlement to such main benefits as retirement pension, widow*s benefit, unemployment and sickness benefit, war pensions andindustrial disablement benefit.    Nor, presumably, would Ministers wish tomodify the recently-introduced supplementary benefits scheme.     Savings in family allowances have not been considered since the problem of family endowment is before Ministers.    If savings had to be found by limiting the coverage of benefits, they would therefore have to be sought on the fringesof the main benefits or among the minor benefits in the insurance schemes.     Thefollowing are illustrations of what would need to be done to secure substantial savings in this way:-benefits, and/or (b) means-tested benefit had already reached a level which10CONFIDENTIAL
Death Grant.     This is a benefit designed to help with funeralexpenses.     The costs incurred in funerals are usually much more thanthe amount of the grant.     The grant has only been increased once -from  20 to  25 in 1958 - but in the context of the 1967 uprating theMinistry of Social Security have proposed an increase to  30.Grants are not paid for people over pension age in 1948, and half-rate grants are paid for people within ten years of pension age atthat time.     To cut out the grants completely would save  10 million in 1970 - 71.     But contributions have been paid for this benefit for nearly twenty years and there would be great pressure for at least some measure of preservation of existing rights, which if concededwould greatly reduce the saving for some years ahead.Maternity benefit.     A maternity allowance is paid at the same rate assickness benefit, during a period of 18 weeks spanning the birth, to women who have been working and paying contributions.     It might bepossible, particularly now that earnings-related sickness benefitcan be paid with maternity allowance, to get rid of the maternityallowance as a separate benefit and to rely solely on sickness benefit,Incapacity could be deemed for six weeks before the birth, for theweek of the birth and for the four weeks after the birth, but outsidethat period benefit might be paid only on proof of incapacity.     Thiswould reduce the period for which benefit was automatically paid from18-11 weeks.     The saving might be of the order of  4 million a year.There is also a grant paid for each birth where the mother or her husband is insured.     The present amount is  22.     To stoppaying this grant would save about  26 million in 1 970-7i but,if traditional concessions had to be made, the saving would be greatly reduced.     If it were retained but not uprated in line with earnings in 1969, there would be a saving of the. orderof  1 million or so in 1970-71 and more after subsequent up-ratings.Waiting days.     Unemployment and sickness benefit are not paid forthe first three days of a spell off work unless the spell lasts for12 days, in which case payment for the waiting days is made in arrears11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL Q 3The waiting period for earnings-related supplements to unemployment and sickness benefits is 12 days and no payment is made for thosedays.     It might be possible, after a reasonable period of notice,to bring these two waiting periods together and have six absolutedays (i.e. with no payment for them however long unemployment orsickness lasts) for both flat-rate and earnings-related benefits.It could be argued that in these days many people are paid sick payby their employers at least for short periods of sickness and this practice is growing, with encouragement from the Government.     Manyunemployed receive payments of one kind or another on cessation ofwork which should see them through a waiting period of a week.     Thechange would simplify administration.     On the other hand, such aproposal to worsen the provision for the early days of unemployment and sickness in this way would be strongly resisted by the T.U.C. andby workers generally, as liable to cause undue hardship.     Therewould usually be a fortnight between the last payment of wages andthe first payment of benefit.     For those with no sick pay orredundancy payments and without refund of tax (often the largerfamilies) the only recourse would be supplementary benefit.     If,nevertheless, the arrangement for six absolute waiting days were inforoe throughout 1970-71 and were to be applied also to injurybenefit, the net savings in that year would be of the order of 25 million.     If the present numbers of waiting days were retainedbut the 3 waiting days for flat-rate benefit made absolute, the netsavings would be about  15 million.Injury benefit.     This is paid for incapacity for work resultingfrom industrial accident or disease for a period up to six months.After that disablement pension and various supplementary allowancescan be paid (on top of sickness benefit if the man is still offwork).     Injury benefit includes an element of compensation andis, therefore, at a higher rate than sickness benefit - by 2   15s. at the present time.     The earnings-related supplements12CONFIDENTIAL
13to sickness benefit can also be paid during the injury benefitperiod.     It would be technically feasible to cut out injurybenefit and leave sickness benefit to do the work but this wouldmean that most people suffering industrial accidents would receiveno compensation for their injuries in return for their contributions.There might also be pressure to allow disablement pensions to bedrawn sooner if the buffer of injury benefit were withdrawn.This would have to be resisted, because any major concession onthese lines would cost more than the original savings.     If,nevertheless, injury benefit were abolished without any change inthe disablement benefit rules, the savings in 1970-71 would beabout  13 million.Summary of possible savings22.   The savings which would result from adopting these possible coursesare summarised below.     They add up at the maximum to 7.2% apart  from the reductions in expenditure resulting from changed assumptions given inTable 3.     13 million of these savings (0.4$) has already been achieved bythe Cabinet decision about the 1967 uprating.

What could be done with a 5 per cent increase in expenditure23o-  A 5 per cent increase in expenditure calculated on the same basis asthe 7^ per cent saving (see paragraph 10) would be about  160 million in1970-71.Family Endowment24.   The first claim for additional expenditure will presumably be a schemeof family endowment, but until Ministers have reached a decision on this itis not possible to put a figure on it.Contingency allowance25.   The basic programme for social security benefits in 1966 contained no allowance (on top of the cost of increasing benefits in line with real earnings) for the small running adjustments which need to be made from timeto time in the national insurance, war pensions and other schemes.   Recentexamples are the raising of the earnings limits for retirement pensions,the reciprocal agreements with the Republic of Ireland and the exceptionallysevere disablement allowance for war and industrial disablement pensionersfollowing the McCorquodale Committee Report.   Whatever decisions are takenabout the general level of provision, it would be more realistic to have a specific sum set aside for these contingencies.   A sum of  15 million in1970-71 would enable the M.S.S. to take on cumulative commitments at about 4 million a year over the next four years.Benefit rates26.   The cost of a new earnings-related pension scheme has been left out of account (see paragraph 8).   The philosophy of the scheme proposed by theM.S.S. and now under consideration by Ministers is to build up the pensions of people reaching pension age after the new scheme starts until, after thescheme has matured, new pensions would be awarded which gave a sufficientproportion of previous average earnings for most people to be free from theneed to apply for means-tested supplementation, whilst giving, to thehigher-paid, pensions more nearly related to their pre-retirement earnings.The new scheme would, however, do nothing for the existing generation of pensioners.15
27.  A good deal of the cost of the proposed scheme would arise fromlifting the general level of pensions above that of the means-testedbenefit.   This would be a reflection of the fact that the present pension is low in relation to average earnings and even to the level of means-testedsupplementary benefits.   Clearly the building-up of new pensions under the earnings-related scheme would be mors acceptable if some improvement couldbe made in the meanwhile to the existing pensions, so that there would beless disparity between them and those payable under the new scheme.   the argument for doing this in 1969 is that it would coincide more nearly with legislation for the new scheme, when the question might become a live one;but it could be done in 1971.28.   One of the difficulties here is that this would mean holding back thelevel of supplementary benefits relative to retirement pensions, which wouldbe open to the criticism that the Government were giving smaller increases to those most in need (cf. para. 20).   If, however, Ministers felt able to withstand this charge, it would be possible, for example, to raisesupplementary benefits sufficiently in 1969 to make good the Is. 5d. cut in 1967,whilst increasing the rate of retirement pension by, say, an extra 5s.Od. on top of this (i.e. by 6s. 5d. in all more than the increase in earnings would require)Allowing for the effect of this on other national insurance benefits, warpensions, etc., the extra cost of this in 1970-71 might be about  133 million.The cost would subsequently increase at first with the growth of the pensionerpopulation but decrease eventually as the new scheme matured^Improvement in pension increments29.  At present retirement pension increments are 1s. a week for every 12  extracontributions after retirement age has been reached.    But it is proposed inthe 1967 uprating to improve them to Is. a week for every nine contributions paid thereafter.    However this will still not give a full return for pensionforegone and extra contributions paid.     There is thus a prime facie oase forfurther improvement.   Some improvements might encourage older people to stayon in work beyond minimum pension age;   an increase in increments mightbe more effeotive than a small all-round increase in pensions in getting a substantial number of people above the level of supplementary benefits.It could alao pave the way to a more flexible system of retirementages if the government were to decide that this was a desirable16CONFIDENTIAL
17development in a new scheme.    On the other hand this would be an expensive form of incentive because it would have to be paid to those whowould have stayed on anyway..   If the change were made in the near future, thenet additional cost in 1970-71 as compared with the proposed arrangements would be approximately  3 million (about  5 million compared with the present arrangements) rising to about  30 million by the end of the century,, without allowing for the effect on retirement practice, which it is impossible to assess.Widow&apos;s benefit30*   Some easement of the conditions for widow&apos;s benefit has been strongly pressed.   At present a woman under age 50 who has no qualifying childrencannot get a permanent widow&apos;s pension.   If the qualifying age were reducedto age 35 the cost in 1970-71 would be of the order of  20 million,   A shortsliding scale might be introduced for ages immediately above age 35 to avoidan abrupt transition;   this would reduce the cost slightly.   It is thoughtthat a qualifying age of 35 could be held without any difficulty since thereis no pressure for a permanent pension for the young childless widow   (in fact,the additional cost of having no qualifying age at all would be no more than 1 million).   The only repercussions would be on the industrial injuriesscheme and the war pensions scheme which have slightly different rules;   thecost of assimilating these would be minimal.The chronic sick319   The problem of the chronic sick is attracting increasing attention, andit may well be desirable to do something more for them by 1970*   one possibility which has been examined is the introduction of some kind ofconstant attendance allowance or helplessness allowance for the most seriouslydisabled.   If an allowance of  3 a week were provided but the qualifyingconditions could be kept very tightly drawn, the cost would probably notexceed  10 million a year.Summary of suggestions for additional expenditure32.   The cost of the alternative suggestions for additional expenditure putforward in paragraphs 24 to 31 can be summarised as follows (not in orderof priority) :-
Item Coat in % of1970-71        3,192 m.  million.    Family endowment2*    Realistic allowance for contingencies 15 0.53.    Increasing N.I. benefits in1969 by 6s. 5d. more thanplanned and supplementary benefits by Is. 5d. 133 4.24.    Lowering qualifying age for widow&apos;s benefit 20 0.65.    Improvements in pensionincrements 3 * 0.16.    Constant attendance allowance of  3 for chronic sick(minimum scheme) 10 0.3* Rising to about  30 m. eventually.The path to 1970-7133.   Savings or extra expenditure from changes in 1969 uprating (paragraph 22item 2) would, on the assumption in this report, take effeot from October, 1969*and their effeot would therefore be felt for 6 months in 1969-70 and fully in1970-71 and 1971-72.   Other measures to achieve savings (paragraph 22 items 3-7)could only be brought into operation after a reasonable period of notice, andeven if legislation were introduced soon it is unlikely that there would be mucheffeot before 1970-71.   Expenditure in 1968-69 is effectively governed by the size of the 1967 uprating, on which a Cabinet decision has already been taken,yielding savings of  13 million in 1970-71.   Other measures to achieveincreases (paragraph 32 items 4-6) could take effeot as soon as legislation could be prepared and passed.18
