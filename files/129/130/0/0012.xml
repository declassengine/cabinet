CONFIDENTIAL &quot;       338DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)1* MQLtVLl?:- COPY NO.     l^-k2nd June, 1967CABINET^ONTERJM^INCREASE IN FAMILY allowances in 1967/68Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio and theMinister of Social SecurityAt their meeting on 14th March (CC(67) 12th Conclusions,Minute 1) the Cabinet decided that there should be no interim increase of family allowances in advance of a final decision on theform of a &quot;give-and-take&quot; scheme, and that this decision in turnshould await completion of the general review of public expenditure.We are now pledged to announce this summer our proposals fordealing with family poverty, but it is clear that the time has passedwhen we could put such a scheme into operation before April, 1968.2.      With the publication later this month both of the Bill providingfor increased social security benefits and of the Report of theMinistry of Social Secur ity rs Family Circumstances Enquiry, weshall again come under pressure to give some immediate relief topoor families, whose situation the Government have for so long beenreviewing as a matter of urgency.   The only practicable way of doing this would be by increasing family allowances for the larger families.Any such increase could be subsumed in the long-term improvementto be introduce d next April.3.      We have discussed the position with the Lord President and theChief Whip.     If there is to be such an increase, we are convinced that,for practical as well as presentational reasons, it should be made simultaneously with the proposed increase in national insurance andother benefits at the end of October.    To achieve this it is necessaryfor legislative provision to be made not later than mid-August.    Inour view the best, if not the only, way of putting ourselves in aposition to do this, while reserving decisions on the amount and scopeof the increase until we have taken firm decisions on family endow-ment in the light of the public expenditure review, would be to takethe necessary power in the Bill providing for national insuranceincreases.4.     If we do not do this the only possible alternative would be tointroduce a separate Bill hard on the heels of the National insurance bill, which would look exceedingly inept;  in any case it must be doubtful whether we could get such a Bill through all its stagesbetween the time when we take a final decision on family endowmentand the summer Adjournment.     If we cannot get the Bill by then therewill of course be no propsect of putting the increases into payment inCO N FIDE NTS AL
October, and indeed very little chance of starting them until december, by which time we shall be well into the winter and less than four months away from the proposed starting date of our long-term scheme.5.     We therefore invite our colleagues to consider whether a clause should be included in the Bill enabling family allowances(if necessary, for some only of the children in a family - e. g. thethird or foiirth onwards) to be increased by Order and national insurance dependency benefits for children correspondingly reduced.     The power would be transitory and would provide forany such Order to cease to have effect on 5th April, 1968.6.      The Bill must clearly be introduced, at the very latest, bythe end of June in order to pass all its stages before Parliamentrises.P. C. G. W.MCH.70, Whitehall, S. W. 1.2nd June, 1967-2-
